<p>This is just a story of my day. It was an incredibly boring day. Why do I write about it? I analyzed why it was so dull and uncovered a great insight. What is the most critical factor in software engineering productivity? I think it is the time it takes to deploy your app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beautiful start of the day</h2>

<p>I woke up at around 10 am. Not too bad, given that I’ve stayed late the night before – I have been trying to solve an engineering problem at work. The problem was adding a new feature to the gigantic project with a not so scalable architecture. The project was born out of the hackathon, so it’s nobody’s fault… Anyway, the engineering problem. It wasn’t even that hard because as soon as I woke up, I had it all figured out in my head. I just needed my morning coffee first.</p>



<p>I started coding right after my first sip. Something really happened in my head during sleep, because it felt so easy to write code. The solution was pretty obvious, and it did not introduce any unneeded complexity to an already chaotic code base. It looked good, so I ran the code locally. Oh, yes, I forgot to import the module here. Oops, this variable is NULL now, let’s fix that. Okay, it seems to work now. So I committed changes to my branch and created a PR. It’s 11 am on the clock. Pretty sweet as a start of the day, ha? Now what? Even if I solved the problem, it’s not going to do much good without getting into production. Now it’s time to get my code to the finish line.</p>



<p>My open PR had automatically triggered tests. We have all kinds of tests: unit, integration, code style, you name it. I knew I had some time because this process is not usually fast. However, I didn’t have enough time to shift my focus to another task or fully relax. So I kept on checking my messengers, social apps, and news feed. Then a message arrived in Slack. “Lint-check failed.” Oh, I hate those! I thought I had everything right! Okay, it looks like I forgot to remove this import, and it’s not used anymore. I removed one line from the code and committed my changes. 5 minutes wait, again. What’s going on on Twitter?</p>



<h2>We all hate waiting</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg" alt="The picture of a man looking at his phone waiting for the code deploy to finish." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I did not notice how 15 minutes passed. Then I got another slack message – integration tests failed. At least my code style is right. So, I spent another 5 minutes fixing the issue (integration test actually did an excellent job catching a tricky bug, so I’m not mad at it). Then I committed my changes and played the waiting game again.</p>



<p>I understand the importance of tests, but 20 minutes, come on! Of course, I could’ve made some progress on another task, meanwhile. No, not really. I don’t know about you, but I hate switching focus. It takes so much time to get into a really focused state. So I’ve checked all my apps on the phone a couple times and found the bottom of the twitter feed before I saw a Slack notification about the successful deployment of my code. </p>



<p>Just to be safe, I need to test the app on production to see if the new feature works. From first glance, it did, but there was a small glitch. I had to update the code in the UI of a web application, nothing fancy, just changing a string. This turned out to be a header on the page, and I added redundant whitespace at the beginning, so now it looks weird. Okay, here we go again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now all tests passed, but the deployment took forever. I’m not sure what kind of computation is involved in moving a folder with files around 10 megabytes from my laptop to the server, but it sure feels like it could’ve trained a conscious AI by now. I don’t remember how much time it took for me to refresh the page and finally see the whitespace disappear, but it definitely took another cup of coffee. I managed to check my emails during this time, so I was productive, I guess. Anyway, it’s 2 pm, and it’s time for lunch.</p>



<h2>How much time we waste</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg" alt="The picture of a clock to illustrate time we waste when the deploy is slow." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>As you may have noticed, I’m complaining. That day I really spent around 1 hour actually solving an engineering problem, including bug-fixing time. But it took me 4 hours until I saw my changes in production. There are many days like this, so time adds up. I feel righteous anger because this thing is common in the industry, and many people experience the same thing.</p>



<p>So, what’s the solution? Not writing tests? Of course, not, tests are freaking great. The issue is more generic – it’s all those inefficiencies that are easy to introduce to the deploy time (I bundle tests and all CI/CD stuff in the deploy time). It’s easy to write an inefficient CI/CD job. Its intent could be positive, and at the time, it may seem like a great idea. But a little delay is multiplied by the number of people working on the project and frequency of changes they make. Because deploy time affects EVERY contributor and EVERY code change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slow deploy means slow feedback loops. Imagine you’re an artist. Now imagine each time you move your brush on the canvas, you need to wait 5 minutes before the paint appears. That would be the most annoying thing ever.</p>



<h2><strong>The feedback loop (deploy) has to be fast</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg" alt="The picture of an artist that compares painting and seeing result with the feedback loop of software deploy." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I believe that each developer who likes to solve creative problems needs to have a fast feedback loop. You change the code – “snap” – it’s updated on the server – “snap” – you see the result.</p>



<p>Please think about this next time you want to add something to the deploy time. And also, think about improving deployment speed next time you work on technical debts. If you cut just 1 minute for a project with 5 contributors, each of them contributing once a day (only on workdays), it saves more than 100 hours a year. And I don’t know how to count improved productivity because of not having to switch the focus, but for me, it would multiply this time by 2 at least. To create better software, we need to improve how we write software.</p>



<p>PS. There is a great talk that inspired me&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a>. You should check it out, it’s mind-blowing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a post in a series of posts :</p>
<br>
<div><p>
As my regular readers know I reluctantly trust anything that isn't tested and battle proof. In the last 2 years, I applied the same logic that I apply to vulnerability research to the Data Privacy environment and proceeded to test a broad range of Data Subject Rights. Expect a few disclosures following this one.</p><p>

In true Information Security Fashion (insiders will understand) have attributed this weakness the ID :</p><ul>
<li><b>CDPWE-0001 - Does not designate a Representative in the European Union</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<br></div>
<p>
When I searched Google for my name an interesting website came up in the results. A company called "Rocket Reach" allowed others to buy access to my personal data. I was intrigued as I have never given any consent for Rocketreach to store (or even sell) my data and I saw no other legal basis for RocketReach processing of my data.</p>
<div>

<p>
"Rocket Reach" a data broker that describes it's service as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Connect directly with the right decision makers, using the world's largest and most accurate database of emails and direct dials.&nbsp;Real-time verified data for 430 million professionals across 17 million companies, worldwide.Trusted by over 5.0 million users — powering sales, recruiting, and marketing at companies large and small.</p>
<p>
Prospect, connect and converse with your leads at scale."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>



<h3>
Issuing a DSAR</h3>
</p>
<p>
On the <b>5th of April&nbsp; 2019</b>, I asked Rocketreach access to my personal data (Data Subject Access Request) and asked for the purpose and the legal basis of processing. Instead of giving me access to my data and reply adequately, RocketReach decided to <b>delete/remove all traces of it </b>and informed me that it did so the same day.</p>

<p>
While it might be surprising to some, this is actually a common reaction to DSARs when the Data Controller realizes the data they have may have no real legal basis.</p>
<br>
<h3>
Filing a complaint&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
On the <b>05th of April 2019</b>, I filed a complaint with the Luxemburgish Data Protection Agency (CNPD). The reference for this complaint is #3018 (For those that want to request information/documents from the CNPD).</p>

<h3>
Waiting for roughly a year</h3>
<br>
<h3>
"We agree with you but we can't do anything, sorry, move on"</h3>
<p>
On the <b>6th of March 2020</b>&nbsp;(<span>1 year!</span>) the CNPD responded as follows (Original Version on top, the Translated version at the bottom).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><span lang="FR">Monsieur Zoller,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">La
 Commission nationale pour la protection des données (CNPD) se permet de
 revenir vers vous concernant votre réclamation du 5 avril 2019 à 
l’encontre de la société RocketReach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cadre de l’instruction de votre réclamation, la 
société RocketReach nous a communiqué qu’elle considère que ce sont les 
utilisateurs de ses services, et non elle-même, qui sont les 
responsables du traitement pour ce qui concerne les
 données à caractère personnel traitées sur son site internet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Par ailleurs, il ressort également de cette instruction 
que la société RocketReach est une société située aux Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique <b>ne disposant pas d’un représentant dans l’Union au sens de 
l’article 27 du règlement général sur la protection
 des données (RGPD). </b><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Au sujet des responsables du traitement établis dans des
 pays tiers, comme les Etats-Unis d’Amérique, nous souhaitons attirer 
votre attention sur le considérant (116) du RGPD qui précise que:</span></p>
<p>
«&nbsp;<i>Lorsque
 des données à caractère personnel franchissent
 les frontières extérieures de l'Union, cela peut accroître le risque 
que les personnes physiques ne puissent exercer leurs droits liés à la 
protection des données, notamment pour se protéger de l'utilisation ou

 De même, les autorités de contrôle peuvent être confrontées à 
l'impossibilité d'examiner des réclamations ou de mener des enquêtes sur
 les activités exercées en dehors de leurs frontières. Leurs efforts 
pour collaborer dans le contexte transfrontalier peuvent
 également être freinés par les pouvoirs insuffisants dont elles 
disposent en matière de prévention ou de recours, par l'hétérogénéité 
des régimes juridiques et par des obstacles pratiques tels que le manque

<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cas de votre réclamation cela signifie que, <b>bien
 que nous ne partagions pas le point de vue de RocketReach et que nous

<blockquote><b>English Translation</b><p>
Mr. Zoller, </p><p>The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) would like to get back to you regarding your complaint of 5 April 2019 against the company RocketReach. </p><p>Rocket Reach has informed us that <b>it considers that it is the users of its services, and not itself, who are responsible for processing personal data processed on its website</b>.  Furthermore, it also emerges from this instruction that RocketReach is a company located in the United States of America that does not have a representative in the Union within the meaning of Article 27 of the General Regulation on Data Protection (RGPD).&nbsp;</p> <p>As regards data controllers established in third countries, such as the United States of America, we would like to draw your attention to recital (116) of the DPMR which states that: 'When personal data crosses the external borders of the Union, this may increase the risk that individuals may not be able to exercise their data protection rights, in particular to protect themselves against unlawful use or disclosure of such information.</p><p>Similarly, supervisory authorities may be faced with the impossibility to investigate complaints or activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventive or remedial powers, heterogeneous legal regimes and practical obstacles such as lack of resources. »&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of your complaint, this means that, although <b>we do not share RocketReach's view and to the contrary believe <span>that RocketReach is the data controller</span> </b>for the processing of personal data on its website, <b>we are unable to take any further action in relation to your complaint.</b> We do not have the authority to investigate and enforce any decision we would have to take in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>We regret to inform you that we consider it impossible for us to proceed with the processing of your case.</b></p></blockquote>
<div><p>In Summary -&nbsp; Rocketreach has <b>not met the requirement</b> of the GDPR to name an EU representative (Art27) to account for the processing of European Personal Data. <b>In their answer, the CNPD makes it sound like it is optional, it isn't.</b> Instead of pursuing Rocketreach locally on that basis alone, the CNPD just gives up arguing it has no jurisdiction in the US.</p></div>

<p><span>In other words, just don't designate a representative in Europe, build your business model around the exploitation of data from millions of European data subjects and you are fine?</span></p>

<p>
I&nbsp; am fully aware that I could engage in legal procedures myself.&nbsp; That's not in my interest (in this case). The overall question you should ask is: Do we need a European Institution that handles extra-territorial investigations and fines? <b>Why should it take the time, money, and energy from an individual when the DPA is supposed to defend the rights of the data subjects</b>?</p>
<p>
What the CNPD could have done according to [1]</p><ul>
<li><span><span>to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the suspension of data flows to a recipient in a third country or to an international organisation.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to, or instead of measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each individual case;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period;</span></span></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-a0ba2051dedfb653ca45"><div><h3><strong>Building Beauty invites computer professionals to:</strong></h3><p><strong>Work, study, and conduct research with a network of&nbsp;Christopher Alexander’s colleagues and students</strong></p><p>The architect and urbanist Christopher Alexander, and his coworkers, produced a body of insights, practical methods, and research results, which inspired countless movements and products in the computer world -- from <strong>structured programming</strong> to <strong>design patterns</strong>; from the <strong>wiki</strong> to the <strong>sims</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>But these were side-effects. His major drive was to understand the <strong>nature of beauty</strong>, and the processes that create life and beauty in nature, so people could make beautiful things.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who wants to build beautifully, and anyone interested in resolving the countless troubles and problems in the world of computing, would benefit from understanding Alexander’s underlying research program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The most direct way to do that, and the most engaged approach, is to study the material <strong>with a network of people who worked closely with Christopher Alexander</strong>, and who are continuing to develop his approach to theory and practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Building Beauty is an architectural graduate program. Its goal is to provide the opportunity to join this network and pursue this research.&nbsp;</p><p>If you work in <strong>computing</strong>, we invite you to study this material with us in its <strong>original</strong> form, for the<strong> built environment</strong> -- and join in parallel seminars, projects, and conferences to explore a disciplined, rigorous, and authentic recasting of this material, within the world of technology. We will pursue research in the natural sciences and explore the nature of engineering, while growing beautiful projects that move us towards a better world.&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher Alexander made sure that his colleagues, no matter their background, went through&nbsp; fundamental, practical training on the nature of beauty. We've continued that tradition at the Building Beauty program. Now, in parallel, within our new Beautiful Software initiative, we’ll get everyone up-to-speed regarding ambitious technology that can assist in the spread of beauty. The first lesson is that putting nature, beauty, and feeling in the <strong>center</strong> of processes and practices will engender positive, revolutionary changes in the world we live in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The case for beautiful software</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>There are <strong>three</strong> strange facts that force us to consider <strong>good</strong> software to be (among other things) <strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>natural</strong>, compelling us to examine closely what these mean.&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>People can tell the <strong>difference</strong> between something that is natural -- that is, <strong>not</strong> man-made -- and something that is a human artifact.</p></li><li><p>However it's measured, <strong>nature</strong> makes <strong>more complex</strong> products than we can. Of course, the human species is an 'artifact' of nature, so we can never win that game.</p></li><li><p>Among the products of nature and humans, we judge the <strong>best</strong> to be 'natural and 'beautiful'.</p></li></ol><p>Regarding (1) -- of course it’s possible to fool people: with a photograph, for example. But when we do so, we are merely re-emphasizing that there <strong>is</strong> a perceptual faculty that reacts to impressions of natural structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding (2) -- nature produces beauty and adaptation wonderfully. It's enviable. But nature's precise physical and chemical mechanisms are terribly complex and hard to uncover, while the mechanisms behind good software must be clear, consistent, and comprehensible. So why study natural processes? Because nature doesn't only work at a single, low-level scale. Nature works with overlapping layers of means and ends, which we can make immediate use of, it turns out, when we direct our efforts towards beauty and feeling. We don't need to copy nature exactly. We just need to do better, and natural processes provide the clues.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding (3) -- there are many human artifacts and processes, even extremely 'popular', 'successful', and 'productive' ones, that are neither beautiful nor natural. This may be a good indication of a harmful product or process. Things that are popular, dominant, and stimulating are not necessarily good. But, unfortunately, by habit, and power projection through our society, bad results are often called 'best practices'. Learning to question dogmas is one of the most important skills one can develop in life and in the sciences -- along with an ability to piece together theories that displace the dogmas. This process of enlightenment, in the broad sense, should never end.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, even the most beautiful and natural software will do harm if it was not created freely and cooperatively, for the purpose of healing and helping people and nature. <strong>Responsibility</strong> is rarely practiced in the creation of any technology, but we need it: we won't survive unless we become truly, doggedly responsible.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll be examining these ideas and practices in our seminars and projects. <strong>You are all invited.</strong></p><p><strong>To express your interest in joining us, please write to </strong><a href="mailto:software@buildingbeauty.org"><strong>software@buildingbeauty.org</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

					<div><p>I have a strange relationship with hypomania. I LOVE IT but I know that what goes up must come down and when it comes down it <span><strong>REALLY</strong></span> comes down. And the next time is even worse than the last. The relief of coming out of depression and speeding towards hypomania is magical. Waking up and jumping out of bed, rushing to get dressed so I can go outside. So I can experience the sun on my skin, the air is fresh and the grass is greener than I remember. Everything is great. I want to share my happiness with my friends, family and the world. I laugh harder than I have ever laughed before. I very rarely wear make-up but when I’m hypomanic I absolutely must. I’m confident in every aspect of life. I even love going to work. I have the best ideas. I could definitely do that. My taste in music changes I’m forever searching for an up-beat song that has a fast beat that I can sing to, dance to. I’ll skip 100’s of songs until I find the one and when I do it’s AMAZING.</p><p>In social situations during a hypomanic episode you’ll often find me surrounded by people. I love talking and I love listening. People tend to be really drawn to me when I’m like this because I’m fun to be around and I make them laugh. I often go days with barely any sleep. I don’t need it. I don’t need to eat either.&nbsp; I can sleep when I’m dead, eating is a distraction from what I want to be doing and I have lots of things that I want to do. Sounds great right? How is this even considered a mental illness? Let me tell you… During this episodes one of my symptoms is hypersexuality.</p><blockquote><p><span><strong>Hypersexuality</strong></span> is defined as an increased need or pressure for sexual gratification. It can often be a symptom of mania, and may also include decreased inhibitions or a need for forbidden sex.</p></blockquote><p>For me I become preoccupied with the thought of having sex and I’ll pursue someone hard. Not just with my partner at the time but anyone who takes my eye. In fact, I don’t even need to feel that attracted to them. The thrill of flirting, the thrill of making them want me is my objective. I consider myself a straight female (Though I have had sexual encounters with women in the past) but it doesn’t matter. I’ll flirt and have sex with women too. I don’t want or need it to be intimate. It’s an hedonistic, animalistic desire to have sex. And if I don’t get it? It pisses me off. This again probably doesn’t sound like the end of the world does it? But what if you’re flirting and perusing your boss? A married man or you’re in a relationship yourself? Not so funny when it can fuck up your life and other peoples. </p><p>This behaviour has led me into dangerous situations. I have been sexually assaulted numerous times and now what would be defined as rape. At the time I had no awareness that it was. For this reason amongst others I never reported it. Victim blaming is prevelant in society. I saw it as me putting myself in a&nbsp; situation where it could happen, thus it was my own fault.</p><p>Reflecting on my teenage years I can now really see that hypomania was very present. After my dad died when I was 16. I stopped turning up at school I made friends with people much older than me. Many of them I’m still friends with and they really are great friends.&nbsp; But during this period of my life I ended up using recreational drugs EVERY weekend, ALL weekend.&nbsp; Not just a bit of weed but ecstasy and cocaine whilst drinking heavily too. Sometimes I took all of those drugs on the same night. I remember the day I turned 18. Finishing work, the guy I worked with (also my best friend at the time) handed me some money to buy ecstasy for the party were planning to have. I walked into my Mum’s house filled with family there to wish me happy birthday. I stood there and chatted to them, the whole time I had 200 ecstasy tablets in the front pocket of my hoody. I didn’t care. I didn’t care that taking one of those ecstasy tablets could have killed me. Because it wouldn’t would it? I’m indestructible. I’m having so much fun. Life is great.</p><p>If all that hasn’t persuaded you that hypomania is a bad thing… What about the racing thoughts? The irritation that consumes you and the full-blown anger that comes because of it? I’ve lost friends and I’ve upset people because something relatively minor has pissed me off and I have completely lost self-control. I can’t control what comes out of my mouth, I don’t have the restraint or the ability to filter what I say. I’ve thrown things, I’ve smashed things. I’ve screamed, caught my breath and screamed again.&nbsp; I’ve promised to do impossible tasks. I’ve spent money I didn’t have because I wanted, no needed those clothes,shoes and that new laptop. I have at least 15 bottles of shampoo in my bathroom, drawers full of make-up all that I very rarely use. The result of a hypomanic episode.</p><p>During some episodes the “fun bit” hasn’t come. Sometimes hypomania for me has had more psychotic and paranoid features such as hearing voices talking about me. My anxiety increases beyond its normal threshold to the point I have panic attacks. I can feel my heart beating so fast that it feels like it’s going to come out of my chest. I shake uncontrollably. And have lost control of my bladder. Yes I’ve actualIy pissed myself fully clothed where I stand. I can actually see my thoughts swirling around above my head so fast that they I can barely read them. I’ve found myself putting my hands over my head and squeezing just to get some sort of relief. Hypomania at some points has led to me trying to, or wanting to kill myself. Not so fun now is it? It’s hard not to get addicted to the euphoria of hypomania. I try to remind myself that there are very real consequences to these episodes when I consider not taking my medication just to feel that euphoria again.</p><p>When it’s all over I’m left to pick up the pieces, to fix (if they are even fixable) the stupid shit I’ve done. Hypomania isn’t fun when it’s over. The depression that comes after hypomania is possibly the worst type of depression. My mind is broken and so is my body. The embarrassment of my behaviour after some of these episodes is awful. I sink lower and lower after every hypomanic episode and it scares me that one day I will really hit the bottom of rock bottom and I’ll never get back out of it. Some of the worst things that have ever happened to me are the result of a hypomanic episode. I’m lucky I’m not dead. Seriously.</p><p>Fortunately, with a combination of medication, psychiatric help and maturing as a person dealing with the depression and hypomania has become easier and I can most of the time diffuse situations or at least deal with the fallout from them better than I have before. &nbsp;Taking diazepam for 7 days at the start of a developing hypomanic episode is necessity for me and can often stop it in its tracks.</p><p>The biggest thing I have learnt after having Bi-Polar is that <span><strong>SLEEP</strong> </span>and <span><strong>STRESS</strong></span> management are key to staying well. When one of those tips the balance, that’s when things start going wrong.</p><p>Although the original idea for this blog was meant to be cathartic release for me. I hope that in some way I can give people a platform to express themselves and the opportunity just to “get it all out” and I hope you feel less alone when reading my posts. Please feel free to engage with me on one of my various social media accounts. Even if it’s just to say Hi or tell me your story.</p><p><img src="https://www.barebipolar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sig1-copy-e1595458758796.png" data-src="https://www.barebipolar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sig1-copy-e1595458758796.png" alt="" width="160" height="76"></p></div>

		<p>I was on <a href="https://www.insideedition.com/zombie-animals-encounters-terrifying-creatures-rise-42966">Inside Edition last week to talk about zombies</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a weird sentence to type.</p>
<p>While the story was dramatic, television clips are notoriously difficult to discuss anything of real significance. I had two main messages I wanted to get across.<strong> One</strong>, that we can’t be sure what these animals are suffering from just by appearance (this message kind of got missed in the clips they chose) and because of that, message <strong>two</strong>: you shouldn’t approach a potentially diseased animal yourself, but instead call animal control or your local wildlife professionals to come help (at least they did include me saying not to approach these animals).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lGACWoZL0-PNLWs0LGJsYz8XoSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHSNF332IQZR5MZDXT5VKCWWTA.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="410"><figcaption>A “zombie” raccoon, probably infected with canine distemper virus. Photo by Robert Coggeshall.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In all likelihood, most of the animals they showed and that have been recently been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/zombie-raccoons-are-terrorizing-city-youngstown-ohio-180968704/">“terrorizing” individuals in Youngstown, Ohio</a> are suffering from infection with <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Canine-Distemper.aspx">canine distemper virus</a>. This is a virus related to human measles, and like measles, is very contagious. From the name, it obviously affects dogs, but isn’t limited to only dogs. It can also infect raccoons, foxes, opossums, ferrets, and even wild <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/canine-distemper-could-wipe-out-siberian-tigers/">tigers</a>. Among animals, the distemper virus can be transmitted by bites or simple close contact, so it can spread quickly within groups of animals living together. The infected animals then either recover and develop immunity, or pass away from the infection.</p>
<p>The animals exhibiting “zombie” symptoms like those shown in the clip are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s likely that many other animals in the local population are also ill, but perhaps not dramatically so; like any infectious disease, there will be a spectrum of symptoms in infected individuals, so not every wild animal infected with canine distemper will “go zombie.”</p>
<p>Wildlife authorities have noted that these outbreaks of animals acting like “zombies” happen every few years: the virus will sweep through a population lacking <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unforgiving-math-that-stops-epidemics-20171026/">herd immunity</a>, infect many of the individuals, and those who are infected but recover will be immune. A few years later, when the population again contains large numbers of susceptible individuals due to births of new animals, the virus can again cause an outbreak—and the cycle continues over and over.</p>
<p>While canine distemper infection doesn’t cause symptoms in humans, <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/Health/Pages/rabies.aspx">rabies absolutely does</a>—and that’s a key reason people need to avoid these animals and leave them to the professionals. Based on the symptoms alone, you can’t tell if an aggressive, strangely-behaving animal is suffering from distemper or rabies. And while distemper isn’t harmful to humans (though it <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/canine-distemper#1">definitely could be to your dog</a> if they’re not up-to-date on their vaccinations), rabies is almost 100% fatal if not quickly treated with anti-rabies immunoglobulin and prophylactic vaccination. In the rare cases who have survived after symptoms developed, it was only with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a1.htm">extreme interventions</a> which are <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/six-year-old-dies-rabies-after-experimental-treatment-milwaukee-protocol-fails-782168">not always able to be replicated</a>.</p>
<p>Expect to see these epidemics of “zombie animals” on a regular basis in different locations around the country—but don’t try to be a hero. That never turns out well in the movies.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_322570"><p>The Dodo – endemic to Mauritius, made extinct at some unknown point in the late 1600s (Roberts &amp; Solow 2003, Hume <em>et al</em>. 2004, Cheke 2006) – was a giant, flightless pigeon, closely related to Nicobar pigeons (<em>Caloenas</em>) and crowned pigeons (<em>Goura</em>). This affinity is demonstrated by numerous anatomical details (Fjeldså 1976, Janoo 1996, 2000, Livezey &amp; Zusi 2007, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>) and also by genetics (Shapiro <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2007). Just knowing about the Dodo’s affinities is useful, since there are a few aspects of Dodo anatomy where we can look to its extant relatives for guidance. Example: obvious sexual dimorphism in plumage (at least, visible to the human eye) is not present in those close living relatives.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_123254"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_181526"><div><p>By far the most famous and influential of these are the paintings attributed to Roelandt Savery, in particular the giant 1626 painting which once belonged to writer and artist George Edwards. Supposedly based on a live bird kept in Holland, it’s today at the Natural History Museum, London (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007145721?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0007145721&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Fuller 2002</span></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>). Incidentally, we’re not <em>completely</em> sure that Savery really was the creator of this painting but I will – from hereon – assume that he was for the sake of convenience. A second very famous Savery Dodo painting – this time by Roelandt’s nephew, Jan or Hans Savery – is on show at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and might have been produced in 1631. Regardless, all of these ‘Savery’ Dodo paintings show grey (though read on), chunky, exceedingly bulky, short-legged birds with yellowish wing and tail plumes.</p><p>Despite claims that R. Savery’s 1626 painting was produced from life, it doesn’t match other images which more certainly were and it seems likely that it was based on taxiderm specimens or written accounts. For these reasons it (and other ‘Savery Dodos’) can’t and shouldn’t be taken as providing especially important insights into Dodo appearance or anatomy.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_187214"><div>

The drawings depict both a dead or stunned Dodo laid out on a table as well as one or more live Dodos in standing pose (Kitchener 1993a, Hume 2003, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>). Another Dodo drawing from the early days of Mauritian discovery and exploration is that featured in the Dutch volume <em>Het Tvveede Boeck</em> of 1601. This reported a 1598 expedition led by Admiral Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007145721?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0007145721&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Fuller 2002</span></a>, Hume 2006, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>) and hence the Dodo featured therein has often been called the Van Neck Dodo. A very influential illustration and account produced by the French naturalist Carolus Clusius in 1605 – it will be referred to a few times in this article – was apparently copied from a drawing in Van Neck’s journal, but the original has been lost.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_43525"><div>

An interesting colour painting produced by Cornelis Saftleven in around 1638 has an air of realism which forces writers like myself to pay attention to it (this might be a trick and it could be worthless), and it also gets mention here. Saftleven’s painting is also unusual in showing the bird in three-quarters view. It’s of unknown provenance and we don’t know if it was based on a live bird.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_219695"><div>

Mansur illustrated animals for Emperor Jahangir of the Mughul Empire who kept a menagerie at Surat, India; Jahangir’s scientific curiosity led him to order the creation of technically rigorous works which were meant to be as accurate and detailed as possible (Dissanayake 2004). As we’ll see, Mansur’s Dodo is one of the most significant depictions of the species in life. And, yes, it seemingly means that at least one live Dodo was present in an Indian menagerie during the 1620s.</p><p>The Dodos of Van Neck, Clusius and Savery are essentially the ‘originals’ from which virtually all later Dodos were copied, and both Kitchener (1993a) and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish (2013)</span></a> produced genealogies showing how subsequent artists based their Dodos on those of these artists.

                    <p>Accidents, tragedies, or negative outcomes, all entice a usual reaction: whoâ€™s at fault for this? Who is to blame? Our instinct drives us in that direction. The reasoning seems pretty obvious: if something bad has happened, it must have been because of someone screwed up by being negligent or maybe they were malevolent all along.</p>

<p>However, sometimes thereâ€™s no one we should be blaming. If we think in calm and measured wayâ€”before scapegoatingâ€”it becomes obvious that no oneâ€™s guilty.</p>

<p>I recently saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUCfY270l7k">video of killing</a> of Haramabe, a silverback gorilla, by Cincinnati Zoo authorities. The video shows a disoriented, agitated gorilla dragging a toddlerâ€”who had fallen into the enclosure after climbing the 3-foot fenceâ€”with intense force. After deliberating for ten minutes, the Zoo authorities decided to shoot the gorilla. Silverback gorilla is an endangered specie and Harambe was only half-way through his expected lifespan. Naturally, the action invited a ton of angry reactions.</p>

<p>Whoâ€™s to blame?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some say itâ€™s the zoo authorities. They point out that Harambe wasnâ€™t trying to hurt the child, and a tranquilizer could have been employed instead. The other camp questions the negligence of having a miniature fence.</li>
  <li>Some say itâ€™s the parents (the mother here). For letting the kid out of sight. Many, including prominent stars like Ricky Gervais, have targeted the mother for being an awful parent.</li>
  <li>The more misopedic ones blame the toddler and even question the decision of prioritizing a human life over the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>But thereâ€™s no one to blame if you ascertain all the facts of the case.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Silverback Gorillas are extremely powerful. It could be argued that Harambe didnâ€™t intend to harm the child, but even without effort, Harambe couldâ€™ve seriously hurt him. He was visibly getting more and more upset by the commotion.</li>
  <li>Tranquilizer darts take about ten minutes to work. The gorilla could have potentially injured the child in that time window, especially after being shot at.</li>
  <li>The fence could have been taller, but that only became obvious after the fact. The fence was erected in 1978 and they had no incident of visitors crossing till 2016. Additionally, the zoo passed inspections without being cited even once for the fenceâ€™s height.</li>
  <li>The mother had four kids with her. The toddler skipped fence when she was strapping the other kids to the stroller. Kids, especially if youâ€™ve multiple, canâ€™t be watched 24x7.  Parents are humans, not robots, and they have limited attention span. The fence climbing could have happened in a 10-20 sec window while she was focused on her other kids. (<a href="https://people.com/celebrity/witness-describes-moment-when-4-year-old-climbed-into-gorilla-enclosure/">ref</a>)</li>
  <li>Finally, kids that young are still impervious to dangers of their actions. They are still learning about the world and can unknowingly attempt something very perilous.</li>
</ul>

<p>To me, thereâ€™s no one to blame. It just an unfortunate incident that happened with no one at an obvious fault. You could invoke the moral culpability in keeping animals away from their natural habitat, but that is far removed from the incident.</p>

<hr>

<p>In 2009, Gene Weingarten, touched on a similar subject with his Pulitzer winning story, â€œ<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html">Fatal Distraction</a>.â€� Around 15-25 times a year, a parentâ€”an â€œotherwise loving and attentive parentâ€�â€”forgets a child in the carâ€™s backseat resulting in a tragic death. Such a horrifying mistake would register as  gross neglect to must of us, but we should ask, can our disgust be more than the â€œlifelong sentence of guiltâ€� that the parent has to bear? This isnâ€™t wilful negligence, itâ€™s a mistake like any other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Memory is a machine, and it is not flawless. Our conscious mind prioritizes things by importance, but on a cellular level, our memory does not. <strong>If youâ€™re capable of forgetting your cellphone, you are potentially capable of forgetting your child</strong></p>

  <p><em>â€”  David Diamond, professor of molecular physiology, University of South Florida</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The search to blame someone can actually exacerbate the situation as Margarethe Wiersema, professor of management at University of California, observed in her <a href="https://hbr.org/2002/12/holes-at-the-top-why-ceo-firings-backfire">study of CEO firings</a>. Often, because of poor earnings and growth, the board of directors relent under the pressure and dismiss the CEO. However, having a new head doesnâ€™t translate to a turnaround; in fact, the decline could potentially accelerate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typically a CEO gets fired not because the board has thoughtfully and deliberately concluded that itâ€™s time for a change at the top but because investors, concerned about poor performance, demand a change. Board members, who have little idea how to address the underlying problems that got their company into trouble in the first place, seek to appease investors in the short term by handing them the CEOâ€™s head on a platter.</p>

  <p>â€¦</p>

  <p>Company performance relative to industry average failed to improve significantly after bringing in a new CEO. And performance lagged behind that of companies with routine CEO successions. I couldnâ€™t find a single measure suggesting that CEO dismissals have a positive effect on corporate performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism">politicianâ€™s syllogism</a> at work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We must do something</li>
  <li>This is something</li>
  <li>Therefore, we must do this.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Rather than asking whoâ€™s to blame, the more productive thing is to assess a situation from everyoneâ€™s point of view, understand that humans are fallible, and think what we can do improve the future outcomes. Blame is an easy game, but compassion is harder.</p>

<h4>Gout termed as rich man’s disease caused a significant impact in Europe and US&nbsp;history.</h4>

<p>The king of the Holy Roman Empire laid siege on the city of Metz in France. The blockade would have been an instant victory if the king had barged into the city. Severe pain in his feet delayed the king to start an offensive. The delay caused the king to lose the battle. The entire European monarchy crashed with it. The Kings’s pain was due to a disease that impacted European history for years to come. The condition was Gout, also called as Foot grabber.</p>



<p>Gout has been part of the royal disease list for centuries. Gout is inflammation in bone joints and termed as the Arthritis of the rich. Gout has affected a meager portion of the world population but has influenced some of the world’s significant political events. Gout occurs due to excessive meat and alcohol consumption, which is the trademark of Europe’s aristocratic life. Gout is mostly formed in the feet and caused unbearable pain.</p>



<h4>Charles V’s Gout Problem and Fall of&nbsp;Europe:</h4>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/00cf6-0pfleiado4dmcexib.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Charles V.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>



<p>Charles V was the Holy Roman Empire in Europe and waged war against the French and led a successful crusade. During one of his campaigns, Charles V laid siege on the crucial town of Metz in France. Metz was the last major town in French control. Charles V had the habit of exhaustive drinking and meat consumption due to which Gout developed in his leg. On the siege day due to unbearable Gout pain, Charles V stopped the offensive and took rest. During the period of rest, the French reinforced the town. When he recovered and went for an invasion, Charles V lost the battle. After the loss and due to Gout pain Charles V abdicated the throne and split the Holy Roman Empire among his son and brother. Gout brought in the Holy Roman Empire’s downfall and cut Europe into two factions the Spanish Habsburgs and Austrian Habsburgs.</p>

<h4>William Pitt, the Elder, and US Independence:</h4>

<p>William Pitt, the Elder, was a British parliamentarian who influenced the British parliament. He was the grandson of the famous Thomas Diamond Pitt. William had Gout from a young age and skipped college graduation due to it. William Pitt spoke for the rights of the people in the American colony. When the British parliament voted on imposing taxes on tea, William Pitt spoke against the bill. He convinced many members to vote against the law. Unfortunately, on the final day of the debate, William could not attend the session, which passed the tax bill.<br>The high tax on tea created the Boston tea party and ultimately sown the seeds for the American revolution. Had Gout not caught William that day, American independence would not have happened.</p>



<p>Other famous personalities who had Gout are Cosmo de Medici, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry VIII.</p>



<p>Physicians came up with remedies to the Gout issue with stool or glass boot, but the relief was temporary. Gout got its portrayal as a rich man’s disease due to its patient history.</p>

            <p>
	Churches in Montreal are becoming concerned about hosting community groups after being hit with bills for municipal taxes.</p>
<p>
	Joel Coppetiers, the Minister at the Cote des Neiges Presbyterian church, was shocked when his institution first received a municipal tax bill in early 2015.</p>
<p>
	It was "the first indication that something had changed," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Provincial law exempts churches and manses from paying municipal taxes but Coppetiers was told that if a manse is vacant for several months between ministers, it's taxable.</p>
<p>
	Following that, city officials arrived for an inspection of every room in the church and how they were used.</p>
<p>
	"The indication is there's not an exemption for the church as a whole, there's only an exemption for those areas used for public worship and things directly related to it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	As a result, many churches in Montreal that host community groups, such as food banks, or Girl Guides or Boy Scouts, are facing mounting tax bills.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says the city has changed how it interprets the law.</p>
<p>
	"We're there to care and serve the community and this is part of it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says taxes are due even when services are suspended for renovations.</p>
<p>
	The amount owed in taxes can increase swiftly if a church closes its doors.</p>
<p>
	When <a href="http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/trinity-memorial-church-in-ndg-closes-its-doors-1.3302321">Trinity Memorial Church in NDG </a>closed earlier this year, the city started enacting taxes immediately following the last service.</p>
<p>
	As a result churches feel pressured to sell swiftly, with Trinity Memorial being sold to Stanford Properties Group within two months.</p>
<p>
	The issue of places of worship owing taxes and fighting the city's exemptions office came as a surprise to city politicians, including Councillor Peter McQueen.</p>
<p>
	"Already our churches are in danger, they're having a number of financial problems and this is a further low blow," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	The NDG councillor said his party, Projet Montreal, will study the exemption issue, but he said Montreal's Executive Committee needs to step up.</p>
<p>
	"If we don't do something you're going to see churches closed, churches possibly torn down, heaven forbid, certainly converted away from community use," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile churches across the island are praying that the city will cease surprising them with taxes they can't afford.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Last Sunday the 19th July 2020 I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>, a Decentralised, Self-Hosted, Twitter™-like microBlogging Platform.</p>

<p>You can read about my previous <a href="https://www.prologic.blog/2020/07/20/ann-announcing-twtxtnet.html">Announcing twtxt.net post</a>.</p>

<p>Today however I want to share more about <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> and the software behind it <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a>; Why I’ve done all this, Why it is important to me and Why you should care.</p>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background Story</h2>

<p>So before we go into the Why and How, let’s first of all talk about how we go here in the first place.</p>

<p>Back in ~2015 I got head hunted by <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>™ and after turning them down twice (<em>three was a bit much!</em>) I accepted the offer and relocated my family to the Bay Area at the Menlo Park HQ ala Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>There I spent ~3.5yrs as a Production Engineer (<em>Google it, or think DevOps/SRE if you’re unfamiliar, but not an apt description</em>).
Meanwhile, while I was <em>trying</em> to be good at my new found ay job, interesting developments were happening in the Social Media industry. Not only was Facebook copping flack for the Cambridge Analytics series of events, but <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>™ was going through some changes as well…</p>

<p>Twitter (_allegedly, although I never really got into Twitter myself…)( was introducing new automated algorithms to change what users on their platform saw on their timeline. This has significant impact on usability of the original intended use of the platform. Naturally <em>some</em> users did not like this and sought out other avenues and solutinos.</p>

<p>One such avenue was <a href="https://github.com/bucket">bucket</a>’s <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a>. As I understand it he created a very simple file format specification, a canonical client and unleashed this onto the world! 👏</p>

<p>This was all around ~2016. I was too busy at Facebook to notice :)</p>

<h2 id="present-day-2020">Present Day (2020)</h2>

<p>Fast forward to ~2020 (<em>20th July 2020 to be exact</em>) and a few weeks earlier while I was on holidays I was up late one night just poking around on the Internet (<em>as you do</em>) and looking for “Decentralized Social Media” software. I found quite a few; here are some of the better known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspore</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other not so well known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">ScuttleButt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gnusocial.network/">GNU Social</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This this very blog’s underlying platform <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> where I now write and publish longer pieces like on my <a href="https://prologic.blog/">Blog</a></p>

<p>There’s even an article on Wired entitled <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/">Decentralised Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>! Well I’m here to tell you  I formally challenge this and am here to throw the gauntlet down! 🧤</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way… I <em>might</em> have caught twtxt sooner back in ~2018 when I got back from the US, but I was also (<em>at that time</em>) too busy moving around, working and trying to get bak into our family home that was still being rented at the time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I said I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>the first of what I hope will be many instances</em>) on Sunday the 19th July 2020. I wrote the software <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a> in just a few short weekends in my “spare time” and licensed it under the very permissive MIT license.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>📕 If you haven’t already checked it out, created an account and played around. I would encourage you to do so! I run a freely available for anyone to use instance over at <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are non-technical and read this far… Firstly congratulations I like you already! Second, don’t worry, <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is just a platform to voice/share your thoughts, wisdoms, rambling, short-form text or anything else you want. Think of it like a miniature Facebook or Twitter but without all the advertising or tracking.</p>

<p>I believe in this very simple analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a diary and a Parker™ Pen.
If you then write down your thoughts, wisdoms, experiences, rambling or whatever you want to and share this with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who owns what you have written? The manufacturer of the paper? The manufacturer of the diary? The manufacturer of the pen?</p>

<p>🤔</p>

<h3 id="so-why-why-should-i-use-twtxt-net">So why? Why should I use twtxt.net?</h3>

<p>You should use <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> if you are the type of person that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoys writing and sharing interesting things with others.</li>
<li>Just have interesting things to say in general. Knowledge and Wisdom should be shared!</li>
<li>Are tired of all the issues of all the <strong>BIG</strong> Social Media giants that now plague the f<em>, g</em> and t*.</li>
<li>No longer <em>wish</em> to be the product of Facebook or Twitter and want to <strong>own</strong> your own posts and interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>See whilst <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is brand spanking new, there are a few principles that will always remain true even now and going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NO</strong> User behaviour tracking of any kind.</li>
<li><strong>NO</strong> Advertising anywhere  of any kind.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> be capable of being self-hosted.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> allow users to take their data somewhere else and use another <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a> client</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-how-will-you-make-any-money">So how will you make any money?!</h3>

<p>Good question! Glad you asked. I probably won’t! But one of my primary goals is for users to “Self Host”.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Well it simply means that you run your own server instance of the software that is behind <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a non-technical person (<em>which would be true of most people as there are only about ~1M software developers in the world</em>) then you’re probably asking yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how do I do this?! I don’t know anything about computers! I just use apps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well don’t worry. Even through (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) it’s really early days for <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> there are plans for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A paid single-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> that is <strong>your very own</strong>, personalised to you, with your own domain name but with all the same features.</li>
<li>A paid multi-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> with all the same features but more suitable to small communities, schools, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>How much will this cost when it becomes available? Short answer is I don’t know. But I can tell you this, it will cost you less than what you are paying for Facebook and Twitter today (<em>remember that even through the f<em>, t</em>, g* are all FREE, there is an implicit cost, which is to say that you are implicitly paying for it as you are their product!</em>).</p>

<p>Let’s just say that once we’re ready to launch single-click hosted instances for the masses that it will cost you next to nothing. And if you can’t pay for your own instance, just use a friend’s instance or jump on any other instance you can find like <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>!</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-today">twtxt.net Today</h2>

<p>So let’s talk about what <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> can do for you today.</p>

<p>Today you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signup as a new user at <a href="https://twtxt.net/register">https://twtxt.net/register</a></li>
<li>Login at <a href="https://twtx.net/login">https://twtx.net/login</a></li>
<li>Make your first post by entering some prose of wisdom in the text box and hitting Submit!</li>
<li>You can follow other feeds by entering a Nickname for the feed and their URL in <a href="https://twtxt.net/follow">https://twtxt.net/follow</a></li>
<li>You can discover other users on the same instance as you by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/discover">https://twtxt.net/discover</a></li>
<li>You can find interesting external feeds and even external users outside of the instance you’re on by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/feeds">https://twtxt.net/feeds</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And most of all. You can have engaging, fun and interesting interactions with all sorts of people! <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) is growing at a rate of ~2-3K requests per day and 3-5 new user signups per day. WOW! 😱</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-tomorrow">twtxt.net Tomorrow</h2>

<p>Now there’s still loads more work to do and all of this is happening in “spare time”. No one is paying me or contributors to do any of this. We do this out of the love and kindness of our hearts 💚</p>

<p>Nevertheless progress will continue and here’s what we have planned already:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Native Mobile iPhone / iOS App! 🎉</li>
<li><code>@mentions</code> where you can easily see who has mentioned you in a post (<em>we call them <code>twt</code>s</em>)</li>
<li><code>#hashtag</code> searching where you can see other similar posts that users tag.</li>
<li>Always continuing to improve the UI/UX and overall user experience.</li>
<li>Uploading images/photos! 📷 This will come pretty quickly actually because there is already a demand for this!</li>
<li>Instance&lt;-&gt;Instance interactions. Basically strengthening the first-class decentralised nature of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>. 👌</li>
</ul>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is a <strong>FREE</strong> new type of Social Media that has a strong focus on Self-Hosting, Decentralisation without any of the bloat, tracking or advertising that we’ve all come to take for granted.</p>

<p>Join us today!</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://liamhinzman.com/blog/vulkan-fundamentals | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liamhinzman.com/blog/vulkan-fundamentals">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>

<p>Last week, my dad was asking me why I was proud of this triangle on my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://liamhinzman.com/img/vkTriangle.jpg"></p>
<p>I told him that rendering a triangle is complicated: it took me 3 days, and 1000+ lines of code to create the above image. This just made him more confused.</p>
<p>So I wrote this article explaining what the Vulkan graphics API is, how it works, and everything that goes into rendering a triangle with your GPU.</p>
<h2 id="what-vulkan-is">What Vulkan Is</h2>
<p>Vulkan is a graphics API that is designed to provide an accurate abstraction of how modern graphics processing units (GPUs) work. Unlike OpenGL, Vulkan is very verbose. Every detail related to the graphics API needs to be set up from scratch. The upsides to this are that you only use what you choose to, and you can better understand what’s going on in your application and in doing so achieve much higher performance.</p>
<p>This article is intended to be a concise overview of the fundamentals of Vulkan. It was written for somebody who knew Vulkan but has forgotten many of the details (i.e.&nbsp;future me). Most of the information here comes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html">Vulkan 1.2 Spec</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This article uses the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/">C++ bindings</a> for Vulkan</p>
<h2 id="vulkan-in-a-nutshell">Vulkan in a Nutshell</h2>
<p><em>From a bird’s eye view, here’s how a Vulkan application works:</em></p>
<p>Vulkan can access <strong>devices</strong>, which let you control one or more <strong>queues</strong>. Queues are how you send a list of commands to the GPU, and they can be members of one or more <strong>queue families</strong>, each of which can do different things (e.g.&nbsp;draw the vertices of a 3D model).</p>
<p><strong>Command buffers</strong> are how you submit commands to a queue. Device commands are ‘recorded’ to a command buffer through Vulkan API calls, and can then be submitted once or many times (e.g.&nbsp;once every frame) to a queue to be executed.</p>
<p>That’s the TL;DR - now it’s time to dive into the details!</p>
<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>
<p><strong><em>Instances and Devices</em></strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning there was the Vulkan API. And the API was made flesh through <code>vk::Instance</code>, and from it sprung all per-application state.</em></p>
<p>You initialize Vulkan by creating an instance, which contains application state - information like what version of the Vulkan API you’re using, your application’s name, and which extensions and layers you want to enable. Extensions and layers provide behavior that isn’t included by default in Vulkan, like extended error checking and call logging.</p>
<p>With an instance you can examine the <strong>physical devices</strong> (usually GPUs) that are available. A machine might have multiple physical devices, and each of their properties (such as being a dedicated graphics card) can be inspected.</p>
<p>A common pattern for physical device selection is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all of the physical devices</li>
<li>Score each physical device on desired properties</li>
<li>Give physical devices without required properties a score of 0</li>
<li>Pick the physical device with the highest score</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary><b> Example code for physical device selection
</b><p><b>(Tip: Read the comments so you don’t get overwhelmed by code) </b></p></summary>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>void</span> pickPhysicalDevice() {</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>  <span>// Get list of all physical devices that can be found by Vulkan</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>  <span>auto</span> physicalDevices = instance.enumeratePhysicalDevices();</span>

<p>With a physical device you can create a <strong>logical device</strong>.</p>
<p>Physical devices represent the GPU, and logical devices are what you use to create resources and access <strong>queues</strong>.</p>
<p>Keeping the logical device separate from the physical device is also useful because it allows you to have multiple logical devices, each with their state and resources, for a single physical device. One example of where this would be useful is if you had a Vulkan rendering application that also used a UI Toolkit (also running on Vulkan) that was completely separate. They’d each need their own logical devices to operate, but they’re both using the same physical device.</p>
<p>Logical device creation is also where you create queues.</p>
<h2 id="making-stuff-happen">Making Stuff Happen</h2>
<p><strong><em>Queues, Command Buffers, and Render Passes</em></strong></p>
<p>A queue is a list of commands that the GPU executes.</p>
<p>Each queue can only have certain types of commands (some can have multiple types, others just one), and this is specified when a queue is created.</p>
<p>The four types of queue operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> —&gt; Drawing the vertices of a model</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> —&gt; Ray tracing, cloth simulation</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong> —&gt; Loading textures and buffers</li>
<li><strong>Sparse</strong> —&gt; Loading part of a ‘mega-texture’</li>
</ul>
<p>A physical device will give you access to several queues of different <strong>queue families</strong>, and when you create a queue it will be an index to a queue of a matching queue family on the device. Queue families are queues that have the same properties as one another (e.g.&nbsp;perform both graphics and compute operations).</p>
<p>Commands are submitted to queues by first recording a series of commands into a command buffer and then submitting the entire command buffer to a queue with <code>vk::Queue::submit()</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Ideally you should reuse command buffers, but generally you can re-record them every frame without a large performance hit, and it makes some things easier (e.g.&nbsp;sending uniform buffers to shaders).</p>
<p>Also, you can submit multiple command buffers to a single queue. One reason why this is useful is that it <em>can</em> allow you to ensure that one set of commands from a command buffer completes execution before another command buffer in the queue starts (more on this later).</p>
<p>Finally, commands recorded in command buffers can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> —&gt; draw, dispatch, clear, copy, query operations etc</li>
<li><strong>State setting</strong> —&gt; bind pipelines / buffers, push constants etc</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong> —&gt; set / wait events, pipeline barriers etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commands perform just one of these tasks, while others do several. A <strong>render pass</strong> is needed to execute certain commands, including drawing.</p>
<h3 id="render-passes">Render Passes</h3>
<p>A render pass consists of one or more <strong>subpasses</strong>, along with several <strong>framebuffers</strong>. Framebuffers represent a series of memory attachments (e.g.&nbsp;color, depth etc) that each subpass can read from and write to.</p>
<p>A command in a subpass might write to a color buffer, which will allow for later subpasses / render passes to read from it. This allows for techniques like deferred rendering.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced-lighting/deferred_g_buffer.png" alt=""><figcaption>Color attachments after initial render pass in deferred rendering (LearnOpenGL)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Deferred rendering is a story for another day, but the gist of it is that you can store most of the geometry information in an initial render pass, and <em>defer</em> expensive rendering operations like lighting for later.</p>
<details>
<summary><b> Example code for recording to a command buffer and render pass </b></summary>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>// Create a command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>vk::CommandBuffer cmd;</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a><span>// Start recording to the command buffer and render pass</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>cmd.begin(vk::CommandBufferBeginInfo());</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo();</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a><span>// Bind a graphics pipeline (covered later)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>cmd.bindPipeline(vk::PipelineBindPoint::eGraphics, graphicsPipeline);</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a><span>// Bind vertex buffers containing info needed to draw vertices</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>cmd.bindVertexBuffers(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, vertexBuffers, offsets);</span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a><span>// Draw the buffer currently bound to this command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>cmd.draw(vertices.size(), <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>);</span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>// Stop recording to the render pass and command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-18"><a href="#cb2-18"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo();</span>
<span id="cb2-19"><a href="#cb2-19"></a>cmd.end();</span></code></pre></div>
</details>
<p>Last thing! Some commands that perform actions (e.g.&nbsp;draw vertices) do so based on the current state (e.g.&nbsp;the currently bound array of vertices) set by commands since the start of the command buffer. This means that in the above code example, <code>cmd.draw()</code> will operate on the current state set by <code>cmd.bindVertex()</code> in the previous line. This “synchronization guarantee”, that one command will finish executing before the next one starts, is usually not true.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>GPUs are optimized for operation throughput, and because of this (with a few exceptions) <strong><em>commands are not executed in the order they were recorded in.</em></strong> The first command that performs an action in a command buffer isn’t guaranteed to finish executing before the last action command in that buffer. The first command buffer submitted to a queue won’t necessarily finish any commands before a later command buffer starts. The same thing applies to command buffers submitted on different queues and multiple subpasses.</p>
<p>At places the Vulkan spec is confusing on this topic, but the TL;DR is that this is true unless a <strong>synchronization object</strong> is used (or with state setting commands within a single command buffer).</p>
<p>There are a few different types of synchronization objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fences</strong> (GPU to CPU sync) —&gt; EX: ensure there are only two rendered frames at a time in the swap chain (i.e.&nbsp;double buffering)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semaphores</strong> (GPU to GPU sync across queues) —&gt; EX: wait for frame to finish rendering before presenting it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barriers</strong> (Sync within a command buffer / pipeline) –&gt; EX: start compute shader execution as soon as the vertex shader is finished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subpass Dependencies</strong> (Sync between subpasses) –&gt; EX: wait for the normal and albedo attachments to complete before starting the lighting rendering subpass.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronization is closely tied to the <strong>graphics pipeline.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A common use case for any software product is the ability to run a certain business logic whenever a particular event gets triggered. This event could occur in the form of a webhook fired by a 3rd party service to your server or it could be generated via your product itself. The point being this event triggers a transaction in your system and the loss of even a single transaction is not acceptable.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This seems straightforward enough when dealing with a low rate of such events, but if your server receives these events at the rate of 200 requests per second and each of these events require significant resources for processing them, it is no longer a trivial thing to do.</p><p>We had a similar requirement while building our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">product</a> which is a tool that helps e-commerce merchants notify their customers when orders are confirmed/shipped via WhatsApp. To implement this we register webhooks to receive order lifecycle events whenever a new e-commerce store signs up with our product.&nbsp;</p><p>This did not seem like a big deal at first until we released that if we acquire even a handful of stores that have a very high volume of orders, the number of webhooks we will receive is going to increase exponentially and if we need the product to scale, we would have to queue up the events and process them asynchronously instead of processing it the moment we receive a webhook.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Expectations from a message queue system</strong><br></p><p>There are 4 primary things that are needed if you want to queue up messages and process them asynchronously.</p><p>‍<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: A dashboard where you can view all the current asynchronous jobs and make sure all of them are running smoothly and there is no clog anywhere.</li><li><strong>Error handling</strong>: The ability to retry failed transactions without having to receive the event again.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Zero loss</strong>: None of the events must be lost and must stay in the queue until they are picked up.</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: If the volume of messages goes up, handling them should be as simple as adding another worker to the pool.</li></ol><p><strong>Available methods for doing this</strong><br></p><p>The above mentioned problem is not something new and has already been solved in many ways. Here are a few that I am aware of.</p><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">AWS SQS</a> as the queue and AWS Lambda as the handler for the jobs in the queue.</li><li><a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Celery</a> is a great framework that solves exactly this and it has compatibility with AWS SQS, Redis and Rabbit MQ.</li><li><a href="https://python-rq.org/" target="_blank">Python-rq</a> with Redis as the queue.</li></ol><p>I immediately ruled out the first method because it would involve too much vendor lock in with AWS and out of the remaining 2 methods, I personally got a little bit spooked by Celerys documentation as it seems a bit overwhelming for my simple use case of being able to deploy worker programs that pick up items from a queue and process them.</p><p>Therefore I decided to <a href="https://python-rq.org/" target="_blank">go with python-rq</a> as it was something I had previously tinkered with, so let's go through each of the expectations that I listed earlier and see if python-rq satisfied all of them.</p><p><strong>Monitoring</strong><br></p><p>To quote one of the lines from the python-rq documentation, “Monitoring is where RQ shines”.&nbsp; You get access to a dashboard where you can view jobs that are currently being processed, pending jobs and failed jobs.</p><figure id="w-node-2f944d69418b-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d0765a977f73edea652de_BbkLnSZEcAQHbsz0e0tZvReFQzpRB1-tVoLDh3cKhIOpqKbD-h7ByCKokqzSMK-KwHnEYlkiQH56Yq4TKg9z5rtKDLO7e4DgCOWWHgn7foxSa_6Lk10DEhBBUsvyG8tnrmcJo8Vl.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>RQ dashboard for viewing status of jobs</figcaption></figure><p>If you do not specify any queue while deploying the service, there is one queue created called “default” and all the jobs you enqueue will go into this queue.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively you can define as many queues as you want, and put jobs into the respective queues based on their priority. All of this is very well documented.</p><p>If you need to monitor some more things like how many jobs are queued at a given time in the form of a time series database or the maximum queued jobs within a given time range, you could export these metrics using <a href="https://github.com/mdawar/rq-exporter" target="_blank">rq_exporter</a> and display them on a <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">grafana</a> dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Error handling</strong><br></p><p>Python-RQ has several ways to retry failed jobs, you could specify a retry count while enqueuing the job itself as mentioned in their documentation.&nbsp;</p><p>You could also specify a time interval between each retry if you don’t want the job to be retried immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly you can also specify different time delays between each retry and achieve a system where if a job fails,&nbsp; you retry after 10 minutes and if it fails again, you could retry after 20 minutes, etc.</p><p>Even if you don’t specify any retry count, there is a default safety net built in where the failed jobs go into a “failed” queue and the same is displayed on the dashboard. You can retry them manually by clicking on “Requeue”.</p><p>You can even see the stack trace of the failed job so that you can make changes to the code if required before retrying the job.</p><figure id="w-node-6b3d732c052e-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d07659bfb9af7bf8dec02_F7KGjCLUhQ6nGEDjK-qpq4jooON2TyQkDBLzi1ova-tz3zSVAgimJ9mIycGnvHcxcCnAUr0Wl5pIHO7OzVEtJLR2D3go52skcan8DTAkYWA05o1AXUmH4ojKFfbT2qXSPBOUUG79.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Failed jobs displayed on RQ dashboard</figcaption></figure><div><p>Python-rq also allows you to define a custom exception handler at the time of starting your workers which you can use to do stuff like sending an alert to yourself over email/slack whenever there is an exception.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Zero loss</strong><br></p><p>When you restart python-rq it does a warm shutdown where new jobs from the queue are no longer accepted and existing jobs will finish running completely before shutting down the service. This ensures that there is no loss in data.</p><p>The producer program which is responsible for enqueuing the jobs must make sure that as soon as an event is received, it is immediately enqueued before running any other logic and this will ensure that there is no loss due to the producer failing to enqueue a job in time.&nbsp;</p><p>Since all the jobs will be saved in the Redis database and Redis has its own methods for prevention of data loss, this pretty much ensures that all your transactions will be executed.</p><p><strong>Scalability</strong><br></p><p>The Beauty of this setup is that if your application scales and you start receiving too many events, the server responsible for enqueuing the events will not face any lag and the only implication of this is that there might be a lag between the time a job is enqueued and the time it is executed.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need to reduce this lag, all you have to do is deploy another RQ worker that listens on the same Redis queue and the tasks will automatically get shared between all the existing workers that are subscribed to that queue. Based on how your traffic scales, you can keep deploying new workers on new instances without having to change anything else.</p><p><strong>Scheduling tasks with python-rq</strong><br></p><p>An added advantage of this infrastructure is that it also takes care of the case where one has to schedule a task to be executed at a later time. There are of course many ways of achieving this including cron jobs, but having this ability within your queuing infrastructure is very handy because all the other aspects like error handling and monitoring automatically get applied to this as well.&nbsp;</p><p>To add job scheduling abilities to python-rq, you would have to install <a href="https://github.com/rq/rq-scheduler" target="_blank">rq-scheduler</a> and run it as a separate service. This service will take care of picking up jobs that are to be executed at a given point in time and enqueue them into the queue that python-rq listens on.</p><p><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></p><p>For our particular use case, we receive close to 200 transactions per second and because they all go straight into a queue, 99% of these requests have a response time of 25 milliseconds or less.</p><figure id="w-node-2247ea7692bf-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d07651bda1c0398075cb6_oDk9wAzBCG3Dmao13tDK-uvkRTWHWk16MZrwMP7IjpnbbKTFElg35xOjtS6KtMfN6epWMPbyH25HySChqv-szF4bu5qGAMeOqxuQyD1Sx3sSwX92G3qdOsR2e09uGv1EnGxSWYW6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Server response time for enqueing jobs</figcaption></figure><p>As for the performance of the workers, we have currently deployed 5 workers and their capacity based on their free time vs busy time looks something like this.</p><figure id="w-node-bd68bbc03805-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d0765b5a619cd968b387a_zlVorXocx5iEHbrrk0QC_84rfs2IvRLyaKmaFUbMYyGXKw6NTApQfqaxkZPRMaMHX19BOo4510pTC4HuaWGpbzhHVnUFsMdV8jk33AQUU6fDdR42Lv-vaI8zHnJwsRWD5l3QiR89.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>RQ&nbsp;worker capacity</figcaption></figure><p>The blue shade represents workers being busy and the rest of the time workers are free.

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">Inflated 3D Convnet (or I3D)</a> is an architecture created by DeepMind researchers to perform human action classification for videos. We will use the I3D model that has been pre-trained on DeepMind’s <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics">Kinetics 400 dataset</a>. That is, given a tensor containing frames of a video, this model will output probabilities that the given video belongs to any one of 400 respective action classes (e.g. “air drumming”, “making tea”, “bench pressing”, etc).</p>
<p>As this is a TensorFlow model, our goal is to convert it to an <code>MLModel</code> that can be consumed natively on Apple platforms. To get started, we’ll open up <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Cr8w_T53bPLHPvLfZteAxHhtjgBS-LH#scrollTo=gTW3l22wUdHD">a new Colab notebook</a> and import <a href="https://github.com/apple/coremltools"><code>coremltools</code></a>, Apple’s Python library for model conversion, editing, and validation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>pip install coremltools<span>==</span><span>4.0</span>b1
<span>import</span> coremltools <span>as</span> ct
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll fetch the <code>kinetics-i3d</code> repo and run the included sample evaluation script which loads the pre-rained RGB video classification model, performs an inference on a sample video (so we know that it’s working), and then exports the frozen TensorFlow model as <code>frozen_model.pb</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>git clone https:<span>/</span><span>/</span>github<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>lukereichold<span>/</span>kinetics<span>-</span>i3d
<span>%</span>cd kinetics<span>-</span>i3d<span>/</span>

<span>!</span>python evaluate_sample<span>.</span>py <span>-</span><span>-</span>eval_type rgb
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll grab the class labels from the repo, where each of the 400 strings corresponds to a potential action in a video.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>with</span> open(<span></span><span>"</span><span>data/label_map.txt</span><span>"</span>) <span>as</span> f:
  class_labels <span>=</span> f<span>.</span>read()<span>.</span>splitlines()

  <span>assert</span> len(class_labels) <span>==</span> <span>400</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="-converting-the-frozen-model-to-core-ml">📲 Converting the frozen model to Core ML</h2>
<p>Finally, we’ll use the <code>coremltools</code> package to convert our frozen TensorFlow model to an <code>mlmodel</code> that can be directly consumed by iOS and macOS applications.</p>
<p>The model expects a tensor of shape <code>(1, NUM_FRAMES, 224, 224, 3)</code>, that is, an array of RGB frames, each of size 224 x 224 and – according to the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">model’s original specification</a> — pixel values rescaled to between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>We’d like to make the number of frames dynamic, so that our model works for any video containing between, say, 25 and 300 frames. Therefore, we create a <code>TensorType</code> with a flexible shape that will be passed into the converter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">range_input <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>TensorType(shape<span>=</span>(<span>1</span>, ct<span>.</span>RangeDim(lower_bound<span>=</span><span>25</span>, upper_bound<span>=</span><span>300</span>, default<span>=</span><span>250</span>), <span>224</span>, <span>224</span>, <span>3</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Also, to make using our classifier model easier to consume, we tell the model about our explicit class labels so that these are explicitly visible within Xcode.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">config <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>ClassifierConfig(class_labels)

<span># This is where the magic happens:</span>
mlmodel <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>convert(<span></span><span>"</span><span>kinetics-i3d/frozen_model.pb</span><span>"</span>, source<span>=</span><span></span><span>'</span><span>tensorflow</span><span>'</span>, classifier_config<span>=</span>config, inputs<span>=</span>[range_input])
</code></pre></div><p>We can also choose to add additional metadata to our model:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Optionally, add metadata to be visible in Xcode.</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>license <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Apache-2.0 License</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>author <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Google Inc.</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>version <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>1.0</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>short_description <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Convolutional neural network performing human action recognition on video data, trained on the Kinetics 400 dataset.</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>🎉 With the conversion successfully performed, we’ll save our new <code>mlmodel</code> to disk! It’s now ready to be imported into an Xcode project.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">mlmodel<span>.</span>save(<span></span><span>'</span><span>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><figure>

<h2 id="-consuming-the-model-with-visualactionkit">📦 Consuming the model with VisualActionKit</h2>
<p>As of Swift 5.3, we’re now able to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/bundling_resources_with_a_swift_package">bundle resources with a Swift package</a>, so <a href="https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit"><code>VisualActionKit</code></a> was created to leverage this new functionality by effectively acting as a convenience wrapper around our <code>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</code>. It offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepts an <code>AVAsset</code> as input</li>
<li>Pre-processes the asset’s data into a format the model expects, including resizing each frame of the video to 224 x 224 pixels using the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">custom resizing strategy outlined in original I3D model repo</a>.</li>
<li>Builds an <code>MLMultiArray</code> tensor containing the asset data</li>
<li>Feeds the input tensor into our model and asynchronously returns the resulting predictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install this package for use in our own apps, we add the following to our app’s <code>Package.swift</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>let</span> package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: <span>"</span><span>https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit.git</span><span>"</span>, from: <span>"</span><span>0.1.0</span><span>"</span>)
    ],
    ...
)
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we can perform action classifications on any provided videos, regardless of the source or input format! Here’s some example usage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>import</span> <span>VisualActionKit</span>

<span>let</span> url = Bundle.module.url(forResource: <span>"</span><span>writing</span><span>"</span>, withExtension: <span>"</span><span>mp4</span><span>"</span>)
<span>let</span> asset = AVAsset(url: url)

<span>try</span> Classifier.shared.classify(asset) { predictions <span>in</span>
    print(predictions)
    <span>//</span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>l</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>s</span><span>L</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>e</span><span>l</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>w</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>i</span><span>n</span><span>g</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>p</span><span>r</span><span>o</span><span>b</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>i</span><span>l</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>y</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9</span><span>9</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>8</span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>3</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>1</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Outside of this specific action classification model, we can use these same steps to convert any arbitrary pre-trained model</strong> to run on Apple platforms by using <code>coremltools v4</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, different than what we did here, if we were interested in <em>training our own action classifier from scratch</em> – without touching any Python or model conversion code – we also have ability to do so now. For more info, I recommend checking out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10043/">2020 WWDC session covering Create ML</a>. Until next time!</p>

																				<p>HANOI: Vietnam has detected its first locally transmitted case of coronavirus in nearly 100 days, authorities said on Saturday, in a country whose swift and full lockdown won praise for controlling the spread of the disease.</p><p>“Patient 416” is a 57-year-old retired Vietnamese man in the southern city of Danang, and the first case of community transmission since April 16.</p>
<p>Local health officials have tested 105 people who had been in close contact with him, the Ministry of Health said.</p>
<p>The man had taken his mother to a hospital in the days before after showing symptoms of the sickness, authorities said, but gave no confirmation of how he was infected in a country where the virus appeared to have been stamped out for several months.</p>
<p>Vietnam has not recorded a single death from Covid-19.</p>
<p>“The patient is currently on ventilator support due to respiratory failure,” the ministry said, adding that his family believe his contacts with others were limited.</p>
<p>“He didn’t go out of the city and only stayed at home to look after his grandchild and interact with neighbours, he didn’t make contact with strangers,” it said.</p>
<p>Danang has been packed with local tourists returning to its beaches and restaurants since Vietnam lifted its lockdown.</p>
<p>Despite sharing a long, ungovernable border with China, Vietnam has recorded just 416 virus cases, including the latest from Danang.</p>
<p>Communist authorities were quick to lock down the country after the virus emerged in China, with a rigorous state quarantine and contact-tracing system put in place.</p>
<p>International flights remain strictly limited with a two-week mandatory quarantine laid out for visitors.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the tough response to the virus will help the economy as foreign investment and local consumer confidence bounces back.</p>									</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  Years ago, a colleague of mine read an article on Google's bitpacking algorithm for storing indexes and an idea was
  born to create a standalone text index and search solution (similar to Apache Lucene). This idea was brought to life
  in a C++ application called <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/zsearch">Zsearch</a>. In hindsight it was a little
  bit ahead of its time as a few years later we saw the emergence of a more powerful Elasticsearch that did all that
  Zsearch could do + a lot more. Anyways, this is a story of how we hunted down a memory leak in our application.
</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
    <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
  </a></p><p>
    Can you find the leak?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The idea behind Zsearch was to see how big of an index we could fit into ram with the data being stored in a key/value
  database, which in our implementation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB">leveldb</a>. Since RAM was a
  precious commodity back in the day, we really wanted to find the right balance between keeping all of our data
  structures in RAM vs. leveldb. During our initial load testing on a linux box, we found a linear memory growth and
  therefore suspected a memory leak. We then tried to find a memory leak using the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>running a load test in a function and calling the function multiple times to test memory usage</li>
  <li>logging in destructors to check whether objects were being deallocated</li>
  <li>debugging the application using valgrind</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unfortunately for us, there were no memory leaks detected and eventually when testing on a mac, we found that memory
  stabilized at the expected peak. We therefore concluded that it was just the linux memory allocator that was acting
  weird. In reality, the memory allocator was doing what it was supposed to do but it did give us a good lead regarding
  how some of the C++ standard library was implemented. It turns out that one of our threads was making copies of an stl
  Map, which is ridiculously inefficient and something that we ended up reworking to keep our memory consumption on
  point :).

<![CDATA[The Four Noble Truths in Buddhism]]>

July 25, 2020 | https://mindfulnessquest.com/four-noble-truths-buddhism/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mindfulnessquest.com/four-noble-truths-buddhism/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
<p>The four noble truths in Buddhism forms the core of the Buddha’s teachings. These are explained in the very first sermon delivered by Buddha, known as&nbsp;<em>dhammacakkappavattana sutta</em>, which in English loosely translates to, “Settings the wheel of dhamma or the truth in motion.”</p>



<p>Understanding <strong>the four noble truths</strong> is a vast subject that needs a detailed and thorough explanation, and it’s impossible to cover it in a single blog post. However, the information I present here will serve as an introductory text for those who wish to understand Buddha’s teachings.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p>



<p>What differentiates Buddha’s teachings from others is that he mentions that his teachings should be understood through direct experience rather than simply believing what he says.</p>



<p>The experiences that he talks about can be verified through different mindfulness practices and meditations. These find mention in the texts (<em>suttas</em>) and practiced by a lot of people all across the world.</p>



<p>Four noble truths form the foundation of a deep-rooted philosophy that can be applied to daily practical life. The primary focus of his teachings is on the&nbsp;<em>here and now</em>. Although these teaching were delivered sometime around 500 BCE, they have stood the test of time and are still applicable today.</p>



<p>At first glance, you may find Buddhism to be very pessimistic, as it starts with the concept of dukkha or suffering. Dukkha is a word of the Pali language, which is a combination of two words:&nbsp;<em>du</em>&nbsp;means “hard,” and&nbsp;<em>kkha</em>&nbsp;means “to endure.”<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p>



<p>Translation of dukkha in English, referred to as the suffering, is a gross oversimplification of the term. Unfortunately, there is no direct equivalent in the English language. It has a much deeper meaning, which we shall explore next.</p>




<h2><span id="The_First_Noble_Truth_There_is_Suffering_or_Dukkha"></span>The First Noble Truth: There is Suffering or Dukkha<span></span></h2>



<p>The word dukkha is much more subtle than the English word suffering. It constitutes injury, sickness, old age, mental pain, death, sorrow, grief, anguish, and more. It further includes minor frustrations such as disappointments, dissatisfactions, and irritations encountered in daily life.</p>



<p>It also includes even the most subtle sources of stress like:</p>



<ul><li>Having to work for longer hours than usual occasionally.</li><li>Not being appropriately apricated for the efforts put into a piece of work.</li><li>Not being correctly greeted by a friend or a colleague at work.</li><li>Having to give more than you receive in a relationship.</li><li>Being rudely spoken to in a demeaning tone.</li><li>Being made fun of in a covert manner.</li><li>Getting irritated standing and waiting in a queue for a cup of coffee.</li><li>Frustration when the server at the coffee shop hands you a latte instead of the cappuccino you asked.</li></ul>



<p>I can go on and on, but you get the idea. All of this is dukkha. Now you may argue that this is just a normal part of daily living. How can you call it dukkha or suffering? It happens to all of us, and it’s normal, right?</p>



<p>You may argue that the real dukkha is passing away of a loved one, or losing a job overnight, or losing all of your income because of the collapse of the economy, or getting a divorce. These are more pressing matters. And yes! You’re right. All of the above are dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>



<p>But here’s what most people don’t understand. The minor frustrations and dissatisfaction that we encounter in our daily lives have a cumulative adverse effect on our psyche. It grows very slowly in a subtle manner.</p>



<p>While the death of a loved one hurts a lot initially, the wounds heal with time. The created void may never go, but eventually, much of it is filled up with time. However, the subtle injuries caused to our psyche go undetected in many of the cases.</p>



<p>Over time, these frustrations get accumulated to such an extent that one resorts to ending one’s life to escape the pain. The problem is that we have normalized ailments like stress, anxiety, and depression, as a part of daily life.</p>



<p>For example, you might argue that losing a job is much worse than being rudely spoken too. Now, this would depend on your personality. </p>



<p>But in general, I have observed that people soon forget about the hardships they face during the times of unemployment. But even after years, they still remember the incident where they were ill-treated or rudely spoken too.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p>



<p>Once you get a new job, you forget about the pain of losing your old job. But the incidents of offensive and demeaning behaviors go directly into your subconscious. </p>



<p>These get accumulated over time and create great mental suffering, and sometimes even manifest as a disease in the physical body.</p>



<p>Again, you may argue that one cannot escape these unpleasantries of life. And yes! You are right again. But the question is – How much do you intend to suffer these unpleasantries? What we call as ups and downs of life are merely just events. There’s nothing good or bad about them.</p>



<p>Yet we suffer! And still, continue to suffer.</p>



<p>Buddha explains that there are three kinds of dukkhas:</p>



<ol><li>The first is simple to understand suffering, like sickness, injury, old age, death, grief, despair, sorrow, etc. It includes both physical and mental pain. We have already covered this kind of suffering above.</li><li>There is a second kind of suffering that is caused by change. Everything is subject to change and finally comes to an end. There is no such thing as a permanency. However, the mind craves for permanency, and therefore, the suffering arises. For example, expecting secure attachments in relationships, friendships, work, etc.,  results in unhappiness.</li><li>Finally, the third kind of suffering buddha talks about is suffering due to the conditioned states. The word used for this suffering is “<em>Sankara.”</em>&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no parallel English word that can describe it. There are five conditioned states, also known as the five aggregates, or&nbsp;<em>skandhas</em>, where one is physical, and the other four are mental.</li></ol>



<p>Now here’s something to think. If you notice carefully, there’s a contradiction between the statement of the first noble truth and the fourth noble truth.</p>



<p>The first noble truth says that all in this world is suffering, while the fourth noble truth says that there is a way out of it. How can both of these statements be true?</p>



<p>You see, the statement of the first noble truth is not an absolute, because the dukkha is born out of ignorance or&nbsp;<em>avidya</em>. Hence, one perceives this world as dukkha. The understanding of the fourth noble truth enables us to experience the world as it is.</p>



<p>Now that we know what dukkha is let’s get to the next section: the origin of suffering.</p>



<h2><span id="The_Second_Noble_Truth_%E2%80%93_The_Origin_of_Suffering"></span>The Second Noble Truth – The Origin of Suffering<span></span></h2>



<p>The origin of suffering is attachment (or L<em>obha</em>) to three kinds of cravings, also known as Tanha (or Trishna in Sanskrit).</p>



<h3><span id="The_Kama_Tanha_Craving_for_Sensory_Pleasures"></span>The Kama Tanha: Craving for Sensory Pleasures<span></span></h3>



<p>This kind of craving or thirst comes with the attachment to sensory pleasures. We always seek things that excite our senses. For example, we get exciting seeing a nice car, and a strong desire to acquire it arises from within. In Buddhism, this is the beginning of dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p>



<p>Anything that satisfies the craving of the five senses: vision, smell, hearing, taste, and touch – is Kama Tanha. The main reason behind this is that these cravings only give temporary satisfaction.</p>



<p>The moment you set your attention to sensory pleasure objects, that very moment marks the beginning of suffering. The problem with this kind of craving is that it is insatiable. The more you have, the more you want.</p>



<p>Another example would be eating your favorite food or dessert. Even after you’ve finished eating, you crave more. For some, this craving comes back after a day or two, while for others, it comes back instantly.</p>



<p>However, the past conditioning of the mind is so intense that we do not see anything wrong with it. A few minutes of compulsive behavior now and then, generally speaking, creates long term health consequences.</p>



<h3><span id="The_Bhava_Tanha_Sense_of_Wanting_To_Become_Something"></span>The Bhava Tanha: Sense of Wanting To Become Something<span></span></h3>



<p>Bhava Tanha is the desire to achieve permanence in some way. One example would be the desire to continue in the heavenly realms as consciousness after death. In this case, the attachment to life and existence is so high that the very thought of not existing after death scares people.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p>



<p>Similarly, becoming a monk with the desire to attain enlightenment is also Bhava Tanha. Practicing meditation, chanting, reciting mantras, performing rituals in the desire to achieve the&nbsp;<em>nirvana</em>&nbsp;(the freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth) is again Bhava Tanha.</p>



<p>It is easy to misunderstand this Tanha. For example, when I started my spiritual practice a couple of years ago, I found myself falling into this trap. </p>



<p>As I read more into the philosophical aspects of these scriptures, I was so impressed that I immediately started giving sermons to the people around me, even when they didn’t ask for it.</p>



<p>I had built such strong identifications with these philosophical ideas that I used to get upset when people showed disinterest. </p>



<p>But my thirst for being the “most knowledgeable” and “all-knowing” had blinded me. I was always keeping a check on how other people perceived me. And I didn’t like it when people disagreed with my ideas.</p>



<p>What I realized was that I had fallen into the same worldly trap once again. I was indirectly seeking recognition as a spiritual teacher. The desire to be known as the great teacher was deluding me. This desire for being recognized and praised is also Bhava Tanha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-narrow-sky-1"></span></p>



<h3><span id="The_Vibhava_Tanha_Desire_To_Get_Rid_of_Things"></span>The Vibhava Tanha: Desire To Get Rid of Things<span></span></h3>



<p>There is another type of Tanha that is the exact opposite of Bhava Tanha. It is known as Vibhava Tanha, that is the desire to get rid of things.</p>



<p>This craving generally happens when we fail in our endeavors, such as building a profitable business or attaining spiritual enlightenment. We quickly get disillusioned by the present circumstances and become opposed to it, believing it to be the root cause of our suffering.</p>



<p>Therefore, we create a desire to get rid of things that leads to …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Nadav, pictured left, with his dev team celebrating an FC Barcelona win in Barcelona on the Axonius company retreat.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>**Name Redacted**, Captain Nadav Lev, and **Name Redacted**</figcaption></figure>







<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

When programming for full operating
systems, like any desktop, mobile, or higher-end embedded platforms, the answer is easy—threads.
They're built into the OS, and you typically <em>have</em> to use them to take advantage of features like
multiple CPU cores. Or, when programming for an embedded target, you may reach for a lightweight
<abbr title="Real-Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> like <a href="https://freertos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FreeRTOS</a>, which gives you full threads without much work.</p>
<p>But what if you have a 16MHz microcontroller with 2 KB of RAM?</p>
<p>The Arduino Uno is known for being ubiquitous, cheap, and easy to program. Although there are more
and more reasons to use competing products, such as the various ARM Cortex-M and Espressif boards
(which I use almost exclusively), the Microchip (formerly Atmel) ATMega series is sometimes still
preferred for low power applications, cutting cents off a <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BOM</abbr>, and its widespread support.</p>
<p>Typically, one checks in a loop repeatedly to see if the task is ready to activate. This can be
checking if there's data in a serial buffer, if a certain time period has passed, or a <abbr title="General-Purpose Input/Output">GPIO</abbr> pin has
toggled. However, I'm going to present an alternative to doing this—<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Many modern languages are implementing <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. C# was one of the first big languages to do
it, and then Python, JavaScript, Dart, Kotlin quickly followed. The big difference between threads
and <code>async</code> functions is that <code>async</code>hronous code is handled by the program itself, usually
cooperatively, while synchronous operations on threads rely on the OS to do it. The first obvious
reason for it, then, is when threads aren't available—just like what we're about to get into soon.
However, asynchronous code is typically faster than synchronous code because it is able to avoid the
overhead of spawning threads and context switches, as well as the memory overhead, as the amount of
space needed on the stack can be calculated ahead of time.</p>
<p>Internally, the compiler turns the code into a state machine, typically using the language's
generators feature if it has one. Here, every time you write <code>.await</code> and the data is not available
immediately, the compiler inserts a <code>return</code> statement, and adds a parameter that allows you to jump
right back to where it was. Rust uses <code>Pin</code>ning, where it is guaranteed that the generated struct
that holds the stack will always be in the same place in memory at all times. This avoids a problem
where a pointer is taken to a local variable, the function returns and comes back, and is suddenly
pointing to something completely different.</p>

<p>C++20 has similar features to Rust's <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with the <code>co_await</code> keyword, although the
<a href="https://blog.panicsoftware.com/co_awaiting-coroutines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available documentation</a> is <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/04_executor.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not quite as good as Rust's</a>.
However, there's a total of... <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/search?q=%22co_await%22&amp;tab=forum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1 search result</a> on the Arduino forums, <em>and</em> it's
in German with no code. And even if there <em>was</em> code, it would be largely unaccessable as Arduino
ships with an old compiler:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/*/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>GCC<span>)</span> <span>7.3</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2017</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>GCC 7.3.0 ships with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">"almost full support"</a> for C++17 (although not by default), but a
total of 0 C++20 additions. And if you're on PlatformIO, you'll have even less luck:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-atmelavr/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.6.2_1759<span>)</span> <span>5.4</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2015</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Rust has been able to compile <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> code for <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">almost a year now on the <em>stable
compiler build</em></a>. There's been steadily increasing interest in using these
features on embedded platforms with Rust, and many projects have been using it as a result.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-asyncawait">Pseudo-<code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h2>
<p>These libraries actually implement a <em>very</em> similar thing to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with a state machine,
and jumping to different positions in code based on where it's already been. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AceRoutine</a> has a macro, <code>COROUTINE</code>, that internally converts the function into a state machine
that jumps to different places using <code>goto</code>. This is actually almost identical to how tools like
Babel in the JavaScript world convert <code>async</code> functions to traditional functions that can be used
with old browsers.</p>
<p>However, there are a few very critical problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local variables are not preserved across yields</strong>.</li>
<li>You can't use certain statements in some libraries (not AceRoutine), such as <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>Destructors don't run properly, and will <strong><code>free</code> uninitialized memory</strong> if not done correctly
(due to the first point).</li>
<li>Tasks can't return values.</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are because simple preprocessor macros, which is the only option in C/C++, are
only "glorified copy-paste", and have no real computing power. Although <code>async</code> is built into the
Rust compiler, it wasn't before, and a (less-than-ideal, but still usable) macro could implement
most of the feature itself. Hopefully, new C++20 features will lead to more use in the embedded
world.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It looks like there's a few packages (known as "crates" in the Rust world) to interface with the
hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a>, which only supports the Arduino Uno</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-device</a>, which provides low-level hardware control</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>, which provides higher-level board and <abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr> support, and depends on avr-device</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a> is by the avr-rust team that worked on getting Rust working on AVR, I ultimately
decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports many more boards, and has a structure that allows it to expand further</li>
<li>
<p>It supports <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a>, which allows us to share code between boards: for example, the
<a href="https://docs.rs/apa102-spi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>apa102_spi</code></a> crate will let us control APA102 LED strips on an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi
running Linux, using the exact same code!</p>
<ul>
<li>embedded-hal also has a bigger focus on nonblocking operations, which is exactly what we're
looking for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has a cleaner and safer API</li>
</ul>
<p>To set that up:</p>
<p><strong>(Update 2020-07-26)</strong>: this is much simpler now with the latest nightly. All that is required:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>rustup <span>install</span> nightly
rustup +nightly component <span>add</span> rust-src</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="compiling-and-running">Compiling and Running</h2>
<p>We can compile by running</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>cargo +nightly build -Z build-std<span>=</span>core --release --target avr-atmega328p.json

cargo +nightly build --release</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, to upload it to a device, assuming that you have <code>avrdude</code> installed, run:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>avrdude -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the upload path (<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf</code>) to meet what you want
to upload.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-only-have-the-arduino-ide-installed">If you only have the Arduino IDE installed</h2>
<p>Enable "Show verbose output during: upload" in the Arduino IDE. Observe the build logs for an
<code>avrdude</code> command—it should look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:/tmp/arduino_build_721874/Blink.ino.hex:i</code></pre></div>
<p>Copy that command, but delete everything after <code>-Uflash:w:</code>. Then, without spaces, add the path to
your binary. This will typically be <code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf</code>, or
<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/example_name.elf</code>. Finally, add <code>:e</code>. Your final command
will probably look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="what-about-converting-to-hex-first">What about converting to hex first?</h3>
<p>Arduino typically converts the compiled binary to raw hex, and many AVR-Rust projects have
<a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/bfc5dfe67107a68b4a673e54532354af126cb3ba/mkhex.sh#L32" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">followed that pattern</a>. However, there's generally no need to do that, as <code>avrdude</code>
has the ability to upload ELF binaries directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="onto-async-operations">Onto <code>async</code> operations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a> is implemented in such a way that asynchronous operations is
quite easy. When you attempt to read or write a value, you can get three results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WouldBlock</code>: I can't complete this operation right now.</li>
<li><code>Ok</code>: The operation succeeded. If reading something, this gives you the read value.</li>
<li><code>Err</code>: An error occurred while performing this operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This maps very nicely to Rust's <code>Future</code> trait, which is used to implement asynchronous code. For
example, reading from a serial port is implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>poll_read</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>:</span> Pin<span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>

        <span>match</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>byte<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>*</span>ptr <span>=</span> byte<span>;</span>
                Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span>WouldBlock<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span>Pending<span>,</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span><span>Other</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although there's a bit of weirdness in terms of checking if the buffer is big enough, for the most
part, this works pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="why-do-i-always-return-1-byte-read">Why do I always return 1 byte read?</h3>
<p>I'm mostly mirroring the <code>AsyncRead</code> and <code>AsyncWrite</code> in the <code>futures</code> crate, which typically is
used on machines with full operating systems. Typically, the overhead of a syscall is somewhat
high, so you might request e.g. 1024 bytes at a time. Obviously, that isn't the case for an 8-bit
<abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr>. However, I'm keeping that pattern for ease of porting and to allow for networking, e.g. the
Arduino Ethernet shield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I copied and pasted the <code>AsyncReadExt</code> and <code>AsyncWriteExt</code> traits from the <code>futures</code> crate as
well. The way this is set up is that you just implement the low-level functions, and the <code>Ext</code>
traits take care of the more user-friendly functions. This is done instead of default
implementations to allow the main trait to be small in case it is added to the standard library,
much like how <code>Future</code> is in <code>std</code>/…</p></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190503172035/https://www.augur.io/">Augur</a> (2013-2017) was a commercial browser fingerprinting service, offered primarily to AdTech companies.  In this post I will analyze their tracking script and describe how it works and what information it collects.  The original copy of the script (<a href="https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>) is no longer up; however, the Internet Archive still has a copy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deobfuscating">Deobfuscating</h2>
<p>A first glance at the script shows a bunch of seemingly random characters (including emojis).  The was a hint to me that they were probably passing a big string into some deobfuscation function and <code>eval</code>ing it.  Passing the script through <a href="https://beautifier.io/">beautifier.io</a> shows exactly that.  The deobfuscation function has the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        ...
        if (!''.replace(_(12), String)) {
            var z = {};
            for (i = 0; i &lt; 686; i++) {
                var y = x(i);
                z[y] = r[i] || y
            }
            t = _(15);
            y = function(a) {
                return z[a] || a
            };
            o = o.replace(t, y)
        } else {
            for (j = a[a.length - 1] - 1; j &gt;= 0; j--) {
                (r[j]) ? o = o.replace(new RegExp('\b' + (j &lt; 63 ? c.charAt(j) : c.charAt((j - 63) / 63) + c.charAt((j - 63) % 63)) + '\b', '\x67'), r[j]): 0
            }
        }
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the deobfuscated output, we can just copy the return statement but replace <code>return</code> with <code>console.log</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        console.log(o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\""));
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can just run the script in our browsers developer console and copy-paste the large output. The deobfuscated version can be found at <a href="https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu">https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprinted-attributes">Fingerprinted Attributes</h2>
<p>We will now look at the attributes collected by the script.</p>

* Font detection - Getting the width/height of the browser "fallback" (default) serif, sans-serif, and monospaces fonts, then measuring the width of a bunch of fonts (Augur's list has over 800) and seeing if there is any differences between the tested font and the defaults

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was shocked to find that Augur was silently collecting user’s Facebook information and all emails put in forms.  Apparently, this has been reported on <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/">before</a>.  Otherwise, their fingerprinting was pretty comprehensive, but did not really feature any innovative or novel techniques.</p>

		<p>Do you want to learn how to utterly destroy SJWs in an argument? How about those fascist, right-wing Nazis?</p>
<p>Well, you’ll have to figure out how to do that on your own.</p>
<p>But if you’re one of those buzzkills who wants to give your argumentative opponent a fair shake, the philosopher Daniel Dennett has some advice. In his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intuition-Pumps-Other-Tools-Thinking/dp/0393348784/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><i>Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking</i></a>, he provides four simple rules (adopted from those crafted by the game theorist Anatol Rapoport) for criticizing the views of those with whom you disagree:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, ‘Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.’</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should mention anything you have learned from your target.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An immediate effect of taking such an approach, Dennett says, is that your opponents “will be a receptive audience for your criticism: you have already shown that you understand their positions as well as they do (you agree with them on some important matters and have even been persuaded by something they said).”</p>
<p>Dennett admits that not all opponents are worthy of such respectful treatment, but when they are it pays off to be as charitable as possible. “It is worth reminding yourself,” he says, “that a heroic attempt to find a defensible interpretation of an author, if it comes up empty, can be even more devastating than an angry hatchet job. I recommend it.”</p>
<p>And so do I.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>From time to time newly graduated hackers ask me: <em>“Do you have any advice for beginning my career?”</em></p><p>I’ve found myself repeating 3 principles over and over again. On reflection, I realized these principles apply more broadly. I <em>think</em> they might answer the question <em>“Do you have any advice on for beginning my life as an adult?”</em></p><p>I thought I’d share these ideas with you here. The style and the examples I wrote are career-oriented, but I think the core ideas will still help in your decision making. I hope you enjoy them : ).</p><p><em>What should you do?</em> is one of the hardest questions to answer when you start out.</p><p>The default path is to follow what’s popular or prestigious. That can lead to a bunch of problems: What’s prestigious is already highly competitive. When you compete with smart people in a game that has established rules, just keeping up will take most of your time. That leaves little time to explore what interests you. When you don’t explore what interests you, you won’t understand things as deeply, and that leaves you with an undifferentiated skillset.</p><p><strong>The solution here is to follow your taste.</strong> Popularity and prestige are lagging indicators. Your taste, especially as a young, curious person, is a signal for <em>what will be</em> popular in the future. Regardless though, when you follow you taste, you’ll find yourself much more interested in the problems you’re solving. When you’re interested in the problems you’re solving, you’ll discover deeper truths, build deeper expertise, a differentiated skillset, and have more fun along the way.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering: <strong>What if you don’t even know what you’re interested in?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. You just need to tune into and strengthen your taste. To do that, just do <em>anything</em>. Once you do <em>anything</em>, ask yourself, what part of that thing do you  find interesting?</p><p>Start going deeper there, and all of a sudden, you’ll discover a wealth of interests.</p><p>Next up, you may be wondering: <strong>What if your interests keep changing?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. Just follow it. You’ll be surprised how things will serve you down the road. As long as you’re working hard and you’re learning, it’s a good use of time.</p><p>You may also wonder: <strong>What if your interests <em>are</em> what’s popular and prestigious today?</strong></p><p>That’s great. Follow that, but instead of competing, start sensing what actually interests you in that field and go deeper.</p><p>The ideas may seem career oriented, so you may be wondering: <strong>What if I just want to travel and explore the world?</strong></p><p>That’s great too! It’s your taste, telling you that you want to travel. Follow it and see where it leads you.</p><p>As you discover your interests, you may find that they’re not necessarily popular. Yet, when you go deeper and do your thing, something magical will happen…which leads us into the second principle:</p><p>As you explore and follow your taste, you’ll discover a subset of people who share your core interests and values.</p><p>Nurture those relationships. Some of these people will be your friends for life. Many of those people will become very successful in the future.</p><p>The people you know will show you what’s possible and work alongside you in deepening, exploring, and innovating on your shared interests.</p><p>You may be wondering: <em>what if you live in the middle of nowhere, and there aren’t people who get you?</em> Do your best to go to the center of wherever your community is. That may be SF for hackers or Los Angeles for entertainers or Paris for artists, the list goes on. You know where it is for you.</p><p>Now, this may sound impractical to you, but you’ll be surprised with what you can do. You can start off online in the meantime.</p><p>One common pitfall here is <em>focusing only on successful people in your field.</em> This misses the point. Sure, reach out to those successful people, but remember that the young, curious, interested people right next you, <em>will become those successful people in the future.</em> You have tons of time to spend together, so it’s great way to deepen your relationships. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t reach out to successful people (you definitely should), but to remove “success” as a criteria altogether for choosing who you spend your time with.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering, <em>how do you deepen those relationships?</em> That leads to us to the third principle:</p><p>As you form your community, new ideas and ways to collaborate will spring up. Take those opportunities: work together, support each-other and play. Over time, which you have a lot of right now, you will form a tight tribe of friends.</p><p>As a happy side effect, you’ll become exposed to new fields, new technologies, interesting problems, and interesting opportunities. Start taking them, and you’re well on your way to a career that’s <em>made for you.</em></p><p>One common issue here is a lack of self belief. This may lead you into choosing what you think “you are capable of”, rather than what you’re interested in. One way to get around this is to just experiment: let yourself dream and work with your friends, even if the problems seem fantastically hard.</p><p>There are a lot of examples I can give you if you’re interested in what I’m interesting in: From <a href="https://m.stopa.io/my-favorite-books-11e6b5a3ac0a" target="_blank">my favorite books</a> to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essays</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910" target="_blank">Norvig’s Paradgims of AI programming</a>, to <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a>. But, instead I encourage you to think: <em>what interests you right now?</em></p><p>If you’re up for it, I’d love to know your answer: <strong><em>what interests you right now?</em></strong> Feel free to leave your answer in the comments or to email me directly, I’d be curious to hear : )</p><p>There’s a slew of people who have influenced and mentored me. These ideas are just as much them as me.</p><p>On the idea of taste specifically, the big shoutout has to go to Paul Graham. A lot of my thinking about this was inspired by reading his essays over and over when I started out. I highly suggest reading them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Talha Baig, Martin Raison, Irakli Safareli, David Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Julien Odent, for reviewing this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imposter syndrome has been something I've dealt with my whole life. And it seems to follow me, no matter what position I'm in or where I go.</p><p>In middle school, I was in awe of high schoolers and how much they seemed to know. When I became a high school student, I was intimidated by college students who had started to creep their way into the working world. Now, as a college student in that position, I feel like an imposter around students with impressive resumes, including those who interviewed me to join different student organizations.</p><p>It was after joining one of those organizations that I started to see how wrong my perceptions were. These students weren't superhuman figures, they were just kids with hobbies, interests, and really cool personalities.</p><p>At that point, I'd realized the fact that's helped me get through future instances of imposter syndrome: <em>everyone's a human being, just like you and I.</em></p><p>That includes Jeff Bezos, your job interviewer, your high school teacher, your mentor. They're all humans, who've probably gone through the same experiences you have. At some point, your job interviewer was the interviewee. They know your heart's racing, that there are thick beads of sweat building up around your temple, that your brain is just 70% in the game —&nbsp;because they've been there.</p><p>This lesson has helped me in so many places. At work, I'm constantly confused with our massive codebase. Asking questions was a pretty scary thing, especially at the beginning. I didn't want to seem like I didn't know what I was doing, or that I wasn't capable. Plowing through the unknown headfirst didn't work so well for me —&nbsp;I later found out that those confusing things I'd spent 3 hours on could be answered in a minute from someone who knew better. And there was never any judgement, because they'd been there themselves.</p><p>So don't sweat things too much. There's no need to put others on a pedestal. Just see them as another person, not too different from yourself, in a position you want to get to. Reach and ask for help; chances are, they'd be happy to.</p></div><div><div><p><a href="https://roland.imprint.to/">Roland's Blog</a></p><p>My thoughts, stories, and ideas</p></div></div></div>]]>

What is Nintendo playing at?

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNtacp8-GoI" width="320" youtube-src-id="kNtacp8-GoI"></iframe></p><p>Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</h3><p>Nintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example. If Phil Spencer and co show off a lot of gameplay for <i>Halo: Infinite</i> and other first party games, this could turn out to be an incredible event.&nbsp; Microsoft's Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart is supposedly going to be unveiled in August, adding even more impetus.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Sony released more information to combat the impact of Microsoft's event, perhaps even the price and launch date.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can Nintendo do to get the buzz going again?</h3><div><ul><li>Mario games in celebration of the 35th anniversary.</li><li>Announce <i>Breath of the Wild 2</i>.</li><li>Nintendo 64 games coming to the Switch.</li><li>New [insert old IP] here - imagine the reaction if a new <i>Wave Race</i> or <i>F-Zero </i>was announced?</li><li>Announce a Game Boy Classic.</li><li>Announce<i> GoldenEye 007</i> coming to the Switch.</li><li>Say "<a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/what-next-for-nintendo.html" target="_blank">Switch Pro</a> - coming 2021"</li></ul><p>What about Todd Howard showing a video of him playing <i>Fallout 3</i> (or 4) on the Switch? That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think? Is Nintendo on the right track or should it do more to get everyone talking about the Switch and their games?</p><h2>If you liked reading this post, please check out some of my others</h2>

July 25, 2020 | https://django-hordak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accounting-for-developers.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://django-hordak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accounting-for-developers.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">
           <div itemprop="articleBody">
            
  <div id="double-entry-accounting-for-developers">

<p>Hordak is inherently aimed at software developers as it provides core
functionality only. Friendly interfaces can certainly be built on top of it, but
if you are here there is a good chance you are a developer.</p>
<p>If you are learning about accounting as developer you may feel – as I did – that
most of the material available doesn’t quite relate to the developer/STEM mindset. I
therefore provide some resources here that may be of use.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23964513">Hacker News discussion</a>, some of what follows may be either incorrect
or abhorrent to those with a good knowledge of accounting practices. I still
feel the following is useful, and that taken as a whole it describes a working
double entry accounting system.</p>
</div>

<div id="in-a-little-more-detail">
<h2>In a little more detail<a href="#in-a-little-more-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">Peter Selinger’s tutorial</a> to be very enlightening and is less terse than the functional description above.
The first section is short and covers single entry accounting, and then shows how one can expand that to create double
entry accounting. I found this background useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You live in a shared house. Everyone pays their share into a communal bank account
every month.</p>
<div id="example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 1: Saving money to pay a bill (no sign flipping)<a href="#example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You pay the electricity bill every three months. Therefore every month you take £100
from everyone’s contributions and put it into Electricity Payable account (a liability
account) in the knowledge that you will pay the bill from this account when it eventually arrives:</p>
<p>These accounts are income &amp; liability accounts, so neither balance needs to be flipped (flipping
only applies to asset &amp; expense accounts). Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £500</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>:<ul>
<li>£100 from <em>Housemate Contribution</em> to <em>Electricity Payable</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £400</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £100</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should also make intuitive sense. Some of the housemate contributions will be used to pay the electricity
bill, therefore the former decreases and the latter increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 2: Saving money to pay a bill (with sign flipping)<a href="#example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the start of every month each housemate pays into the communal bank account. We
should therefore represent this somehow in our double entry system (something we ignored in
example 1).</p>
<p>We have an account called <em>Bank</em> which is an asset account (because this is money
we actually have). We also have a <em>Housemate Contribution</em> account which is an
income account.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>to represent the fact that we have been paid money, we must create a transaction</strong>.
However, money cannot be injected from outside our double entry system, so how do we deal with this?</p>
<p>Let’s show how we represent a single housemate’s payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): £0</li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction:</strong><ul>
<li>£500 from <em>Bank</em> to <em>Housemate Contribution</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): -£500 * -1 = <strong>£500</strong></li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em>  (income): £500</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the bank account is an asset account, we flip the sign of its balance.
<strong>The result is that both accounts increase in value.</strong></p>

    <li><a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Open"AI</a> is not open at all. In fact, everything is closed source and proprietary.</li>
    <li>The ramifications of this blackbox API processing these kinds of queries is enormous.</li>

<p>Bullshit. You can open-source AND run the infrastructure to make it "more accessible" at the same time.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">
<p>the API model allows us to more easily respond to misuse of the technology ... harassment, intentional deception, radicalization, astroturfing, or spam ...</p>

<p>This is a losing battle. Other models will come along shortly. By being actually open, they will be infinitely more socially and technically scalable.</p>

            <p>Variables are one of the fundamental blocks of any programming language, the way each language defines how we declare and interact with variables can make or break a programming language. Thus any developer needs to understand how to effectively work with variables, their rules, and particularities. In today’s tutorial, we are going to learn how to declare, interact, and scope variables in JavaScript. We will introduce new concepts and important JavaScript keywords like <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="declaring-variables">Declaring variables</h2>
<p>Nowadays JavaScript has three different keywords to declare a variable, <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and, <code>const</code>. Each with its own properties and particularities. Let’s start by making a simple comparison table of the 3 and then getting into the details.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Keyword</th>
<th>Scope</th>
<th>Hoisting</th>
<th>Can be reassign</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">var</a></td>
<td>Function</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">let</a></td>
<td>Block</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const">const</a></td>
<td>Block</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Don’t worry if for now, you are not sure what we mean by scope, hoisting, or any of the other attributes. We are going to cover them in detail next.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="variable-scope">Variable Scope</h2>
<p>Scope in JavaScript refers to context (or portion) of the code which determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. In JavaScript, we have 2 types of scope, <strong>local</strong> and <strong>global</strong>. Though local scope can have different meanings.</p>
<p>Let’s work out through the definitions by giving some examples of how scoping works. Let’s say you define a variable <code>message</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>message</span>) <span>// 'Hello World'
</span></code></pre></div><p>As you may expect the variable <code>message</code> used in the <code>console.log</code> would exist and have the value <code>Hello World</code>.  No Doubts there, but what happens if I change a bit where I declare the variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>true</span>) {
    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>message</span>) <span>// ReferenceError: message is not defined
</span></code></pre></div><p>Ups… Looks like we broke it, but why? The thing is that the <code>if</code> statement creates a local <strong>block scope</strong>, and since we used const the variable is only declared for that <strong>block scope</strong>, and cannot be accessed from the outside.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a bit more about block and function scopes.</p>
<h3 id="block-scope">Block Scope</h3>
<p>A block is basically a section of code (zero or more statements) which is delimited by a pair of curly braces and may optionally be labeled.</p>
<p>As we already discussed the use of <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> allows us to define variables that live within the block scope. Next, we’ll build very similar examples by using different keywords to generate new scopes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
{
    <span>const</span> <span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x1</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x1</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>Let’s explain this one as it may look a bit strange at first. In our outer scope, we are defining the variable <code>x1</code> with a value of <code>1</code>. Then we create a new block scope by simply using curly braces, this is strange, but totally legal within JavaScript, and in this new scope, we create a new variable (separate from the one in the outer scope) also named <code>x1</code>. But don’t get confused, this is a brand new variable, which will only be available within that scope.</p>
<p>Same example now with a named scope:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>myNewScope</span><span>:</span> { <span>// Named scope
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x2</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x2</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>While example (<strong>DO NOT RUN THE CODE BELOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong>)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x3</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>while</span>(<span>x3</span> <span>===</span> <span>1</span>) {
    <span>const</span> <span>x3</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x3</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x3</span>) <span>// Never executed
</span></code></pre></div><p>Can you guess what’s wrong with that code? And what would happen if you run it?… Let me explain, <code>x3</code> as declared in the outer scope is used for the while comparison <code>x3 === 1</code>, normally inside the while statement, I’d be able to reassign <code>x3</code> a new value and exit the loop, however as we are declaring a new <code>x3</code> withing the block scope, we cannot change <code>x3</code> from the outer scope anymore, and thus the while condition will always evaluate to <code>true</code> producing an infinite loop that will hang your browser, or if you are using a terminal to run it on NodeJS will print a lot of <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>Fixing this particular code could be tricky unless you actually rename either variables.</p>
<p>So far in our example, we used <code>const</code>, but exactly the same behavior would happen with <code>let</code>. However, we saw in our comparison table that the keyword <code>var</code> is actually function scope, so what does it mean for our examples? Well… let’s take a look:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
{
    <span>var</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x4</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x4</span>) <span>// 2
</span></code></pre></div><p>Amazing! even though we re-declared <code>x4</code> inside the scope it changed the value to <code>2</code> on the inner scope as well as the outer scope. An this is one of the <strong>most important</strong> differences between <code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, and <code>var</code>  and is usually subject (in one way or another) for interview questions.</p>
<h3 id="function-scope">Function Scope</h3>
<p>A function scope is in a way also a block scope, so <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> would behave the same way they did in our previous examples. However, function scopes also encapsulate variables declared with <code>var</code>. but let’s see that continuing with our <code>xn</code> examples:</p>
<p><code>const</code> or <code>let</code> example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x5</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() {
    <span>const</span> <span>x5</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x5</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>myFunction</span>()
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x5</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>Exactly as we expected it, and now with <code>var</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>x6</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() {
    <span>var</span> <span>x6</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x6</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>myFunction</span>()
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x6</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this scenario, var worked the same way as <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.  Moreover:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() {
    <span>var</span> <span>x7</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x7</span>) <span>// ReferenceError: x7 is not defined
</span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, <code>var</code> declarations only exist within the function they were created in and can’t be accessed from the outside.</p>
<p>But there’s more to it, as always JS has been evolving, and newer type of scopes has been created.</p>
<h3 id="module-scope">Module Scope</h3>
<p>With the introduction of modules in ES6, it was important for variables in a module not to directly affect variables in other modules. Can you imagine a world where importing modules from a library would conflict with your variables? Not even JS is that messy!
So by definition modules create their own scope which encapsulates all variables created with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>, similar to the function scope.</p>
<p>There are ways though that modules provide to export variables so they can be accessed from outside the module, and that I covered already in the article <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-08-an-intro-to-javascript-modules/">An Intro To JavaScript Modules</a>.</p>
<p>So far we talked about different types of <strong>local</strong> scopes, let’s now dive into <strong>global</strong> scopes.</p>
<h3 id="global-scope">Global Scope</h3>
<p>A variable defined outside any function, block, or module scope has global scope. Variables in global scope can be accessed from everywhere in the application.</p>
<p>The global scope can sometimes be confused with module scope, but this is not the case, a global scope variable can be used across modules, though this is considered a bad practice, and for good reasons.</p>
<p>How would you go about declaring a global variable? It depends on the context, it is different on a browser than a NodeJS application. In the context of the browser, you can do something as simply as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
    <span>let</span> <span>MESSAGE</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>MESSAGE</span>)
&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Or by using the window object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
    window.<span>MESSAGE</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>MESSAGE</span>)
&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>There are some reasons you wanna do something like this, however, always be careful when you do it.</p>
<h3 id="nesting-scopes">Nesting scopes</h3>
<p>As you probably guessed by now, it is possible to nest scopes, meaning to create a scope within another scope, and its a very common practice. Simply by adding an <code>if</code> statement inside a function we are doing this. So let’s see an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>nextedScopes</span>() {
    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span>

    <span>if</span> (<span>true</span>) {
        <span>const</span> <span>fromIf</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello If Block!'</span>
        <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>message</span>) <span>// Hello World!
</span><span></span>    }

    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>fromIf</span>) <span>// ReferenceError: fromIf is not defined
</span><span></span>}

<span>nextedScopes</span>()
</code></pre></div><h3 id="lexical-scope">Lexical Scope</h3>
<p>In a way, we already made use of lexical scope, though we didn’t know about it. Lexical scope simply means that the children scopes have access to the variables defined in outer scopes.</p>
<p>Let’s see it with an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>outerScope</span>() {
    <span>var</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Juan'</span>
    <span>function</span> <span>innerScope</span>() {
        <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>name</span>) <span>// 'Juan'
</span><span></span>    }

    <span>return</span> <span>innerScope</span>
}

<span>const</span> <span>inner</span> <span>=</span> <span>outerScope</span>()
<span>inner</span>()
</code></pre></div><p>That looks stranger than what it is, so let’s explain it. The function <code>outerScope</code> declares a variable <code>name</code> with value <code>Juan</code> and a function named <code>innerScope</code>. The later does not declare any variables for its own scope but makes use of the variable <code>name</code> declared in the outer function scope.</p>
<p>When <code>outerScope()</code> gets called it returns a reference to the <code>innerScope</code> function, which is later called from the outermost scope. When reading this code for the first time you may be confused as to why <code>innerScope</code> would <code>console.log</code> the value <code>Juan</code> as we are calling it from the global scope, or module scope, where <code>name</code> is not declared.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is thanks to JavaScript closures. Closures is a topic of its own and you can read more about it on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">MDN docs</a>. I’m planning an article to explain closures on simple terms but is not ready at the time of this writing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hoisting">Hoisting</h2>
<p>Hoisting in terms of JavaScript means that a variable is created in memory during the compile phase, and thus they can actually be used before they are actually declared. Sounds super confusing, let’s better see it in code.</p>
<p>This is what a normal flow would look like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>displayName</span>(<span>name</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>name</span>)
}

<span>displayName</span>(<span>'Juan'</span>)

<span>//***********************
</span><span>// Outputs
</span><span>//***********************
</span><span>// 'Juan'
</span></code></pre></div><p>Awesome! as expected that works, but what would you think of the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>hoistedDisplayName</span>(<span>'Juan'</span>)

<span>function</span> <span>hoistedDisplayName</span>(<span>name</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>name</span>)
}

<span>//***********************
</span><span>// Outputs
</span><span>//***********************
</span><span>// 'Juan'
</span></code></pre></div><p>Wait wait wait…. what? As crazy as it sounds, since the function is assigned to memory before the code actually runs, the function <code>hoistedDisplayName</code> is available before its actual definition, at least in terms of code lines.</p>
<p>Functions have this particular property, but also do variables declared with <code>var</code>. Let’s see an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x8</span>) <span>// undefined
</span><span></span><span>var</span> <span>x8</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Not what you guessed? The fact that the variable is “created” before its actual definition in the code doesn’t mean that its value …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>This post is a recipe for setting up a minimal Kubernetes cluster on
Fedora without requiring virtualization or a container registry. These
two features make the system cloud-agnostic and the cluster entirely
self-contained. The post will end with us running a simple Flask app
from a local container.</p>
<p>This setup is primarily useful for simple CI environments or
application development on Linux. (Docker Desktop has better tooling
for development on Mac or Windows.)</p>
<h3 id="getting-kubernetes">Getting Kubernetes</h3><p>The core of this effort is <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a>, a Kubernetes
distribution that allows us to run on a single node without
virtualization.</p>
<p>But first off, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/">install Docker</a>.</p>
<p>Then install K3s:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
</code></pre>
<p>It may prompt you to adjust some SELinux policies like so:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dnf install -y container-selinux selinux-policy-base
$ sudo rpm -i https://rpm.rancher.io/k3s-selinux-0.1.1-rc1.el7.noarch.rpm
</code></pre>
<p>Swap these out with whatever it prompts and retry the K3s install.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">install
kubectl</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
</code></pre>
<p>Now copy the global K3s kubeconfig into <code>~/.kube/config</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
$ sudo chown $USER:$GROUP ~/.kube/config
</code></pre>
<p>And enable K3s:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl enable k3s
</code></pre>
<p>If you're on Fedora 31+ you'll need to disable cgroups v2 and reboot:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo grubby --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0" --update-kernel=ALL
$ sudo reboot
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can run <code>kubectl</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="a-simple-application">A simple application</h3><p>We'll create a small Flask app, containerize it, and write a
Kubernetes deployment and service config for it.</p>
<p>We begin with <code>app.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello World, Flask!'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Then a <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>FROM python:3-slim

RUN pip install flask
COPY . /app

CMD python3 /app/app.py
</code></pre>
<p>Then the deployment in <code>manifest.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: helloworld
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: helloworld
          name: helloworld
</code></pre>
<h3 id="running-in-kubernetes">Running in Kubernetes</h3><p>First we build, save, and import the image into <code>k3s</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build . -t helloworld
$ docker save helloworld &gt; helloworld.tar
$ sudo k3s ctr image import helloworld.tar
$ kubectl apply -f ./manifest.yaml
$ kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods | grep helloworld | cut -d ' ' -f 1) 5000 &gt; log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
$ curl localhost:5000
Hello World, Flask
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
  
  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Let’s take the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int * f()
{
    int x = 2;
    return &amp;x;
}

int g( int * p  )
{
    return 3 + *( p? f(): p );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has two errors in it. First, <code>f</code> returns a pointer to a local variable,
which goes out of scope. Second, the check in <code>g</code> is reversed; in the case
<code>p</code> is a null pointer, it dereferences it, instead of doing the opposite –
dereference <code>p</code> only when it’s not null.</p>

<p>This is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rbn9KP">GCC emits</a> for <code>g</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g(int*):
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR ds:0
        ud2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is, it can obviously see that <code>g</code> will either dereference a null pointer
(undefined behavior), or an invalid pointer (undefined behavior), so it generates
code that dereferences a null pointer (<code>mov eax, [0]</code>), which crashes, and then
emits the guaranteed-invalid instruction <code>ud2</code>, which crashes.</p>

<p>(You can’t be too sure, is GCC’s motto.)</p>

<p>And this is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/zW5dzY">Clang emits</a> for the same function:</p>



<p>Presumably, the logic here is that one of the branches leads to undefined behavior,
and the other also leads to undefined behavior, so we might as well remove the whole
thing, it’s not going to get called anyway in a correct program. (But if it does, let’s
just return, as crashing would be gauche.)</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know about you, but I’m left wondering here; if the compilers can clearly
see that all possible code paths through this function lead to undefined behavior,
why don’t they <em>tell us that</em>? Something like “Warning: function invokes undefined behaviour
on all control paths, you might want to check your code, mate”, except less formal.</p>

<p>Who cares about that, some might say, nobody writes such code anyway, this will catch
no bugs. Well, I have obviously oversimplified a bit. Let’s take a slightly more
realistic example, such as this one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int slice_sum( std::vector&lt;int&gt; const&amp; v, int i, int n )
{
    int s = 0;

    for( int j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j )
    {
        assert( i+j &gt;= 0 );
        assert( i+j &lt; v.size() );
        
        s += v[ i+j ];
    }

    return s;
}

int f()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    return slice_sum( v, 3, 2 );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5YGYYd">GCC do</a>?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.LC0:
        .string "int slice_sum(const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp;, int, int)"
.LC1:
        .string "./example.cpp"
.LC3:
        .string "i+j &lt; v.size()"

f():
        sub     rsp, 8
        mov     ecx, OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
        mov     edx, 11
        mov     esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC1
        mov     edi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC3
        call    __assert_fail
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Goes straight to <code>__assert_fail</code>, without passing Go and collecting $200.</p>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aP5qEW">Clang do</a>? Same thing.</p>

<p>Again, if the compilers can clearly see that calling <code>f</code> produces a guaranteed
assertion failure, why don’t they tell us?</p>

<p>Because we are put here on this planet to suffer, that is why.</p>

<p>(Also because <code>assert</code> is a macro that the compilers do not even see, and they
don’t know that <code>__assert_fail</code> is the assertion failure handler, and contracts,
which would have allowed us to write <code>[[assert: i+j &lt; v.size()]]</code> , were removed
from C++20 as being too useful, but those are just random second-order
manifestations of the cosmic need for suffering.)</p>

</p><p>
According to a report in The Information, an internal programme at Google known as "Android Lockbox" gives employees access to data on how Android users interact with popular, non-Google apps like </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="TikTok" actualkeyword="TikTok">TikTok</keyword><p>, </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Facebook" keynameseo="facebook" actualkeyword="facebook">Facebook</keyword><p> and </p><keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Instagram" actualkeyword="Instagram">Instagram</keyword><p>.
</p><p>
    "When YouTube was planning the rollout of its rival to TikTok in India earlier this month, employees turned to a valuable source of market research: how people in the country were using TikTok and its competitors on Android", the report claimed.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>The programme works via Google Mobile Services (GMS).
</p><p>
    "In some cases, such as YouTube in India, this data helps Google advance its own competing apps, say the people, all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely," the report added.
</p><p>
The Google employees can reportedly see "sensitive" data about other apps, including how often they're opened and for how long they're used.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Google-owned YouTube is working on a TikTok rival called Shorts, to be introduced by the end of this year.
</p><p>
"Google is also thought to have used the internal programme to plan the launch of its TikTok competitor called Shorts", according to the report.
</p><p>
    "Android Lockbox" works after Google users agree to share information as part of the Android setup process.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Users are told that this data allows Google to offer a more personalised experience. According to the report, it also provides data for competitive research.
</p><p>
    Google admitted that it has access to usage data from rival apps.
</p><p>
A Google spokesperson told The Verge in a statement: "Since 2014, the Android App Usage Data API has been used by Google and Android developers who have been authorized by Android OEMs or users to access basic data about app usage -- such as how often apps are opened -- to analyze and improve services".
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>"The API doesn't obtain any information about in-app activity and our collection of this data is disclosed to and controllable by users," the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
</p><p>
The US government is set to grill Google along with other tech giants over its dominance in their fields of Search and anti-market practices. The panel announced its antitrust probe into the tech giants in June last year.
</p><p>
    Google isn't the only company that's been accused of such data gathering practices.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>In 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook used a VPN service called Onavo to monitor rival services.
</p><p>
    Onavo Protect -- a Facebook's software that was going to get the functionality -- was billed as a piece of VPN software. Onavo was used primarily to gather information about what other apps Facebook users were using on their mobile devices.
</p><p>
The app was shut down in 2019.

<span><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer.png" alt="Technical drawing of keyboard keys" title="Typometer"></span>Typometer is a tool to measure and analyze visual latency of text / code editors.</p>
<p>Editor latency is delay between an input event and a corresponding screen update, in particular case – delay between keystroke and character appearance. While there are many kinds of delays (caret movement, line editing, etc.), typing latency is a major predictor of editor usability.</p>
<p>Check my article <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure">Typing with pleasure</a> to learn more about editor latency and its effects on typing performance.</p>
<p>Project source code is available as a <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer/releases/download/v1.0.1/typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip">typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip</a> (0.5 MB)</p>
<p>Java 8 or latter is required to run the program. You can <a href="https://java.com/download">download Java</a> from the official site.<br>
<span id="more-1135"></span></p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).</li>
<li>Native API calls for faster screen access.</li>
<li>Synchronous / asynchronous modes.</li>
<li>Import / export of CSV data.</li>
<li>Summary statistics, frequency distribution.</li>
<li>Line / bar charts (including comparative ones).</li>
<li>Chart image export (with legend).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Screenshots</h3>
<p>Main window:</p>
<p><img alt="Typometer, main window" title="Typometer, main window" src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-window.png"></p>
<p>Frequency distribution chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-distribution.png" alt="Typometer, frequency distribution chart" title="Typometer, frequency distribution chart"></p>
<h3>Principle</h3>
<p>The program generates OS input events (key presses) and uses screen capture to fully automate the test process.</p>
<p>At first, a predefined pattern (“<code>.....</code>“) is inserted in editor window in order to detect screen metrics (start position, step, background, etc.).</p>
<p>After that, the program types a predefined number of “<code>.</code>” characters into the editor (with given periodicity), measuring delays between key presses and corresponding character drawings.</p>
<p>To achieve high accuracy of measurement, only a single pixel is queried for each symbol. Moreover, the program can use fast native API (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">WinAPI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">XLib</a>) calls on supported platforms, offering <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html">AWT robot</a> as a fallback option.</p>
<p>There are two modes of testing available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> – the program always waits for typed character to appear before making a pause and typing the next character. It’s the most accurate method (because there’s no threading overhead).</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> – the program types and recognizes characters independently. This method is slightly less accurate, but it’s useful for testing rapid typing, when editor drawing might easily lag by multiple characters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To register only essential editor latency, text must be rendered directly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">framebuffer</a>, without intermediate image processing that might introduce additional delay. Prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager">stacking window managers</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositing window managers</a> for the testing purposes, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Classic theme in Windows. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero">Windows Aero</a> enforces internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_television#Vertical_synchronization">vertical synchronization</a>, which leads to minimum 1 frame lag (about 17 ms for 60 Hz monitor refresh rate) and delay discretization. It’s also possible to disable the compositing directly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021060058/http://www.softwareaudioconsole.com/Tweaking_Windows_7.htm">in Windows 7</a> and <a href="http://www.rlauncher.com/wiki/index.php?title=Input_Lag_Checklist#Disable_Desktop_Composition_in_Windows_8_and_8.1">in Windows 8</a>.</li>
<li>Use Linux distributive with lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">window manager</a>, like <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbox">Openbox</a>). Complex, 3D-based windows managers might substantially increase system rendering latency, for example, on my hardware, Ubuntu’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">Compiz</a>, adds ~10 ms unavoidable lag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Close all programs that add system-wide keyboard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking">hooks</a>, as they might process the keyboard events synchronously and affect the results (for example, <a href="http://www.workrave.org/">Workrave</a> is known to noticeable increase the typing latency).</p>
<p>You may consider switching your machine in a particular hardware mode (power scheme, integrated / discrete graphics, etc.). In power save mode (and on battery), for example, editor responsiveness is usually much lower, so it’s possible to detect significant performance glitches which are less frequently observable otherwise.</p>
<p>Before you start benchmarking, make sure that other applications are not placing noticeable load on your system. It’s up to you whether to “warm up” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">VM</a>-based editors, so they can pre-compile performance-critical parts of their code before proceeding.</p>
<p>If possible, enable non-block caret (i. e. underline / vertical bar instead of rectangle) in editor. This might increase measurement accuracy.</p>
<p>Typical action sequence is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a measurement title, like “HTML in Vim” <em>(optional, can be set later)</em>.</li>
<li>Configure test parameters <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Launch an editor, maximize its window.</li>
<li>Open some data in the editor, for instance, a large HTML file <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Place editor caret in desired context (like comment, etc.), at the end of short / empty line.</li>
<li>Start benchmarking process in the program.</li>
<li>After a corresponding prompt, transfer focus to the editor window.</li>
<li>Wait for test completion, don’t interfere with the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always interrupt the testing process simply by transferring focus back to the program window.</p>
<p>After test result is acquired, you may either analyze the singular data by itself or perform additional tests (different editors / conditions) to do comparative analysis.</p>
<p>Both source- and aggregate data is easily accessible, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy table content  as text,</li>
<li>save chart to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a> file (with legend and summary stats),</li>
<li>export raw data in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> or <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, if you fancy).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s possible to merge results either by inserting data from an existing CSV file, or by appending data to a CSV file on saving.</p>
<h3>Recipes</h3>
<p>Here are a few tips on how you can use the tool to detect performance bottlenecks in text / code editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether number of lines influences the latency. If so, typing might “lag” inside a large file.</li>
<li>Check whether editor window size influences the latency. If so, the editor probably does excessive repainting instead of drawing only a newly inserted symbol.</li>
<li>Check whether latency depends on horizontal symbol position. Ideally, that correlation should be undetectable.</li>
<li>Try to enable highlighting / autocomplete / folding / spellchecker / etc. Those features should be processed asynchronously, without affecting the typing as such.</li>
<li>Try to run the test in power-saving mode. Ideally, typing should be handled decently even on less powerful hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re implementing a text / code editor, take a look at the <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/low-latency-painting-in-awt-and-swing/">programming techniques</a> to significantly reduce the drawing latency.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>To make benchmarking possible, correct screen metrics must be detected at the initial step. The program attempts to recognize a custom pattern (5 new dots) in order to determine the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting position,</li>
<li>horizontal step,</li>
<li>background color,</li>
<li>line length,</li>
<li>caret type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are many editors (and multiple versions of each editor), which looks different on different platforms, and there are many possible color schemes and fonts, the metrics recognition algorithm has to be very flexible. While the program sources contain a great deal of test cases, some glitches are still probable.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of typical problems and corresponding solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor background is non-uniform (gradient, picture) – set solid color background.</li>
<li>Characters are too low-contrast and obscure – use a crisp color scheme.</li>
<li>Dot characters merge with the caret – increase font size.</li>
<li>Editor replaces multiple dots with ellipsis – disable that auto-correction.</li>
<li>Spaces between dots are uneven – use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced font</a> in the editor.</li>
<li>Editor has a left panel that melds with the text area – hide the panel.</li>
</ul>

Today we will go through the process of setting up an entire internal PKI backed by the security guarantee the HSM provides. First, we will generate a root CA with a private key living on the HSM’s hardware. Then, we will generate an Intermediate CA, whose private key will live secured by file system permissions in Linux. Then, we will walk through an example of generating a client certificate for use on internal endpoints. The root certificate can be distributed to the root certificate store of managed endpoints, and the machine used to generate the root CA’s private key can subsequently be kept offline.</p><p><img itemprop="url" src="https://cdn.ssltrust.com.au/assets/images/help/internal-pki-openssl-nitrokey-hsm/nitrokey-hsm.jpg" alt="Create an Internal PKI using OpenSSL and NitroKey HSM"></p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>Before getting started, make sure to have setup a machine running Ubuntu Linux capable of talking to the NitroKey.

    <main>
      <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

        <p><em>(This post was originally written as a reply on the mailop mailing-list, but
a friend asked me to turn it into a blog post.  I've edited it, mostly
adding more links to elsewhere, but there are some additions here.)</em></p>
<p><em>Context: someone with a mail-server hosted in a German facility with a
poor reputation for handling abuse reports was asking for help on
sending email to their Gmail-using friends; they had SPF and didn't see
the point of DKIM; they had TLS setup for their mail-server, using a
certificate from CACert.</em></p>
<p>There's a PDF from Google from 2006 which is still worth reading:
<a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf">https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf</a>, entitled
“Sender Reputation in a Large Webmail Service” by Bradley Taylor.
Anyone running a mail-server today needs to read that document.</p>
<p>If you don't send much email, then the only IP-based reputation which
Google can assess you on is the reputation of your address-block, so
being in a “troublesome” hosting provider will score heavily against
you.  At that point, if not moving away, you need to try to balance out
that negative score with enough positives that any of the large
providers using reputation scoring will accept the mail.</p>
<p>Working forward-and-reverse paired DNS is even more important for IPv6
than for IPv4; for better or worse, some of the large providers have
decided that exemptions in old standards for old behavior should not
apply when folks deploy standards which are far newer.  So you
absolutely need an <code>MX</code> record, you must not just rely upon
address-records (<code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code>).</p>
<p>With a poor IP-based reputation, you need to see if you can score a
better domain-based reputation.  This is where DKIM comes into play:
once you can provably link a message to really be from a given domain,
then even if you don't send much mail you can benefit from stuff like
“not on day-old-bread domain-lists”.  But having DKIM and then a DMARC
record does help (and <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2014/04/dmarc-stance/">I'm no fan of DMARC</a>).</p>
<p>For the mail-server's TLS: for that to count in your favor instead of
being a wash, I strongly suspect that it needs to be a certificate which
senders can verify.  For those people scoring up for “better TLS”, those
senders using DANE will be happy with a TLSA record in DNSSEC for your
CACert anchor.  But the large webmail providers are Resistant to having
to deploy DNSSEC verification, so instead have pushed out an alternative
called MTA-STS.  With MTA-STS, you're tied into “whichever subset of CAs
all the large senders you care about will trust”, and then using that CA
for the certificates both for the MTA-STS web-server and for your
mail-server.  Note that you don't need to implement the client logic for
MTA-STS (and I think it's antithetical to an open federated platform)
but do need to just publish the static information for those senders who
do use it. At that point, CACert is not going to cut it.  You'd need to
try Let's Encrypt instead.</p>
<p>The ongoing natural tendency from larger providers is to favor
supporting what the majority of their users want the majority of the
time.  With so many people using larger providers, they naturally tilt
towards stuff which works with the larger senders, and requiring more
hoops.  Those additional hoops create more work for smaller providers
and self-hosters doing thing manually.</p>
<p>We need better automation tools around all of this.  The below will make
it clearer why.</p>
<p>So, here is my current understanding of the best current practices here,
in reality not IETF idealism.  This includes making mandatory stuff
which some folks insist must be optional, because realistically to send
to some large providers it's not optional.  This list includes features
to make you compatible with ongoing trends in the EU (particularly
Germany) to strongly disfavor allowing clear-text SMTP.</p>
<p>This assumes that you are <em>not</em> a large sender who should also be
setting up feedback loops, learning how to “warm” IPs, considering BIMI,
postmaster tooling domain verification, etc.</p>
<h3 id="deliverability-fixes">Deliverability fixes</h3>
<ol>
<li>reverse DNS with matching forward DNS; the name used should not
pattern-match anything generic and ideally would include a DNS label
of <code>mail</code> or <code>mx</code> or the like in it.</li>
<li>MX record, always.</li>
<li>Accurate SPF;
<ul>
<li>ideally not too broad; pay attention to SPF's query limits.</li>
<li>avoid <code>-all</code> at the end because, with the sole exception of “this
domain never sends email” records, the larger operators have metrics to
show that using <code>-all</code> <em>tends</em> to be a sign of over-enthusiasm rather
than reality, so it will slightly count against you;</li>
<li>remember to have an SPF record for your <code>HELO</code> hostname, because
when you send a “bounce” rejection, this is the thing which will be
looked up (since there's no domain in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DKIM set up, with thought towards the selector namespace.
<ul>
<li>RSA2048 key is effectively a hard-requirement
<ul>
<li>DNS TXT records consist of one or more DNS strings, each of which
is limited to 255 ASCII characters.  For a key of this size, you
will end up needing two DNS strings in the zonefile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed25519 keys are not yet widely supported, but by now are not
likely to actively break and make things worse for you, if you
dual-sign.  This needs to be a different selector.</li>
<li>Note that for various good reasons you should design this to be
something you routinely rotate.
<ul>
<li>Some folks use yearly, some monthly</li>
<li>I rotate every three months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DMARC record; see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489" title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)">RFC 7489</a>
<ul>
<li>But for domains which humans send from <em>don't</em> use
<code>p=quarantine</code> or <code>p=reject</code>;</li>
<li>Do consider setting up a receiver for reports, just so that you can
see how much of a privacy breach DMARC reporting is when you send
to mailing-lists which don't re-sign. :-/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TLS certificate from a CA in the main trust anchor bundles;
<ul>
<li>Just use Let's Encrypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MTA-STS web-server with HTTPS certificate from the same CA, and the
relevant MTA-STS txt file in place; add the DNS record when it's up
and happy.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461" title="SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)">RFC 8461</a>.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/">https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/</a> for a testing validation tool
(with thanks to Luis Muñoz for the pointer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the independent mail providers using the stuff broadly supported
in open source MTAs, you should look at DNSSEC, because the patterns
here are less susceptible to rent-seeking pressures:
<ul>
<li>DNSSEC-signed zone for your own domain
<ul>
<li>Use whichever signing algorithm CloudFlare are currently using:
this should be both current for cryptography and widely enough
supported that if it's not supported by someone's resolver, then
they have bigger problems than just your domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNSSEC validating resolver for you to look up records of others
(consider <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> or <a href="https://www.knot-resolver.cz/">Knot Resolver</a>)</li>
<li>DANE records for your own domain (TLSA records in DNS)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7672" title="SMTP Security via Opportunistic DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS)">RFC 7672</a> for the SMTP details.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA">RFC 6698</a> for the base spec with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7218" title="Adding Acronyms to Simplify Conversations about DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)">RFC 7218</a> for some common
acronyms which make talking about it easier.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7671" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Protocol: Updates and Operational Guidance">RFC 7671</a> for the updates and operational guidance.</li>
<li>There are other RFCs, for SRV records and for OpenPGP, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell your mail-server to obey DANE stuff, so that if there's a TLSA
record in DNSSEC-verified DNS then the mail-server can disable
fallback to cleartext for delivery to MX (and ideally also then
verify the TLS connection has a cert chain which is anchored in one
of the TLSA records)</li>
<li><a href="https://dnsviz.net/">https://dnsviz.net</a> is your friend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>_smtp._tls</code> record so you can get reports of TLS failures sending to
you</li>
<li>Seeing if you can get your IP onto one of the open DNS-based
allow-lists (also called “whitelists” but some folks are moving away
from that term), such as <a href="https://www.dnswl.org/">https://www.dnswl.org/</a> or Spamhaus's SWL.</li>
<li>Periodically check if you appear in any DNS-based deny-lists.</li>
<li>Make sure you're not sending from “ISP residential address-space”; if
need be route your mail outbound via a host in better address-space
(and update SPF etc to match)</li>
<li>Don't do sender call-out verification to SMTP servers which aren't
yours.</li>
<li>For your own sanity, do make sure you set up <a href="https://www.fail2ban.org/">fail2ban</a>, or something
like it, scanning your mail-server logs, because SMTP AUTH online
cracking is widespread.  If they ever get in, your deliverability
will be negatively impacted by their spam campaign through your
mail-server.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="convenience-stuff">Convenience Stuff</h3>
<p>Outside of “Phil's BCP” above, additional non-deliverability but
convenience options include:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS SRV records for submission(s)/imap(s)/pop3(s)/sieve, even if just
to say with «<code>0 0 0 .</code>» that it's not supported.</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using OpenPGP with email,
then set up WKD to publish OpenPGP keys for your domain too.
<ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>This is a short post reflecting on some pretty basic C++ that bothered me
because I felt like I didn't fully understand it. I felt that the language
should be able to do more, and wanted to understand why it could not.</p>

<p>In C++, subtype polymorphism allows pointers and references of child classes to
be treated as their parents<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>class</span><span> Parent</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span><span>class</span><span> Child</span> <span>:</span> <span>public</span><span> Parent</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span><span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>    Child<span>*</span> child <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span>    <span>foo</span><span>(</span>child<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>    
<span id="L10">10 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is at the core of Object Oriented style programming in C++, and, like all
forms of polymorphism, allows us to write code that is only tied to an
interface, not its implementations. We can swap out implementations easily,
making the code more flexible, as well as more testable: test doubles that
implement the interface can be injected during tests.</p>
<p>C++ also provides another mechanism for polymorphism: templates. Templates
allow us to parameterise interfaces by type. The template <code>std::vector</code>
describes a growable list and is parametrised by the type the list contains.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in C++, you cannot combine these two forms of polymorphism in a
way that you might like to.</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1">1 </span><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L2">2 </span>
<span id="L3">3 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L4">4 </span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Child<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span> children <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>()</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5">5 </span>    <span>bar</span><span>(</span>children<span>)</span><span>;</span>  
<span id="L6">6 </span>    
<span id="L7">7 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>It's easy to explain this by pointing out that <code>std::vector&lt;Child*&gt;</code> does not
inherit from <code>std::vector&lt;Parent*&gt;</code>, and so why would you expect to be able to
use them interchangeably?</p>
<p>This explanation makes sense intuitively, but I found it to be lacking. I
thought about this:</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Child<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span> children <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>()</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span> children_as_parents <span>=</span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span>        <span>*</span><span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>*</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>&amp;</span>children<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>    <span>bar</span><span>(</span>children_as_parents<span>)</span><span>;</span>  
<span id="L8"> 8 </span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L10">10 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>I thought this would be "safe" (we'll see why not below): the memory layout
will still be valid, as the
vector contains pointers, so accessing elements of the vector would work as
expected; and of course, because <code>Child</code> inherits from <code>Parent</code>, accessing the
<code>Parent</code> members after the cast would also work as expected.</p>
<p>I thought: if I know that this is safe, why can't the compiler? If the compiler
can know that it's safe, why doesn't the language allow it without circumventing
the type system with <code>reinterpret_cast</code>?</p>

<p>The example above is not actually safe because the vector is mutable. We could
add pointers to other subtypes of <code>Parent</code> to <code>children_as_parents</code> while still
being able to access <code>children</code>, which would now be undefined behaviour.</p>
<p>This suggests we could never have <code>std::vector</code> behave the way I've described
with subtypes, and immutable containers would be needed instead.</p>

<p>The <code>reinterpret_cast</code> done above would only work because I know that the
implementation of <code>std::vector&lt;Parent*&gt;</code> and <code>std::vector&lt;Child*&gt;</code> is
identical.</p>
<p>However, that of course isn't the case in general for templates: part of their
function is that you can specialise them for different type arguments.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> T<span>&gt;</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span><span>class</span><span> A</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>    <span>...</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>class</span><span> A</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>    <span>double</span> m_<span>;</span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>
<span id="L10">10 </span><span>template</span><span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>class</span><span> A</span><span>&lt;</span>Child<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L11">11 </span>    <span>int</span> bar_<span>;</span>
<span id="L12">12 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you were able to pass <code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code> as if it were <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code>, what could that
look like?</p>
<p>When a <code>Child</code> object is copied to a <code>Parent</code> object, it is <em>sliced</em>. This just
means that any data in the child object that isn't part of <code>Parent</code> is not
copied.</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>class</span><span> Parent</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>    <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span>        <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>    <span>}</span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span><span>class</span><span> Child</span> <span>:</span> <span>public</span><span> Parent</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L10">10 </span>    <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L11">11 </span>        <span>return</span> foo_<span>;</span>
<span id="L12">12 </span>    <span>}</span>
<span id="L13">13 </span>
<span id="L14">14 </span> <span>private</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L15">15 </span>    <span>const</span> <span>int</span> foo_ <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L16">16 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L17">17 </span>
<span id="L18">18 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L19">19 </span>    Child child<span>;</span>
<span id="L20">20 </span>    Parent parent <span>=</span> child<span>;</span>  
<span id="L21">21 </span>    <span>return</span> parent<span>.</span><span>foo</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>  
<span id="L22">22 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>There's no obvious way for this to work for our template example above:
<code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code> does not share the members of <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code>, how could it be sliced
down?</p>
<p>Even if we were to take a reference (which means no slicing would occur), the
problem is essentially the same: <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code> could have a method that
<code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code> does not have.</p>

<p>Of course, we can still write a function that could take a <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code> or
<code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code>: with templating:</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>class</span><span> Parent</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>    <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>class</span><span> Child</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span>    <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>        <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L10">10 </span>    <span>}</span>
<span id="L11">11 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L12">12 </span>
<span id="L13">13 </span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> T<span>&gt;</span>
<span id="L14">14 </span><span>int</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;</span> vec<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L15">15 </span>    <span>return</span> vec<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>foo</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L16">16 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>But what I wanted was to be able to express that my function can take a vector
of any type that implements <code>Parent</code>. This doesn't express that. There's no way
in C++ to explicitly constrain the types on templates. In C++20, concepts
provide a minimal way to do this<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concept constraints are implicitly met, not explicitly implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concepts are orthogonal to the subtype polymorphism I want to ergonomically take advantage of.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, the explanation of why you can't pass <code>std::vector&lt;Child*&gt;</code> as
<code>std::vector&lt;Parent*&gt;</code> is really the same explanation we had at the start: you
can't pass templates of subtypes as templates of parents because the template
itself is not a subtype.</p>
<p>But really, a more meta-explanation is that C++ lacks the ability to constrain
template type arguments. This makes templates inherently inexpressive, and
makes it difficult to harmoniously use templates with inherited types.</p>
<p>This is one place where Rust shines in comparison to C++.</p>

<p>I really like the way Rust approaches polymorphism. Traits are Rust's only
mechanism for polymorphism. They provide a unified way for specifying both
static and dynamic interfaces. They facilitate designs based on composition,
reducing coupling. They allow for explicit constraint of type arguments in
generics.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In Rust, we can express the equivalent of what we wanted above easily:<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>This is the power of a more expressive type system, which to me is such a
crucial part of a programming language. C++'s type system always falls flat for
me, for many reasons: the limited expressiveness shown above; the lack of a way
for the type system to to track object lifetime, so we have a library of smart
pointers instead which can easily be abused; implicit type conversion that can
make code less clear and cause bugs; references that are taken implicitly; a
confusing value taxonomy.</p>
<p>I am definitely complaining here; but I also think part of developing a good
understanding of a system is understanding its limitations, being able to
understand why some things aren't possible, and knowing what a different system
would (or does!) look like. I hope this Rust example has helped with that.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any C++ insight to share I'd appreciate it: it's a
complex topic and I always have more to learn :)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/smattrr">Matthew Fernandez</a> kindly sent me <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/covariance-and-contravariance-in-subtyping/">this blog
post</a>
about the concept of type variance, which gives us a more formal language to
talk about some of the ideas discussed in this blog post, namely that C++
templates are <em>invariant</em>. I desired for them to be <em>covariant</em>.</p>
<p>From the linked blog post, "variance refers to how subtyping between more
complex types relates to subtyping between their components". In Rust,
implementing a trait does not create a subtype of that trait, so there's no
concept of variance to apply to our example above.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The issue of variance in C++ is relevant due to the use of both templates and
subtyping; Rust's unified mechanism for polymorphism, with explicitly met
constraints on type arguments, avoids this issue.</p>

Naively, it means that you have the right to express ideas without fear of governmental retaliation or censorship. But that’s not worth much in a vacuum. Free speech is valuable when you are communicating with others: abstractly, freedom of speech means the right to distribute information to an audience.</p> <p>If you frame freedom of speech not in terms of what comes out of your mouth, but in terms of the interaction between yourself and another party,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> then edge cases rapidly emerge. For example, suppose that you are on the street, lawfully raising a protest sign supporting X. You are hoping to persuade passers-by. The government sends in <em>five hundred</em> counter-protestors, peacefully raising <em>not X</em> signs. Your voice is drowned out in the crowd. You are unable to reach the passers-by; it’s as if you were not there. Is this censorship? I am no constitutional lawyer, but the effect is undeniably censorious – it is practically as if you had been sent home by the police.</p> <p>Historically, I haven’t seen this type of scenario give rise to much concern among constitutional scholars – perhaps for reasons of practicality. Perpetually mobilizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturf</a> brigades to drown out individual voices is hardly practically feasible.</p> <p>However, this has dangerously changed as discourse has moved online. The real-world constraints to astroturfing do not exist online. With <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-text-generator-gpt-3-learning-language-fitfully/">GPT-3</a>, the marginal cost of distributing astroturfed propaganda online has firmly hit zero. GPT-3 represents the newest generation of text-generating AI, and it is extremely good – perfectly indistinguishable from a human in short form, articulate, detailed, and capable of infinite variety in style and tone. Now it is actually possible for any online group discussion to be brigaded by thousands of automated users – indistinguishable from real humans – twisting the conversation, while drowning out the voices of real humans.</p> <p>This will become common in no time. It’s too effective a weapon for malicious states to pass it up. Manual online astroturfing is already widespread. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Water_Army">China</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency">Russia</a> pay thousands of state employees to spread propaganda online. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections">Russiagate</a> and the now widespread conspiracy theories on Antivax, 5G, COVID-19, etc. show, it’s very effective: social media platforms have enabled divide-and-conquer strategies at unprecedented scale and granularity. They have become a battleground for the opinions of people in the West, and these people haven’t realized it yet. Using fully automated, infinitely scalable tools to infect the minds of your opponents with malicious ideas and sow discord offers an unprecedentedly high ROI to the villains of the world.</p> <p>Thus, we are moving into a world where bad actors can interfere with free speech with a new form of censorship: the use of automated voices, indistinguishable from real ones, to overpower genuine voices online, and to shape the appearance of public discourse according to their goals. If you believe, as many scholars do, that democratic societies are critically reliant on your freedom to distribute information, then this poses a severe threat.</p> <p>The abstract problem is that on the internet, we don’t have a good way to tell real humans from fake ones. The current state-of-the-art tests are CAPTCHAs with challenges that “only humans could pass”: read the word, click all the squares with traffic lights, and so forth. Obviously these aren’t going to resist automation for long. They will be useless across the board in a few years, once general image recognition tools are as good as some substantial minority of humans.</p> <p>In the long term, AI will be effectively impossible to distinguish from humans online. The only solution is to use what we have and they don’t – real-world identification. A real-world ID could correspond to some set of private keys, so you could sign your online actions to prove their human authenticity. You could have a large number of private keys, so as to enable ample pseudonymity. However, true anonymity – not leveraging real-world identity in some sense – becomes impossible<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> without opening up the possibility of mass creation of automated trolls.</p> <p>In conclusion: free speech is not just about freedom from straight-forward censorship, but about your ability to participate in discourse without state interference. GPT-3 marks a new generation of tools enabling states to interfere in online discourse with unprecedented scale and persuasiveness, enabling great damage at low cost. It is clear that on the internet, AI will become indistinguishable from genuine humans in the next few years. To that extent, we have to protect our freedom of speech. It seems like requiring real-world IDs and coupling them with public key cryptography is the only way out, which keeps pseudonymity but loses anonymity.</p> <p>Losing anonymity to protect free speech is counter-intuitive and somewhat repulsive. I believe in individual freedom as the highest ideal. I used to think anonymity was one of the greatest values provided by the internet. And I acknowledge that eliminating anonymity to protect free speech comes with its own issues in the long run: for example, a malicious government could abuse the real-world-ID-to-private-key link to very effectively crack down on free speech. I don’t <em>like</em> the solution I am advocating, but it’s a difficult trade-off.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> DevOps doesn’t have to be all work and no play. I built 5 stupid (but fun!) GitHub actions… because <em>why not</em>?</p>
<p>The full code for these actions can all be found in this <strong><a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions">GitHub repo</a></strong>. I encourage you to fork and/or add issues/PRs with impractical actions of your own!</p>
<p>I also recorded a video about this project on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-ugGAYVCo">YouTube</a></strong>. ← Check out the video and subscribe if you are into this sort of thing 🙏</p>

<h2 id="what-is-github-actions">What is GitHub Actions?</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub. It can be used to automate things such as building, testing, and deploying code and can be triggered by any GitHub event.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">marketplace</a> where developers can publish their actions for others to use.</p>
<p>While I have used many CI/CD systems including Jenkins, Google Cloud Build, and CircleCI, prior to this project I hadn’t explored GitHub Actions, so I thought I would try it out and have some fun along the way.</p>
<p>Enough preamble, let’s get to the stupid stuff!</p>
<h2 id="the-actions">The Actions</h2>
<h3 id="1----holiday-reminder">1 – Holiday Reminder</h3>
<p>Starting simple with this first action, I take advantage of the fact that actions can be triggered on a cron schedule to create the following 10 line action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: holiday-reminder-happy-new-year
<span>on</span>:
  <span>schedule</span>:
    - <span>cron</span>: <span>'0 0 1 1 *'</span>
<span>jobs</span>:
  <span>happy-new-year</span>:
    <span>runs-on</span>: ubuntu-latest
    <span>steps</span>:
    - <span>name</span>: throw error
      <span>run</span>: exit <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The action will run at midnight on New Year’s day and fail every time due to the non-zero exit code. This will cause GitHub to send me an email wishing me a Happy New Year 🎉🎉🎉.</p>
<h3 id="2----recursive-action">2 – Recursive Action</h3>
<p>The next idea was proposed by a friend and former colleague (<a href="https://scotchka.github.io/)">https://scotchka.github.io/)</a>. He suggested that I make an action which triggers itself, thus creating an infinite chain of actions.</p>
<p>Given that the GitHub documentation explicitly states <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token">“To minimize your GitHub Actions usage costs, ensure that you don’t create recursive or unintended workflow runs,"</a> this seemed like a sufficiently stupid idea. To achieve this, I created an action triggered by commits that makes and commits a code change of its own.</p>
<p>There are two interesting parts to this action:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub helps prevent users from accidentally doing this by not triggering actions based on events associated with the default <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. In order to get around this, I created a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">personal access token</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/recursive.yml">action yaml file</a> for how this gets used.</li>
<li>In order to prevent the infinite action chain, I persist a count of the action executions within a file in the repo and increment it with each execution. This allows me to terminate the action chain when I reach a specified limit.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">COUNTER_FILE<span>=</span>./recursive/counter.txt
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>5</span>

count<span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat <span>"</span>$COUNTER_FILE<span>"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    echo <span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span> &gt; $COUNTER_FILE
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="76051f1236121300190605121f041315021f00135815191b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    git add $COUNTER_FILE
    git commit -m <span>"Incremented counter file"</span>
    git push 
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><h3 id="3----exponential-action">3 – Exponential Action</h3>
<p>The previous action has the potential to run indefinitely, but only one instance executes at a time, so it could be stopped manually if necessary. What if instead, the action triggered itself multiple times? This way, if it got out of hand there would be no stopping the exponential growth 😰. That sounds dumb… lets do it!</p>
<p>The file counter trick from before no longer works because multiple actions would be executing in parallel, all trying to modify and commit simultaneously causing conflicts. Instead, I stored the state in Git tags!</p>
<p>A random UUID is used as the base for the tag and the current iteration is appended to prevent collisions. The current implementation only support single digits, but if I make it past 9 iterations of exponential growth that means I messed up 💀.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>function</span> increment_tag_push <span>{</span>
    uuid<span>=</span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span>
    suffix<span>=</span><span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span>
    tag<span>=</span>$1.$uuid.$suffix
    git tag -a $tag -m <span>"New UUID tag"</span>
    git push origin $tag
<span>}</span>

count<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>echo -n $GITHUB_REF| tail -c 1<span>)</span><span>"</span>

echo $GITHUB_REF
echo $count

sleep <span>10</span> <span># In case something goes wrong (this saved me during development 😳)</span>
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>2</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="dcafb5b89cb8b9aab3acafb8b5aeb9bfa8b5aab9f2bfb3b1">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>i <span>=</span> 1; i &lt;<span>=</span> $1; i++ <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
    <span>do</span>
    increment_tag_push $i
    <span>done</span>
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><p>If you are looking for a quick way to burn through your 2000 free tier minutes… this is definitely the way to go!</p>
<h3 id="4----smart-lights">4 – Smart Lights</h3>
<p>Thus far, these actions have been implemented in small bash scripts. In order to actually explore the capabilities of GitHub actions I decided the next action should utilize <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action">Docker</a>.</p>
<p>I had a couple of WiFi smart plugs from VeSync that I received as a gift a few years ago and found a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyvesync/">python client for their API</a>. This made it simple to create an action which turns the lights on for a short period of time after each commit (what better way to incentivize code velocity?!💡)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/lights-off.gif" alt="images/lights-off.gif">
<figcaption>Lights on... Lights off!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The code for this one isn’t particularly interesting, but because the action is using more than just bash, it requires an <code>action.yml</code> file in which we can see how inputs get passed into the action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: <span>'Turn on Lights'</span>
<span>description</span>: <span>'Turn on smart home lights for a few seconds'</span>
<span>inputs</span>:
  <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>:  
    <span>description</span>: password for VESYNC_PASS
    <span>required</span>: <span>true</span>
<span>runs</span>:
  <span>using</span>: <span>'docker'</span>
  <span>image</span>: <span>'Dockerfile'</span>
  <span>env</span>:
    <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>: ${{ inputs.VESYNC_PASS }}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="5----tic-tac-toe">5 – Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<p>With the team starting to get a bit burnt out having to commit code constantly just to keep the lights on, I decided to implement a game of Tic-tac-toe to let them burn off some steam. The trick is that the computer player for this game executes within an action!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="images/tic-tac-toe.png">
<figcaption>Command line interface + board state file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wanted to try out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action">Javascript runtime</a>, so I built the game with Node, persisting the board state in a text file. Since the point of this game was to learn about actions the computer’s strategy is random, but this has the added benefit of letting the human win, boosting morale 🤔.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, GitHub Actions turned out to be fairly easy to work with and the option Dockerize the action steps ensures that it should be able to support pretty much any CI/CD need. Also, GitHub has made sharing and reuse of actions a core part of the experience through the Marketplace.</p>
<p>While I’m won’t be rushing off to port existing CI/CD workloads onto GitHub actions, I will certainly consider it for future greenfield projects!</p>

      <div><p>#SSSSS</p>
<p><em>Stupid</em>
<em>Simple</em>
<em>Static</em>
<em>Site</em>
<em>Starter</em></p>
<p>IMPORTANT: SSSSS requires that a markdown renderer be installed, and be
executable from a shell as 'markdown'. SSSSS assumes that the renderer will
only render exactly what is in the file, and not add anything like &lt;body&gt;
tags.</p>
<p>In addition to this assumption, SSSSS assumes that</p>
<pre><code>$ markdown file.md
</code></pre>
<p>will output the generated html to stdout.</p>
<p>EQUALLY IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT: SSSSS assumes that there is a POSIX sh at
/bin/sh. If there isn't, who knows what will happen, but probably not what
you want. In addition, s5-render does pass some user defined values to sh in
the form of path names. If you run it somewhere where a path includes valid
commands, you're gonna have a bad time.</p>
<hr>
<p>##About</p>
<p>This program will take a directory structure consisting of directories with
images and markdown files and render it to an html website.</p>
<p>The top level directory will include templates for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The html-header.html (<code>&lt;!doctype&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags.)</li>
<li>The document-header.html (<code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and whatever html you want to be included in the
header of your website.)</li>
<li>The document-footer.html (Your html for the footer, followed by <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>When SSSSS renders a given Markdown file it will place the templates and
markdown in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>html-header.html</li>
<li>document-header.html</li>
<li>input.md</li>
<li>footer.html</li>
</ol>
<p>One final feature. If you put a document-header.html file in the <code>top</code>
directory or one of it's sub-directories, that document-header.html file will
be passed down the directory tree, in order to make things like a tabbed
interface require less JS and/or drudge work. If you use this feature, be aware
that if you put a document-header.html into a child directory, you need to put
one in the parent as well, or else sometimes the child will leak upwards.</p>
<p>This is a bug, but one that I've found easy enough to work around that I
haven't felt compelled to fix it yet. If at some point there is demand for
this, I may fix it.</p>
<hr>
<p>There must be exactly one markdown file in each directory of the structure that
SSSSS is called on. SSSSS will take this:</p>
<pre><code>DemoSite
|- html-header.html
|- document-header.html
|- footer.html
|
\-top
  |- document-header.html
  |- index.md
  |
  \-about
  | |- document-header.html
  | |- about.md
  |
  \-blog
  | |- document-header.html
  | |- blog.md
  | |
  | \-post-one
  | | |- post-one.md
  | |
  | \-post-two
  |   |- post-two.md
  |
  \-other
    |- document-header.html
    |- other.md
</code></pre>
<p>and turn it to:</p>
<pre><code>DemoSite
|- html-header.html
|- document-header.html
|- footer.html
|
\-top
 |- document-header.html
 |- index.md
 |- index.html
 |
 \-about
 | |- document-header.html
 | |- about.md
 | |- index.html
 |
 \-blog
 | |- document-header.html
 | |- blog.md
 | |- index.html
 | |
 | \-post-one
 | | |- post-one.md
 | | |- index.html
 | |
 | \-post-two
 |   |- post-two.md
 |   |- index.html
 |
 \-other
   |- document-header.html
   |- other.md
   |- index.html
</code></pre>
<p>Although it seems strange that it would render every markdown file to a file
called index.html, there are actually two reasons. First, it allows you to have
nice looking URI's without needing to do any extra configuration in your
webserver. Second, it allows for less and simpler code, which makes this easier
to hack on for anyone who feels interested.</p>
<hr>
<p>##Tutorial</p>
<p>So you read through all that and still want to try this out? Cool. Start by
cloning this repository and installing some markdown program. After you have
done this, move the programs s5-generate.sh and s5-render into your path
somewhere, or just remember their fully qualified path.</p>
<p>Next, run</p>
<pre><code>$ s5-generate.sh HelloWorld
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new site called, you guessed it, HelloWorld. Move into the
HelloWorld directory you just created, you should see the template files
mentioned above, and a directory called top. The interior of top is where your
site will start.</p>
<p>Go ahead and cd yourself into top, and create a markdown file with content of
your choosing. I'm just going to go with a nice "Hello, World".</p>
<pre><code>file: WhateverNameYouWant.md
</code></pre>
<pre><code>#Hello, World!

Why does the world never say hello back?

</code></pre>
<p>After doing this, cd back up into the HelloWorld directory. Once there, run
s5-render and go back down into top. There should now be whatever markdown
file you created, along with an index.html file. Go ahead and play around
with changing the template files at the top, and look at how the outputed html
files change.</p>
<p>Presumably if you've found this, you know enough about computers to figure it
out from here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2 id="introducing-the-editor">Introducing the Editor</h2>
<p>Collaborative editors are defined by the size and speed of their
updates. On a website you might submit a form, but in a collaborative
editor you can send a single character or key press.</p>
<video controls="" width="100%">
    <source src="https://caolan.uk/articles/inside-a-collaborative-text-editor/google-docs-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<p>Those tiny edits are shared quickly so you feel connected to your
collaborators and can anticipate their actions. This experience is
described as <em>real-time</em> editing.</p>
<p>Inside your editor, however, the frequent edits form a hotbed of
conflicting updates. Solving or avoiding these conflicts is the real
challenge of a collaborative text editor.</p>
<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h2>
<p>Taking turns, two authors might avoid a conflict - if they have the
patience.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/4154d7b675ec700e00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But our collaborative editor has many authors. To block one author's
key press until another releases their keyboard would be infuriating.
Instead, they each edit a copy of the document and submit changes
when ready.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/57a61b3a6fefc58700.png" title="Their legs are crossed. That's probably not obvious."></p>
<p>To submit, the first author can simply swap his copy for the
original - with no prior updates, his edits apply cleanly.</p>
<p>The second author, however, will find - in place of the original - the
first author's copy. Where she re-worded a sentence, he might have
deleted the whole paragraph. She cannot replace the document without
losing his work, so she must compare the two and decide how, and if,
her edits still apply.</p>
<p>Most collaborative editors do this automatically, behind the scenes,
for every change to a document.</p>
<h2 id="operational-transformation">Operational Transformation</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d16f9e7203a8563100.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The process of re-writing your edits to account for the work of others
is called <em>Operational Transformation</em>. It's the most popular way to
implement a collaborative editor and is used by Etherpad and Google
Docs.</p>
<p>Concrete examples will follow, but for now let's start with two
tubes: the kind you buy tennis balls in.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/155936b3bca3740700.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Each tube has a starting state - a yellow ball - and each is held by a
different artist. At the same time, each artist adds a coloured ball
to the tube and informs their partner.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d4d34a8e9cee60a400.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing a yellow ball and a blue ball stacked on top, the right showing a red ball in place of blue. Beside the tubes are two artists saying 'blue' and 'red' respectively." title="We're not acorns, we're artists."></p>
<p>If they apply their partner's update naively, their tubes will look
different: red-blue-yellow one side and blue-red-yellow the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f4f128e9fa2cfce00.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing from top to bottom: red, blue, yellow, the right: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>No single tube is correct - the colours were added simultaneously -
but the artists should agree a result.</p>
<p>To resolve the tie, they can invent an arbitrary rule. One that, when
applied by both artists, will arrive at the same state.
They could discard every ball… but the result is disappointing. How
about: "when inserts are tied, insert red before blue"?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/74a0a8e0c99fd7b500.png" alt="Two tubes, both showing from top to bottom: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>By applying the same rule their states <em>converge</em>. This is the
principle behind Operational Transformation and it can be applied to
many authors typing at once.</p>
<h2 id="handling-text">Handling text</h2>
<p>In a text document, you can improve such a rule by examining the
position of the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/9ae873262f52072300.jpg" alt="Tama under a blanket with the caption 'sleepy cat'." title="Mraow"></p>
<p>Here's a photo of our cat Tama. I've labelled it "sleepy cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui (our other cat) both update my caption at different
positions. When Tama receives Yui's edit, she'll need to
shift Yui's "grumpy" right to account for her insert of "very".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f7a6a5a6edbee75500.png" alt="Two editors with the same state: very sleepy grumpy cat. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;grumpy &quot; 12'."></p>
<p>If she applied Yui's edit at its original character position, Tama
would have the state <strong>"very slgrumpy eepy cat"</strong>. But by understanding
how their concurrent edits affect one another, Tama's editor can
recover.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't rely on position alone - what if they both
insert text at the same location?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d56daf5a9e4e722f00.jpg" alt="Tama on top of the blanket with the caption &quot;Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Another photo, labelled simply: "Tama".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/086ae591d859549800.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;happy Tama&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui both make an edit at the beginning - position 0.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/819f09cfa16942c400.png" alt="Two editors showing a conflict. Tama has applied 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;playful happy Tama&quot;. Yui has applied 'INS &quot;happy &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Like our artists, Tama and Yui are tied for position. To resolve this,
we invent another arbitrary rule and order the inserts by Tama and
Yui's <em>editor ID</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8c2ab5057501f00500.png" alt="Two editors with the conflict resolved. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 6' and now also has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Yui has ID <code>[2]</code>, which is greater than Tama's <code>[1]</code>, so Tama
shifts Yui's insert after her own to converge on: <strong>"happy
playful Tama"</strong>.</p>
<p>We applied only two concurrent edits, but if Tama made multiple
changes, she would need to transform Yui's insert for each -
potentially shifting it multiple times before its final position.</p>
<p>I hope you feel confident after that, because - to demonstrate the
risks - I'm going to present a puzzle that threw the early algorithms
off-course.</p>
<h2 id="false-ties">False ties</h2>
<p><img alt="A photo of Yui with the caption 'little cat'." src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/750197ed186d7d3c00.jpg" title="Ah yes, all innocent - you wouldn't believe the noise."></p>
<p>The puzzle begins with a third author. And, since we only have two
cats - that's Yui above - I've introduced a fictional bunny: Bandit.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f57d6afe96060d5d00.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;little loud cat&quot;. Bandit suggesting &quot;cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;cute little cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Bandit doesn't think Yui is small and deletes the word 'little'. After
applying all their edits, we expect the final caption to read: "cute
loud cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8bd6291f807f45ce00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But there's a problem - because Bandit deletes the word separating
Tama and Yui's edits, a transform step might (falsely) tie them for
position. I'll demonstrate by stepping through Tama and Bandit's
transforms.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d1431eaff0d5f1a600.png" alt="Tama applying 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 7', 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'DEL 5..12' to get the state &quot;cute loud cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama arrives at the correct result <strong>"cute loud cat"</strong> because she
applies Bandit's delete <em>after</em> her and Yui's inserts. Bandit,
however, applies his delete first.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/09c1793a9bf57cd800.png" alt="Bandit applying 'DEL 0..7', the transformed message 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0' to get the state &quot;loud cute cat&quot;."></p>
<p>His delete shifts Tama's "loud" to position 0. Yui's edit now ties
with Tama's, so Bandit must apply the arbitrary rule and order their
inserts by editor ID - <code>[1]</code> Tama's "loud", followed by <code>[2]</code> Yui's
"cute". Bandit incorrectly arrives at <strong>"loud cute cat"</strong>.</p>
<p>If you didn't anticipate that you're in good company. Many academic
papers on Operational Transformation (OT) suffered similar
<em>counter-examples</em> (or bugs, to the practitioner) on publication.
Thankfully these puzzles have now been solved, as evidenced by the
widespread use of OT in the wild.</p>
<p>You can find the solution to our puzzle in the 30 years of OT research
since 1989. But to keep your curiosity in check, consider the
following: if an edit could be <em>undone</em>, conflicts could be rewound
and replayed in a fixed order. It's more work, and could still cause a
false tie, but at least everyone would encounter the <em>same</em> tie.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're now suitably paranoid. Operational Transformation is
easy to explain but complex to implement. If only there was a way to
avoid conflicts altogether…</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-conflicts">Avoiding conflicts</h2>
<p>Remember the two artists? I have another commission for them, this
time using coloured liquid instead of balls.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7039688af6d8494800.png" title="There are plenty of yellow liquids."></p>
<p>They each start with a tube containing yellow dye, to which they add
their own colours. Yellow and blue to make green; yellow and red to make
orange.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/48d447c836121b4600.png" alt="A blue drop being added to the left tube to make green. A red drop being added to the right tube to make orange."></p>
<p>Finally, they inform each other and add their partner's dye to their
own.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/35549bbf749c16a000.png" alt="A red drop being added to the left tube to make a sort of grey colour. A blue drop added to the right tube to make the same grew colour."></p>
<p>What a lovely colour! - but at least they didn't have to apply any
transforms to converge on it. Because the artists used liquid,
the order they added the dye is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Using a data type with the same property for text we could eliminate
conflicts there too.</p>
<h2 id="conflict-free-replicated-data-types">Conflict-free replicated data types</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>One elegant data type, called LOGOOT (an example of a conflict-free
replicated data type, or CRDT) is built upon each edit holding a
unique position - represented by a list of integers.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/1a9e80211f2fe7f900.png" alt="&quot;[10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>The list is comprised of: a positioning number, the author's editor
ID, and a counter.</p>
<p>Every edit increments the author's counter. In combination with their
editor ID, it ensures the position is unique. The positioning number
places the text in the document.</p>
<p>To insert a word at the beginning of the document (before "sleepy")
Tama <code>[1]</code> would create a new position list that starts with a random
value between 0 and 10.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/db8ec7b35046ae4700.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>Yui <code>[2]</code>, unable to generate an integer between 10 and 11, chooses a
new random positioning number and appends her values to the preceding
list. By growing the list, Yui can always find a position between two
adjacent words.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/e74bdd81e27aab8200.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [10, 0, 1, 130, 2, 1] GRUMPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>You can insert these four words - ordered by their position lists - in
any sequence. You'll always arrive at the same result.</p>
<p>The example above uses a position list per word, but you'll probably
want a position list per <em>character</em> - occupying significantly more
space than the text alone in exchange for predictable performance.</p>
<p>Praise for the performance of CRDTs often rests on the worst-case
scenario: a long conflicting history of edits. In practice,
Operational Transformation can perform millions of simple transforms a
second and grants greater freedom to optimise the data structure - so
you might find OT performs better where fast feedback and short
conflicting histories are the norm.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy using a modified version of LOGOOT. In the end,
what convinced me was, not performance, but greater confidence that my
code is correct.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2>
<p>It seems incredible that, after 30 years of research, many products
still restrict work to a single author or just lose overlapping edits.
If, instead, we apply techniques to detect, avoid, and resolve
conflicts, we <em>can</em> write good collaborative software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in March, my kids were super excited for a few days off for their Spring Break. I took a week off so I could be home with them and not have to worry about work. I still haven’t been back to the office, and they haven’t been back to their school.</p>

<p>I doubt there’s anybody that’s not aware of the current world situation regarding COVID-19. In March, my kids’ school decided that the risk of having all those kids in one place was too great, and they moved to a “School from Home” setup. My work did pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty fortunate in that my work supports a “From Home” option, and I’ve been full time from home before. I was already setup to do anything and everything I needed to do for my job right from my house.</p>

<p>My company offered basic supplies to take home if we needed them. Keyboards, mice, monitors, even chairs. I passed on pretty much all of that because I already have a good setup at home to work with. My laptop is all I need to work from pretty much anywhere in my house.</p>

<p>It’s been four months now. I confess, I’m burning out.</p>

<p>I recently attended a conference called SRE From Home, which was really interesting to me. One of the things said in one of the presentations stuck with me. To paraphrase, the reason we’re all burning out isn't because we’re working from home, it’s because we’re living at work.</p>

<p>That really struck home for me. I took a step back and really looked at how I’ve been doing this.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, I got up in the morning at a fixed time. I showered, got myself and my kids fed, the kids off to school, and then I drove in to work. I plopped my laptop down on my desk at work and <em>that</em> is when my work day started. I did my job until the end of the day, and then I packed up my stuff into my laptop bag and I drove home. I picked up my kids, got dinner ready, did homework with them, and got them to bed. I’d sit with my wife on our couch and watch a TV show or two and then go to bed.</p>

<p>Now, during the pandemic, my schedule is entirely different. I still get up at a fixed time, but the kids don’t go to school and I don’t go to work. I walk the required fifteen steps from my bedroom to my office and I plop down at my desk with my computer already running and open. It never closes anymore. It’s always there. I go grab a quick lunch, but rarely actually take a lunch <em>break</em>. I eat in my office at my desk. When my kids come grab me to tell me they’re hungry, I fix them something to eat, and then I’m right back at my desk. Dinner time roles around, and it’s the same routine. Even after they’ve gone to bed, the computer is still there, open and waiting. I’ll check my email in the evening and manage some small tasks right up until the point I go to bed.</p>

<p>Looking at this now, I realize that I <em>never stop</em> working. If I’m awake, I’m at work.</p>

<p>This is something I’m going to have to change.</p>

<p>I did something different today. I have to work tomorrow for server upgrades, so I “left” early. I closed my laptop down at three o’clock, and I went and took a nap. I haven’t looked at my computer since. It’s still sitting there on the desk, but the lid is closed, and I’m not going to open it until tomorrow night for the upgrades. When those are done, the lid will close again, and I’m sleeping in on Monday.</p>

<p>There are four hours of work scheduled for me Saturday night to Sunday morning, and those are not going to be “Free Work Hours”.</p>

<p>I need to start setting boundaries. There needs to be a line between “work” and “not work”. If I can’t draw that line, I’m going to drive myself crazy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have wanted to build a social network for 8 years, but it was much harder to
make software for the web back then. Also, 8 years ago, I was not even a
software developer yet, so there is that. But now I am (thanks
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a>!), and we are living in the
easiest time to be a software developer since Jeff Goldblum uploaded a virus to
an alien mothership.</p>
<h2>Quid Sentio</h2>
<p>The time was kind to my idea of what a social network should be too. It aged
well, and now it's time to uncork it. I am building <a href="https://www.quidsentio.com/">Quid
Sentio</a>, a shareable personal journal. I am not
calling it a social network site, but it is. Well, it will be. It's just the
basics now but open in public beta in the hopes someone will care.</p>
<p>What I am building now is much more mature than what I envisioned back then. The
core idea is the same -- keeping in touch with real friends, the closest friends
and family-- but the foundation is much more robust these days. In the meantime,
Path has come and gone, people saying they have quit Facebook have come and
gone, data leaks and privacy abuses have come and stayed.</p>
<p>I want to build Quid Sentio upon the principle of privacy. Privacy as freedom
from being observed. From being observed by non-friends, from being observed by
companies, from being observed by people who bought your data in the deep web
after a database leak.</p>
<p>The first two are just consequences of design and business choices. Adding a
little bit of friction for adding friends -- so no one can spam-add all their
contact list; keeping shared posts visible only by your direct friends -- so no
virality or friends of friends stalking you. A subscription-based business model
-- so no ads, no invasive tracking. The third level of privacy is not that
simple.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is one thing that gets harder and harder to do in software
development. At the same time, services that do it better than me are more
accessible. This is the first reason why I decided to build my project using
other people's infrastructure.</p>
<p>The second reason is that I want to limit how many things I have to juggle in my
mind while building it. I read in Sapiens that the Cognitive Revolution started
70,000 years ago. I am pretty sure it ended when I made 40. Some things look
attractive from afar, but I can pass without them, and I am happy enough just
hearing people talking about it. Things that fall into that bucket are Finnegans
Wake, EVE Online, Dwarf Fortress, and Vim. Other things I cannot pass by
without, and I have no idea how to do it myself.</p>
<p>The inevitable implication is that I had to find other people to do my job for
me. I wanted to focus on building the UI, creating the application logic,
designing the experience that would make my product unique. Not the devops, not
the infra, not the data plumbing, none of those solved problems. I found people
that do these better than I could possibly ever do in Netlify and FaunaDB. There
is also other software taken for granted that are worthy, but not newsworthy at
this point. Like Stripe, AWS S3, and the plethora of open-source software that
are the buried giants whose shoulders I am standing on while pretending to be in
a mountain that I climbed all by myself.</p>
<p>Economics teaches you about comparative advantage. People in those companies
have the advantage of being smart; I have the advantage of using their service's
free tiers. Not sure I got that economics thing right.</p>
<p>The defining technical characteristic of my application is using good things
with bad names. I built it on a serverless architecture, which is the same as
calling food delivery "kitchenless food". I am using JAMstack, which is an
acronym for static websites or dynamic web apps using a stack with Javascript,
APIs and markup language but not like all those other websites and web apps that
also use Javascript, APIs and markup language in a totally different way. I
would be much happier calling serverless architecture, “Boaty”, and JAMstack,
“McBoatface”.</p>
<p>Still, just like Panama hats from Ecuador, they are great things. They are
powerful ideas, implemented, and popularized by great companies that I am using
to build mine.</p>
<h3>Netlify Build and Netlify Functions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is famous for how simple and intuitive it is
to create static sites that have hosting, continuous deployment, and CDN without
any hassle. With Netlify Functions, I can go one step further; I can make my
React site a dynamic application using APIs. Their serverless Functions make
creating an API a breeze; I drop a javascript function in a folder, deploy, and
I have an API.</p>
<p>Serverless is great for its smaller upfront costs (for low traffic, you are
usually still in free tier range) and zero infrastructure management needs.
Pay-as-you-go is a risk if you go too fast, but that’s not something I am
expecting. With Netlify Functions encapsulating the not that simple AWS Lambda
Functions, it has the extra bonus of keeping me away from the AWS Management
Console interface.</p>
<p>I have a fast CRUD app deployed in my domain, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<h3>Fauna</h3>
<p><a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> is a distributed NoSQL database that is very well
suited to plug into serverless applications. NoSQL, with its flexible schema, is
a blessing for building new projects that will change a lot and quickly. I am
not building a typical social network; I am implementing original ideas that
might or might not work, that have changed and will continue to change as my own
ideas evolve and I get users' feedback. The data structure will reflect that. I
am a Javascript developer; I like how javascript notates its objects; it is
easier for me to understand and change a JSON object. It is also the obvious
solution for going serverless.</p>
<p>I have a safe, reliable, and fast database, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<p><em>update: In the first version of this post I was using Userbase as
authentication solution. Since then, I decided to concentrate more on FaunaDB
tech, including their built-in user authentication.</em></p>
<h3>Putting everything to work</h3>
<p>Quid Sentio core entity is the journal entry. An entry can contain text, audio
recorded by the user, an image, a mood number selected from a range from -100 to
100, and custom tags. Each entry can also be shared and commented by friends.
This data looks like this for the user:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-01.png" alt="Text entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-02.png" alt="Audio entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-03.png" alt="Image entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-04.png" alt="Mood entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-05.png" alt="Tags entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-06.png" alt="Sharing entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-07.png" alt="Commenting entry screenshot"></p>
<p>The entry data is pretty suitable for a JSON structure, as I have to fit all of
these, with its inherent grouping, in one database item. Images and audios are
stored at AWS S3, their URLs are stored at the database item too.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that I can -- and I will -- add more types of content that
the user can add to an entry. Audio, image, and custom tags were all added after
I launched the alpha version. I still consider video, maybe stickers, or other
more creative inputs that I learn from my users. The flexibility of adding more
properties to an entry while keeping it backward-compatible comes much more
naturally to NoSQL.</p>
<p>Quid Sentio is also social. The user creates an entry in their journal and can
then choose with whom, among their friends, they want to share it and allow to
comment on it. The user will also view all of their friends’ entries that were
shared with them. Each entry contains its permissions of access and list of
comments.</p>
<p>I keep the user’s list of friends as one of the profile properties that I keep
in a "Users" collection in FaunaDB. After user authentication I can access it
and then I can keep it in the state of my application. It is basically a list of
userIds, so no big deal. The tricky thing is to make the request that returns
only the entries from those friends who are authorized to be seen by the user.</p>
<p>This is where FQL shines. FQL is FaunaDB’s own query language, but I could use
GraphQL (also supported by FaunaDB) with similar results. I can easily create a
query from a Netlify Function that only brings the authorized entries without
the need of writing a lot of code with the logic required to not expose
unauthorized entries to the client. So it ends up being pretty fast and simple
to get the user’s friends’ entries and show this:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I had many technical obstacles between me and the social network that I wanted
to build. Then modern services started to arrive, one by one, and, with more
ease than expected, I got it done. I create-react-apped an app, deployed with
Netlify, wrote Netlify functions for the basic operations, integrated with
Fauna's NoSQL serverless database, including its built-in user authentication,
inserted a Stripe handled checkout page and voilà. The only thing in front of me
now is my vision. And I have all my cognitive resources preserved to reach it.
Or to be consumed trying to write smart comments on Hacker News. Only time will
tell.</p>

<p>My brain basks in this planning process. It feels so productive, but it involves minimal mental effort.</p>
<p>Time and time again this cycle occurs. When it comes to getting down to real work, the euphoric rush fades. It turns out planning is easy and action is hard.</p>
<p>Before long, my interest dies down and it’s onto the next topic. And so the cycle continues.</p>
<p>This happened until I heard a story of two men learning to fish. The first fisherman heads to the marina and buys the best fishing boat money can buy. He specs out a custom carbon fiber rod and spends thousands on a deep-water GPS. He spends time reading up on different casting, reeling, and baiting techniques. A few months later, he feels ready to fish.</p>
<p>But by the time he casts his first line, the second fisherman has sucked the lake dry. </p>
<p>On day one, the second fisherman grabbed a shitty rod, sliced up a hot dog, and started fishing. Every day he honed his technique, finding bait which worked a little better or a spot that had a few more nibbles. After three weeks of iteration, he found the winning combo.</p>
<p>Before long, he was hauling in hundreds of fish every day. From there he opened a restaurant to sell his fresh fish. And then he opened a fishing school to teach others his craft. All while the first fisherman gathered gear.</p>
<p>The moral of this story?</p>
<p>Get to action as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong> When you find yourself gathering gear, grab a shitty rod and start fishing.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a minimal static website and blog using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and deploy it on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. To goal is to start simple with a minimal set of features and add more functionality later as needed. I will also explain why I decided to use a static site generator and why I chose Pelican. If you are not interested in the first part, you can directly jump to the <a href="#how-to">How To section</a> of the tutorial.</p>

    </a></p><p>The I Want To Read More website generated with Pelican</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Why static site generator?</h2>
<p>When I <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog/building-a-product-in-the-open/">started building I Want To Read More</a> I wanted to launch a prototype quickly <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/building-the-prototype" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a>, so I could validate the idea. This meant avoiding as much complexity as possible. Using a static site generator and going serverless <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/buidling-serverless" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a> seemed like the best way to achieve this.</p>
<p>A static site generator uses template files to define the structure and design of the site. The content, like for example the blog posts, is stored separately, usually in Markdown format. When the generator builds the site, the final HTML files are generated by combining the templates and the content files. This allows you to avoid code duplication and to be able to focus on the content when writing. Many static site generators are explicitly focused on blogs.</p>
<p>The big advantage of statically generated sites is that their hosting is simple and cheap. The web server simply needs to serve the generated HTML pages. Compared to dynamic content management systems (CMS), like <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> or <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>, static sites are safer, faster and consume less resources. That's why you can find many static site hosting providers that offer generous free plans like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">AWS S3</a>. Dynamic sites are usually either paid (<a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>) or offer a more limited free tier. For example, using the free plan, you cannot have a custom domain on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> and have very limited bandwidth on <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>.</p>
<p>Some more advanced features may be easier to implement in a CMS, like for example sophisticated publishing systems. Our goal here, though, is to get something up and running quickly and cheaply.</p>
<p>You will also need some technical knowledge to set everything up, but the effort is worth it. It this tutorial I will show you how you can remove a lot of the complexity in the process. I will also provide you with templates so you can create a simple site with a blog with minimal effort.</p>
<h2>Why I chose Pelican?</h2>
<p>There are literally hundreds of static site generators, so how do you choose one? My approach here was to go for one that is implemented in a language I'm already familiar with. While you will not need to write code to configure the generator, you will probably have some experiences with the tools of the particular language. I decided to go with a Python based static site generator, but here are some ideas for other languages as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python - <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, <a href="https://www.getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>, <a href="https://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a></li>
<li>Ruby - <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.bridgetownrb.com/">Bridgetown</a>, <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a></li>
<li>JavaScript - <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing to consider is if the site generator has a particular focus. Some are more suitable for blogs, while other specialize in project documentation. Choose one that is suitable for your use case. For <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a> it was important for me to be able to easily create static pages and a blog.</p>
<p>When choosing a framework, I like to choose a mature and popular project. Such projects have the advantage that there will be a big community and you will easily find solutions to common problems. If you need some specific feature, though, it may be worth checking some of the more specialized options.</p>
<p>I recommend checking <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>, which is a list of static site generators. You can filter the different projects by their programming language and compare them by popularity and specialization.</p>

    </a></p><p>Choosing a static site generator on StaticGen</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After I compared the different Python options, I decided to go with <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. Another popular Python generator is <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a>, but it seems to be specialized for project documentation, instead on blogs. <a href="https://www.getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> and <a href="https://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a> had much less start on GitHub, which I find to be a good proxy for popularity.</p>
<p>In the next section, I will go through the steps that you need to do in order to create a minimal static site with a blog using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. I will also show you how to deploy the site on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> using the free plan.</p>

<h2>How to create a static site and a blog with Pelican?</h2>
<p>I found Pelican's default configuration and theme a bit overwhelming for a simple website. There are just too many features and options that you don't need in the beginning. So, I created a configuration that is stripped down to only the most important things. I personally like an iterative approach, where I quickly create something working end-to-end and build on top of it.</p>
<p>I went through the code of the default <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/notmyidea-cms"><code>notmyidea</code></a> theme and stripped it down as much as possible. You can find the code of my <code>minimal</code> theme in the <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a> GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/tree/minimalistic_pelican_site/website">here</a>. This is the branch where the basic website is created and you can use it as a template for creating your own. Note, that this branch was merged into <code>master</code> and deployed in production. This is really the code used for the <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read Mode</a> website.</p>

    </a></p><p>The minimal website code on GitHub</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>1. Install Pelican</h3>
<p>You can easily install Pelican with <code>pip</code>. You should also choose what markup language you want to use for your content. Pelican supports both <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>, but I went with Markdown since I'm already familiar with it.</p>
<pre><code>pip install pelican markdown
</code></pre>

<h3>2. Create a Pelican project.</h3>
<p>After Pelican is installed, you can create a new project with the <code>pelican-quickstart</code> tool:</p>
<pre><code>pelican-quickstart
</code></pre>

<p>It will ask you several questions like website title, author and URL. You should answer yes to the generation of automation scripts, because they will be useful, when deploying on Netlify. The tool will also offer you configuration for different ways of uploading your website. I rejected all of them because the deployment on Netlify can be easily done when pushing to the git repository. Here is my log of setting up <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a>.</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to pelican-quickstart v4.2.0.

This script will help you create a new Pelican-based website.

Please answer the following questions so this script can generate the files
needed by Pelican.

&gt; Where do you want to create your new web site? [.] .
&gt; What will be the title of this web site? I Want To Read More
&gt; Who will be the author of this web site? Vladimir Haltakov
&gt; What will be the default language of this web site? [en] en
&gt; Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., https://example.com   (Y/n) Y
&gt; What is your URL prefix? (see above example; no trailing slash) https://iwanttoreadmore.com
&gt; Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) n
&gt; What is your time zone? [Europe/Paris] 
&gt; Do you want to generate a tasks.py/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) Y
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using FTP? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using SSH? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using Dropbox? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using S3? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using Rackspace Cloud Files? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages? (y/N) n
</code></pre>

<p>The newly created Pelican site will contain several folders and files that form the skeleton of your site. The following are the most important:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>content</code> - this is where you put your blog articles. You can also add the images that you will include in your posts here.</li>
<li><code>themes</code> - here you have the <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/">Jinja</a> template files that will be used to generate the HTML code as well as your static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript). There are many <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes#pelican-themes">predefined Pelican themes</a>, but you will probably want to create a specific one for your website. It is a good idea to start from an existing theme and modify it.</li>
<li><code>pelicanconf.py</code> - the main configuration file of your site. Here, you can set variables to configure the different Pelican features.</li>
<li><code>publishconf.py</code> - configuration that applies when building the site for publishing.</li>
<li><code>output</code> - the folder where all the generated files will be stored.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Adapting the theme.</h3>
<p>At this stage, you can take my <code>minimal</code> theme as a basis and change it to fit your website. It is stripped down to the most important features and it will allow you to start quickly. You can get the code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/tree/minimalistic_pelican_site/website">here</a>. Below, I will describe how I created it.</p>
<h3>4. Disabling unneeded features.</h3>
<p>I first disabled the generation of several blog pages that I don't need, like for example the archives, tags, categories or authors pages. This can be done in the <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/8070dba10d73478866bda8ae64d898e0634de5cd/website/pelicanconf.py#L38"><code>pelicanconf.py</code></a> file.</p>
<pre><code># Disable unneeded blog features
ARCHIVES_SAVE_AS = ""
AUTHOR_SAVE_AS = ""
AUTHORS_SAVE_AS = ""
CATEGORY_SAVE_AS = ""
CATEGORIES_SAVE_AS = ""
TAGS_SAVE_AS = ""
</code></pre>

<p>Removing these pages means that you don't have to take care of designing the templates for them in your theme. You can of course enable them again later if needed.</p>
<h3>5. Adapting the templates.</h3>
<p>After removing most blog pages, there are only 3 templates that I needed to adapt to my website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/minimalistic_pelican_site/website/themes/minimal/templates/base.html"><code>base.html</code></a> - this template defines the structure of every page. It contains the common header, navigation bar and footer.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/minimalistic_pelican_site/website/themes/minimal/templates/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a> - this is your blog's index page, that contains a list of all your articles. While it is possible to have some featured articles on top, I removed them for now in order to keep things simple.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/minimalistic_pelican_site/website/themes/minimal/templates/article.html"><code>article.html</code></a> - this is the template used to render a blog post. It is a small wrapper around the actual text of the article coming from the Markdown files in the <code>content</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Creating static pages outside the blog.</h3>
<p>The default Pelican setup assumes that your website's index will be your blog's index page. However, for <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a> I wanted to have a landing page that describes the product. The blog is available at <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog">https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog</a>.</p>
<p>To achieve this, you first need to create the template for your landing page …</p></div></div>

<p>With Software as a Service (SaaS) spawning an entire cottage industry of *aaS, it is fair to wonder if some Silicon Valley startup with try and market themselves as becoming a Farming as a Service operation. One key problem is…FaaS has basically been around for decades, albeit with a less slick name: custom farming. </p>



<p>“Custom Farming” is basically an umbrella term for any operation a producer pays for or offers service for in addition to their own operation. Its so ubiquitous that Universities in the Midwest routinely take <a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/crops/html/a3-10.html">surveys</a> to track pricing and monitor changes over years. Need someone to plant a field for you because you are overextended? According to the linked survey, you will look to pay around ~$25 depending on various options.  Agriculture in the U.S. is not in need of a FaaS startup to disrupt the status quo because a very healthy market already exists. As a plus for farmers (and a hindrance to founders looking for walled-garden approaches), the market is very transparent with several Universities publishing annuals surveys to reflect local fluctuations.</p>



<p>That said, the friction could be improved. With most things having an online presence and as farming communities becoming less face-to-face, perhaps an online (and real-time) marketplace connecting people who want work done posting bids and people who can work posting asks for various calendar-dependent activities. One way SV businesses to connect with the Midwest would be Imagery As a Service (IaaS). Farmers have access to drones and satellite imagery from seed and chemical companies (often at a cost $$$), but these seed and chemical companies have access to the same satellite and imagery systems as SV does (I am not aware of an agriculture company launching their own satellite with proprietary sensors). Working with imagery is a well honed skill for many data scientists and automating it into some sort of IaaS for farmers may be an interesting startup or side hustle. </p>



<p>How cool would it be to just upload some GPS coordinates for a field, pay $5 and get the <em>literal</em> most up-to-date image without driving out to the field (although half the fun of farming <em>is</em> going to the field!)? So if you see a startup marketing itself as FaaS, just know that has already been done and all you are paying for is added overhead!</p>

					<p>Ever tried dealing with a large company, only to get stonewalled? You're talking to a black box that repeats “Sorry, that’s against policy” or “I can’t do that”</p><p>But if you can open up that box the picture changes. The moving pieces become visible. Watch how each one ticks, and you’ll start noticing the systems at play.</p><p>Leaders design incentives to be armor plating for the company, protecting its interests.

You know them as customer service. &nbsp;Depending on whether you’re that <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy">company’s customer or their product</a>, customer service’s role varies from “keep them happy with minimal effort” to “get these people off our backs.” They’re the ones companies want you to contact.</p><p>When customer service isn’t being that helpful, look for someone else to complain to. Like the CEO.</p><p>Jeff Bezos is famous for reading all customer emails sent directly to him.

Propelling it faster and faster and faster till it smashed into my team’s inbox at critical velocity. All hands on deck!</p><p>Why did &nbsp;this work? Look at what’s happening behind the scenes. Your message went to someone with just enough time to say "This might be important, I’ll delegate it to the relevant team." And it gets fast tracked through the chain of command</p><p>A funny bit of management psychology comes into play here: If your boss’s boss’s boss tells you to “look into this please,” it jumps to top of your priority list. Usually folks don’t bother to ask if it should be prioritized higher or lower than the large pile already on their plate.</p><p>Achievement unlocked: Teleport to front of line.</p><p>Many businesses have departments tasked with nothing but creating rules other departments must follow. Some of those rules get really weird:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m continuously amazed by how many people have to ask permission to buy a $50 book, yet are empowered to call a meeting that costs tens of thousands of dollars.</p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1103868678389420033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Once I was going on a business trip to help with a conference. My company had instituted a hotel budget of $250 per day. But this was a BIG conference. Hotel prices were jacked up, and only the sketchiest places met that price point.</p><p>The cheaper hotels were 30 minutes away, but then I’d blow the budget for uber rides. I asked if I'd have to cancel my conference trip.</p><p>Manager: “There’s not actually an uber limit”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I booked that distant hotel and took an uber everyday. Now here’s the kicker: the hotel + uber cost <em>more </em>than what I would have paid if I had gotten a hotel walking distance from the venue. But that’s too complicated for the finance department to write formal rules around. Imagine if they prevented people from getting a ride when it was <em>really </em>needed!</p><p>Thus the current policy was born.</p><p>It gets better. When you see the policy’s red lines drawn out, you can walk around them like Danny Ocean’s crew navigating a laser maze. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mr834Cs9ncs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Good sales reps know this and use it to push deals through. Patrick McKenzie <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1284404823572410369">offers an example</a>:</p><p><em>"Suppose you are selling a $100k product to a director who has $100k budgeted for it. You do the dance. Purchasing says they need a 10% discount because We're Big Enough To Always Demand One.</em></p><p><em>Three days later you submit the following: $100k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year of SaaS services. Comes out of software budget. $12k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year commitment to professional services. Comes out of consulting budget.</em></p><p><em>Purchasing is *extremely* likely to approve this."</em></p><p>Did the company hire people who couldn’t do basic math? Of course not.</p><p>They pay people who know <em>where their time will be most valuable</em>. Writing a policy that covers 95% of situations will take them 10 hours and saves the companies $XX millions of dollars. Writing policies to cover the remaining 5% will take ten times as long and only offer a tiny fraction of the savings. The cost/benefit analysis doesn’t work out.</p><p>If you learn what was left in that missing 5% you'll have the advantage.</p><p>Remember there is no “company.” All of the company’s decisions are actually individuals acting within their own set of incentives. The “company” is what emerges when those individual incentives interact with each other.</p><p>You don’t have to fight the entire company.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/there-is-no-spoon.png" alt=""><figcaption>There is no company</figcaption></figure><p>Hidden incentives exist in your own company too. Is a team resisting doing something you’re asking for? Learn why. Find the fulcrum point. New paths will emerge.</p><p>For example, I used to struggle with people not responding to my emails when I tried to get their approval on a change I was making. “People are busy,” my manager explained. “Instead say, ‘I’ll be making this change on Thursday unless you object before then.’” </p><p>I started doing that.</p><p>The objections were rare. The complaints, non-existent.</p><div><p>You get the best results when you adapt your approach to the person you’re facing</p><p>Now replace "person" with "team" or "department"</p><p>The sentence remains true</p></div><p>Figuring out each team's incentives can <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer#research-like-a-detective">take some detective work</a>. But once you understand them you’ll learn what makes each group tick. As you get better at this you’ll find yourself able to collaborate with others much more effectively and Get Stuff Done.</p>

		<p><em>See <a href="https://www.ollielovell.com/ollielearns/spaced-repetition-incremental-reading-anki-dendro/">this post</a> on how I now combine spaced repetition software with incremental reading software to supercharge my learning! If you haven’t heard of Anki before you may like to read my intro to it <a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/tot/spaced-repetition-software-the-most-efficient-way-to-remember-anything/">here</a>, how I’ve been using it in my classes <a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/olliesclassroom/instructional-approach-2017/">here</a>, or the previous post in this series on Anki advanced use <a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/edtech/anki2/">here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Cloze deletion</strong></p>
<p>Cloze deletion is a highly effective way of studying content, and making flash cards.</p>
<p>Imagine there’s a question that you would like to be able to remember and recall.</p>
<blockquote><p>in 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first artificial satellite, the Sputnik 1.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cloze deletion allows you to set up Anki cards where some of the key information is blanked out, and your job is to retrieve it. The above sentence could end up looking like this in a cloze deletion card.</p>
<blockquote><p>In ____, the&nbsp;____________ launched the world’s first artificial satellite, the ___________.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a number of ways to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1, Simple cloze deletion</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1392166854">Cloze Deletion Single Card</a>&nbsp;Anki add-on. this allows you to make simple, single cards. Sometimes you might want to have multiple cloze deletions in a single card, or make different cloze deletions appear for different cards, based upon the same core phrase or piece of information. The following video clearly shows how to do this. <span id="more-1818"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRY1rYxd9EM?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Method 2, Cloze deletion and type the answer</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you might want to ensure that you know how to spell the missing words correctly (e.g., Sputnik vs. Sputnic), in this case, it could be helpful to set up anki so that you have to&nbsp;<em>type</em> the answer in. The following video shows you how to do this.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Before you edit the card template (i.e., type in the code) it’s important that you clone the ‘cloze’ card type, otherwise you’ll modify all cloze deletion cards that you have. I’ve included some screenshots at the bottom of this post to show you how to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>, The code given by the person in the video isn’t complete. See the info and the screenshot below this vid to see how exactly to set it up.</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FnrigOzpJQo?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the front you should have: {{cloze:Text}}&lt;br&gt;{{type:cloze:Text}}</p>
<p>On the back you should have:&nbsp;{{cloze:Text}}&lt;br&gt;{{type:cloze:Text}}{{Extra}}</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1829"><img src="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-03-10 at 3.57.29 pm" width="592" height="535" srcset="https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm.png 592w, https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm-300x271.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px"></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 3, Image Occlusion for cloze deletion</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, such as when you are using info from slides and you’re having issues with the formatting of mathematical equations and the like, it may be better off to just take a screenshot of the info and create cloze deletions from the image itself. This would be helpful if you were trying to remember a list of info, such as is demonstrated in the following.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1819"><img src="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion.png" alt="Ollie Lovell, Oliver Lovell, Anki, Cloze deletion" width="732" height="371" srcset="https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion.png 732w, https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion-300x152.png 300w, https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion-624x316.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px"></a></p>
<p>In a case like this you can use the<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094"> image occlusion enhanced</a> add-on, as demonstrated in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYAMkwBdOas?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can just include the formula part as a screenshot, and use the cloze deletion function on the screenshot. Anki has no issue using cloze deletion on the images : )</p>
<p><strong>Method 4, Cloze Overlapper (more detailed and complex)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/969733775">TheCloze Overlapper</a>&nbsp;Anki addon is good for longer lists of info. A great tutorial video for this is shown below. Happy studying!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
				<!-- To a functional programmer like me, every programming language is a functional language. --> 

<p>Functional programming is a style of programming and modern languages support this style to a greater or lesser extent. In this article I want to explain how programming in a functional style provides you with powerful abstractions to make your code cleaner. I will illustrate this with examples in Raku and Python, which as we will see are both excellent languages for functional programming.</p>

<h2>Raku: a quick introduction</h2>

<p>The code examples in this article are written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>. I assume most people are familiar with Python, but Raku is less well known, so I will explain the basics first. The code in this article is not very idiomatic so you should be able to understand it easily if you know another programming language.</p>

<p>Raku is most similar to <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>. Both languages are syntactically similar to C/C++, Java and JavaScript: block-based, with statements separated by semicolons, blocks demarcated by braces, and argument lists in parentheses and separated by commas. The main feature that sets Perl and Raku apart from other languages is the use of sigils ('funny characters') which identify the type of a variable: <code>$</code> for a scalar, <code>@</code> for an array, <code>%</code> for a hash (map) and <code>&amp;</code> for a subroutine. Variables also have keywords to identify their scope, I will only use <code>my</code> which marks the variable as lexically scoped. A subroutine is declared with the <code>sub</code> keyword, and subroutines can be named or anonymous:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>square</span> (<span>$x</span>) {
    <span>$x</span>*<span>$x</span>;
}
<span># anonymous subroutine </span>
<span>my</span> <span>$anon_square</span> = <span>sub</span> (<span>$x</span>) {
    <span>$x</span>*<span>$x</span>;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Python this would be:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>square</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span>

<span># anonymous subroutine </span>
<span>anon_square</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<!-- Raku also has [twigils](https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-Twigil), secondary sigils that influence the scoping of a variable. For this article, the only twigil used in the code is `.` which is used to declare a role or class attribute with automatically generated accessors (like `$.notes` in the example below). -->

<p>Raku supports sigil-less variables, and uses the <code>\</code> syntax to declare them. For more on the difference between ordinary and sigil-less variables, see <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Sigilless_variables">the Raku documentation</a>. For example (<code>say</code> prints its argument followed by a newline):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>x</span> = <span>42</span>; <span># sigilless</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$y</span> = <span>43</span>; 
<span>say</span> <span>x</span> + <span>$y</span>; 
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the code in this article, I will use the sigil-less variables whenever possible.</p>

<p>Raku has several types of sequence data structures. In the code below I will use <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/list">lists and arrays</a> and <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Range">ranges</a>. The main difference between a list and an array in Raku is that a list is immutable, which means that once created, it can't be modified. So it is a read-only data structure. To 'update' an immutable data structure, you need to create an updated copy. Arrays on the other hand are mutable, so we can update their elements, extend them, shrink them etc. All updates happen in place on the original. </p>

<p>Raku's arrays are similar to Python's lists and Raku's lists are similar to Python's tuples, which are also immutable. Apart from the syntax, ranges in Raku are similar to ranges in Python, and both are immutable.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>@array1</span> = <span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>; <span>#=&gt; an array because of the '@' sigil</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>array2</span> = [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>]; <span>#=&gt; an array, because of the '[...]'</span>

<span>my</span> \<span>range1</span> = <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>; <span>#=&gt; a range 1 .. 10</span>
<span>my</span> <span>@array3</span> = <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>; <span>#=&gt; an array from a range, because of the '@' sigil</span>

<span>my</span> \<span>list1</span> = <span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>; <span>#=&gt; a list</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$list2</span> = (<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>); <span>#=&gt; also a list</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>list3</span> = |(<span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>);  <span>#=&gt; an array from a range because of the '|' flattening operation</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The equivalent Python code would be</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>list1</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>))</span> <span>#=&gt; a list from a tuple</span>
<span>list2</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>];</span> <span>#=&gt; a list, because of the '[...]'</span>

<span>range1</span> <span>=</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; a range 1 .. 10</span>
<span>list3</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>));</span> <span>#=&gt; a list from a range</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Other specific bits of syntax or functionality will be explained for the particular examples. </p>

<h2><em>A function, by any other name</em> — functions as values</h2>

<p>Functions are the essence of functional programming. As I explained in my article <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/everything-is-a-function">"Everything is a function"</a>, in a proper functional language, all constructs are built from functions. </p>

<p>All modern programming languages have a notion of functions, procedures, subroutines or methods. They are an essential mechanism for code reuse.
Typically, we think of a function as something that operates on some input values to produce one or more output values. The input values can be globally declared, attributes of a class or passed as arguments to the function. Similarly, the output values can be returned directly, to global variables, as class attributes or by modifying the input values. </p>

<p>To benefit most from functional programming, it is best if functions are <em>pure</em>, which means that a call to the function always produces the same output for the same inputs. In practice, this is easier to achieve if the function only takes inputs as arguments and returns the output directly, but this is not essential.</p>

<p>The crucial feature of functional programming is that the input and output values of a function <em>can themselves be functions</em>. So functions must be values in your language. Sometimes this is called "functions must be first-class", and a function that takes and/or returns a function is sometimes called a "higher-order function". </p>

<p>If functions are values, it follows that we can assign them to variables. In particular we will assign them to the arguments of other functions. But we can also assign them to ordinary variables. </p>

<p>Let's consider the following function, <code>choose</code>, which takes three arguments <code>t</code>, <code>f</code> and <code>c</code>. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>choose</span> (\<span>t</span>, \<span>f</span>, \<span>d</span>) {
    <span>if</span> (<span>d</span>) {<span>t</span>} <span>else</span> {<span>f</span>}
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>def</span> <span>choose</span> <span>(</span><span>t</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>d</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>t</span> 
  <span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>f</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>First let's call <code>choose</code> with strings as values for the first two arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>tstr</span> = <span>"True!"</span>;
<span>my</span> \<span>fstr</span> = <span>"False!"</span>;

<span>my</span> \<span>res_str</span> = <span>choose</span>(<span>tstr</span>, <span>fstr</span>, <span>True</span>);

<span>say</span> <span>res_str</span>; <span>#=&gt; says "True!"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>tstr</span> <span>=</span> <span>"True!"</span>
<span>fstr</span> <span>=</span> <span>"False!"</span>

<span>res_str</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span><span>(</span><span>tstr</span><span>,</span><span>fstr</span><span>,</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>res_str</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says "True!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now let's try with functions as arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>tt</span> (\<span>s</span>) { <span>say</span> <span>"True {s}!"</span> }
<span>sub</span> <span>ff</span> (\<span>s</span>) { <span>say</span> <span>"False {s}!"</span> }

<span>my</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span> = <span>choose</span>(<span>&amp;tt</span>, <span>&amp;ff</span>, <span>False</span>);

<span>say</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span>; <span>#=&gt; says &amp;ff</span>
<span>res_f</span>(<span>"rumour"</span>); <span>#=&gt; says "False rumour!"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>def</span> <span>tt</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>):</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"True "</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>ff</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>):</span>  
  <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"False"</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span><span>)</span>

<span>res_f</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span><span>(</span><span>tt</span><span>,</span><span>ff</span><span>,</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>res_f</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says &lt;function tt at 0x7f829c3aa310&gt;</span>
<span>res_f</span><span>(</span><span>"rumour"</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says "False rumour!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So our function <code>choose</code> took two functions as its first two arguments, and returned a function. In Raku we need the <code>&amp;</code> sigil on the function names because otherwise they would be evaluated: a bare function name like <code>tt</code> is the same as calling the function without arguments, <code>tt()</code>. By assigning this function to a variable (<code>res_f</code>), we can now call <code>res_f</code> as a function and it will eventually call <code>tt</code> or <code>ff</code> depending of the choice.</p>

<h2>Functions don't need a name</h2>

<p>Now, if we can assign functions to variables, they don't really need a name themselves. So our functions can be anonymous. Most languages support anonymous functions. In functional languages they are usually called <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/everything-is-a-function/">"lambda functions"</a>. In Raku, we have two ways to create anonymous functions:</p>

<p>Using the <code>sub (...)</code> syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>tt</span> = <span>sub</span> (\<span>s</span>) { <span>say</span> <span>"True {s}!"</span> };
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or using the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#index-entry-pointy_blocks">'pointy block' syntax</a>, which is a little bit more compact:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>ff</span> = -&gt; \<span>s</span> { <span>say</span> <span>"False {s}!"</span> };
</code></pre></div>
<p>Python uses the <code>lambda</code> keyword:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>tt</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>s</span> <span>:</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"True "</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span> <span>)</span>
<span>ff</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>s</span> <span>:</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"False "</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span> <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So now we can say</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span> = <span>choose</span>(<span>tt</span>, <span>ff</span>, <span>True</span>);

<span>say</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span>; <span>#=&gt; says sub { }</span>
<span>res_f</span>(<span>"story"</span>); <span>#=&gt; says "True story!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When we print out the variable to which the function is bound, Raku returns <code>sub { }</code> to indicate that the variable contains a function.</p>

<p>In Python:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>res_f</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span><span>(</span><span>tt</span><span>,</span> <span>ff</span><span>,</span> <span>True</span><span>);</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>res_f</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says &lt;function &lt;lambda&gt; at 0x7f829b298b80&gt;</span>
<span>res_f</span><span>(</span><span>"story"</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says "True story!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Examples: <code>map</code>, <code>grep</code> and <code>reduce</code></h2>

<p>Functions of functions have many uses, and I just want to highlight three examples that are available readily in Raku: <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code> and <code>grep</code>. Python has <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>, and provides <code>reduce</code> via the <code>functools</code> module. What these functions have in common is that they offer an alternative to <code>for</code>-loops over lists.</p>

<h3><code>map</code> : applying a function to all elements of a list</h3>

<p><code>map</code> takes two arguments: a function and a list. It applies the function to all values in the list in order and returns the results, for example to square all values in a list:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = <span>map</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {<span>x*x</span>} , <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Python we need to explicitly create the tuple, but apart from the syntax differences, the structure is quite the same:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the functional alternative to the more conventional <code>for</code>-loop:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = [];
<span>for</span> <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {
    <span>res</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>x*x</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>):</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that in both Raku and Python we need to use a mutable data structure for the <code>for</code>-loop version, whereas the <code>map</code> version uses immutable data structures.</p>

<h3><code>grep</code> : filtering a list</h3>

<p><code>grep</code> (called <code>filter</code> in Python) also takes arguments, a function and a list, but it only returns the values from the list for which the function returns <code>true</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = <span>grep</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> { <span>x</span> % <span>5</span> == <span>0</span> }, <span>1</span> .. <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>,</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>31</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can of course write this using a <code>for</code>-loop and an <code>if</code>-statement, but that again requires a mutable data structure:  </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = [];
<span>for</span> <span>1</span> .. <span>30</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {
    <span>if</span> (<span>x</span> % <span>5</span> == <span>0</span>) {
    <span>res</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>x</span>);
    }
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>31</span><span>):</span> 
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>):</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>What's nice about <code>map</code> and <code>grep</code> is that you can easily chain them together:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>grep</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> { <span>x</span> % <span>5</span> == <span>0</span> }, <span>map</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {<span>x*x</span>}, <span>1</span><span>..</span><span>30</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>,</span><span>map</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>,</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>31</span><span>))))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is because <code>map</code> and <code>grep</code> take a list and return a list, so as long as you need to operate on a list, you can do this by chaining the calls.</p>

<h3><code>reduce</code> : combining all elements of a list into a single value</h3>

<p><code>reduce</code> also takes a function and a list, but it uses the function to combine all elements of the list into a single result. So the function must take two arguments. The <em>second</em> argument is the element taken from the list, and the first argument is used as a state variable to combine all …</p></div></div>

"""

Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the study of chaos—states of dynamical systems whose apparently-random states of disorder and irregularities are often governed by deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnectedness, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly effect, an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state (meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions). A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in Texas.

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to errors in measurements or due to rounding errors in numerical computation, can yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. This can happen even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior follows a unique evolution and is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as:

"Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future."

Chaotic behavior exists in many natural systems, including fluid flow, heartbeat irregularities, weather and climate. It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with artificial components, such as the stock market and road traffic. This behavior can be studied through the analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincaré maps. Chaos theory has applications in a variety of disciplines, including meteorology, anthropology, sociology, physics, environmental science, computer science, engineering, economics, biology, ecology, pandemic crisis management, and philosophy. The theory formed the basis for such fields of study as complex dynamical systems, edge of chaos theory, and self-assembly processes.

<p>Artificial intelligence is one of the most talked-about topics in the tech landscape due to its potential for revolutionizing the world. Many thought leaders of the domain have spoken their minds on artificial intelligence at various occasions in different parts of the world. Today, we will list down the top&nbsp;quotes on artificial intelligence&nbsp;that have an in-depth meaning and are/were ahead of time.</p>



<p>Here is the list of&nbsp;top quotes about artificial intelligence: –</p>



<h3><strong>Quote On Artificial Intelligence By Stephen Hawking</strong></h3>



<blockquote><p>“Success in creating effective AI, could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just don’t know. So we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and side-lined, or conceivably destroyed by it. Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. It could bring great disruption to our economy.”</p><cite>Stephen Hawking, 2017</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stephen Hawking’s&nbsp;quotes on artificial intelligence&nbsp;are very optimistic. Some of the famous quotes on artificial intelligence came from Hawking in 2014 when the BBC interviewed him. He said artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.</p>

<h3>Elon Musk On Artificial Intelligence</h3>



<blockquote><p>I have been banging this AI drum for a decade. We should be concerned about where AI is going. The people I see being the most wrong about AI are the ones who are very smart, because they can not imagine that a computer could be way smarter than them. That’s the flaw in their logic. They are just way dumber than they think they are.</p><cite>Elon Musk, 2020</cite></blockquote>



<p>Musk has been very vocal about artificial intelligence’s capabilities in changing the way we do our day-to-day tasks. Earlier, he had stressed on the fact that AI can be the cause for world war three. In his Tweet, Musk mentioned ‘it [war] begins’ while quoting a news, which noted Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, though on the ruler of the world; the president said the nation that leads in AI would be the ruler of the world.</p>

<h3>Mark Zuckerberg’s Quote</h3>



<p>Unlike negative quotes on artificial intelligence by others, Zuckerberg does not believe artificial intelligence will be a threat to the world. In his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10103911836230631/?t=1031">Facebook live</a>, Zuckerberg answered a user who asked about people like Elon Musk’s opinion about artificial intelligence. Here’s what he said:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I have pretty strong opinions on this. I am optimistic. I think you can build things and the world gets better. But with AI especially, I am really optimistic. And I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios. I just don’t understand it. It’s really negative and in some ways, I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.”</p><cite>Mark Zuckerberg, 2017</cite></blockquote>



<h3>Larry Page’s Quote</h3>



<blockquote><p>“Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We’re nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on.”</p><cite>Larry Page</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stepped down as the CEO of Alphabet in late 2019, Larry Page has been passionate about integrating artificial intelligence in Google products. This was evident when the search giant announced that the firm is moving from ‘Mobile-first’ to ‘AI-first’.</p>



<h3>Sebastian Thrun’s Quote On Artificial Intelligence</h3>



<blockquote><p>“Nobody phrases it this way, but I think that artificial intelligence is almost a humanities discipline. It’s really an attempt to understand human intelligence and human cognition.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Sebastian Thrun</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sebastian Thrun is the co-founder of Udacity and earlier established Google X — the team behind Google self-driving car and Google Glass. He is one of the pioneers of the self-driving technology; Thrun, along with his team, won the Pentagon’s 2005 contest for self-driving vehicles, which was a massive leap in the autonomous vehicle landscape.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tesla.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla</a>, the world’s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles, accused and filled a suit against its electric vehicle automaker rivals —&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://rivian.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivian</a>.</p>



<p>According to Tesla, Rivian is stimulating employees of Tesla to leave their job and encouraging them to pouch the company’s trade secrets, confidential, and property information while leaving the firm.</p>



<p>Tesla also indicted Rivian by alleging that the rival startup has already recruited four of its employees who stole highly sensitive information while leaving. The largest automaker mentioned in the new suit that a total of 178 former Tesla employees are working at Rivian. And of which around 70 of them directly joined the rival startup.</p>

<p>While Tesla is blaming its rival, Rivian defended itself with a statement to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tesla-takes-aim-at-rivian-in-lawsuit-alleging-trade-secret-theft-poaching-talent/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tech Crunch</a>: “We admire Tesla for its leadership in resetting expectations of what an electric car can be. Rivian is made up of high-performing, mission-driven teams, and our business model and technology are based on many years of engineering, design and strategy development. This requires the contribution and know-how of thousands of employees from across the technology and automotive spaces. Upon joining Rivian, we require all employees to confirm that they have not, and will not, introduce former employers’ intellectual property into Rivian systems. This suit’s allegations are baseless and run counter to Rivian’s culture, ethos and corporate policies.”</p>



<p>With investments from Amazon and Ford, Rivian is a significant player in the electric vehicle industry and had bagged high-profile deals from Amazon. The largest e-commerce company has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian, which are yet to be delivered by the Tesla rival. R.J Scaringe founded Rivian in the year 2009, and today the company has footprints in many countries such as Canada, California, Plymouth, Normal, San Jose, United Kingdom, and more.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Tesla alleged that its employees steal sensitive information and leave the company and joined rivals organizations such as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.xiaopeng.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xpeng Motors</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://zoox.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoox Inc</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It must have been about a year ago, just after I moved from San Francisco here to New York. I was having steaks with my good friend and soon to be business partner, Kyle. Kyle and I transferred to Vanderbilt at the same time, were placed a few doors down from each other in an awful, mold-ridden dorm which we would both soon move out of (and which was knocked down by the time we graduated), and spent our first night on campus drinking whiskey together with another future friend of ours. Over the next few years, Kyle and I hung out a lot, studied together often and discussed a lot of business and investing ideas while procrastinating from said studies. This past year, a few months after the aforementioned dinner, we bought in 50/50 on a real estate investment, a multi-family duplex in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. I never imagined that I would become a Kentucky homeowner, but because of Kyle, now I am. Our investment is going very well so far and I am confident that Kyle and I will be doing a lot more together in the future, real estate or otherwise.</p>



<p>Going back to that dinner, over my ribeye and glass of wine and his filet and Coca-Cola, Kyle and I discussed where each of us were and where we wanted to be headed, in terms of our careers mostly as the majority time consumers of our lives in general. I was working as many hours as ever in investment banking and he had recently moved on from banking and into equity research. In discussing his decision to make the transition, he made a somewhat obvious point that I think tends to get overlooked and underestimated nonetheless, which is why I am choosing to write about it today. That is, he pointed out that we should be thinking about the value of our time in terms of hours rather than years.</p>



<p>Most career-oriented jobs advertise salary to their prospective applicants. I used to think of my income in investment banking as a combination of salary and bonus because the latter comprises an unusually large percentage of most people’s overall annual income in the industry (i.e. the end of year bonuses are often more or less equal to annual salaries for top performers).</p>



<p>After Kyle’s comment, I started to think about income more often in terms of dollars per hour. Think about the following hypothetical. All other things equal, would you rather work 80 hours per week for $100,000 or 40 hours per week for $75,000? The former pays $24 / hour and the latter pays $36 / hour. Most logical people would opt for the latter as the difference in the hourly rate is just too great. The decision would be more difficult however if the 40 hours per week job only paid $60,000. In that case, the income per hour of the 40 hours per week job ($29) would still be greater than that of the 80 hours per week job ($24), but the larger difference in annual salary becomes a bit more difficult of a pill to swallow ($100,000 – $60,000 = $40,000). I am not advocating for choosing one job over the other, even in this idealistic situation where everything else was somehow exactly equal, which of course in real life it would never be. I am simply advocating for people to more deliberately consider the time they expect to give in exchange for a salary when considering an offer.</p>



<p>Further on the hypothetical situation above, even if you were to take the 40 hour per week job at a salary of $75,000 and you are one of the increasingly popular breed of millennials who wants to work 80 hours per week still, that is totally fine. You can spend your time working on things that you are interested in and passionate about, invest your time in learning new skills and/or subjects, or if short-term income is your primary focus, get another part-time job or create your own side hustle for evenings and/or weekends. If you make more than $12 / hour for 40 additional hours of work, you would make more annually than the 80 hour per week job that paid $100,000.&nbsp; For comparison’s sake, the much debated minimum wage for food service workers in New York City is $15 / hour…</p>



<p>Moreover, as with most other things, when it comes to your free time, or disposable time as I prefer to call it, scarcity increases value. The less disposable time you have, the more precious it becomes, the more valuable it becomes. Think about it in extremes. If you had no disposable time (free time to do with what you wish), you would not be able to sleep at your own discretion (this is unfortunately a reality for some people who work long hour jobs or multiple jobs including night shifts). As such, most people would demand more money in exchange for working their 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hour of the day than the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup>. They probably have at least six hours set aside to work anyway and will take what they can get in terms of income in exchange for that time. The 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hours on the other hand cut into the human necessity of sleep and for that reason they are very valuable. The same goes for the less extreme hours in between. There must be a gradual increase in the value of every hour between those two ranges of hours. The less disposable time you have, the more important are the things you have to cut for work such as time for meals with family or friends, time to go to the gym, time to read a book or watch TV, and time to just relax or enjoy your weekends.</p>



<p>Of course, this point about considering income per hour rather than annual salary cannot be considered in a vacuum because there are a host of other related factors that are also important in making decisions around what to do for money. For example, if the day to day composition of your work includes a number of tasks, practices and activities that you like or even love doing or that you might be doing anyway if you had the freedom to choose what to do with your time, then you should be willing to accept less income in exchange for your time because there is less of a difference in the enjoyment or utility of what you have to do for that income versus what you might otherwise be doing.</p>



<p>Once in a while you hear people who love their jobs say things like “I feel like I have never worked a day in my life” or “If money was not a thing, I would be doing exactly the same work that I am doing now”. Those people are mostly outliers and exceptions for now, but the optimist in me convinces the pragmatist that one day in the not too distant future it will become much more common as more menial tasks become automated and some form(s) of universal basic income increasingly provides people with more disposable income/time to live their lives as they please. In the meantime, most of us will continue to feel that we have to make some sort of trade off involving time for money. I suggest that we think about that trade-off in terms of hours as opposed to years. Forget salary.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of this year, I decided it was finally time to port my website from a <span>PHP</span>-based <span>CMS</span><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> to a JavaScript-based Static Site Generator (<span>SSG</span>). This was for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>After starting out as a ‘full-stack’ developer, I now work solely on the front end: If I need to write custom functionality, I don’t want to write it in <span>PHP</span> when I could be writing it in JavaScript.</li>
<li>I don't need the layers of abstraction or the complexity of a <span>CMS</span> — markdown files are where I'm most comfortable writing content and I’d be happy never to touch a My<span>SQL</span> database or <span>wysiwyg</span> editor again.</li>
<li>I want to improve my site’s performance: static <span>HTML</span> files are, 99 times out of 100, going to be faster than pages built on the fly.</li>
<li>Lastly, there’s the cost benefit: A <span>LAMP</span> stack<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> server costs money every month; Netlify’s free tier (300 build minutes/month) should comfortably cover a personal blog at zero cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I'd decided I want a Static Site Generator and it needed to use JavaScript (which ruled out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>), I narrowed the list down to two very different contenders:</p>
<h2>“I heard Gatsby was good”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">the official site</a>, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. It has a data layer powered by GraphQL and it outputs everything to static files, allowing you to host it pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When I first heard that I could write React and use this cool new GraphQL thing, while still outputting static pages that work without JavaScript, I was keen to give it a try. <em>‘This sounds like Progressive Enhancement but without the effort’</em> I thought. Unfortunately, as with most things that sound too good to be true, after some investigation, there turned out to be a catch. Here's what happens the first time a user visits a Gatsby site:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user requests a page</li>
<li>The server sends the statically-generated <span>HTML</span> document to the user’s browser and the browser starts rendering the page.</li>
<li>Now that the <span>HTML</span> document has arrived, the JavaScript bundle (including the React library and any other JavaScript required to render the page) begins downloading, parsing and compiling in the background</li>
<li>The JavaScript is ready to run — the whole <span>DOM</span> gets “hydrated”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> with React components</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s something not quite right here — Gatsby forces you to load the same page again, but as React components; until that extra step is complete, none of the elements that require JavaScript (e.g. buttons, menus, custom inputs) are actually interactive.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have any interactive elements (excluding links, they work without JavaScript, even in Gatsby), your users still have to download this JavaScript anyway, for the sole purpose of turning your site into a Single-Page Application (<span>SPA</span>), which has its own drawbacks as we'll soon discover.</p>
<p>This extra bloat seems to go against one of the main reasons for moving to a <span>SSG</span>: making pages faster. Your flashy Gatsby site might be fast on a $2,000 MacBook, but for someone using a budget smartphone on a 3G connection, it's visible yet unresponsive, for 15 seconds while the user waits for the JavaScript to load. It’s also unnecessarily draining their battery <em>and</em> data allowance.</p>
<p>If the browser needs to parse 296kb of JavaScript<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> to show a list of blog posts, that’s not Progressive Enhancement, it’s using the wrong tool for the job. To use the rather fuzzy website/web app distinction — React is for building web apps: interactive UIs that need to respond to user input or fetch data in real time — your blog is just a website <em>and that’s fine</em>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility in single-page applications</h2>
<p>A single-page application is a website that forgoes the traditional method of navigation on the web, i.e. loading new content by loading a new <span>HTML</span> document; instead it uses JavaScript features like <span>AJAX</span> and the History <span>API</span> to swap in new content without triggering a page load. The goal is to increase perceived performance and make the website feel more like a 'native' app (something you’d download from an app store). The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>If you’re an accessibility-conscious developer building a single-page application, you may try to emulate the browser’s behaviour using JavaScript. Gatsby attempts to handle this for you by including a <code>RouteAnnouncer</code> component. This uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><span>ARIA</span> live region</a> to announce the <code>title</code> or <code>h1</code> of the page, alerting users of screenreader software to navigation changes. This approach, however, is not without its problems: there are still outstanding issues around <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21059">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20801">localisation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the Single-page applications have inherent accessibility issues around navigation, but it’s worth bearing in mind that using a front-end framework can make other aspects of accessibility harder too. In a February 2020 survey of one million homepages, WebAIM found that those using React had 5.7% more accessibility errors than average; while those using Vue had 25% more<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the frameworks caused these errors, but there’s a strong correlation between more JavaScript and worse accessibility.</p>
<h2>Does a blog even need JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Chances are, the first webpage your ever built performed far better than some of the pages you've built since — it consisted of an <span>HTML</span> file and some <span>CSS</span>; maybe it had a few unoptimised images but they didn’t stop the page from loading. If you're anything like me, the moment you started adding JavaScript was the moment the performance of your webpage took a nosedive. Not all bytes are made equal: an image is going to take far less time to decode and render to the screen than the equivalently sized JavaScript file would take to parse, compile, and execute<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can do some incredible things, but it’s incredibly easy to jump to using it too early in development, when you could be using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> instead. Consider the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">rule of least power</a>: Don’t use the more powerful language (JavaScript) until you’ve exhausted the capabilities of less powerful languages (<span>HTML</span>). To me, it feels that turning a blog into a JavaScript Single-page application is introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to come across as a specific attack on Gatsby. There are some clever people behind it, who’ve acknowledged many of the issues mentioned in this article and are trying to solve them. A statically rendered and hydrated page is still infinitely better than a fully client-side rendered React app (like those generated by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>) which is useless without JavaScript. I do have issues with the way that its JavaScript-heavy, Single page app approach is advertised, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-30-why-gatsby-is-better-with-javascript/">including in Gatsby’s own marketing</a>, as appropriate for any kind of website. Client-side JavaScript has a cost and developers should be aware of it.</p>
<h2>Building a Gatsby site with less JavaScript</h2>
<p>This brings me to a dilemma: developing sites with Gatsby is an all-round great experience; but Developer Experience (DX) should always be secondary to User Experience (UX) — how do I build a Gatsby site without the issues inherent in Gatsby’s JavaScript-heavy approach? By removing as much of it as possible, of course. Fortunately, there are some fantastic efforts going on within the Gatsby community to build faster, more lightweight sites:</p>
<p>Firstly, you could save a few kilobytes by swapping React for Preact, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">gatsby-plugin-preact</a>. I use this on <a href="https://component.gallery/">the Component Gallery</a> and it works seamlessly, instantly knocking ~30kb off the JavaScript payload.</p>
<p>If you want to take a more drastic approach, there's a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript/">plugin which removes <em>all</em> the Gatsby JavaScript from your Gatsby site</a>. Now we’re getting somewhere! You can continue to write react components and GraphQL, even use a CSS-in-JS library (as long as it outputs CSS or inline styles), <em>without</em> sending any JavaScript to the browser. Most of the problems with Gatsby can be solved by throwing out all of its client side JavaScript. <a href="https://gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog.netlify.com/low-tech/">Gatsby Starter Low Tech Blog</a> uses the no-javascript plugin, as well as some other techniques including converting all images to greyscale, to help you create an incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient blog.</p>
<h2>Starting from scratch with Eleventy</h2>
<p>At this point I felt like something was wrong — using a framework that heavily pushes client-side JavaScript, but removing all of that JavaScript seemed like a pretty convoluted way to build a website. I wanted to see whether I could build a fully-featured blog with zero client-side JavaScript and instead of using a plugin to remove it, I wasn’t going to add it in the first place. This is where my other contender comes in:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> encourages you to build your site how you want to. You use the technology you're most comfortable with and it sticks to generating your pages. Eleventy gives you the option of mixing and matching ten different templating languages, including markdown, nunjucks, and liquid; this meant I could copy and paste my old twig templates from Craft, change the file extension, and with some minor tweaks have them running in Eleventy. Instead of adapting my front-end build process to a new bundler I could just drop in my existing webpack file and <code>src</code> folder. Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">concurrently</a> package I can run my build script at the same time as Eleventy’s <code>serve</code> process.</p>
<p>Like Gatsby, Eleventy also has an ecosystem of plugins (which is small, but rapidly growing). I’ve picked out a few that I've used which have enabled me to add features without adding client-side JavaScript:</p>
<p>When displaying code snippets in a post, it’s common to include language-specific syntax highlighting. There are a few JavaScript libraries out there that can do it, the most popular of which seems to be <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> — normally you’d run this in the client, but because …</p></div></div>

Apple in a support bulletin said that using tapes/physical covers could eventually degrade the webcam and damage the MacBook display. The Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211148">advisory</a> says that MacBook users should just rely on the indicator light that shows when the camera is active.</p><p>Apple explains that using a webcam cover, such as a small piece of tape, could actually break down features like the ambient light sensor or True Tone. Apple may have its reasons to warn MacBook users, but Librem Linux smartphones and laptop makers don’t like Apple’s advice. In a <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/apple-has-no-tolerance-for-webcam-covers/">blog post</a>, Purism Chief Security Officer, Kyle Rankin says Apple’s advice is ‘discouraging’ from a security point of view. Rankin says that Apple wants its users to follow the “just trust us” policy which is very unsound cybersecurity advice to give.</p><p>“While this advice is consistent with Apple’s overall “just trust us” approach to security, it completely misses the point of why people used webcam covers to begin with: to claw back the tiniest bit of control over their privacy from hardware and software companies,” Rankin says in the post.</p><p>Rankin is very critical of this sort of cybersecurity approach and says that Apple is doing more harm than good by telling MacBook users to rely on it for cybersecurity. Rankin says that if MacBook owners follow Apple’s advisory, they will lose control over their security.</p><p>“The fundamental flaw with Apple’s approach is that it takes all control over security and privacy away from you. To be secure you must fully trust Apple and their security measures and if anything ever happens to violate that trust, such as a security exploit, there isn’t much you can do about it,” Rankin adds.</p><p>Rankin says that Purism believes in totally opposite concept for providing security to users. While Purism offers users <strong>Kill Switches</strong> to kill their microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, webcam, etc. and be in control, Apple wants to be the sole security custodian for such services. “Apple and Purism take completely different approaches to security. Apple’s approach is to require customers to hand over all trust and control to Apple and depend upon Apple for all of their security. Purism’s approach is to give customers control over their own computers and provide security without depending upon Purism. Webcam security is a great lens through which to view these completely opposite approaches,” Rankin adds, “In the end, your privacy and your computer should belong to you, not the vendor that sold it.”</p><p>Purism is a Linux hardware maker and sells Linux smartphones, tablets, and laptops under the Librem brand. All Librem devices are designed to protect privacy and freedom by avoiding the Intel Active Management Technology. All Librem laptops feature hardware kill switches for the microphone, webcam, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>Python web scraping is a field where you can collect data from online web pages. For many different purposes. Mostly for data mining for data analysis, data science and machine learning. However there are so many use cases for web scraping. </p>



<p>Web scraping is a bit of a dark art in the sense, that with great power comes great responsibility. Use what you learn in this tutorial only to do ethical scraping. In this python web scraping tutorial, we will scrape the worldometer website for some data on the pandemic.</p>



<p>Then do something with that data. Since this is a web scraping tutorial we will mainly be focusing on the scraping portion and only very little be touching on the data processing side of the tutorial.</p>



<p>We will be using a python library called <strong>beautifulsoup </strong>for our web scraping project. It is important to note that beautiful soup isn’t the silver bullet in web scraping. </p>



<p>It mainly is a wrapper for a parse which makes it more intuitive and simpler to extract data from markup like HTML and XML. If you are looking for something which can help you navigate pages. </p>



<p>Also be able to crawl websites then beautiful soup won’t do that on it’s own. However it is good to note that there are other options such as <strong>python scrapy</strong> as well. There will later on be a tutorial on scrapy as well. </p>



<p>Then you can actually decide which is the best for your particular project or use case. Before we can get started let us start by installing beautifulsoup. So for this we will need to create a virtual environment. </p>



<p>If you are using windows, mac, Linux the procedure should be very similar. So here we go:</p>



<h2>Python beautifulsoup: installation</h2>



<p>Let us create a virtual environment for our project. So if you are on windows open a powershell or cmd prompt. If on mac or linux open up a terminal and execute the following commands.</p>



<pre><code lang="powershell">python -m virtualenv bsenv</code></pre>



<p>Where bsenv will be the folder where our virtual environment will be. You can now run:</p>



<p>Windows:</p>



<pre><code lang="powershell">.\bsenv\Scripts\activate</code></pre>



<p>Linux/Mac:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">source bsenv/bin/activate</code></pre>



<p>This should now activate your virtual environment like this and we can now install beautifulsoup.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-39.png" alt="python web scraping beautifulsoup installation virtualenv" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-39.png"></figure>



<p>Run this to install on linux/mac/windows:</p>



<pre><code lang="powershell">pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests</code></pre>



<p>To test that beautifulsoup is installed. Run a python terminal and import beautifulsoup like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-40.png" alt="python web scraping beautifulsoup installation" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-40.png"></figure>



<p>If that worked for you then great you are installed! Let us now start with the most basic example. </p>



<h2>Beautifulsoup: HTML page python web scraping / parsing</h2>



<p>So here is an HTML example we will work with to just start with. So go ahead and paste this into your favorite editor and save it as <strong>index.html</strong>.</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Joe&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Suzanne&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Jane&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;John&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;69&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
       
    &lt;/table&gt;
    
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Once you have saved that. Create a new python script called: scrape.py.  Here is the code we going to use to get some info from our index.html file.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
data = open("index.html").read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')

print(soup.title.text)</code></pre>



<p>This very basic bit of code will grab the title tag text from our index.html document. This is how the output will look if you run it.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-41.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-41.png"></figure>



<p>Let’s now try do something a little more complicated like grabbing all the tr tags. Then displaying all the names in the tags.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
data = open("index.html").read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')

trs = soup.find_all('tr')

for tr in trs:
    td = tr.findChildren("td")
    
    if not td: 
        continue
    print(td[0].text)</code></pre>



<p>Your output should look something like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-42.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-42.png"></figure>



<p>To explain how this code works. We are loading up the html with a basic file read in python. We then instantiate the BeautifulSoup parser with our html data. We then do a find_all on all the tr tags.</p>



<p>I then loop over all the trs and find all the td children. If the td children don’t exist we skip over this item. Then finally we just get the first element and print the text contained in those tags.</p>



<p>So, so far so good pretty simple right. Let’s now look at getting some data using a request. The url we will be using to get some data is: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</p>



<h2>Python web scraping: From a web page url</h2>



<p>To be able to load up the html from the web page we will use the requests library in python and then feed that data to beautiful soup. Here is the code.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
data = requests.get('https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/').text

soup = BeautifulSoup(data,'html.parser')
data_table = soup.find('table', id='main_table_countries_today')
rows = data_table.find_all('tr')
datalist = []
for row in rows:
    rowlist = []
    
    try:
        tds = row.find_all('td')
        for td in tds:
            rowlist.append(td.text)
        datalist.append(','.join(rowlist))
    except:
        pass
print('\n'.join(datalist))</code></pre>



<p>So if you run this it will output a csv set of data for us will be generated like this which we can use for some data analysis or maybe even some type of other data source. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-43.png" alt="beautiful soup requests data" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-43.png"></figure>



<p>Here is how the code works. So first thing is we import requests, so that we can make web requests using our python script. We then call requests.get to get the url and at the end choose to get the text version of the data. </p>



<p>So that we get the raw html data. Next we add this to our BeautifulSoup object and use the html.parser. Then we select a table with the id=main_table_countries_today. </p>



<p>How we find this is you will open the page in your chrome or firefox browser head over to the table, then right click and select the inspect option. </p>



<p>If you have done this you should be able to find this id main_table_countries_today. So once we have that we will use data_table variable we just created. Which will now contain the data table element. </p>



<p>Then we simply do a find all to find all the tr elements in that table. Next we loop over all our rows and just initialize an empty rowlist to store our data in. After that we open a try except block, so that if any of the elements are missing in our data we won’t error out our script. </p>



<p>The try except will basically skip over the critical errors so our script can continue reading the html. In the try except we do a find all for all the td tags, then finally loop over them to add the columns to our rowlist.</p>



<p> Outside of that loop we join them on a comma. Then outside of that loop we add the row to our datalist and then finally outside of that loop we join our datalist rows to create a csv like print out of the data.</p>



<p>If you look at the code, that was pretty simple to just gather some basic table form data. Scraping like this needs to really be done carefully as you don’t want to overwhelm anyone’s server. </p>



<p>So once again this is only for educational purposes and what you do with this is at your own risk. However for basic scraping on your own websites which you own you can collect data etc.</p>



<p>If you are wanting to learn web scraping it is best to do as much of it offline, so you can rapidly test and don’t have to do a request to a server the whole time. </p>



<p>For that you can just save a particular web page using your browser and work on that html file locally.</p>



<p>Let us look at another example of some web scraping before we end off this tutorial.</p>



<h2>Python web scraping: creating a blog post feed</h2>



<p>So you may want to create a blog post feed. For whatever reason, maybe you are building an application. </p>



<p>Which needs to retrieve basic data from a blog post for a social sharing website. Then you can use beautifulsoup to parse some of this data.</p>



<p>To show you how this can work let us scrape some data from my own blog from the home page.</p>



<p>So we will use the url: https://generalistprogrammer.com</p>



<p>So for this I have saved the html page using my browser like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-44.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-44.png"></figure>



<p>I suggest if you want to follow along you should do the same. Please don’t do a request to my server in python. So save that as <strong>gp.html</strong>.</p>



<p>Now here is a pro tip. You might get this really strange error with this code.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
data = open('gp.html').read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data,'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify())</code></pre>



<p>C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.8_3.8.1520.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\lib\encodings\cp1252.py”, line 23, in decode<br>return codecs.charmap_decode(input,self.errors,decoding_table)[0]<br>UnicodeDecodeError: ‘charmap’ codec can’t decode byte 0x8d in position 18403: character maps to</p>



<p>If you are getting this error, it is because our reader is not reading this as utf8. So to fix this we modify our code to look like this.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
data = open('gp.html',encoding='utf8').read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data,'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify())</code></pre>



<p>So we basically just added encoding=’utf8′. Then when you run it you will get the output of the web page.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-45.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-45.png"></figure>



<p>So great you may have noticed I used the .prettify at the end that just makes this html more structured and easier to read using beautifulsoup. So let’s now follow the same procedure as before by using our inspector tool in chrome / firefox like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-46.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-46.png"></figure>



<p>That will open up the inspector tool like this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-47.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-47.png"></figure>



<p>So this helps us find the entry point for our scraper. So we want to look at all articles. Then you will notice the article tag slightly above this tag. So let’s start …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this blog post, we look at three approaches for eliminating duplicate objects from Arrays.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="eliminating-duplicates-from-arrays">Eliminating duplicates from Arrays&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Eliminating duplicate values from Arrays is simple – as long as the values are primitive (and therefore compared by value):</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> values = [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>, <span>'jane'</span>];
<span>const</span> uniqueValues = [...new <span>Set</span>(values)];
assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueValues,
  [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>]);
</code></pre>
<p>However, that approach doesn’t work with the following data because a Set would consider each object to be unique:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> members = [
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
  },
];
</code></pre>
<h2 id="approach-1%3A-building-a-new-array-without-duplicates">Approach 1: building a new Array without duplicates&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code><span>const</span> uniqueMembers1 = [];

<span>for</span> (<span>const</span> m <span>of</span> members) {
  <span>if</span> (!containsMember(uniqueMembers1, m)) {
    uniqueMembers1.push(m);
  }
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>containsMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.find(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers1,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>We only add an object from <code>members</code> to <code>uniqueMembers1</code> if it doesn’t already exist in that Array. That’s why the earlier Jane with ID <code>'10yejma'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-2%3A-using-.filter()">Approach 2: using <code>.filter()</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers2 = members.filter(
  <span>(<span>m, index, ms</span>) =&gt;</span> getIndexOfMember(ms, m) === index);

<span><span>function</span> <span>getIndexOfMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.findIndex(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers2,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p><code>getIndexOfMember()</code> returns the first index where a member appears. We tell <code>.filter()</code> to only keep the members at those indices. That’s why the first Jane “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-3%3A-a-map-from-unique-keys-to-members">Approach 3: a Map from unique keys to members&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueKeyToMember = <span>new</span> <span>Map</span>(
  members.map(<span><span>m</span> =&gt;</span> [m.first+<span>'\t'</span>+m.last, m])); 
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers3 = [...uniqueKeyToMember.values()];

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers3,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>If an object that is added to the Map has the same unique key as a previous object, it replaces that object. That’s why the later Jane with ID <code>'1y15hhu'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h3 id="variants-of-approach-1-and-approach-2">Variants of approach 1 and approach 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We use a Set to record unique keys of members that we have visited. If the key of the current member is already in that Set, then we don’t push it (approach 1) or filter it out (approach 2).</p>
<p>This may help with large Arrays because we don’t have to search them. On the other hand, creating keys and maintaining a Set affects performance negatively.</p>

                                                        <p><strong>EU supports joint strategy for innovation in research and teaching with a total of five million euros</strong></p>

<p>The university network ENLIGHT is to become a European University. The EU will fund the network of nine research-intensive universities, among them the University of Göttingen, with five million euro for a three-year period. In the coming semester, the partners will begin implementing a joint strategy for innovation in research and higher education. ENLIGHT stands for <em>European university Network to promote equitable quality of Life, sustainability and Global engagement through Higher education Transformation</em>. The EU’s main aim behind the pilot call “European Universities” was to transform the European Higher Education sector. Twenty-four university networks were selected in the second round of this initiative.</p>

<p>“The goals we set ourselves within this consortium are highly ambitious, but I am convinced that this is the right way forward,” says Professor Reinhard Jahn, President of the University of Göttingen. “Even after years of European integration there are still obstacles to collaborative research and the Europeanisation of higher education. In order to tear down these remaining barriers, we need consortiums wherein we trust each other and can dare to experiment. I am proud that Göttingen is among the universities that will shape this reform process in Europe and look forward to tackling this challenge.”</p>

<p>In joint structures and through innovative teaching opportunities, the nine ENLIGHT universities will empower students with the right knowledge and skills to become engaged citizens and professionals and respond to the major, complex societal challenges of the 21st century.</p>

<p>“ENLIGHT is unique in its geographical, economic, social, cultural and linguistic diversity,” says Professor Hiltraud Casper-Hehne, Vice-President for Internationalisation at the University of Göttingen. “The dedicated and sustainable commitment to this goal has been worth it! We will now use this breadth and wealth to create new, flexible and international research and study opportunities tailored to everyone's individual needs. In so doing, we will lay the foundation for the next generation of genuine Europeans.”</p>

<p>"This is a great success for the University of Göttingen and its international partners," explains Björn Thümler, Minister for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony. "This award means that Lower Saxony is clearly placed on the map of European science. This is whole-hearted confirmation of our course to strongly focus on European initiatives. The support of the University of Göttingen in the application process has paid off.”</p>

<p>ENLIGHT unites the universities of the Basque Country, Bordeaux, Galway, Gent, Göttingen, Groningen, Tartu, Uppsala and Comenius University in Bratislava. Cross-border collaboration is as central to the joint strategy as a focus on the locality, where the partners intend to address societal challenges in a local context. ENLIGHT will pilot new learning formats across five focus themes: Climate Change, Health and Well-Being, Inequalities, Digital Revolution, Energy and Circularity. In these areas, students will engage with researchers, citizens and professionals from their communities. They will discuss problems and solutions, examine innovation potential and promote diversity. The exchange within the network will allow European solutions to emerge from these local contexts, and in this process, students will also be involved. This constitutes a completely new form of university education.</p>

<p>The ENLIGHT project was established in close collaboration with the student representatives of all ENLIGHT universities. The Student Network will continue to play a central role to meet the needs of current and future student generations.</p>

<p>ENLIGHT's ambition extends much further than the three-year project lifespan. In the long-term, ENLIGHT wants to create an open accessible space without barriers between the nine universities for researching, learning, teaching and working together. ENLIGHT intends to develop a model that not only applies within Europe, but also has a true impact worldwide and makes a substantial contribution to strengthen Europe's role in the world.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is going to outline the procedure for setting up a Haskell development environment.</p>

<p>This post differs from most posts around setting up a Haskell development environment in the sense that it does not directly jump into Cabal or Stack. Instead, it first provides some background information that makes it possible to understand the basics of the development environment in Haskell, the different moving parts, and how those come together in turning Haskell source code into an executable which can then be run.</p>

<!--end_excerpt-->

<p>A separate post will build on the information provided here and show how to make use of Stack or Cabal.</p>



<p>Haskell programs are compiled native executable binaries. Haskell programs are compiled. Software is written in Haskell, which by the way is a high-level programming language that is first converted into machine language which then gets executed. In this sense Haskell is different from languages like JavaScript and Python, which are interpreted language, but similar to languages like Java and Go, which are also compiled. It should be noted that it is also possible to run Haskell programs like an interpreted language. We get to this pretty soon, but most of the time, Haskell programs are compiled.</p>

<p>The Haskell compilation process produces native executive binaries. The keyword here is native. This means once a Haskell program is compiled, it does not need anything else to be able to run. This is similar to languages like Rust and Go, which also produce native executive binaries, but differ from languages like Java and C#, which requires a runtime to be first installed on the target computer before the compiled program can be executed.</p>

<p>The job of converting software written in a high-level programming language to machine language is done by a compiler. In the case of Haskell, the compiler is known as <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC (The Glasgow Haskell Compiler)</a>. Sometimes GHC is referred to as The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler or Glorious Haskell Compiler. GHC is not the only Haskell compiler in existence; others exist. Some other ones are <a href="https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc">UHC (Utrecht Haskell Compiler)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Lemmih/lhc">LHC (LLVM Haskell Compiler)</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Hugs">HUGS (Haskell User´s Gofer System)</a>. Even though other compilers exist, GHC has evolved to be the one true Haskell compiler, as it is by far the most used Haskell compiler. The other compilers are not as used or they are no longer supported. Haskell Wiki <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Implementations">lists</a> all the other compilers for Haskell.</p>

<p>To setup, a Haskell development environment is then essentially setting up GHC, and be able to use it to compile Haskell source code to executable binaries.</p>



<p>The method for getting GHC installed varies depending on the operating system and the installation methods. This post will only focus on the installation on macOS and Linux (Ubuntu).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are already familiar with Haskell, this is the point where you probably expect Cabal or Stack to be introduced. But on the contrary, Cabal/Stack won’t be mentioned yet. The idea is to install GHC without these tools in other to get a feeling of how things work behind the scenes. Doing this will also help appreciate the motivation for tools like Cabal and Stack exist within Haskell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For installation on macOS <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/"><code>ghcup</code></a> will be used while installation will be done using the Software repository on Ubuntu (Linux).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ghcup">What is ghcup</h2>

<p><code>ghcup</code> describes itself as the Haskell (GHC) toolchain installer. Similar in scope to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup">rustup</a> with Rust. It provides the mechanism to install all the necessary components required for developing Haskell. Together these components are sometimes referred to as the Haskell toolchain, of which GHC is a constituent.</p>



<p>Haskell toolchain is often used to refer to all the necessary components required for developing Haskell. It comprises of the compiler together with other auxiliary tools. As at the writing of this post, here is a list of what makes up the toolchain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>GHC: The Haskell batch compiler. This is used for compiler source files into either libraries and executables.  Libraries are used as dependencies in other Haskell projects while executable are binaries that are run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GHCi: An interactive Haskell interpreter, which allows making use of GHC in an interactive environment. GHCi is what powers the Haskell REPL</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>runghc: A shell script that allows running Haskell as a script. Find more information on how to use <code>runghc</code> <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runghc.html">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>runhaskell: Similar to <code>runghc</code> but allows the ability to swap the Haskell compiler from <code>ghc</code> to something else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Haddock: a tool for automatically generating documentation from annotated Haskell source code. See <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haddock/">here</a> for more information about Haddock.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hp2ps: a profile tool for Haskell programs. See <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html">here</a> for more on how to use the Haskell profiler.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hpc: a code coverage tool for Haskell programs. See <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_program_coverage">here</a> for more information.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will like to note that the official download page is quite confusing. It refers to a Haskell platform which in reality no longer exists. It also presents 3 different classes of Haskell installation: Minimal Installation/Stack/Haskell Platform which is also really not the best representation of the process of installing Haskell. It is best to view installing Haskell as the process of getting the Haskell toolchain. This can be done by building from source, using a tool like <code>ghcup</code> or <code>Cabal</code> or <code>Stack</code>. The confusing state of the Download page is known, as can be seen from these two issues that have been created to resolve the problem: <a href="https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/issues/12">Download page is confusing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/pull/14">Download Page: Rearrangement of sections</a>. As of the writing of this post, these issues have not been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we know what the Haskell toolchain comprises of, let us look at some of the ways of getting it installed. First, we start by looking at how to install it on a Mac using <code>ghcup</code>.</p>



<p>There are a couple of ways to install <code>ghcup</code> but the most straightforward approach is to follow the instructions found at <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/</a>.</p>

<p>The installation process involves executing a command in the terminal and then following the prompts.</p>

<p>After installation is done, you will see a final prompt that may look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Installation is done!

To run `ghc` and cabal, you need to adjust your PATH variable.
You may want to source '/Users/schooloffp/.ghcup/env' in your shell
configuration to do so (e.g. ~/.bashrc).

Detected bash shell on your system...
If you want ghcup to automatically add the required PATH variable to "/Users/schooloffp/.bashrc"
answer with YES, otherwise with NO and press ENTER.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is about making the related binaries <code>ghcup</code> installed available in the terminal, so it is a good idea to type YES and have the <code>.bashrc</code> modified.</p>

<p>Note that on macOS, the <code>.bashrc</code> file is not run automatically. See this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/13019">stackoverflow answer</a>. This means the above process of <code>ghcup</code> modifying the <code>.bashrc</code> will not suffice to get the needed binary available in the terminal. There are a couple of ways to remedy this. One way, as also noted in the StackOverflow thread is to add <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> to the <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>

<p>Once this is done, you can then execute the installed binaries from the terminal. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.8.4

ghci --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.8.4

haddock --version
Haddock version 2.23.0, (c) Simon Marlow 2006
Ported to use the GHC API by David Waern 2006-2008

</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>An inquisitive reader would have also found that apart from the binaries listed as a constituent of the Haskell Toolchain, a cabal binary has also been installed as part of the <code>ghcup</code> installation process. This is indeed the case. <code>ghcup</code> also installs cabal, but we will ignore cabal for now and talk about it in subsequent posts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It should be noted that the above method of using <code>ghcup</code> to install the Haskell toolchain will also work on a Linux machine. The main objective of the installation process is to get necessary binaries unto the system, and most Linux distribution has a procedure for this already using their software package management. Hence it is also possible to use those to install the Haskell toolchain.</p>

<p>The only drawback is that most of the time, the Haskell version found in the official software repositories of most Linux distribution would be out of date.</p>

<p>At least that is the case with Ubuntu. Running the command below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> apt-cache policy haskell-platform
haskell-platform:
Installed: (none)
Candidate: 2014.2.0.0.debian4
Version table:
2014.2.0.0.debian4 500
500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/universe amd64 Packages
500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/universe i386 Packages
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Shows that the Debian package version found for Haskell is 2014.2.0.0.debian4. And if we find this on <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/haskell-platform/2014.2.0.0.debian4">Launchpad</a> we see this was uploaded 2016.</p>

<p>On installation by running <code>sudo apt-get install haskell-platform</code>, we can then check the version of <code>ghc</code> that is installed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.0.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This shows version 8.0.2. Even though, at the time of writing this post, the most recent version is 8.8.4</p>

<p>Therefore to get the latest Haskell Toolchain installed on Ubuntu, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~hvr/+archive/ubuntu/ghc">hpv’s PPA</a> can be used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some background information about what PPA (Personal Package Archive) is, see <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA">Packaging/PPA</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding the PPA:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hvr/ghc
sudo apt-get update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Installing Haskell:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// sudo apt-get install ghc-x.y.z where x.y.z is the version to install

sudo apt-get install ghc-8.8.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the moment of writing this, even though 8.8.4 is the recent version, the latest version available via install via the PPA is version 8.8.3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The installation processes put the binaries in <code>/opt/ghc</code></p>



<p>Hence to have the binary available in the terminal, updating the path is one approach:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:/opt/ghc/bin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After which the installation can …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tr><td>
	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lFjinlwpcHY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </p>
<p>Whenever you’re learning a new tool, you should first ask yourself two questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does this tool exist?</li>
<li>What problems does this tool solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can’t answer both of those questions, you may not need the tool in the first place. Let’s take those questions and apply them to webpack.</p>
<h3>Why does Webpack exist?</h3>
<p>At its core, webpack is a module bundler. It examines all of the <a href="https://ui.dev/javascript-modules-iifes-commonjs-esmodules/">modules</a> in your application, creates a dependency graph, then intelligently puts all of them together into one or more bundle(s) that your <code>index.html</code> file can reference.</p>
<div data-language="md"><pre><code>App.js ---&gt;     |         |
Dashboard.js -&gt; | Bundler | -&gt; bundle.js
About.js ---&gt;   |         |</code></pre></div>
<h3>What problem is webpack solving?</h3>
<p>Historically when building a JavaScript application, your JavaScript code would be separated by files (these files may or may not have been actual modules). Then in your <code>index.html</code> file, you’d have to include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to every JavaScript file you had.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not only was this tedious, but it was also error-prone. There were the obvious issues like typos or forgetting to include a file, but more than that, the order of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags mattered. If you loaded a script that depended on React before loading the React script, things would break. Because webpack (intelligently) creates a bundle for you, both of those problems go away. You don’t have to worry about forgetting a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and you don’t have to worry about the order.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>dist/bundle.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As we’ll soon see, the “module bundling” aspect is just one part of webpack. If needed, you’re also able to tell webpack to make certain transformations on your modules before adding them to the bundle. Examples might include transforming SASS/LESS to regular CSS or “modern JavaScript” to ES5 that the browser can understand.</p>
<h3>Installing webpack</h3>
<p>Assuming you’ve initialized a new project with npm, there are two packages you need to install to use webpack, <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> webpack webpack-cli --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<h3>webpack.config.js</h3>
<p>Once you’ve installed <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>, it’s time to start configuring webpack. To do that, you’ll create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file that exports an object. Naturally, this object is where all the configuration settings for webpack will go.</p>

<p>Remember, the whole point of webpack is to “examine all of your modules, (optionally) transform them, then intelligently put all of them together into one or more bundle(s)” If you think about that process, in order to do that, webpack needs to know three things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The entry point of your application</li>
<li>Which transformations, if any, to make on your code</li>
<li>The location to put the newly formed bundle(s)</li>
</ol>
<h4>The entry point</h4>
<p>Whenever your application is composed of modules, there’s always a single module that is the entry point of your application. It’s the module that kicks everything off. Typically, it’s an <code>index.js</code> file. Something like this.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>index<span>.</span>js
  imports about<span>.</span>js
  imports dashboard<span>.</span>js
    imports graph<span>.</span>js
    imports auth<span>.</span>js
      imports api<span>.</span>js</code></pre></div>
<p>If we give webpack the path to this entry file, it’ll use that to create the dependency graph of our application (much like we did above, except… better). To do that, you add an <code>entry</code> property to your webpack config which points to your entry file.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4>Transformations with Loaders</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file, the next thing we need to tell it is what transformations to run on our code. To do this, we’ll use what are called “loaders”.</p>
<p>Out of the box, when webpack is building its dependency graph by examining all of your <code>import</code>/<code>require()</code> statements, it’s only able to process JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> auth <span>from</span> <span>'./api/auth'</span> 
<span>import</span> config <span>from</span> <span>'./utils/config.json'</span> 
<span>import</span> <span>'./styles.css'</span> 
<span>import</span> logo <span>from</span> <span>'./assets/logo.svg'</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>There’s a very good chance that you’re going to want your dependency tree to be made up of more than just JS and JSON files - i.e., you’re going to want to be able to import <code>.css</code> files, <code>.svg</code> files, images, etc, as we’re doing above. This is where “loaders” can help us out. The primary purpose of a loader, as the name suggests, is to give webpack the ability to process more than just JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<p>The first step to adding any loader is to download it. Because we want to add the ability to <code>import</code> <code>.svg</code> files in our app, we’ll download the <code>svg-inline-loader</code> from npm.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> svg-inline-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we need to add it to our webpack config. All of the information for your loaders will go into an array of objects under <code>module.rules</code>.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now there are two pieces of information we need to give webpack about each loader. First, the type of file we want to run the loader on (in our case, all <code>.svg</code> files). Second, the loader to use on that file type (in our case, <code>svg-inline-loader</code>).</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll have an object with two properties, <code>test</code> and <code>use</code>. <code>test</code> will be a regex to match the file path and <code>use</code> will be the name of the loader we want to use.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we’ll be able to import <code>.svg</code> files. What about our <code>.css</code> files though? Let’s add a loader for that as well. We’ll use the <code>css-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> css-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we can import <code>.svg</code> and <code>.css</code> files. However, there’s still one more loader we need to add to get our styles to work properly. Right now, because of our <code>css-loader</code>, we’re able to <code>import</code> <code>.css</code> files. However, that doesn’t mean those styles are being injected into the DOM. What we really want to do is <code>import</code> a CSS file then have webpack put all of that CSS in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the DOM so they’re active on the page. To do that, we’ll use the <code>style-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> style-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice, because we now have two loaders for our <code>.css</code> rule, we change <code>use</code> to be an array. Also, notice that we have <code>style-loader</code> before <code>css-loader</code>. This is important. Webpack will process those in reverse order. So <code>css-loader</code> will interpret the <code>import './styles.css'</code> line then <code>style-loader</code> will inject that CSS into the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we just saw with <code>style-loader</code>, loaders can do more than just allow you to <code>import</code> certain file types. They’re also able to run transformations on files before they get added to the final output bundle. The most popular is transforming “next generation JavaScript” to the JavaScript of today that browsers can understand using <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="nofollow">Babel</a>. To do this, you can use the <code>babel-loader</code> on every <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> babel-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.(js)$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'babel-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>There are loaders for just about anything you’d need to do. You can check out the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/" rel="nofollow">full list here</a>.</p>
<h4>The output</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file and what loaders to use, the next thing we need to tell it is where to put the bundle it creates. To do this, you add an <code>output</code> property to your webpack config.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

<span>const</span> path <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>)</span>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.(js)$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'babel-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  output<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    path<span>:</span> path<span>.</span><span>resolve</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>'dist'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    filename<span>:</span> <span>'index_bundle.js'</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So the full process looks something like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>webpack grabs the entry point located at <code>./app/index.js</code>.</li>
<li>It examines all of our <code>import</code> and <code>require</code> statements and creates a dependency graph.</li>
<li>webpack starts creating a bundle, whenever it comes across a path we have a loader for, it transforms the code according to that loader then adds it to the bundle.</li>
<li>It takes the final bundle and outputs it at <code>dist/index_bundle.js</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>We’ve seen how you can use loaders to work on individual files before or while the bundle is being generated. Unlike loaders, plugins allow you to execute certain tasks <strong>after</strong> the bundle has been created. Because of this, these tasks can be on the bundle itself, or just to your codebase. You can think of plugins as a more powerful, less restrictive version of loaders.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a few examples.</p>
<h4>HtmlWebpackPlugin</h4>
<p>Earlier we saw that the main benefit of webpack was that it would generate a single bundle for us that we could then use to reference inside of our main <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
<p>What <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> does is it will generate this <code>index.html</code> page for us, stick it inside of the same directory where our bundle is put, and automatically include a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag which references the newly generated bundle.</p>
<p>So in our example, because we’ve told webpack to name the final bundle <code>index_bundle.js</code> and put it in a folder called <code>dist</code>, when <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> runs, it’ll create a new <code>index.html</code> file, put it in <code>dist</code>, and include a script to reference the bundle, <code>&lt;script src='bundle_index.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>. Pretty nice, right? Because this file is being generated for us by <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code>, even if we change the output path or …</p></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-bypassing-sb-using-emfi/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-bypassing-sb-using-emfi/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Our research during the last few years definitely points out our interest in <strong>Fault Injection (FI)</strong> attacks. We produced numerous publications, which we presented at both <em><strong>academic</strong></em> and <em><strong>security</strong></em> conferences. Among other research, we showed that <strong>FI</strong> is an effective technique for for <strong>bypassing Secure Boot</strong> (<a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2016/2016_BlackHat-EU_Bypassing-Secure-Boot-Using-Fault-Injection_NT-AS.pdf">2016</a>, <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2019/2019_BlueHat-IL_Hardening-Secure-Boot-on-Embedded-Devices-for-Hostile-Environments_NT-AS-CM.pdf">2019</a> and <a href="https://raelize.com/upload//research/2019/2019_Designing-Secure-Boot-Securely_NT-AS.pdf">2019</a>) and <strong>escalating privileges on Linux</strong> (<a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2017/2017_FDTC_Escalating-Privileges-in-Linux-using-Fault-Injection_NT-CM.pdf">2017</a>, <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2017/2017_BlueHat-v17_KERNELFAULT-R00ting-the-Unexploitable-using-Hardware-Fault-Injection_CM_NT.pdf">2017</a> and <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2017/2017_Hardwear-io_Escalating-Privileges-in-Linux-using-Fault-Injection_NT-CM.pdf">2017</a>).</p>
<p>Like many of you, our curiosity is constantly sparked and therefore we cannot prevent ourselves from injecting glitches. This post will be your first peek into our new and exciting <strong>FI</strong> research.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2019/2019_PoC_Using-Fault-Injection-to-Turn-Data-Transfers-into-Arbitrary-Execution_CM-NT.pdf">presentation</a> at <a href="http://www.powerofcommunity.net/2019.htm#" target="_blank">POC2019</a> <em>advances</em> and <em>generalizes</em> the <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2016/2016_FDTC_Controlling-PC-on-ARM-using-Fault-Injection_NT-AS-MW.pdf">research</a> we published in 2016 at <a href="https://fdtc.deib.polimi.it/FDTC16/" target="_blank">FDTC</a>, where we showed that <em>“data transfers”</em> can yield <em>“arbitrary code execution”</em> using <strong>FI</strong>. During our demonstration live on stage we injected <strong>voltage glitches</strong> into the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32/overview" target="_blank">Espressif ESP32</a> using the open source <a href="https://github.com/noopwafel/iceglitch" target="_blank">iceGLITCH</a>. More specifically, we showed how <strong>FI</strong> can be used to modify <strong>callx8 instructions</strong> in order to achieve <strong>arbitrary control</strong> of the <strong>program counter</strong> in situations where the attacker controls nothing more than just <strong>the data</strong> being transferred.</p>
<p>It's important to point out that our <strong>2016 research</strong> showed the program counter can be be controlled on processor architectures where it is directly addressable (e.g. ARMv7). Our <strong>2019 research</strong> showed that the program counter can be controlled even if the it is not directly addressable (e.g. ARMv8). Moreover, maybe even more relevant, this is possible leveraging <strong>common software constructs</strong> such as the  <code>memcpy</code> function.</p>
<p>Let us be clear…</p>
<p>You can perform these type of attack when you <strong>only</strong> control <strong>the data</strong> being transferred. Neither the <strong>destination</strong> nor the <strong>source</strong> of the data transfer needs to be controlled, <strong>just the data</strong> itself. Moreover, you can leverage <strong>common software constructs</strong> executed by <strong>privileged code</strong> (e.g. Kernel) that copy data from an untrusted domain (e.g. an communication interface or external data source like flash), which are present on any device. Then, if the underlying <strong>hardware is vulnerable</strong> to <strong>FI</strong>, and many standard chips are, you can achieve <strong>full control</strong> of the program counter, <strong>regardless</strong> of the processor architecture.</p>
<p>We disclosed our research to <strong>Espressif</strong> before the presentation. It was received with interest and we discussed the potential risk for the <strong>ESP32</strong> chip. Nonetheless, as the results were achieved in a <strong>fully controlled environment</strong> targeting <strong>test code</strong>, we agreed that the impact was minimal at the time.</p>

<p>Fast forward to early 2020 and we obtained new hardware <strong>FI</strong> tooling to support our research endeavors. We decided to test our new capabilities on a target already available to us and that we were familiar with. We decided to focus on injecting electromagnetic (EM) glitches. We will refer to this technique as <strong>EMFI</strong>.</p>
<p>We started with a typical approach where we target test code that is entirely under our control in order to determine the resilience of the <strong>ESP32</strong> towards <strong>EM glitches</strong>. Once we determined the <strong>ESP32</strong> is vulnerable, we set our final goal to put our <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2019/2019_PoC_Using-Fault-Injection-to-Turn-Data-Transfers-into-Arbitrary-Execution_CM-NT.pdf">2019</a> research into practice.</p>
<p>We decided our first step towards to this goal was to bypass the <strong>Secure Boot</strong> implementation of the <strong>ESP32</strong>. It's important to point out that when we started our research, several researchers already published <strong>FI</strong> attacks on this implementation for which Espressif issued an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_Security_Advisory_Concerning_Fault_Injection_and_Secure_Boot" target="_blank">advisory</a>. Differently from the attacks already published, we used <strong>EM glitches</strong> instead of <strong>voltage glitches</strong> to <strong>trigger</strong> a similar hardware vulnerability. Our approach has several advantages, as <strong>EMFI</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>typically requires no <strong>invasive modifications</strong> to the target</li>
<li>is somewhat <strong>localized</strong>,  as the EM field has a definite spatial distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, besides reproducing the already published attack, we identified several new approaches for exploiting the faults we introduce, which allow us to bypass both <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong>. By doing so, we also identified several <strong>new vulnerabilities</strong> for which <strong>Espressif</strong> issued an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/Security%20Advisory%20CVE-2020-15048%2C%2013629%20EN%26CN.pdf" target="_blank">advisory</a>. <strong>Espressif</strong> indicated that these attacks do not apply to the the updated <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/ESP32_ECO_V3_User_Guide__EN.pdfe" target="_blank">ESP32 V3</a> and <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2" target="_blank">ESP32-S2</a> chips.</p>
<p>In this post we describe our approach for bypassing <strong>Secure Boot</strong> without <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> enabled (i.e. reproducing <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_Security_Advisory_Concerning_Fault_Injection_and_Secure_Boot" target="_blank">CVE-2019-15894</a>) using <strong>EMFI</strong>. In several upcoming posts, which will be posted in the upcoming weeks, we will describe our other attacks, including the new vulnerabilities we identified (i.e. <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15048" target="_blank">CVE-2020-15048</a> and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13629" target="_blank">CVE-2020-13629</a>).</p>

<p>After over a decade of conducting <strong>FI</strong> testing and research, we know out of firsthand experience that the <strong>identification</strong> and <strong>exploitation</strong> of <strong>FI</strong> vulnerabilities may require a long breath. It's not always so trivial as some may make you believe. <strong>Expert tooling</strong> in the hands of <em>advanced users</em>, can make a dramatic difference in the <strong>identification</strong> phase, let alone during the <strong>exploitation</strong> of the identified vulnerabilities. Therefore, we like to use <a href="https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-fi/" target="_blank">commercially available</a> tooling during our <strong>FI</strong> research.</p>
<p>We believe that our results may be achieved using low cost (e.g. <a href="http://store.newae.com/chipshouter-kit/" target="_blank">ChipShouter</a>) or Do-It-Yourself (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/RedBalloonShenanigans/BADFET" target="_blank">BADFET</a>) tooling as well. However, this type of tooling may be limiting and is often not able to sufficiently sweep the <strong>glitch parameter</strong> search space. Nonetheless, we believe that once a <strong>FI</strong> vulnerability is identified and exploited, and therefore the required <strong>glitch parameters</strong> are known, <strong>low cost tooling</strong> may be tuned or built to inject a successful glitch.</p>
<p>To set ourselves up for success, being able to sweep the glitch parameter search space efficiently, we use the following components to conduct our <strong>FI</strong> research:</p>

<p>We execute the <a href="https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-fi/" target="_blank">Inspector FI Python</a> framework on an <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html" target="_blank">Intel NUC</a> in order to communicate with the above components. A logical representation of the setup is shown below.</p>

<p>We used the <a href="https://www.az-delivery.de/en/products/esp32-developmentboard" target="_blank">ESP32 NodeMCU</a> modules available from <a href="https://www.az-delivery.de/en" target="_blank">AZ Delivery</a> which is shown in the picture below. These modules are designed around a <strong>ESP32-WROOM-32</strong> package.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>We removed the metal casing of the <strong>ESP32-WROOM-32</strong> package in order to place the tip of the <strong>EM-FI Probe</strong> on the chip's surface. This is the only modification we made to the target in order to inject <strong>EM</strong> glitches.</p>

<p>The most important <strong>glitch parameters</strong> when performing <strong>EMFI</strong>, are <strong>position</strong>, <strong>power</strong> and <strong>timing</strong>. Tuning these parameters is not always trivial, especially when targeting something specific like <strong>Secure Boot</strong>. The combined parameter search space can be huge, especially if a fine grid is used for spatial positioning. Therefore, we typically start with an intermediate step that allows us to determine efficiently where exactly a chip is sensitive to <strong>EM</strong> glitches.</p>
<p>It's relevant to point out, that the first step for <strong>FI</strong>, after building the setup, is to determine if the target is <strong>vulnerable</strong>. As such vulnerability is at the <strong>chip level</strong> (i.e. hardware), it does not matter if it is identified on a <strong>development board</strong> or an <strong>finalized device</strong> (i.e. the vulnerability is the same). That's why, if possible, we typically prefer to perform the initial research using a development board that's designed around the same or similar chip. Then, porting the attack to a finalized device, especially when the software is the same as well (e.g. ROM code), is often trivial.</p>
<h2 id="test-code">Test code</h2>
<p>The test code we use during this intermediate step includes a command handler with at least one command, which does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>receive command byte</li>
<li>set trigger high</li>
<li>using assembly to initialize unused registers with known values</li>
<li>using assembly to increase a counter with add instructions (i.e add sled)</li>
<li>set trigger signal low</li>
<li>print the counter result</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the implementations used during our <strong>ESP32</strong> research is shown below. The test code allows us to identify a successful glitch by observing the counter printed on the <strong>serial interface</strong>. If the counter value is different than the expected value (i.e. 10,000), then the glitch we injected <strong>successfully</strong> affected the target's execution without preventing program continuation.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We generate the <strong>trigger high</strong> and the <strong>trigger low</strong> signal by driving a <strong>GPIO</strong> pin. This allows us to create a measurable <strong>attack window</strong> that encompasses the sled of <code>add</code> instructions. This increases our chances of injecting a successful glitch and allows us to identify the presence of a hardware vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>We use the <strong>XYZ stage</strong> to automatically move the <strong>EM-FI Probe</strong> across the chip's surface. The <strong>Spider</strong> waits until the <strong>trigger</strong> is set high, effectively injecting the glitch exactly within the attack window. The attack window is defined by the moment the <strong>trigger</strong> goes high and the <strong>trigger</strong> goes low. We randomize both the <strong>timing within the attack window</strong> and the <strong>power</strong> of the <strong>EM-FI Probe</strong>. We used a <strong>30 x 30 grid</strong> for our initial experiment.</p>
<p>All experiments are grouped according to the behavior we observe. We assign a color to each experiment based on their group. All experiments that result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>no observable effect whatsoever are colored <span>green dots</span></li>
<li>a reset or mute of the chip are colored <span>yellow dots</span></li>
<li>a different counter value (i.e. successful glitch) are are colored <span>red diamonds</span></li>
<li>an exception (e.g. illegal instruction) are colored <span>magenta …</span></li></ul></article></div>

I’ve laid out the index of topics covered in the post. </p><p>Depending on the stage of your journey, feel free to skip to the sections that are most relevant to you.<br></p><h3><strong>Topics covered in this post</strong></h3><ol role="list"><li>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</li><li>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</li><li>Standing out from competition</li><li>Shopify App Store optimisation basics</li><li>Find your #1 keyword</li><li>Getting customers to review your Shopify app (by delivering great customer support)</li><li>Getting the first customers for your Shopify app</li><li>Finding early users and beta testers for your Shopify app outside the App Store</li><li>Getting listed under the right categories &amp; collections, and getting featured on the Shopify App Store</li><li>The right pricing model for your Shopify app</li><li>Optimising for trials</li><li>Long term game plan in the Shopify App Store</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</strong></h2><p>Shopify isn’t the only choice when it comes to picking an apps marketplace. There’s </p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank">Slack</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a></li><li><a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a></li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace" target="_blank">GSuite Marketplace</a></li><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/in/ios/app-store/" target="_blank">Apple iOS App Store</a></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/mac/id39?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a></li></ul><p>All these marketplaces are valid options for you to start. I would lean on a marketplace where there’s a combination of 2 factors</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Familiarity with problems</strong> - You know what the core product is about, you understand or can empathise with its users maybe from using the tool at your previous workplace, you have an idea on the different kind of problems that exist in the ecosystem and don’t find it too boring to solve them</li><li><strong>Skillset to execute</strong> - If you don’t know how to build Android, iOS, or Mac apps, perhaps steer clear of it. Your goal is not to take on a hard challenge, it’s to take on a challenge where you have some advantage from skill and insight. The goal is to win.<br></li></ol><h3>Why you should pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Huge distribution:</strong> Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it. Shopify has 1mn+ merchants and tons of new signups every month who go to the app store browsing for solutions. <br>Shopify promotes apps within its product and has made it an integral part of its user journey. A new app is able to gain traction fairly easily in the app marketplace, which makes it friendly to newcomers. <br>Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it.</li><li><strong>Tons of app opportunities:</strong> E-commerce store owners have 101+ problems to be taken care of, and you can address any one and do a great job at it to build a sustainable business. It’s not hard (relative standards) to gain 200 paying customers paying you $10/mo to earn $2000/mo ($1600 after Shopify’s 20%)</li><li><strong>Ease of development:</strong> Shopify’s documentation and APIs are first-class, they get out of the way allowing you to build fast. Additionally, Shopify’s <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris UI framework</a> makes building app interfaces a piece of cake. It’s based on React and comes with a Sketch/Figma file to help you design and prototype solutions fast.</li><li><strong>Billing taken care of:</strong> Heads up, Shopify takes a 20% commission on all earnings. So if your app’s monthly subscription fees is $10, you get $8. In return, Shopify takes care of billing end to end.<br>You can charge monthly, annually, charge per activity, provide app credit, and issue refunds with very little effort. You don’t need to worry about failed payments, Shopify takes care of it. You don’t even need to generate an invoice, app bills are included in the merchant’s monthly Shopify invoice.</li><li><strong>Familiarity with ecommerce:</strong> If you’re someone who can jump into an industry and learn all about it, great. If not, you would want some familiarity with how an ecommerce store works, what are the typical problems faced by a merchant.<br>You can do this by creating a Shopify store and trying to sell your own products. Or you could have conversations with 10 different store owners and absorb from their experience. You could also find someone who works at an e-commerce agency for valuable insights. It’s not that hard.<br></li></ul><h3>Why you shouldn’t pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Copycat galore:</strong> You’re likely to copy an existing app and make a slight improvement in terms of product, pricing, or both. Guess what, the next smart person with the same idea can do the same to you. If you’re dependent on getting all or majority of your customers from the app store, be ready for stiff competition from copycats. <br>This doesn’t mean you cannot grow your app to $1k or $10k MRR. SaaS is not a winner take all market. It just means that it gets harder to grow as you grow. If this is something you are not mentally prepared for, steer clear. <br>There’s ways you can grow out of this by taking a long term strategy, either by taking a brand-centric approach (brand is not your name, but the experience that customers remember you by for which they’ll choose you over a copycat). <br>Or you can go upmarket and target large volume and Plus merchants, where ticket sizes are $200/mo or higher and switching does not happen often. </li><li><strong>Low-end, high-maintenance customers:</strong> Majority of Shopify merchants are people who don’t want to pay beyond $10-$15/mo and yet they expect world-class customer service. Some will ask for phone support or to jump on a video call. <br>You can tackle this by solving problems where the ticket sizes are higher, in the range of $50-$100/mo, but also expect it to be significantly harder to rank and fight existing competitors in such problem spaces. Example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=page+builder" target="_blank">page builders</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=product+reviews" target="_blank">product review</a> apps. <br>You can mitigate this by going in with the mindset that you’ll be serving $15/mo customers, so your app better be self-serve ready, have a dead simple UX and sufficient documentation or walkthrough videos. You can also aim to be the cost-leader of a segment, example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme" target="_blank">Judge.me</a> </li></ul><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</strong></h2><p>I’ve previously written about <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">uncovering opportunities on Shopify</a> and I also shared all my research in my big <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hnpcl1VAlPC9MuFvvsl2UsU0yu1iM6aKR-iK30VtbwA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Shopify app ideas spreadsheet</a>. Let me reiterate on the advice shared there in a more structured manner that will hopefully better answer questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>“How do you find niches in the app store in the first place?”</li><li>“How to find a problem worth solving within shopify? (worth solving=stressful enough for merchants &amp; competition not too tough)”<br></li></ul><p>There have been people who have asked me what kind of problems to solve, or what are the underserved niches. The thing is - if there's an obviously underserved niche and people have taken the time to research about it, they are probably busy solving it. If it's being posted in any blog post, know that it's no longer an underserved or hidden niche, because clearly anyone could find it.</p><p>Ultimately, only you can find an idea that you find worthy enough to pursue, whose various pros and cons are justified in your mind. And therefore, I can only provide a directional framework towards evaluating ideas. I can't list out ideas.</p><p>The best use of a directional framework is to</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>First</strong> - cast a wide net, get to know what's out there</li><li><strong>Second</strong> - narrow down your search based on parameters you have decided</li></ol><p>This first section of the article will help you with casting a wide net. </p><p>As you go further along the article, I've shared ideas and techniques which you can use to narrow down your search.<br></p><h3>1- Browse the entire App Store</h3><p>I recommend this as the starting point for anyone new to the Shopify ecosystem. Start by browsing all the categories &amp; sub-categories of apps on the app store. You can do the same on <a href="https://sasi.unionworks.co.uk/categories" target="_blank">SASI</a>. </p><p>The purpose of browsing this way is to familiarise yourself with the different types of problems faced by merchants and being solved by apps. Ideally, you want to note down some interesting apps that you come across during your browsing adventure to investigate later on.</p><figure id="w-node-892fc283544a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f1c114edd643e073591f8cc_browse%20categories%20shopify%20app%20store.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>2- Go through every letter in search autocomplete</h3><p>Okay, this is a step I took when&nbsp;I was browsing the app store. I would type in "aa", "ab", "ac"... ... ... "zz" on the search bar, note the autocomplete terms and check the results of ones I found to be interesting.</p><p>Turns out, Shopify has since updated their algorithm. Autocomplete suggestions only show up after you type 3 letters now. So you can't recreate what I did with autocomplete and go through every letter. It's not feasible anymore.</p><p>Not to worry, it's still useful.</p><h4>Plug in keywords of shortlisted apps into the search bar</h4><p>From step 1, all the apps (hopefully at least a dozen) that you shortlisted for being interesting, extract the keywords used in the app's title or description. </p><p>Now, enter …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>by Valentin, July 25 2020, in <a href="http://foobuzz.github.io/tag/random/">random</a></p><p>One of the most important realizations that I have had about mathematics is the fact that there is no global definition of what "infinity" is. You can't just drop the word "infinite" in any context, as if one day mathematicians had a meeting to decide the meaning of "infinity" and made it an element of reasoning you can use with any mathematical thing.</p><p>In set theory, a set is "infinite" if, for every natural number, the set has a subset whose cardinality is that of this natural number. In functional analysis, a function has a limit L as <em>x</em> approaches "infinity" if, for any tiny ɛ, there is a point after which the function won't ever be farther from L than the distance ɛ. The term of "infinity" obviously comes from an intuition about the philosophical notion of infinity, but it is then defined formally using very traditional and non-mystical notions and notations, and there isn't any global notion of "infinity". You can't take some random mathematical thing and ask "What happens when this goes to infinity?".</p><p>Now, when someone comes and says "hey, do you know that 0.999 with an infinite amount of 9s after the decimal point is equal to 1?", what most people do is that they try to picture the number 0.999 with an actual infinite number of nines after the decimal point and then they try to actually reason about this monstrosity. This is an interesting intellectual exercise, but when you're doing that, you're doing philosophy, not mathematics. If you want to do mathematics, what you should be asking back is "What is the definition of a number with a decimal repeating infinitely?"</p><p>There are multiple definitions for it, but the one that makes the most sense to me is an infinite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)#Convergent_series">series</a>. We can simply state that 0.999... can be written as 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + 0.0009 + ... Formally, it would be written as follows:</p><p><img src="http://foobuzz.github.io/assets/articles/09-series.svg"></p><p>This form is very helpful, because the notion of infinite series is very well defined. It is simply the limit of the sequence of the partial sums. In other words, 0.999... is the limit of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, etc. Let's call this sequence 0.(9)n for later reference. I like this definition because it reminds me of very important aspects of sequences and their limits that I learned when I was in school:</p><ol><li>There is no such thing as an "infinite term" of a sequence (and some teachers won't like it if you ever dare say something like that).</li><li>The limit of a sequence may very well be distinct than any of its terms.</li></ol><p>I think those two aspects are at the origin of the difficulty that there is to accept that 0.999... = 1. I think that the decimal representation with its "infinite digits" is misleading because it leads us to ponder the notion of an "infinite term" (of finite truncations) all while it is explicitly discouraged as soon as we actually consider the sequence of truncations itself. Then our minds are lost wandering in the vast pastures of infinity where it's hard to understand how a limit may not belong to the sequence itself. I think that what people really mean when they think that it's problematic that 0.999... = 1 is that the sequence of 0.(9)n <em>never</em> reaches 1 no matter how many time you look at the next term.</p><p>In other words, consider the set of all elements of the sequence: {0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, ...}. This set is obviously infinite, and 1, the limit of the sequence, does not belong to this set. When we ponder the notion of "infinity" in the context of 0.9..., what we might envision is the journey through this "infinite" set. With this in mind, it's hard to see how 1 can have anything to do with this, since it is outside the set.</p><p>But this begs the question: what is a "limit"? In layman terms, the limit of a sequence is a real number the sequence is ever getting closer to (without the requirement that it actually reaches it at any point). More formally, it means that for any tiny real number ɛ, there is a rank after which the sequence won't ever be farther from the limit than the distance ɛ. (This is the same definition than the one used in functional analysis I presented in the introduction.) Even without a formal proof, it seems pretty obvious than the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999,... has 1 for limit. And therefore, if you actually understand the proper meaning of the notation, that 0.999... = 1.</p><p>Now, since the limit of an increasing sequence also happens to be its supremum (least upper bound), this leads us to another definition, which is the one that is actually used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The real number represented by an infinite decimal is the least upper bound of its finite truncations.</p></blockquote><p>What this means is that if you take the sequence 0.(9)n, then the number that is written "0.999..." or said to have "an infinite amount of 9s after the decimal point" is the smallest number that is greater than all terms of the sequence. For example, 3 is greater than all the terms of the sequence, so that's a candidate. Is it the smallest such number? Well, certainly not. 2 is greater than all terms of the sequence and it is lesser than 3. Can we find smaller? Sure. 1 is greater than all terms of the sequence. Is there something even smaller? Hmm... doesn't seem so. I think 1 is the smallest. This, of course, is only intuition so far, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...#Formal_proof">the proof</a> is easy enough to follow.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Around November of last year, I started a project to wrangle my digital life. Tired of haphazardly increasing my subjectivity by trusting "free" websites to provide various services, I wanted to wrest some control over my internet existence. I made a plan to self-host several "critical" services on my home network and maintain them personally. In short, I made a homelab.</p>
<p>To be frank, the professional websites that I was previously dependent upon are undoubtedly more reliable than my cobbled-together hobby project of a homelab. However, on general principle (and because it seemed like a fun way to learn some sysadmin / devops skills), I made this setup:</p>
<p><img src="https://0xc45.com/blog/ansible-defined-homelab/homelab-network-diagram.svg" alt="Homelab Network Diagram"></p>
<p>As you can see, I have deployed a couple of general-purpose compute platforms: 4 ESXi hypervisors, and a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, there are several VM-based services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. For data storage and backup, I use a Synology NAS. Finally, a custom OpenBSD-based router provides internet connectivity to everything. In order to reduce operational overhead, I crafted <a href="https://github.com/0xC45/homelab-setup">a set of Ansible scripts</a> that deploy and configure all of these components.</p>
<p>Overall, making this setup has been quite a journey. In this blog post, I will describe my uses for each of these services, share my thoughts and experiences so far, and attempt to articulate my future improvement plans.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Of course, everything you see above already exists as a service on the internet. If my goal were solely the end feature set, it would have been much simpler to pay for each service. In most cases, there are even "free" versions available. For example, if I only cared about having access to a web-based git repository UI, I could have signed up for a Github or Gitlab account rather than bother setting up a Gitea VM on my home network.</p>
<p>However, like most of my hobby projects, this endeavor was more about the journey than the destination. By setting up these services on my home network, I learned a bunch of useful devops and sysadmin skills. Additionally, by running my own services, I have achieved the philosophical goal of reducing my reliance on 3rd party services. Now, if any of the services that I rely upon break, I am empowered to fix them. I am no longer dependent on the "opaque box" that is Google Drive, for example.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>So, without further ado, let's dive into each of the components that make up my homelab. For each component, I will describe the main utility it provides me, why I chose it, and any additional commentary that may be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="router">Router</h3>
<p>The first component of my homelab is a custom OpenBSD-based router. It provides internet connectivity and DHCP to everything on my home network. Additionally, the device serves as a caching DNS server and firewall. I could write an entire blog post describing this router in excruciating detail. In fact, I <a href="https://0xc45.com/blog/openbsd-home-router/">already have</a>.</p>
<h3 id="esxi-hosts">ESXi Hosts</h3>
<p>In total, I maintain four physical <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html">ESXi</a> hosts to form a platform for running virtual machines on my network.</p>
<p>Three of the ESXi hosts are Intel NUCs (System76 Meerkats). These smaller machines run the VMs that form my Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>The other ESXi host is a custom machine built from spare parts. It currently runs three VM-based HTTPS services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. Because it only runs three (relatively small) VMs, it has quite a bit of spare compute power leftover for future additions and/or temporary experiments.</p>
<p>I chose ESXi to run my virtual machines because it's enterprise quality and free. There are many hypervisors out there. For my current use case, ESXi is perfect. Also, in the future, I may consider expanding my use of VMware products by running vCenter to programmatically manage virtual machines, setting-up vSAN for shared storage, and potentially installing NSX if my networking requirements become more complicated. So, there is room to grow.</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-cluster">Kubernetes Cluster</h3>
<p>In addition to the VM-based compute platform provided by ESXi, I run Kubernetes to provide a container-based compute platform. Though I do not currently use my Kubernetes cluster for anything, I have plans to setup <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo CI/CD</a>, experiment with <a href="https://knative.dev/">kNative</a>, develop some operators, and maybe run a <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/factorio">factorio game server</a>.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes cluster consists of 6 VMs running across 3 Intel NUCs. I chose to install Kubernetes on VMs with the ESXi hypervisor layer for ease of management. At some point, I'm sure to break things, want to reconfigure, etc. With the hypervisor, it's easier to perform these type of adjustments. Furthermore, at some point in the future, I may switch to <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid">TKG</a>, a vSphere-integrated distribution of Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="synology-nas">Synology NAS</h3>
<p>For backups and storing important data, I use a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS218+">Synology NAS</a>. Though I didn't really shop around and compare NAS products / vendors, I am happy with the Synology so far. That being said, I would like to create my own NAS from scratch at some point in the future. However, the Synology product includes several features "out-of-the-box" that would be potentially difficult to replicate.</p>
<p>First, it has an easy-to-use application called <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/active_backup_business">"Active Backup for Business"</a> that can automatically take backups of ESXi virtual machines following configurable schedules and retention policies.</p>
<p>The VM backup application pairs nicely with the automatic cloud backup application, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages/GlacierBackup">"Glacier Backup"</a>. Every night, after the VMs are backed-up to the NAS, I replicate the backups to Amazon S3 Glacier. Hopefully, this way I won't ever lose data.</p>
<p>Finally, the Synology has built-in UPS integration. If <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-Power-Saving-Back-UPS-Pro-1500/P-BR1500G">my UPS</a> loses power for more than one minute, the NAS will cleanly shutdown, preventing any data corruption that could be caused by an unexpected power loss.</p>
<h3 id="nextcloud-vm">Nextcloud VM</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> as my "personal cloud". I use it to store my important files and photos. The desktop / mobile application synchronizes the files across all of my devices, allowing me to edit and view my files from anywhere. </p>
<p>Nextcloud also has the capability to install "apps" that provide additional functionality. Currently, I have only installed one app, <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck">"Deck"</a>. Deck is a Kanban-style project management and organization tool. I use Deck to plan, organize, and record progress on my hobby projects.</p>
<p>Because it gives me the capability to install (and potentially create) apps, Nextcloud is an extensible platform. It's open source and under active development. Though the recent major version upgrade was a bit rocky (for me, at least), I'm happy with Nextcloud and plan to stick with it.</p>
<h3 id="gitea-vm">Gitea VM</h3>
<p>Of course, I need a place to store my code. For that purpose, I use <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a>. I prefer Gitea to Gitlab because it's lighter-weight. Unlike Gitlab, there aren't a million additional features bundled-in that add bloat (in my opinion). Also, I slightly prefer the Gitea UI over the Gitlab UI.</p>
<p>There's really not much else to say about Gitea. It works great for my purposes. I push all of my code to the Gitea VM running on my home network. Whenever I want to "publish" a project or share it with the world, I push my code to a public Github repo.</p>
<h3 id="harbor-vm">Harbor VM</h3>
<p>To make container images available for running on my Kubernetes cluster, I need a container registry. For this purpose, I use <a href="https://goharbor.io/">Harbor</a>, an open source solution that seems to be the current most popular self-hosted container registry. In addition to providing a standard API for pushing/pulling container images, Harbor has the useful capability to scan container images for known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Harbor has worked well for me so far, but I haven't really placed it under a serious workload. Soon, I will start using my Kubernetes cluster for various projects, which will require pushing / pulling images from Harbor on a regular basis. Perhaps, at some point in the future, I will have a more nuanced opinion of Harbor.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Though I am happy with the current setup, I continually find myself coming up with ideas for potential improvements and additions to the homelab. Here are a couple of the more well-defined ideas.</p>
<p>First, I want to install <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo</a> on the Kubernetes cluster to run pipeline-based workflows. For example, it could be useful to automatically run tests for every commit that gets pushed to my repositories on Gitea. More generally, I could configure Argo to trigger a job for any arbitrary external event. It could be used to create a notification service. Or, it could be used to manage heavy workloads. There are endless potential uses for a pipeline-based workflow engine such as Argo.</p>
<p>Second, I want to create a dashboard that provides a graphical representation of the status of each of my homelab components using <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. Using various open-source tools, I could collect metrics and aggregate them. Then, using Grafana, I could visualize the data. It would be useful to be able to quickly ascertain the state of my home network services in order to understand workloads, diagnose issues, etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the work spanning several months, creating my homelab has been quite a journey. Along the way, I started to grow weary, concerned that I had signed myself up for the all-consuming task of operating my homelab. With the overhead required to maintain all the various components, how could I ever have time for anything else? However, I'm happy to report that the Ansible script automation has proved worthwhile. Now, upgrades, configuration changes, and various "day 2" operations are quick and simple. At this point, I'm looking forward to shifting gears and working on something else for a while, using my homelab services as helpful tools along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/huawei-hacked-my-laptop">Huawei Hacked My Laptop?</a></p><p><img alt="" src="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29436/20200725_180027.huawei-xhost.png?width=500&amp;height=444"></p>

<p>The screenshot above shows a script called "Huawei Autorun" which executes the command "xhost +" when you login. This command makes your Linux desktop remotely accessible to anyone on the network. The "Huawei Autorun" script appeared on my laptop after installing a Huawei E353 HSPA+ 3G USB stick (with serial number CE0682 on the back).</p>

<p>It seems like I dodged a bullet as I don't use the standard Linux GNOME desktop, so the script was not enabled, but the fact remains that Huawei installed malware on my Linux laptop. If they managed to get into my laptop, imagine what is happening inside your phone.</p>

<p>State-sponsored hacking is real.</p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE----</strong></p>

<p>For those people who requested more information. The OS is Debian 8.1 LTS. The script is basically a one-liner embedded in an autostart launcher (see below). It was installed as root, so I must have screwed up big time there. Obviously, I'll&nbsp;have to reinstall my OS.&nbsp;Debian 8 is at end of life&nbsp;now anyway.</p>

<pre>$ cat /etc/xdg/autostart/HuaweiAutoStart.desktop 
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Huawei  AutoRun
Name[en_US]=Huawei AutoRun
<strong>Exec=xhost +</strong>

X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false

GenericName[en_US]=</pre>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 2----</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I decided to check out this modem. It does include Linux drivers which require root for installation. I reran the installation script as root and sure enough the same autostart script was reinstalled.</p>

<pre>$ ls /etc/xdg/autostart/ -l
total 116
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  305 Oct 10  2014 at-spi-dbus-bus.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6351 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7777 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7339 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-secrets.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5996 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7741 Aug 27  2014 gsettings-data-convert.desktop
<strong>-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  262 Jul 25 23:59 HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</strong>
<span>....</span>
</pre>

<p>This script is also installed to <span>$HOME/.config/autostart/</span><span>HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</span>. Another script called <span>ReadDisplay</span> is&nbsp;installed in <span>/usr/local/modem</span> which&nbsp;passes the&nbsp;<span>$DISPLAY</span>&nbsp;environment variable to a binary&nbsp;called <span>MobilePartner</span>. The drivers do include a GUI, but if the sole purpose of all this is to fire up a GUI then it is not only exceptionally sloppy code, but also a&nbsp;security risk that needs explaining.</p>

<p>Below is a tarball image of the huawei e353 drivers so you can audit them for yourself. I've included the Windows drivers so you get an image of the disk just as I have it. Heck you could even try it for yourself. The drivers didn't compile the second time I did this, but the autostart script was still installed.</p>

<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29437/huawei-e353-malware.tar.gz">Download huawei e353 drivers (warning, possible malware!)</a></p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 3----</strong></p>

<p>I'm giving Huawei the benefit of doubt on this one. As a commenter suggested, it is probably a hack to run the GUI as root. Either way, it is still a nasty vulnerability, even if your X server is configured to use local sockets by default. I guess this&nbsp;shows the folly of blindly trusting hardware manufactures. I'll be sticking to open source code from official repositories in the future.</p>

<p>Live and learn, I suppose.</p>

      <p>Based on the article, I would think it is just a sloppy and lazy implementation, but the title does served as a bait clicker. The comment where avoiding pure chinese company or there is at least American company involved will be pure ignorance&nbsp;or turning a blind eye on what is happening around the world and purely cynical. Every country spying on people when they have the means and ways. So don't even think for a second that&nbsp;&nbsp;an American company involvement will make it any better. That will be pure ignorant.<br>

  <p>It's more likely the package installed some graphical configuration tool that needs to run as root. Running "xhost +" is a lazy way to enable programs running as root to connect to your non-root user's X11 session.</p>

<p>I don't know what debian's default settings are regarding Xorg and networking, but on my laptop Xorg appears to only be listening on unix sockets, which are obviously not accessible from the whole network.</p>

    
  <blockquote>
<p><span>State-sponsored hacking is real.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Yes. It's happening. 14 eyes (US+others) are also doing it. So I don't trust US services and devices either.</span></p>

<p><span>While they're banning each other of different things, open hardware is rising up and welcoming everyone (for example RISC V). We need things like this in this world to bring in peace so that they don't fight over silli things.</span></p>

    
  <p>Clean the system, you most likely found one piece of the drop. Replace the drive, looks to be a long weekend</p>

    
  <p>I avoid any pure Chinese tech, where possible. By law in China, all companies must work with the CCP (which means the military). Obviously, iPhones and such are made in China, although production is starting to move to other countries under Trump's trade policies, but at least there is an American company involved on the HW and SW sides.</p>

    
  <p>Did inserting the Huawei E353 dongle attach a virtual CD-ROM drive that you manually installed drivers from? I know for a fact similar devices (eg, ZTE MF910) offer drivers this way. The generic Linux USB ethernet driver worked fine, so there's no need to install Huawei or ZTE's driver.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning USB On-The-Go devices (including Android phones and 4G modems) have relatively powerful processors running a wide variety of network services, including an insecure web server (for the end-user web configuration interface), high-precision location, a high bandwidth internet side-channel (the 4G connection itself) while also having the ability to act as any USB client device (including keyboards to send keystrokes). They are an incredibly powerful platform for targeted cyberattacks and I imagine state actors are using them very often.</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt3/">previous post</a> we have written code to change the amplitude of wave files.</p>
<p>Now we’ll take a look at how we can turn a mono wave file into a stereo wave file with an optional
panning, and explore how this is represented internally by the WAVE file format.</p>

<p>The raw audio data inside a WAVE file consists of multiple frames. For now, we have called them
‘samples’ although that is strictly speaking not entirely correct. In fact, single float in the raw
audio data only corresponds to a single sample when we assume a mono audio file.</p>
<p>When you have multiple channels, a single ‘sample’ can consist of multiple frames. As each channel
needs to play a certain ‘frame’ at any given point in time.</p>
<p>In the WAVE file format, the channels are interleaved. For example, a stereo file would be
laid out like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/interleaving.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here, each sample consists of two frames. Such that frame 1 and 2 make up sample 1, frame 3 and 4
make up sample 2, and so on..</p>
<p>Programs know how to interpret the raw audio data because of the <code>fmt</code> chunk inside the audio file,
which specifies the number of channels that are present in the raw audio data. The maximum number of
channels in a wave file is actually as high as 65,536, which does not actually make sense for audio
data.</p>
<p>Some common ones would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-channel: mono</li>
<li>2-channel: stereo</li>
<li>3-channel: stereo + center channel</li>
<li>4-channel: Quadrophonic</li>
<li>5-channel: “Surround sound”</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience though, we’ll mostly work on mono and stereo files. Not only are they the most
commonly used, this also allows us to test our code without needing a more expensive setup.</p>

<p>So what is a pan? When you pan an audio signal, you essentially make an audio signal ‘louder’ on
either the left or the right side. Typically in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a> this would be represented by an ‘automation
track’ between the value of -1 to 1.</p>
<p>The program to apply a pan will take three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>input file</li>
<li>output file</li>
<li>pan (-1 to 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the input file we will restrict this to mono files, and for the output files we will always
generate a stereo file. The pan variable should be between -1 (left) and 1 (right). Before we can
start applying our pan, we need to read the raw audio data from an input wave file. Remember that to
read the wave file we will use the <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> library we made
earlier:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>import</span> (
        <span>wav</span> <span>"github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/wave"</span>
)
</code></pre></div><p>The set up for this program is rather simple, we will use the build-in <code>flags</code> package to parse the
input from the CLI.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>var</span> (
	<span>input</span>  = <span>flag</span>.<span>String</span>(<span>"i"</span>, <span>""</span>, <span>"input file"</span>)
	<span>output</span> = <span>flag</span>.<span>String</span>(<span>"o"</span>, <span>""</span>, <span>"output file"</span>)
	<span>pan</span>    = <span>flag</span>.<span>Float64</span>(<span>"p"</span>, <span>0.0</span>, <span>"pan in range of -1 (left) to 1 (right)"</span>)
)
</code></pre></div><p>Once we have our flags set up, we can parse them and read the input file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>flag</span>.<span>Parse</span>()
	<span>infile</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span>
	<span>outfile</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>output</span>
	<span>panfac</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>pan</span>
	<span>wave</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>wav</span>.<span>ReadWaveFile</span>(<span>infile</span>)
	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		panic(<span>"Could not parse wave file"</span>)
	}
        <span>...</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>So far so good. We have parsed the input so we know which value to use for our pan, and we have read
the raw audio data as well. But how do we go from a value in the range of (-1) to (1) to an actual
change in loudness on the left or right-side? We can imagine that a simple function would look like
this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>panposition</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>left</span>, <span>right</span> <span>float64</span>
}

<span>func</span> <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>position</span> <span>float64</span>) <span>panposition</span> {
	<span>position</span> <span>*=</span> <span>0.5</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>panposition</span>{
		<span>left</span>:  <span>position</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span>,
		<span>right</span>: <span>position</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span>,
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here we are using a struct that can represent the amplitude on a scale of 0 to 1 for both the left
and right channel. Such that we observe the following values:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>position</th>
<th>left-channel</th>
<th>right-channel</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In other words, if the position is zero the sound is perfectly balanced between the left and
right-side of your headphones. And in the extreme values, the sound is either only left-sided or
right-sided.</p>
<p>Just like in the previous post, we actually need to alter the frames based on the position data we
found in the <code>calculatePosition</code> function. We can create a function that modifies the frames based
on the <code>panposition</code> returned in the previous function.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>applyPan</span>(<span>frames</span> []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>, <span>p</span> <span>panposition</span>) []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span> {
	<span>out</span> <span>:=</span> []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>{}
	<span>for</span> <span>_</span>, <span>s</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>frames</span> {
		<span>out</span> = append(<span>out</span>, <span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>(float64(<span>s</span>)<span>*</span><span>p</span>.<span>left</span>))
		<span>out</span> = append(<span>out</span>, <span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>(float64(<span>s</span>)<span>*</span><span>p</span>.<span>right</span>))
	}
	<span>return</span> <span>out</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Notice how for each <code>frame</code> we actually append two <code>frames</code> to the resulting slice! That is how we
are interleaving the left and right audio channel.</p>
<p>Now we can finish up the main method:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go">        <span>...</span>
	<span>pos</span> <span>:=</span> <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>panfac</span>)
	<span>scaledFrames</span> <span>:=</span> <span>applyPan</span>(<span>wave</span>.<span>Frames</span>, <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>panfac</span>))
	<span>wave</span>.<span>NumChannels</span> = <span>2</span> <span>// samples are now stereo, so we need dual channels
</span><span></span>	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>wav</span>.<span>WriteFrames</span>(<span>scaledFrames</span>, <span>wave</span>.<span>WaveFmt</span>, <span>outfile</span>); <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		panic(<span>err</span>)
	}
</code></pre></div><p>A crucial step here is that before writing the samples we have set ran <code>wave.NumChannels=2</code>. Without
this, the wave file would be interpreted as a mono sound file and our panning effect would have been
lost.</p>

<p>To test this, I find it easy to use an input file without a lot of things going on. I’m mainly using
this simple <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/mono.wav">mono file</a>.</p>
<p>If we run <code>go run main.go -i mono.wav -o left-side.wav -p -1</code> we get:</p>
<p><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/left-side.wav">left-side.wav</a></p>
<p>And when we  run <code>go run main.go -i mono.wav -o right-side.wav -p 1</code> we get:</p>
<p><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/right-side.wav">right-side.wav</a></p>

<p>There is actually a flaw with this panning function that we are using. However it is not apparent to
us yet because we can only set a pan for an entire audio source. To see why this panning function is
not perfect we need to first introduce breakpoints as a way to create automation tracks, so the focus for our next few posts will be
breakpoints. :-)</p>

<em>(If you plan to develop a white-label mobile app, JUST DON'T!!!</em> 😅 <em>But this is a story for another post.)</em>
I implemented a <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong> that was very tightly coupled with back-end implementation.</p><p>The PRs were created, reviewed, and approved by front-end and back-end teams.
Everything was tested, some small bugs were found, I fixed them and was ready for merging to <code>master</code> branch.
But some severe bugs and priority features had to be done,
so the back-end developer had to switch working on them and the back-end implementation was not shipped in production.</p><p>I didn't want to merge my commits in <code>master</code> branch,
as the implementation in back-end may be changed after addition of other requirements
and decided to wait until the back-end developer will be free and ready to merge his implementations.</p><p>I thought that the feature will be shipped the week after.</p><p>Meanwhile, I started working on the next feature that was based on the <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong>.
When I finished I didn't create a new PR in <code>master</code> branch as the <code>feature2</code> branch included changes from <code>feature10</code>.
After a week I asked the back-end developer about the status with <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong> shipment to production,
but he was busy with other tasks and as the app was in active development I continued developing on top of <strong><code>big-feature</code></strong> branch.</p><p>I was working alone in that repo and the front-end devs were helping me only with pair programming or opinions on feature implementations.
No one needed my changes and I took the easy path of just working on features/bugs and creating builds directly for testers and onboarding clients.</p><p>Time has passed, the back-end developer forgot about the <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong>.
I was working on features and bug fixes.
<code>feature5</code>, <code>feature10</code>, <code>feature13</code>, <code>bugfix12</code>, <code>refactor2</code> branches were all created on top of <strong><code>big-feature</code></strong> branch.</p><p>One day I understood that the PR in <code>master</code> branch will be an <strong>ENORMOUS</strong> lesson for me and the team.
Another developer joined the project so I created a new <code>dev</code> branch from <code>feature16</code> and for the last 2 weeks, we created and reviewed PRs in <code>dev</code> branch.</p><p>Finally after <strong>140 days</strong> from the beginning of <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong> the back-end implementation was merged and shipped to prod.</p><p>And I was ready for <strong>my biggest Pull Request</strong> <em>(so far)</em>.</p><h2>The Pull Request</h2><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You got a new dog, he’s very smart. So you decided to call him Brain. You love Brain, he’s your best friend now, and you always do things together. Everything would be perfect if Brain didn’t have this little problem; He gets distracted very easily, and when you go out for a walk, he pulls you around. No matter how tight you hold the leash, he always wins. It doesn’t stop there, and most often you find yourself following Brain rather than the other way around.</p><p>You are so frustrated, you can’t get anything done. Brain always wants to eat, play, or go outside to chase squirrels. You had enough, it’s time to train Brain, take control, and show him who is in charge!<br></p><p>The first step to changing Brain’s behavior is understanding why the behavior is happening.</p><h2>How Dogs Learn</h2><p>Training dogs is all about teaching them that you are the Alpha, and then using psychological techniques to reinforce their learning around key behaviors. The three different types of learning I’ll address here are called <strong>classical conditioning</strong>, <strong>operant conditioning</strong>, and <strong>social learning</strong>.</p><h3>Conditioned Behavior</h3><p>Classical conditioning was first studied in detail by Ivan Pavlov, through experiments with dogs and published in 1897. In one of his most famous experiments, Pavlov offered food to dogs and rang a bell at the same time. Over time, the dogs began to salivate (an unconscious response to food) not only when food was offered, but also when the bell was rung.</p><figure id="w-node-7408c90152ab-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f1b2f8837dee2e4604d0561_Group.png" alt="Pavlov’s experiment with dogs"></p></figure><p>In this way, a dog can be taught to associate a certain event (positive or negative) with another stimulus. This model explains why some dogs can recognize the word “walk” and will grab their leash or get excited if someone says the word.</p><h3>Operant Conditioning</h3><p>Operant conditioning is based more on voluntary behavior. And It’s done by <strong>reinforcement</strong> or <strong>punishment</strong>. This theory was first elaborated by B.F. Skinner, who conducted experiments using rats and pigeons to assess learning based on stimuli. In this model, punishment doesn’t mean abuse or even physical force; it could simply be the removal of something positive, such as attention if a dog engages in bad behavior. Operant conditioning has four quadrants and they are:<br></p><p>1. Positive-reinforcement: This is when you reward your dog for performing a behavior that you would like your dog to repeat.<br></p><p>2. Negative-reinforcement: This is when pressure is applied, and it is only turned off when your dog complies.<br></p><p>3. Positive-punishment: This is when you use a physical correction (such as popping on the leash) to reduce the occurrence of a behavior.<br></p><p>4. Negative-punishment: This is when you withhold a reward from your dog. For example, your dog wants a treat, so you tell him to sit, he decides not to sit, so he doesn't receive the reward.</p><h3>Social Learning</h3><p>Social learning is whereby an animal learns by copying or mimicking the behavior of others. This can be a powerful tool to use when training a dog, especially if you have access to a very well-behaved dog that can act as a model.</p><h2>How does this apply to your brain?<br></h2><p>The problem you have with Brain that I’ve mentioned earlier is a combination of two sub-problems. (1) Obedience: how to get Brain to listen to you and do what you ask. (2) Focus: once you get Brain’s attention, and he starts doing what you have asked, how to make sure he won’t quit after 8 seconds or whenever a random thing tries to get his attention.</p><h3>Obedience</h3><p>If you want to sit to do some work, Brain won’t naturally sit quietly and let you do it. Brain wants to check social media, watch Youtube videos, and keep refreshing your email inbox in case you get a new email so he can rip it up.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You could try to talk some sense to him and convince him to let you work, but good luck with that. Instead, as Pavlov’s experiment suggests, you could train Brain by combining a <strong>natural stimulus</strong> with an <strong>unconditioned stimulus, </strong>and associate it to an <strong>unconditioned response</strong>.<br></p><p>For example, Brain loves coffee, when you offer him coffee (unconditioned stimulus), Brain gets excited (unconditioned response). Let’s say you want Brain to get excited when you sit down to write your morning pages or your daily todo list (which usually he doesn't like doing). In this case, the natural stimulus could be something like sitting down on your desk and saying: “Hey Brain, let’s sit down for 20 minutes and do XYZ”. You would say that while sipping your brewed delicious coffee to create the connection between enjoying coffee and getting something done.<br></p><p>To compare this to Pavlov’s experiment, saying “Hey Brain, let’s do XYZ” is like ringing the bell, the coffee is the treat, and the excitement that follows is the desired response. Eventually, If you repeat this enough times, “Let’s do XYZ” will become the <em>conditioned stimulus</em> and you will get the same excitement as the <em>conditioned response</em> even without having the coffee treat!<br></p><p>Of course, things may not go as smoothly as you hope. Making Brain give you the chance to be productive is just the first step and that doesn’t mean you will actually get the work done. To make sure that happens, we need to use the other training method to deal with the focus problem.</p><h3>Focus</h3><p>By now, you have Brain listening to what you say and let you start working on that important task you have to finish. However, Brain’s attention span is as short as 8 seconds as some studies suggest. How do you keep Brain engaged? Since you know Brain very well, you know how much he loves chocolate and to play PUBG on the phone. So you decided to take advantage of that, by using the four quadrants of <strong>Operant Conditioning</strong>, to maximise the possibility of getting Brain to perform with reliable obedience.<br></p><p>To use <strong>positive reinforcement </strong>you could tell Brain something like: “If we work on this task for 25 minutes without interruption you can have a piece of chocolate”. You want to reinforce the good behaviour of focus by rewarding it with chocolate.<br></p><p>Don’t confuse this with <strong>negative reinforcement</strong>. If Brain wants to play PUBG, and you say: “you can play PUBG but we have to finish today’s blog post first”. Here you are turning a pressure on, and when Brains complies your turn it off.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two very important things to remember when using negative reinforcement: (1) once the pressure is turned on, it can’t be turned off until Brain complies. If you told Brain that he can play after you finish the blog post, but you don’t finish it and you let him play, it defeats the entire purpose. (2) Once Brain complies, the pressure must immediately be turned off. If you finished your blog post don’t ask Brain for more work, doing so will make this method less effective later on.<br></p><p>For <strong>positive punishment, </strong>you may need the help of other people. For example,<strong> </strong>if you notice that Brain is spending a lot of time playing video games, you could ask your friend or partner to help you “punish” Brain, and force you to do more cleaning duties like doing the dishes. And if they catch you playing, you have to do 50 jumping jacks. The point is that an unpleasant consequence is introduced to the subject to discourage this behavior.<br></p><p>If after all of&nbsp; that Brain still didn’t comply, you can delete the game from your phone, or ask a friend to change your account password. That would be an example for <strong>negative punishment</strong>, you are taking something of value away.<br></p><p>Finally, to strengthen all the new behaviours you could use <em>Social Learning</em>. Take Brain and hang out with other people who have trained “Brains”. Either it’s a local group of friends or an online community. Interacting with other well-behaving “Brains” will help your Brain to do less of the bad behaviours and more of the good ones.</p><h2>🧠 = 🐶 ?</h2><p>We want to believe so bad that we are rational beings, but that simply is not true. The same way a dog’s decisions are driven by impulse, most of your decisions are too as well. If you want to control your actions you need to control the impulses behind them. And the same way you can train a dog to do progressively more complex behaviors and tasks, so too can you train your brain to take on more and more disciplined activities.<br></p><p>Hopefully, by using the brain-dog analogy, you can see that there is progress to be made and it will take time and patience. As you don’t expect your dog to know how to spin or wave on day one, you shouldn’t expect your brain to be super focused and productive without training. So don’t forget to be nice to yourself and your inner-dog.</p><p>📕 This chapter is part of my upcoming book <em>“TL;DR — a book about productivity by a procrastination master”</em>.

<hr>



<h4>How is Human Unitec International (HMNU) capitalizing on the GRONE?</h4>



<p>HMNU struck a $40.8m binding purchase agreement with Palladium Investments SA, of Lugano, Switzerland on June 11, 2020, to build the first GRONE plant in Saudi Arabia. This purchase agreement includes six plants.</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/HMNU/news/story?e&amp;id=1633883">June 29<sup>th</sup> release</a>, HMNU has successfully launched their prototype for a 10-ton capacity recycling plant with Grupo Sedda of Porto Torres. This plant is currently conducting operations for <span>tire recycling</span>. <span>The average annual net income to be generated is $1.8m USD.</span> With a budgeted investment cap at only $2m.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/HMNU/news/story?e&amp;id=1636270">June, 30<sup>th</sup></a> an extension was made to include a second GRONE purchase. However, this one is for <span>plastic recycling</span>, with a 10-ton max for electricity production.</p>



<p>Group Sedda founder, Andrea Sedda commented on the deal, “We are very happy to have the chance to build this fantastic equipment in Sardinia. The GRONE plant represents a significant evolution in the growth of the renewable green energy for our country and our environment. Economically, a 10 tons plant is able to produce up to 8 tons of green eco diesel a day, equal to 12,600,000 KW/year or over Euros (€) 2,772,000 in net revenues.”</p>

<p><strong>PHP is a dynamically typed scripting language</strong> and until the year
of 2015 php had no support for statically declared types at all. One
could cast to scalar types explicitly in the code, but declaring scalar
types in methods and functions signatures wasn't a thing until PHP 7.0
with the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5">Scalar Type Declarations</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types">Return Type Declarations</a> rfcs.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that from version 7.0 PHP became a statically typed
language, though. <strong>It has type hinting that can be analyzed statically</strong>
but <strong>it still supports dynamic types</strong> and even allows them to be mixed.
See the example below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function returnsInt(): int
{
  return '100';
}</code></pre>
<p>No doubt that <strong>there's a type mismatch there</strong>. The return type is
supposed to be <em>int</em> and the returned type is in fact a <em>string</em>. Now,
what PHP does there is to automatically transform the token '100'
into an integer in order to return the required type. Even though it
seems to have an extra cost, it doesn't. PHP's type juggling is <em>nearly</em>
cost-free in many cases.</p>
<p>To better clarify how the language deals with types I'll split this article
into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#union-types">Union Types</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-juggling">PHP's type juggling</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-modes">PHP type modes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions on what to add here, feel free to
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">reach out to me on twitter</a> or opening an issue on
github.</p>
<h2 id="kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</h2>
<p>PHP's type system is very simplified when it comes to language features.
For example there's no <em>char</em> type, or <em>unsigned</em> types or even <em>int8</em>,
<em>int16</em>, <em>int32</em>, <em>int64</em>...</p>
<p>The <em>char</em> type is simplified to a string type and all <em>integer</em> variations
are simplified into an <em>integer</em> type. Whether that's a good or bad thing, is
up to you.</p>
<p>One can always inspect a variable's type using the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> function or using
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a> function and
checking its output.</p>
<p>PHP comes with three different kinds of types: <strong>scalar types</strong>, <strong>compound types</strong>
and <strong>special types</strong>.</p>
<h3>Scalar types</h3>
<p>Scalar types are the bare bones of the language and they are four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boolean (<code>bool</code> | <code>boolean</code>)</li>
<li>Integer (<code>int</code> | <code>integer</code>)</li>
<li>Float (<code>float</code> | <code>double</code>)</li>
<li>String (<code>string</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>By definition scalar types do not carry behaviour or state with themselves.
Expressions like <code>100-&gt;toString()</code> or <code>'thephp.website'::length()</code> are invalid.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: scalar values do not have behaviour or state, they just represent
a value.</strong></p>
<h3>Compound types</h3>
<p>Compound types are much more interesting because even though they are very similar
to the scalar type, <strong>each one of the four compound types carry different syntactic
capabilities.</strong></p>
<p>The four compound types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#compound-type-array">array</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-object">object</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-callable">callable</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-iterable">iterable</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compound-type-array">The array compound type</h4>
<p>An array is in fact a hashmap, built-in to the language. Meaning that it stores
values in a <strong>key =&gt; value</strong> manner. Even if you use it purely as a vector.</p>
<p>Arrays are very flexible structures when it comes to size, internal types and
key-value mapping. The examples below are all valid arrays:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$vec = [0, 1, 2];
// $vec[1] is int(1)

$map = ['a' =&gt; 1, 'b' =&gt; 2];
// $map['a'] is int(1)

$map_ish = ['a' =&gt; 1, 0 =&gt; 2];
// $map_ish['a'] is int(1)
// $map_ish[0] =&gt; is int(2)</code></pre>
<p>Unlike C, php won't require you to define an array's size before creating it.
This of course comes with a memory consumption cost: the bigger your array size,
the more memory you'll consume in crazy proportions (in fact, arrays are allocated in powers of two).
How this consumption works is out of the scope of this article,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">feel free to ping me if you'd like to hear more</a>.</p>
<p>In case you're curious about this statement, the video below presents some charts
and further insights on arrays vs. object memory profiles.</p>

<p>As you'll see bellow, arrays are also considered to be of type <em>iterable</em>, meaning
that you can iterate over them using a <em>foreach</em> loop. But they also provide
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php">specific functions that can manipulate their internal pointers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: array is an extremely flexible compound type that can be perceived
as a HashMap and is also considered an iterable type.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-object">The object compound type</h4>
<p>Due to php's architecture, the <em>object</em> compound type normally has a much lower memory
consumption profile when compared with arrays. That's because <em>normally</em> one would use
the object type by creating instances of classes.</p>
<p>Objects can carry state and behaviour. Meaning that php will offer dereferencing
language structs to access an object's internals. The snippet below illustrates
a php object's derefs:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  private const A = 1;
  public int $property = 0;
  public function method(): void {}
}

$obj = new MyClass();
// $obj is object(MyClass)
// $obj::A is int(1)
// $obj-&gt;property is int(0)
// $obj-&gt;method() is null</code></pre>
<p>An object can also be normally created as a result of a type cast from an array.
Transforming an array's keys into objects property names. Such cast will always
result in an <code>object(stdClass)</code> type.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) ['a' =&gt; 1];
// $obj is object(stdClass)
// $obj-&gt;a is int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Important to notice that casting an array with numeric keys into an object is valid,
but one can't dereference its value because property names may not start with numbers.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) [0, 1]; // Legal
$obj-&gt;0; // Illegal</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: objects normally have lower memory profiles than arrays, they carry
state and behaviour, they all inherit from stdClass and can be created by casting an
array.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-callable">The callable compound type</h4>
<p>A callable in php is anything that can be called (oh don't you say!!) with parenthesis
or with the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php">call_user_func()</a>
function. In other words, a callable can fulfil the responsibility of what we know as
functions. Functions and methods are always callables. Objects and classes may also become
callables.</p>
<p>A callable can, by definition, have its reference stored in a variable. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$callable = 'strlen';</code></pre>
<p>What? But that's a string, no?</p>
<p>Well, yes. But it can be coerced into a callable if necessary. Like below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function callACallable(
  callable $f
): int {
  return $f('thephp.website');
}

$callable = 'strlen';

var_dump(
  $callable('thephp.website')
);
// int(14)

var_dump(
  callACallable($callable)
);
// int(14)</code></pre>
<p>Callables may also point to object methods:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  public function myMethod(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyClass();
var_dump([$obj, 'myMethod']());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Looks odd? I know it looks like an array. In fact it is. Unless you name it a callable 👀</p>
<p>This kind of callable above (object-method reference) is very interesting because
<strong>you can call private or protected methods</strong> with it <strong>if you're inside the class' scope.</strong>
Otherwise you may only call public methods with it.</p>
<p>Also classes that implement
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.invoke">the __invoke() magic method</a>,
automatically transform their instances into callables themselves. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyCallableClass
{
  public function __invoke(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyCallableClass();
var_dump($obj());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: callables hold reference to functions or methods and can be
constructed in different ways.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-iterable">The iterable compound type</h4>
<p>Iterables are simpler to explain: they are by definition an array or an instance of
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.traversable.php">Traversable interface</a>. The
main thing of an iterable is that it can be used in a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php">foreach() loop</a>, with a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.generators.syntax.php#control-structures.yield.from">yield from statement</a>
or with <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spread_operator_for_array">spread operator</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of iterables are:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function generator_function(): Generator
{
  // ...
};

// All variables here are iterables
$a = [0, 1, 2];
$b = generator_function();
$c = new ArrayObject();</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: if you can fit it in a foreach(), it is an iterable.</strong></p>
<h3>Special Types</h3>
<p>There are two special types. And the biggest reason why they're called special, is that
<strong>you can't cast these types</strong>. The special types are both the <strong>resource</strong> type and
the <strong>NULL</strong> type.</p>
<p><strong>A resource represents a handle to an external resource</strong>. It can be a file handle,
an I/O stream or a database connection handle. You may guess now why you can't convert
a resource to any other type.</p>
<p><strong>The null type represents a null value</strong>. Meaning that a variable holding NULL was not
initialized, assigned to NULL or unset during runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: a special typed value can't be casted to anything.</strong></p>
<h3>What about class instances?</h3>
<p>Class instances have the type <code>object</code> and will always be presented like so. Executing
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> on an object will always return
a <code>string("object")</code> and calling <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a>
on an object will always print its value using the <code>object(ClassName)</code> notation. If you need
to fetch an object's class as a string, use the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-class">get_class()</a> function.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = new stdClass();

echo gettype($obj);
// object

var_dump($obj);
// object(stdClass)#1 (0) {
// ...

echo get_class($obj);
// \stdClass</code></pre>
<h2 id="type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</h2>
<p>There are different "operations" one can do with PHP when it comes to types. I believe
it is important to clearly state them here so that we don't mix things up later on.</p>
<h3>Type juggling: type casting and coercion</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, here are three important definitions we need keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type conversion</strong> means to transform a type from A to B. For example: from integer to float.</li>
<li><strong>Type cast</strong> means to <strong>manually</strong> or <strong>explicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$hundred = (int) 100.0</code>. (<code>float(100.0)</code> became <code>int(100)</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type coercion</strong> means to <strong>implicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$twenty = 10 + '10 bananas';</code>. (<code>string("10 bananas")</code> became <code>int(10)</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Being that said, the following sections explain how it happens in php. Later on you'll find
more information on Type Juggling.</p>
<h4>Type casting</h4>
<p>Similar to what Java does, php allows type casting. Meaning that when a variable points to
a value that can be casted to a different type, it allows manual (explicit) type conversion.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. What!? 🤨</p>
<p>Given a variable <code>$hundred</code> holding a <code>string("100")</code> its value may be manually converted (casted)
to become an <code>int(100)</code> or a <code>float(100.00)</code> - or any other scalar type or one of compound
types <em>array</em> or <em>object</em>.</p>
<p>The following snippet works just fine in PHP and is very similar to Java:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$hundred = (int) '100';
// $hundred is now int(100)</code></pre>
<p>Now, one thing Java does and is completely illegal on php code, is to …</p></iframe></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9357"><div><div><div><h2>Amazon’s venture capital fund accused of investing in small companies just to steal their ideas</h2><p>Jeff Bezos’ owned world’s biggest eCommerce firm is actually a predator! Amazon is reportedly using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon is accused of investing in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. The e-commerce retailer then uses this confidential information to launch its own service based on such data.</p><p>According to a report in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249">Wall Street Journal(Paywall)</a>, Amazon.com’s venture-capital fund invested in DefinedCrowd and gained access to the technology startup’s finances and other confidential information. Four years later the marketplace launched a similar artificial intelligence product that does almost exactly what DefinedCrowd does.</p><p>DefinedCrowd founder and CEO Daniela Braga has accused Amazon of stealing their concept to launch its own product. Amazon recently launched a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) product called A2I. DefinedCrowd CEO says that it is completely based on their product and competes directly with them. And all this under the garb of venture capital funding.</p><p>Another company that suffered a similar fate was LivingSocial. LivingSocial officials met with Amazon’s venture capital firm to discuss a potential investment. At the end of the talks, Amazon purchased 30 percent of LivingSocial equity. After buying the share in LivingSocial, Amazon requested access to proprietary LivingSocial data. In a few months, Amazon started reaching out to its own clients offering better deals for similar products.</p><p>Even Amazon’s Echo seems to have been developed using this predatory thieving. A company that built Ubi, a smart speaker was in talks with Amazon for seed funding. The Ubi officials met with Amazo several times to discuss funding and concepts. It was just a matter of days before Amazon launched a similar product to Ubi- Amazon’s Echo. Due to the Echo launch, Ubi has all but disappeared.</p><p>WSJ report says that many startup founders claimed that after Amazon launched rival products their businesses collapsed. Some say they were being forced to downsize their companies due to Amazon’s competition.</p><p>Amazon has refused to comment on the predatory nature of its venture capital fund. Amazon says that such funding meetings are confidential in nature. Amazon, however, added that information obtained from such meetings is not used to build competing products, noting that any such claims are typically resolved in court.</p><p>“For 26 years, we’ve pioneered many features, products, and even whole new categories. From amazon.com itself to Kindle to Echo to AWS, few companies can claim a track record for innovation that rivals Amazon’s,” an Amazon spokesperson told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-startup-investment-competitors-wsj-report-echo-nucleus-ubi-2020-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>. “Unfortunately, there will always be self-interested parties who complain rather than build. Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts.”</p><p>While court decisions may take a long time and many of these startups are too small to fight with a giant like Amazon armed with a battery of A-list lawyers, it is answerable to the US anti-trust body which it will be facing next week. The Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos will have to testify in the official hearing scheduled for Monday in front of the House Judiciary Committee.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>In an industry saturated with upbeat bubblegum pop beats, it’s difficult to stand out or add any layer of depth: but Emily Vu does just that. You may know her as a teen Tik Tok sensation, having amassed over 1.4 million followers on the platform, accompanied by a fervent 386k on Instagram, but the California-native proves she’s more than just a viral star in the latest of her recent string of releases, ‘Just Wait’. </p>



<p>Having already achieved huge success with her first original single debuted back in October 2019 and now boasting an intimidating 1.3 million streams on Spotify, Emily has been busy at work, in a time where most of us our stuck in a productivity rut, with the release of her 4th track in just a couple of months. Overlaying a breezy summer beat, the singer songwriter laments on past relationships through a reel of introspective lyricism and youthful vocals. I spoke to Emily following the release of ‘Just Wait’ to explore the approach behind it:</p>



<p><strong><em>‘Just Wait’ has been described as exploring the vulnerability of falling in love – a common theme throughout your music. Where do you draw your inspiration from here?</em></strong></p>



<p>I only write songs from my own experience so I guess you could say my inspiration comes from myself and all the different relationships I’ve been in.</p>



<p><strong><em>The song itself is lighthearted and airy, whereas the lyrics are slightly more somber in contrast. What was the songwriting process behind this?</em></strong></p>



<p>I was in a session with my producer SZNS and usually when we work together he’ll take some time to produce the instrumental before we start writing. While he was producing it out, I had a chorus melody stuck in my head, so I just sat down and started writing it. We both loved it and continued to work on it from there.</p>



<p><strong><em>What’s been the biggest step change for you as an artist since your first release last year in comparison to ‘Just Wait’?</em></strong></p>



<p>I think my voice has evolved since my first ever release. Part of that stems from my voice getting better over time, but I also think a big portion of it is learning to sing with the sound I want and how I want listeners to connect with my music.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you have any plans to release an EP with your recent body of work?</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, very soon! I’m currently working on some big projects!</p>



<p><strong><em>Being a young person in music is undoubtedly an enormous challenge. What motivated you to pursue music? What challenges have you faced in navigating the industry?</em></strong></p>



<p>The thing that motivates me to pursue music is my love for it. I love music and I can never really see myself doing anything else. As a young artist, I’ve definitely faced the challenge of getting other people in the industry to take me seriously.</p>



<p><strong><em>How has the response to your music been in your view?</em></strong></p>



<p>The response has been amazing! I get tons of messages from fans telling me how a song has helped them through a tough time and it truly warms my heart.</p>



<p><strong><em>Who or what are your main inspirations musically, and how has this influenced your own style?</em></strong></p>



<p>Lauv is an artist that I really look up to. I’ve been listening to his music for years.</p>



<p><strong><em>In a previous interview you mentioned hating having to play the piano when you were younger, but regaining a love for it after playing it your way. How has your experience with music when you were younger shaped your artistry today?</em></strong></p>



<p>I think that having prior knowledge of music and playing instruments has helped me pick things up quicker in the studio. I recognize keys and tempos so much more easily.</p>



<p><strong><em>Mean Muse Magazine is a platform dedicated to women &amp; non-binary people in music to showcase their talent where they’re often underrepresented. When was the first time you saw someone in music you identified with or who resonated with you?</em></strong></p>



<p>The first artist I really resonated with was Hayley Kiyoko. I remember stumbling across her music video for “Girls Like Girls” and falling in love with her music.</p>



<p><strong><em>You’re of course very active on social media, with a strong following across major platforms, particularly Tik Tok. Would you say that social media has been more of a help or hindrance in your career to date given the misrepresentative labels that can come with being seen as just a ‘TikTok artist’?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I can say it’s been both helpful and a burden, but nevertheless I’ll always be thankful for the platform I’ve been given.</p>



<p><strong><em>Final question: we always love being put onto new music – who are you listening to right now?</em></strong></p>



<p>My favorite artist right now is SAINt JHN. You should definitely listen to “Selfish” and “Monica Lewinsky”!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Listen to ‘Just Wait’ here:</strong></p>







<p><strong>Follow Emily Vu on social media:</strong></p>

<p> The WTTC, a council that represents private-sector travel and tourism, created the Safe Travels stamp to allow tourists to identify destinations and businesses around the world that have adopted the global standardised health and hygiene protocols.</p> 
<p>The stamp provides guidance to travel providers and travellers about the new approach to health, hygiene, deep cleansing and physical distancing, in the “new normal” of a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
<p> The protocols were devised following the experience of WTTC members dealing with Covid-19 and based on guidelines from the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and control.</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.unwto.org/">The United Nations World Tourism Organisation</a> has welcomed the WTTC Safe Travels stamp, which makes the safety and hygiene of travellers a top priority.</p> 

<p>“As we reopen Dubai’s doors to tourism and welcome our international visitors back to the city, our foremost priority is their well-being, achieved through stringent hygiene and safety protocols that have been deployed across all tourist touch points,” Helal Saeed Almarri, director general, Dubai’s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (Dubai Tourism) said. </p>

<p>“The WTTC's Safe Travels stamp endorses Dubai’s strong global co-operation in combating the pandemic with comprehensive and effective measures to ensure guest health and safety.</p>
<p> “We trust that our efforts not only provide an optimised experience for our visitors, but also secure their health and that of their families, further cementing the confidence that our guests have had thus far in Dubai, and encouraging people from every corner of the world to visit one of the safest cities in the world this summer.”</p> 
 
<p>The UAE has been praised for its coronavirus response. A survey by the Deep Knowledge Group, a consortium of technology companies and non-profit organisations, last month ranked the Emirates as 11th on the list in its responses to the pandemic.</p> 
<p>Costa Rica, Indonesia, Rwanda, Tobago and Tanzania are also among the latest recipients of the health and safety stamp.</p> 
<p>The growing list of endorsements has come from many major holiday and city destinations around the world, such as Sharjah as well Malaga in Spain, which joins the growing list of Spanish destinations including Alicante and Benidorm.</p> 
<p>Gloria Guevara, WTTC president and chief executive, said: “Our Safe Travels stamp is proving a great success and we are delighted to see even more popular countries and destinations adopt our global health and hygiene protocols.</p>

<p>“The success of the WTTC Safe Travels stamp shows its importance not only to countries and destinations, but also crucially to travellers and the 330 million people around the world who work in and depend on the travel and tourism sector.</p> 
<p>“The stamp is a critical step in re-establishing consumer confidence in travel and tourism and ensuring travellers can rest easy knowing that enhanced standards of hygiene are in place and they can once again experience ‘safe travels’.”</p>

<h2>Background</h2>



<p>IPv6 is coming, but we still have to use IPv4 also. In other words, we have to keep use IPv4/IPv6 dual stack environment. Also, ISPs use different aggregators for IPv4 and IPv6 (For example, PPPoE for IPv4, IPoE for IPv6). And their capacity and performance are different. As a result, connections speed of  IPv4 and IPv6 are different.</p>



<p>I’ll talk the statistics of this player at next APNIC conference (IPv6 deployment session). Please play the videos.</p>



<h2>IPv4 IPv6 Multi Protocol Media Player</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.kosho.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/46mplayer.png" alt=""></figure>



<h3>Speed comparison</h3>



<p>The player downloads media chunks by IPv4 and IPv6 (e.g. media001.ts by IPv4, media002.ts by IPv6, media003.ts by IPv4, media004.ts by IPv6 …) and calculate the download speeds. </p>



<h3>Protocol selection</h3>



<p>After the comparison, the player use the faster protocol. There are 2 modes:</p>



<ul><li>Initial check mode<ul><li>The player compares the protocols during the first segments. After that, the player keeps using the faster protocol.</li></ul></li><li>Continuous check mode<ul><li>The player compares the protocols during the first segments. After that, the player uses both protocols by the following rate (e.g.) to get the latest speeds.<ul><li>faster protocol: 4</li><li>slower protocol: 1</li></ul></li><li>The reason of this mode: media streaming could keep long (For example TV streaming would continue to be watched for several hours).  Protocol speeds could be changed during the hours.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>I made a simple plugin (hls-46.js) for hls.js. Github page will be available soon.</p>



<h2>Sample</h2>



<p>Caution: all samples are only available for IPv6:</p>



<ul><li>Simple speed comparison<ul><li><a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-comp0.html">http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-comp0.html</a></li></ul><ul><li>This sample only uses the plugin for speed display. IPv4/IPv6 mixed play uses the media playlist (<a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/tears-2m-5-mixed.m3u8">tears-2m-2-mixed.m3u8</a>) has the following entries:<ul><li>#EXTINF:2.00000</li><li>https://ipv6.jstream.jp/media/hls2/2M-2/tears000.ts</li><li>#EXTINF:2.00000</li><li>https://ipv4.jstream.jp/media/hls2/2M-2/tears001.ts</li><li>#EXTINF:2.00000</li><li>https://ipv6.jstream.jp/media/hls2/2M-2/tears002.ts</li><li>#EXTINF:2.00000</li><li>https://ipv4.jstream.jp/media/hls2/2M-2/tears003.ts</li><li>…</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Speed comparison by plugin<ul><li><a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-comp1.html">http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-comp1.html</a></li><li>This sample uses the normal playlist (<a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/tears-2m-2-template.m3u8">tears-2m-2-template.m3u8</a>) and the plugin adds the hosts (ipv4.jpcdn.jp, ipv6.jpcdn.jp) one by one.</li></ul></li><li>Protocol selection (Initial check mode)<ul><li><a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-mcdn1.html">http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-mcdn1.html</a></li></ul></li><li>Protocol selection (Continuous check mode)<ul><li><a href="http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-mcdn2.html">http://ipv6.jpcdn.jp/hls-mcdn2.html</a></li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The player has console output (Browser debug window: F12) that shows each download speeds.</p>

              <p>Bounding boxes are one of the most popular—and recognized tools when it comes to image processing for image and video annotation projects.<br></p><p>Image processing is one of the main reasons why computer vision continues to improve and drive innovative AI-based technologies. From self-driving cars to facial recognition technology—computer vision applications are the face of new tech. <br></p><p>But image processing can’t be as simple as drawing rectangles around objects—right? How do bounding boxes work, and what are the key elements that make this such a useful tool for annotators looking to create reliable datasets?</p><h2 id="bounding-box-image-processing-what-you-need-to-know">Bounding Box Image Processing: What You Need to Know</h2><p>A bounding box is an imaginary rectangle that serves as a point of reference for object detection and creates a collision box for that object. <br></p><p>Data annotators draw these rectangles over images, outlining the object of interest within each image by defining its X and Y coordinates. This makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to find what they’re looking for, determine collision paths, and conserves valuable computing resources. <br></p><p>Bounding boxes are one of the most popular image annotation techniques in deep learning. Compared to other image processing methods, this method can reduce costs and increase annotation efficiency.</p><h2 id="using-bounding-boxes-for-object-detection">Using Bounding Boxes for Object Detection</h2><p>But how does object detection work in relation to bounding boxes? Answering this question requires looking at object detection as two components: object classification and object localization. In other words, to detect an object in an image, the computer needs to know what it is and where it is. <br></p><p>Take self-driving cars as an example. An annotator will draw bounding boxes around other vehicles and label them. This helps train an algorithm to understand what vehicles look like. Annotating objects such as vehicles, traffic signals, and pedestrians makes it possible for autonomous vehicles to maneuver busy streets safely. Self-driving car perception models rely heavily on bounding boxes to make this possible.<br></p><p>However, it’s important to note that a single bounding box doesn’t guarantee a perfect prediction rate. Enhanced object detection requires many bounding boxes in combination with data augmentation techniques.</p><h2 id="common-use-cases-for-bounding-boxes">Common Use Cases for Bounding Boxes</h2><p>There are a variety of use cases for image processing and bounding boxes. Some of the more popular ones include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://keymakr.com/autonomous-vehicle.php">Self-driving cars</a></li><li>Insurance claims</li><li><a href="https://keymakr.com/retail.php">Ecommerce</a></li><li><a href="https://keymakr.com/agriculture.php">Agriculture</a></li><li>Healthcare<br></li></ul><p>Bounding boxes are used in all of these areas to train algorithms to identify patterns. An insurance company may leverage machine learning to document insurance claims for car accidents, while an agriculture company could use it to identify what stage of growth a plant is in.</p><h2 id="professional-bounding-box-annotation-services">Professional Bounding Box Annotation Services</h2><p>For those of us working in the AI industry, you may be familiar with the phrase “garbage in, garbage out.” This is spot-on. Feeding your system inaccurate training datasets is one of the best ways to sabotage your next computer vision project. <br></p><p>Misaligned bounding boxes throw a wrench in your algorithm and can take significant time to diagnose and fix. That’s why AI companies often choose to <a href="https://keymakr.com/blog/reasons-to-outsource-image-and-video-annotation/">outsource image and video annotation</a> to professional annotators.

            <p>“I’m trying to go down a bottomless pit. I’ll never make it till the end.”</p>
<p>That’s what I thought when I tried to create my own video game. I was young, beautiful, and I was struggling to use <code>for</code> loops and <code>arrays</code> at the same time.
There was so much to learn!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found the strength to continue. More and more, the concepts behind programming began to make sense. From there, learning wasn’t a chore anymore, but an intrepid journey. Going through a book about C and trying to create my own adventure on MS-DOS was a crazy Indiana Jone’s-like discovery I’ll never forget.</p>
<p>My first video game wasn’t great, but it was mine. It was <em>my</em> creation. Yet, what I remember today, with a tear in my left eye, is not the result, but the learning process itself. It was these “Aha!” moments which brought me the most joy!</p>
<p>I love learning. For a long, long time. That’s why I tried, through the years, to make my learning gradually more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>Learning is essential for developers. We need to learn about the new breakthroughs, discoveries, and changes in the industry.</p>
<p>We need to learn about our history, to know what’s really new, what’s not, and what to do with it, <em>in what context</em>.</p>
<p>We need to learn about the business domain of the company we’re working with.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to better communicates with our teammates.</p>
<p>We need to learn about what our customers really want.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, this article will brush over the wide subject of learning, as a developer. We’ll try to answer these questions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s learning?</li>
<li>Why do we learn? Should learning serve a goal?</li>
<li>How to avoid ineffective learning methods, procrastination, and distractions?</li>
<li>Should we have a mentor or learn by ourselves?</li>
<li>Is practice only makes perfect?</li>
<li>How to test ourselves to avoid the illusion of competence?</li>
<li>Are feedback important? What kind of feedback can you get? What feedback should you be interested in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to dive? Good. Take your machete and let’s go together through the Deep Jungle of Knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="whats-learning">What’s learning?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we can be very surprised of the meaning of common words. Especially if we never question their definitions.</p>
<p>For example, I’m always surprised to hear people saying that learning is only a question of memory. It’s not wrong, but it’s incomplete.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oxford dictionary</a>, learning means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives us clues about how to learn (study, experience, or being taught), but not really about the meaning of “acquisition of knowledge”.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the definition of <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/knowledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can already see, thanks to these definitions, two main fundamentals for learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding</li>
<li>Remembering (acquisition)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll add a third one:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Transfer</li>
</ol>
<p>Transfer is applying the knowledge from the learning context to another context. For example, it could be applying the programming knowledge your learned at school to the side project you always dreamt to build.</p>
<p>Transfer is not a necessity for learning. After all, you can understand and remember something without ever using what you learned.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, we learn in hope to apply the knowledge acquired. That’s why it’s still a major component of our learning experiences.</p>

</picture>



<h3 id="enriching-your-life">Enriching Your Life</h3>
<p>Learning will enrich your life in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your opinions will evolve.</li>
<li>Your vision on the world will change.</li>
<li>You’ll feel strong connections with people who share your interests, creating passionate and mind-binding conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning can open doors in your professional life:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can help you climbing the corporate ladder.</li>
<li>It can help you to negotiate a better salary. After all, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge workers</a>: our worth is <em>partly</em> our knowledge.</li>
<li>It will create opportunities for <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/guide-debate-software-developer-skill/">healthy debates with your fellow colleagues</a>.</li>
<li>Your CTO might call you <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/software-developer-titles-junior-senior/">“Rockstar” or “Ninja”</a> too, you lucky pit of knowledge!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning-with-or-without-goals">Learning With or Without Goals?</h3>
<p>When you try to learn something, it’s useful to have concrete goals you want to achieve with the knowledge acquired. These goals could be a good occasion to <em>transfer</em> your knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, you want to learn programming because you always dreamt to create a revolutionary video game, where you can break bricks with a ball. Maybe you want to learn what’s the <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/dry-principle-cost-benefit-example/">DRY principle</a>, to finally refactor your favorite legacy application.</p>
<p>Without meaningful goals, it will be difficult to be motivated in the long run. Learning is not easy. Understanding can be a daunting task (depending of what you learn), remembering even more so, and transfer is maybe the worst of all.</p>
<p>It takes time, too. That’s why being able to reach concrete goals with your new skills and knowledge can be very satisfying. It will give you the needed motivation to continue on your learning path.</p>
<p>It’s even more true when you try to learn complex topics. Your motivation is something you should try to assess and even measure along the way, to see if you need to boost it by making (and finishing) something important to you.</p>
<p>It’s always possible to learn for the sake of learning. Heck, I do it quite a lot myself. Yet, you need to have a good confidence on your motivation, and you need to be aware of the benefits of the learning journey itself.</p>
<p>If you have difficulties to find concrete ideas and goals where you can transfer your new knowledge, I wrote a whole article about techniques <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/generate-programming-side-project-ideas/">to generate project ideas</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-deep-do-you-want-to-go">How Deep Do You Want to Go?</h2>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/experts.jpg" alt="Being an expert is not necessarily your goal">
</picture>



<p>Now that you have your goals, you need to decide <em>how much</em> you want to learn.</p>
<p>After all, you don’t need to be an expert in everything.</p>
<p>Moreover, knowledge acquisition is not like buying a new table for your living room. You need some maintenance not to forget the knowledge and skills acquired.</p>
<p>It means that you need to constantly refresh your knowledge and skills, for everything you want to be an expert at. It takes time, energy, and require, again, a lot of motivation.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that your life’s dream is to write a PHP script to rename automatically thousands of your holidays pictures. You don’t need to be a PHP evangelist to answer your needs. Trying to understand superficially how PHP works to accomplish what you want might be enough.</p>
<p>Superficial learning works well if you don’t have any goal, too. You can read about programming paradigms for example, by pure curiosity, to have a global overview of all of them. You can still dive deeper if you wish later.</p>
<p>Beyond the superficial, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreyfus model of competence</a> can help you deciding how competent you want to become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novice</strong> - Shallow understanding, or no understanding at all.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Beginner</strong> - Can make things works, often rely on following a series of steps.</li>
<li><strong>Competent</strong> - Can spot the roots of problems (background understanding), know all the rules and can select a rule depending of the situation. Still make many mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Proficient</strong> - Very conscious about performance, know perfectly what approaches to take in what situation.</li>
<li><strong>Expert</strong> - Intuition very well developed, apply his skills without thoughts, performances look magical.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1nzADdV6zk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose your destiny</a>, depending on your needs!</p>

</picture>



<p>Let’s see now how you should prepare yourself before learning anything.</p>
<p>The following advice won’t change your life from one day to another. You need to work on it, actively seeking to apply these advice, day after day. The rewards are, however, huge. I promise.</p>
<h3 id="the-mistakes-to-avoid">The Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>Let’s go back years in your past, when you were young, innocent, and not a caffeine junky yet.</p>
<p>You’re at school. The teacher is speaking about whatever subject he wants you to learn. His tone is monotonous, he doesn’t believe in what he’s saying, you think about what you’ll eat at lunch.</p>
<p>You’re bored.</p>
<p>The seconds feel like minutes. Minutes feel like hours. You can’t do anything, except waiting. Will it ever end? Will you feel joy again? Is it the end of time?</p>
<p>Finally, against all odds, the course end. The teacher ask you to learn a new chapter of your book. He will test you next time.</p>
<p>At home, you read again and again the learning material. You have difficulties to concentrate, but you’re a serious boy (or girl), so you push yourself through. After five reading, you judge yourself good enough to pass the next test.</p>
<p>You close your book, satisfied with yourself, and switch on the TV, because Youtube might not exist yet.</p>
<p>What I just described is the worst way to learn something. <em>Passively</em> listening to somebody, then <em>passively</em> going through some learning materials might teach you something, but very, very slowly. You don’t need to be in a class for that: just switch on Youtube and consume <em>passively</em> any video on programming.</p>
<p>When you close your book after your passive learning, you think you learned something. Yet, when you’ll pass your test, you’ll understand that you really didn’t.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>illusion of competence</strong>: we have often the <em>impression</em> we learned something, even if we didn’t.</p>
<p>You should spend most of your time <em>actively learning</em>. You need to be an actor in your own learning, not only consuming it like you would consume Netflix.</p>
<p>I would compare active learning as playing a video game. Yes, I was a video game junky.</p>
<p>When you play, you’re actively doing something. Consequently, I’m sure you can remember many more video games than what you read in your last books.</p>
<p>This is due to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Video games are fun. You can make your learning experience fun, too. More you’ll learn what you love, more you’ll like the process of learning.</li>
<li>Playing is an active endeavor, not a passive one.</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, before actively learning, you need …</p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many people ask me why I chose not to pursue a PhD directly after college. I figured I might as well centralize my thoughts in one place. This essay is for computer science or technical grads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested in machine learning</li>
<li>Enjoy working on hard, unsolved technical challenges</li>
<li>Possibly choosing between research or industry</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who deeply enjoys thinking about and coding solutions to open-ended research questions, I genuinely considered going to a PhD program. To come to a decision, I spent a while pondering why many students with research experience don’t pursue a PhD directly after undergrad. I think there are many reasons why people don’t go directly to PhD programs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Effort</em>: it’s a lot of work to write applications for many schools, get solid recommendation letters, pay a lot of money in application fees, go through interviews, align with professors, secure funding, and more.</li>
<li><em>Comfort</em>: industry perks and salaries can be more attractive than graduate school stipends and long work hours.</li>
<li><em>Inertia</em>: if you’re not absolutely sure it’s right for you, the thought of switching trajectories midway into the program is very anxiety-provoking.</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt like I could put in the effort to apply and would enjoy a PhD program if I got in, but I still didn’t know what to do. Delaying the decision didn’t feel optimal either, since even if I worked in industry for a few years before going to a PhD program, I didn’t think I’d easily accustom to a large pay cut and working on problem sets again. Understandably, the PhD vs Industry decision caused me a lot of stress! Halfway through my senior year, I wrote down some pros and cons for each choice. In practice, an industry job for me meant working at a startup since I didn’t really enjoy my engineering internships at large companies. </p>
<p>Here, I discuss the raw pros and cons of pursuing a PhD and pros and cons of joining an early-stage machine learning startup. I wrote these in my journal in January 2019, and I provide some relevant commentary from my current self as a machine learning engineer (July 2020) in the nested bullets.</p>
<h2>Pros of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can prioritize my curiosity and have the freedom to learn about what I find intellectually engaging.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I’ve been at a startup, although I can still be curious about many things, I have to work on things that provide business value. The ability to not be constrained by industry value is a real pro here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can deeply hone technical expertise and have many people respect me for it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m cringing at how much external validation I used to seek. Being in computer science is playing the <a href="https://nav.al/long-term">long game</a>. You don’t always get external validation, and good work can take a while.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s easier to “be my own boss” if I were doing research.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe? Ask a researcher this question. But <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/">choosing what to work on is challenging</a>, regardless of whether you’re in research or engineering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I actually really enjoy research more than engineering.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I still feel that I enjoy research more than engineering, but I’ve committed to developing my engineering skills. Again, being in tech is playing the long game, and having good engineering skills will help me no matter where I go, whether it’s research or IC or management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There are more clear mentorship opportunities for me.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is probably true if I went to a PhD program, since I’d have access to many professors and older grad student friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can be in a stable career option (5-6 years at least if doing PhD).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This point occasionally gives me anxiety, since I don’t know exactly where I am going to be for the next 5-6 years. Startups are risky. But I’ve gotten more used to this feeling over the past year. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Maybe I’m a shitty researcher or will find out that I’m a shitty researcher.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Still a fear of mine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s unclear whether I want to end up in academia or industry research, so a PhD could be for nothing.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>One of my math PhD friends explains a PhD as “a socially acceptable reason for screwing around with whatever you’re interested in.” I like this reference, so technically going to a PhD program isn’t a waste if I enjoy it in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Incentives in academia are horrible. There are so many major conferences. How do you balance long term gains with getting the publications out?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is really true. A year ago, I didn’t know how to think long-term. I probably would have tried to maximize my number of papers and burned out in my 3rd year, complaining that I’m not working on anything truly impactful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A PhD can be really long and hard.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I love Philip Guo’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind"><em>The PhD Grind</em></a>. Unfortunately he recently took his website down, which hosted the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pros of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can learn how to build things from scratch.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Painfully true — building from scratch is challenging, but the growing pains are necessary to deeply understand productionizing ML. </li>
<li>At the time, I didn’t know about the existence of “real-world” ML and engineering tools such as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. These tools are super relevant and learning them can be its own pro.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can see how research is applied in industry and measure the gap between research and industry.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This gap is larger than I expected. It’s also really fun to apply state-of-the-art research to business cases. For example, we recently productionized a transformer model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can gain leadership skills from the beginning and be a key figure in recruiting and defining the culture.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I was thrown into the fire as soon as I joined. Now, a year later, I’ve probably done over a hundred technical interviews, led a few ML projects for key clients, and mentored a couple of interns. I would definitely not have gotten this experience at a larger company.</li>
<li>It’s also cool to be able to choose who you work with (to some extent) by hiring people that fit in with the culture you help to define.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can closely work with both experienced engineers and non-technical domain experts.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I have learned so much from every single one of my coworkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I am relatively immune to any level of risk this early in my career.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This honestly just speaks to my insane privileges of graduating from a top school, having experience at big tech companies, and being a US citizen. I am quite thankful for these things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Possibly being the only woman, potentially for a long time.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Bleh. True. No comment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This is not the route to maximize expected earnings. I could get paid more at a larger company. Only in the small chance that the startup succeeds will I make a lot of money.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>True, but I now feel like this really isn’t a priority for me. Being in tech gives me the privilege of making a high salary wherever I go, and I think that <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html">as long as I can live comfortably</a> (as I do now), I’m happy. Maybe this will change if I’m trying to buy a house or have a family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>My technical accomplishments aren’t seen outside the startup.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat false. I think there are some people outside my company who respect my technical abilities.</li>
<li>This point also doesn’t really matter too much, since<a href="https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/"> one’s career involves more than just how prolific of a programmer they are.</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I could be overworking myself.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I think this is true of any job. There are always opportunities to work more than you’re expected to. Also, as a new grad, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-mistakes-which-software-engineers-make-in-their-early-years/answer/Edmond-Lau">optimizing for learning rate</a> can feel like overworking oneself, especially in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If I don’t care about the specific application, I might not be motivated to do quality work.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Surprisingly, I don’t care too much about cars (my company’s application), but I am really, really motivated to solve the technical challenges my company faces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>My story and decision-making process<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Thinking back to the fall of 2018, I remember how stressed I felt drafting my statement of purpose. I’m the kind of person who’s never fully confident in my decisions — there’s always a nagging <em>what if?</em> in my brain. I didn’t feel a magnetic pull towards academia. I also didn’t feel like I was destined to make a huge impact in industry. What does one pursue if they’re just…unsure? I felt this urge to apply to PhD programs — after all, I grew up in a college town, I’m a professor’s daughter, and most of my closest childhood and university friends are in PhD programs.</p>
<p>One of my older friends told me, “If you know what problem you want to solve, then find the place where you’re most likely to help devise a solution.”  <em>Robustness in machine learning models is something only academics are working on</em>, I naively thought at the time. So maybe a PhD was the right move. But as I drafted my statement of purpose, writing about how we needed to construct and solve relevant toy problems because it would be imperative to have safe and robust machine learning models in the real world, it seemed silly to me that I wanted to research this field when I had never actually worked on machine learning in the real world.  What new perspectives could I bring? Why should a school accept me?</p>
<p>My wonderful undergraduate advisor, <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/">Pat Hanrahan</a>, urged me to consider working in industry for a couple years before going to a PhD program. I didn’t like the suggestion at first — what if I would never end up doing a PhD? “Well, then you’ve saved yourself five or six years! If you don’t want to do a PhD, you’ll find out eventually,” he laughed. </p>
<p>Pat had a point, so I started to look for industry machine learning jobs. Fortunately, since I had significant ML research experience for an undergrad, I could pick between many options. Did I want to do machine learning at a large company? Small company? Focus on a specific vertical?  I thought back to my machine learning project at Facebook, where I wrote a few lines of SQL to use a well-oiled tool called <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/">FBLearner</a> to set up a gradient boosting classifier. I thought about machine learning at Google, where engineers write <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a> scripts to throw lots of serialized data at one of many models in a zoo.

<p><strong>Die Corona-Warn-App funktioniert nach Recherchen von </strong><strong><em>tagesschau.de</em></strong><strong> auf vielen iPhones nur fehlerhaft. Besitzer werden oft zu spät gewarnt. Die Entwickler räumten das Problem ein - und sehen den Fehler bei Apple. </strong></p>
<p><em>Von Dominik Lauck, tagesschau.de</em></p>
<p> Fünf Wochen nach dem Start der Corona-Warn-App sind Probleme bei der Nutzung bekannt geworden. Nach Recherchen von <em>tagesschau.de</em> funktioniert auf vielen iPhones die Kontaktüberprüfung nur lückenhaft. Nutzerinnen und Nutzer wurden teilweise über Wochen nicht über die App informiert, ob sie Kontakt zu Infizierten hatten oder nicht. SAP, das die App zusammen mit der Deutschen Telekom entwickelt hat, räumte den Fehler ein.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<p> "Da gibt es Probleme, und ich hoffe ganz stark, dass die entweder sehr, sehr schnell beseitigt werden oder wir einen wirksamen Workaround finden, (…) um trotzdem die Funktionalität auf die Beine zu stellen", sagt Thomas Klingbeil, der Software-Architekt der Corona-Warn-App bei SAP gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>.</p>
<h2>Hintergrundaktualisierung wird nicht aufgerufen</h2>
<p> Woran hakt es? Auch wenn die Corona-Warn-App nicht geöffnet ist, soll sie im Hintergrund weiterlaufen und Daten aktualisieren. Wenn es eine Begegnung mit einer Person gab, die dann positiv auf das Coronavirus getestet wurde, soll das Handy den Besitzer eigentlich aktiv mit einer Benachrichtigung auf das erhöhte Risiko hinweisen. "Das Problem, das wir haben, ist, dass die Hintergrundaktualisierung vom Betriebssystem offenbar nicht aufgerufen wird", so Klingbeil.</p><!-- mediaCon-->
<p> Zuvor hatte die "Bild"-Zeitung bereits über ähnliche Probleme bei einigen Android-Geräten berichtet. Dort war die Hintergrundaktualisierung im Stromsparmodus nicht oder nur eingeschränkt möglich. "Das gilt nicht nur für die Corona-Warn-App, sondern für alle Apps auf diesen Smartphones", hieß es dazu aus dem Bundesgesundheitsministerium. Laut Entwickler ist das keine Fehlfunktion in der App, sondern hängt mit den Einstellungen bei den Geräten zusammen. Dies könne von den Nutzern geändert werden.</p>
<p> Das Gesundheitsministerium versicherte, dass die Anwendung "zu jeder Zeit" funktioniert habe. Wer seine Einstellung nicht anpasste, wurde erst beim Öffnen der App vor einem möglichen gefährlichen Kontakt mit einem Corona-Infizierten gewarnt. "Mit der Version 1.1.1, die am Mittwoch erschienen ist, können die Nutzerinnen und Nutzern, diese fehlerhaften Optimierungsfunktionen des Betriebssystems übersteuern", erklärte Jürgen Müller aus dem SAP-Vorstand <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/corona-warn-app-und-sie-funktioniert-doch-juergen-mueller">in einem Blogeintrag</a>.</p>
<h2>Problem bei iPhones noch nicht behoben</h2>
<p> Anders als bei den Android-Geräten ist bei den iPhones das Problem noch nicht behoben. Einige Nutzer berichten gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>, dass an mehr als zehn aufeinanderfolgenden Tagen kein Abgleich erfolgte. Das heißt, sie wären im Extremfall erst zehn Tage später gewarnt worden, dass sie Kontakt mit Infizierten gehabt hatten.</p>
<p> Normalerweise werden die Daten in der App alle 24 Stunden aktualisiert. Wann genau steht unter dem Punkt "Risikoermittlung" beziehungsweise in den Einstellungen des Smartphones. Pro Tag sollen bis zu 14 Datensätze abgerufen werden - einen für jeden der zurückliegenden 14 Tage. "Wenn die App in den letzten zwei Wochen dauerhaft aktiv war, sollten Sie in der Regel 13 oder 14 Überprüfungen in den letzten 24 Stunden sehen", erklären die Entwickler. Die Zahl der abgerufenen Datensätze sagt nichts darüber aus, ob oder wieviele Kontakte die App mit anderen Corona-Warn-Apps ermittelt hat.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Fehler liegt im Betriebssystem von Apple</h2>
<p> Die Entwickler haben Apple über die Lücken bei der Kontaktüberprüfung informiert, der iPhone-Hersteller habe den Fehler mittlerweile eingeräumt. Nach bisherigen Erkenntnissen befindet sich im Betriebssystem iOS ein Bug. Dort ist ein sogenannter Scheduler einprogrammiert, der dafür sorgt, dass die Corona-Warn-App im Hintergrund die Daten einmal täglich vom Server holt.</p>
<p> "Wir sind vollkommen auf ein regelmäßiges Funktionieren des Schedulers angewiesen", erklärt Peter Lorenz, Chefentwickler der Deutschen Telekom, gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>. "Dieser Scheduler hat hin und wieder einen Schluckauf." Dadurch unterbleibe der Impuls, die Daten vom Server abzurufen.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Ministerium räumt Fehler ein</h2>
<p> Das Problem haben die Entwickler nach eigenen Aussagen "vor einer Woche" bemerkt. Auch in der Schweiz, Österreich und Italien hätten die Programmierer der dortigen Corona-Apps entsprechende Probleme festgestellt. "Uns war nicht bekannt, in welcher Breite das Problem auftritt", so Lorenz.</p>
<p> Das Ausmaß sei erst an diesem Freitag erkannt worden, als sich die Entwickler nach den Berichten über die Android-Fehler auch das Apple-Betriebssystem genauer angeschaut hätten. "Die Entwickler arbeiten mit Hochdruck an einem Weg, die systembedingten Einschränkungen zu umgehen, bis Apple das Systemproblem selbst gelöst hat", erklärte das Gesundheitsministerium auf Anfrage. SAP-Sprecher Hilmar Schepp zeigte sich zuversichtlich, "bis Anfang der kommenden Woche" eine vorübergehende Lösung zu haben, den Bug zu umgehen.</p>
<h2>Codes werden weiterhin ausgetauscht</h2>
<p> Sowohl bei den Android- als auch bei den Apple-Smartphones würden jedoch auch ohne die Hintergrundaktualisierung anonyme Codes mit anderen Smartphones ausgetauscht, versichern die Entwickler. Allerdings wird ein Nutzer bei fehlender Hintergrundaktualisierung nur dann über ein Ansteckungsrisiko informiert, wenn er die App öffnet.</p>
<p> Wie viele Geräte von den Problemen betroffen sind, ist nicht bekannt. Insgesamt wurde die App in Deutschland bereits 16,2 Millionen Mal heruntergeladen. Noch am Nachmittag hatte das Gesundheitsministerium erklärt, das Problem mit der aussetzenden Hintergrundaktualisierung sei bei iPhones nicht aufgetreten. "Im Moment können wir sagen, dass es nicht alle Androidgeräte betroffen hat, sondern nur bestimmte", sagte eine Sprecherin.</p><div>
<div>
<!-- mediaCon-->
<h4>So können Sie die Kontaktüberprüfung abrufen</h4>
<div><p>In den Einstellungen Ihres Smartphones können Sie sehen, ob die Kontaktüberprüfung der Corona-Warn-App reibungslos funktioniert oder Lücken aufweist. Dazu sind folgende Schritte nötig:</p><p><strong>iPhone:</strong> <br>Einstellungen -&gt; Datenschutz -&gt; Health -&gt; COVID-19-Kontaktprotokoll -&gt; Kontaktüberprüfungen </p><p><strong>Android-Geräte: </strong><br>Einstellungen -&gt; Google -&gt; COVID-19-Benachrichtigungen an</p></div>

</div><!-- teaser -->
</div>

<h2>App soll Infektionsketten unterbrechen</h2>
<p> Die Corona-Warn-App wurde <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/corona-warn-app-startet-101.html">am 16. Juni veröffentlicht</a> und ist in den Stores <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.rki.coronawarnapp">von Google</a> und <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/corona-warn-app/id1512595757">Apple</a> erhältlich. Sie soll helfen, Infektionsketten nachzuverfolgen und zu unterbrechen. Außerdem kann sie dazu beitragen, dass Menschen nach einem Coronavirus-Test möglichst schnell ihr Testergebnis digital erhalten und über die App anonym mögliche Kontaktpersonen warnen können, wenn diese auch die App installiert haben.</p>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth.

You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

<p><em>Work-in-progress LVGL GUI Framework ported to Wayland EGL on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch</em></p>
<p><strong>We ❤️ &nbsp; Old Underwear...</strong></p>
<p>They feel comfy, they fit our contours. Nevermind the holes and the old stains 🤢</p>
<p><strong>X11 is like Old Underwear.</strong> It's been around for 30 years... Yet we still use it in spite of its feature gaps and wonky quirks.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/PinePhone"><strong>PinePhone on Ubuntu Touch feels like... New Underwear.</strong></a></p>
<p>It runs Linux but it has none of the legacy X11 code. Because it's optimised for a great mobile experience with <strong>Wayland.</strong></p>
<p>But New Underwear feels uncomfortable. So today we'll learn Wayland and understand how apps are built with Wayland.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday we'll move on to newer, simpler app frameworks (like <a href="https://lvgl.io/">LVGL</a> and Flutter) as we discard our Old Underwear: X11, SDL, GTK, Qt, ...</p>
<p>The source code for this article may be found here...</p>
<ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/lvgl-wayland"><code>github.com/lupyuen/lvgl-wayland</code></a></p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir"><code>github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir</code></a></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> is the Graphical Display Service that runs on most Linux desktops and notebooks.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the X11 Service on Pinebook Pro...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-pinebook.png" alt="X11 Service on Pinebook Pro"></p>
<p>That's the X11 Service... A <strong>2.2 MB</strong> executable named <strong><code>Xorg</code></strong>. </p>
<p>The X11 Service controls the rendering of Linux apps (as well as the keyboard and mouse input) like this...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-x11.png" alt="X11 Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the Linux programs running on our Linux machine: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Each program renders its graphical display and transmits the raw graphics to the X11 Service (via a local TCP socket).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X11 Service forwards the rendered graphics to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"><strong>Window Manager / Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor is provided by the <strong>Desktop Environment</strong>: Xfce, KDE, Gnome, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor wraps the rendered graphics into Display Windows and <strong>"decorates"</strong> them with scrollbars, title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor then draws the Display Windows into a <strong>Screen Buffer</strong> according to their screen coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Screen Buffer is rendered to our screen by the X11 Service, talking to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>keyboard and mouse input</strong> is captured by the X11 Service, and forwarded to the programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Why is X11 so complex? So many hops?</em></p>
<p>Because X11 was designed for Distributed Computing Systems.</p>
<p>Here's how I used (abused?) X11R4 at <a href="http://srg.cs.illinois.edu/">UIUC Systems Research Group</a> way back in 1990 (30 years ago!)...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-uiuc.png" alt="Distributed X11 System"></p>
<p>Thankfully things are a lot simpler now, lemme explain...</p>

<p><em>Do we need overlapping or tiled windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we need to need to decorate PinePhone windows with a title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we even need any windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p>No! Because each PinePhone app takes control of the entire screen!</p>
<p>PinePhone uses a simpler Graphical Display Service: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)#Wayland_compositors"><strong>Wayland Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the Wayland Compositor on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-compositor.png" alt="Wayland Compositor on PinePhone"></p>
<p>That's the Wayland Compositor... A <strong>262 KB</strong> executable named <code>unity-system-compositor</code>. </p>
<p><em>Compare that with the 2.2 MB X11 Server on Pinebook Pro!</em></p>
<p>Here's how the Wayland Compositor controls apps and touchscreen input on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-arch.png" alt="Wayland Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)">"EGL API"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the apps running on our phone: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Since each app runs fullscreen, only the active app will be rendered.</p>
<p>When then app starts, it queries the <strong>Wayland Compositor</strong> for the graphical display interfaces available. (They talk via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Socket">Linux socket file</a>: <code>/run/user/32011/wayland-0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayland Compositor returns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)"><strong>EGL Interface</strong></a> to the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App calls the EGL Interface to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL"><strong>render OpenGL graphics</strong></a> directly to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux Display Driver forwards the OpenGL rendering commands to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"><strong>GPU to update the screen</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>touchscreen input</strong> is captured by the Wayland Compositor, and forwarded to the active app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wayland looks so much simpler and faster than X11!</p>
<p><em>Wayland is designed for OpenGL and GPUs?</em></p>
<p>Yes! And I lied about Wayland being New Underwear... Wayland is not really that New!</p>
<p>Wayland was first released in 2008 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">11 years ago</a>)... Yet it was designed around OpenGL and GPUs, the same tech that powers our beautiful games today. (<a href="https://youtu.be/DNBk9hnPkTY">And websites too</a>)</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to render our own OpenGL graphics with Wayland and Ubuntu Touch on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-egl.jpg" alt="Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone"></p>
<p><em>Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone</em></p>

<p>Here's the function that calls OpenGL to render the yellow box above: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L44-L60"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Render the OpenGL ES2 display
static void render_display() {
    //  Fill the rectangular region with yellow
    glClearColor(
        1.0,  //  Red
        1.0,  //  Green
        0.0,  //  Blue
        1.0   //  Alpha
    );
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // Render now
    glFlush();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>render_display()</code> looks exactly like normal OpenGL, and it works on PinePhone with Wayland! (Thanks to Ubuntu Touch)</p>
<p>Two things to note...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PinePhone supports a popular subset of OpenGL, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES"><strong>OpenGL for Embedded Systems</strong></a> Version 2.0.</p>
<p>OpenGL ES is optimised for Embedded Devices. It's used by many mobile and console games today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To render OpenGL ES graphics, we need to get the <strong>OpenGL ES Context</strong> and <strong>Window Surface</strong> from Wayland</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before calling <code>render_display()</code>, we fetch the OpenGL Window Surface from Wayland like so: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L167-L189"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Dimensions of the OpenGL region to be rendered
static int WIDTH  = 480;
static int HEIGHT = 360;

static struct wl_egl_window *egl_window;  //  Wayland EGL Window
static EGLSurface egl_surface;            //  EGL Surface

//  Create the EGL Window and render OpenGL graphics
static void create_window(void) {
    //  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
    egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    assert(egl_window != EGL_NO_SURFACE);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window

    //  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
    egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
        egl_window, NULL);
    assert(egl_surface != NULL);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window Surface

    //  Set the current rendering surface
    EGLBoolean madeCurrent = eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
        egl_surface, egl_context);
    assert(madeCurrent);  //  Failed to set rendering surface

    //  Render the display
    render_display();

    //  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
    EGLBoolean swappedBuffers = eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
    assert(swappedBuffers);  //  Failed to swap display buffers
}
</code></pre>
<p>Functions named <code>wl_egl_...</code> are provided by the Wayland EGL Interface.  Functions named <code>egl...</code> come from the cross-platform <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/egl.html#:%7E:text=The%20main%20library%20(%20libEGL%20)%20is,directly%20dispatched%20to%20the%20drivers.">Mesa 3D Graphics Library</a>.</p>
<p><em>EGL vs OpenGL... What's the difference?</em></p>
<p>In Wayland, EGL is the Enabler for OpenGL. </p>
<p>Wayland only understands EGL and it will gladly hand us EGL objects... But it's up to us to transform EGL into OpenGL for rendering.</p>
<p>Thus in the code above, we take a Wayland Surface <code>surface</code> and transform it into an EGL Window <code>egl_window</code>...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create an OpenGL Window Surface <code>egl_surface</code> from that EGL Window...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
    egl_window, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>And we begin the OpenGL rendering...</p>
<pre><code>//  Set the current rendering surface
eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
    egl_surface, egl_context);

//  Render the display
render_display();

//  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how we create a Wayland Region for OpenGL rendering: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L103-L112"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>static struct wl_region *region;  //  Wayland Region

//  Create the Wayland Region for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void create_opaque_region(void) {
    //  Create a Wayland Region
    region = wl_compositor_create_region(compositor);
    assert(region != NULL);  //  Failed to create EGL Region

    //  Set the dimensions of the Wayland Region
    wl_region_add(region, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);

    //  Add the Region to the Wayland Surface
    wl_surface_set_opaque_region(surface, region);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about EGL, check out <a href="https://jan.newmarch.name/Wayland/EGL/">"Programming Wayland Clients"</a></p>
<p>The Wayland EGL code in this article was adapted from that document.</p>

<p>Earlier in <code>create_window()</code> we called an <strong>EGL Context</strong> <code>egl_context</code> to render OpenGL graphics.</p>
<p>Here's how we get the EGL Context: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L113-L165"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Wayland EGL Interfaces for OpenGL Rendering
static EGLDisplay egl_display;  //  EGL Display
static EGLConfig  egl_conf;     //  EGL Configuration
static EGLContext egl_context;  //  EGL Context

//  Create the EGL Context for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void init_egl(void) {
    //  Attributes for our EGL Display
    EGLint config_attribs[] = {
        EGL_SURFACE_TYPE,    EGL_WINDOW_BIT,
        EGL_RED_SIZE,        8,
        EGL_GREEN_SIZE,      8,
        EGL_BLUE_SIZE,       8,
        EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE, EGL_OPENGL_ES2_BIT,
        EGL_NONE
    };
    static const EGLint context_attribs[] = {
        EGL_CONTEXT_CLIENT_VERSION, 2,
        EGL_NONE
    };

    //  Get the EGL Display
    egl_display = eglGetDisplay((EGLNativeDisplayType) display);

        <h3>
About</h3>

<p>
Mathematical Components is the name of a library of formalized mathematics for
the Coq system. It covers a variety of topics, from the theory of basic data
structures (e.g., numbers, lists, finite sets) to advanced results in various
flavors of algebra. This library constitutes the infrastructure for the machine
checked proofs of the Four Color Theorem and of the Odd Order Theorem.
</p>
<p>
The reason of existence of this book is to break down the barriers to entry.
While there are several books around covering the usage of the Coq system and
the theory it is based on, the Mathematical Components library is built in an
unconventional way. As a consequence this book provides a non standard
presentation of Coq, putting upfront the formalization choices and the proof
style that are the pillars of the library.
</p>
<p>
This books targets two classes of public. On one hand newcomers, even the more
mathematical inclined ones, find a soft introduction to the programming
language of Coq, <em>Gallina</em>, and the <em>Ssreflect</em> proof language.
On the other hand accustomed Coq users find a substantial account of the
formalization style that made the Mathematical Components library possible.

<p>
	*** The Urban Archeology Program uncovered basalt slab floors corresponding to an open plaza in the Old Houses of Axayácatl, <em>tlatoani</em> of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	*** INAH’s archaeological salvage project also detected the remains of the conqueror's dwelling, which later became the headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca.</p>

 

<p>
	Within the walls of the Old Houses of Axayácatl some of the most decisive episodes of the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlán occurred, such as the death of the <em>tlatoani</em> Moctezuma Xocoyotzin, possibly on June 29, 1520; unexpected outcomes that undermined the relationship between Mexicans and Spaniards and triggered the open confrontation.</p>

<p>
	The most recent discovery made by specialists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), of vestiges of that pre-Hispanic palace, and of the remains of a later house built under the orders of Hernán Cortés, with reused materials from the previous Tenochca building, revives the memory of those historical events, five centuries later.</p>

<p>
	Thanks to historical sources, it is no mystery for archaeologists that under the floors of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, one of the most emblematic buildings of Mexico City’s Historic Center, located next to the Metropolitan Cathedral, are the foundations of the Palace of Axayácatl, which functioned as the living quarters of Cortés' entourage upon their arrival in the heart of Tenochtitlan.</p>

<p>
	Over the last two decades, and taking advantage of diverse remodeling projects undertaken in the headquarters of that institution, various INAH experts have found remnants of the former residence of Moctezuma II's father. The most recent discoveries were brought to light during archaeological interventions led by Raúl Barrera Rodríguez and José María García Guerrero, head and collaborator, respectively, of the Urban Archeology Program (PAU).</p>

<p>
	Following an inspection for refurbishments conducted in the northern half of the historic building, PAU personnel carried out an archaeological salvage project between the first days of September 2017 and mid-August 2018, focusing on the main courtyard and an adjacent room. It is noteworthy that the project continues to the present in the post-dig research phase.</p>

<p>
	Excavations resulted in the discovery of numerous basalt slab floors, which must have formed part of an open plaza in the Palace of Axayácatl, the ruler who controlled the destiny of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	Also, from the early Viceregal period (1521-1620 AD), the remains of a house built by order of Cortés were uncovered. That construction, where the Spanish conqueror resided for several years, would also become the seat of the first Cabildo of New Spain (around 1525) and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, granted to the conqueror four years later.</p>

<p>
	<strong>The archaeological investigation</strong></p>

<p>
	As an exciting part of the public outreach program "Contigo en la Distancia” (“With you from a Distance”), from the Ministry of Culture, the head of the PAU, Raúl Barrera, and his collaborator José María García, explain that they dug 12 test pits - 2 meters per side and 1.50 m deep— around the main courtyard of the National Monte de Piedad, where remodeling work was being carried out to reinforce the columns that define the structure and support the first level of the building.</p>

<p>
	By excavating a series of test pits, on the north, east and west sides, the remains of a stone masonry wall - 1.50 meters high by 1.25 m wide - were uncovered. This wall served as a foundation and basal platform for a series of columns of the building erected around 1755, which allows us to deduce that the central courtyard was originally larger. Also, in the west section of this same space were found the subflooring: basal portions and a shaft of other columns from the early Viceregal period.</p>

<p>
	However, major surprises awaited in the adjacent room. PAU archaeologists had the opportunity to conduct an extensive excavation, which allowed them to locate the remains of a room made of basalt and <em>tezontle </em>(vesicular lava) dressed stones - 5 by 4 meters -, whose base sat upon a floor of basalt slabs. Further analyses led to the conclusion that this was the home of Hernán Cortés, once Mexico-Tenochtitlan fell in 1521.</p>

<p>
	Below the subflooring of the house of Cortés, more than 3 meters deep, the remains of another floor of basalt slabs, but from pre-Hispanic times, were detected. Given its characteristics, the specialists deduced that it was part of an open space in the former Palace of Axayácatl, probably a courtyard.</p>

<p>
	Barrera and García emphasize that the vestiges of the nascent Viceregal era correspond to reused materials from the Old Houses of Axayácatl. These premises, like so many other structures of the Sacred Precinct of Tenochtitlan, were destroyed by the Spanish and their indigenous allies, almost to their foundations.</p>

<p>
	As an example of this, embedded in the façade of the southeast interior corner of the colonial room, two pre-Hispanic dressed stones carved with sculptures in high relief were found. They depicted a feathered serpent (Quetzalcóatl) and a headdress of feathers, and must have belonged to a panel of the Palace of Axayácatl. Also, another Mexica sculpture with the glyph that symbolizes the <em>tianquiztli</em> or market was recovered, in its place as part of a shaft.</p>

<p>
	Some of the diagnostic materials, which allow the preliminary dating of these findings, are the remains of pre-Hispanic and colonial pottery, whose types (styles) belong to the aforementioned historical periods: Aztec III: Orange Monochrome, Black-on-Orange and Texcoco Burnished Earthenware; as well as glazed earthenware and Spanish and New Spain majolica.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Old Houses of Axayácatl</strong></p>

<p>
	Raúl Barrera, also a researcher at the INAH Directorate of Salvage Archaeology, reflects on the fact that some material evidence speaks volumes, by its very paucity. Such is the case for the recent discoveries in the National Monte de Piedad, which “speak” of the destruction that the main buildings of Tenochtitlan were subjected to, both for symbolic and practical purposes.</p>

<p>
	Despite the modest nature of the remains, those pre-Hispanic floors were the same ones that the Spanish invaders and their allies tread upon during their arrival to Tenochtitlan, on November 8, 1519. Moctezuma II allowed them to stay in the old houses that had belonged to his father, and soon after they turned them into their barracks.</p>

<p>
	While in that palace, numerous events took place. For example, they remodeled a room to celebrate mass, and right there, they also held various rulers captive, starting with their distinguished host: Moctezuma Xocoyotzin; as well as Cuitláhuac, lord of Iztapalapa; Cacamatzin,<em> tlatoani</em> of Texcoco; and Itzcuauhtzin, lord of Tlatelolco, among others.</p>

<p>
	Following on the massacre during the festival of Tóxcatl that took place at the Templo Mayor (“Great Temple”) on May 22 of 1520, by the order of Pedro de Alvarado, the Spanish withdrew and returned to the Palace of Axayácatl. That incident unleashed the anger of the Mexica and, at the end of June of that year, they besieged the invaders in that building. Hernán Cortés wanted to contain their fury through Moctezuma, who tried to placate them from the roof of the palace. But the efforts were in vain, as his brother Cuitláhuac had already been ordained the new ruler.</p>

<p>
	On the night of June 30, 1520, the Spanish fled to Tlaxcala by the great causeway of Tlacopan (today Tacuba), leaving behind the Old Houses of Axayácatl.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Cortés’ houses</strong></p>

<p>
	After the fall of Tenochtitlan, the surviving Mexicas were forced to destroy, with their own hands, their temples and palaces and build the new city using the same materials. The Old Houses of Axayácatl would gave way to the Houses of Hernán de Cortés, which were also the temporary headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain, around 1525, and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, a noble title carrying the responsibility for creating a government, granted in 1529 for his services to the Spanish Crown.</p>

<p>
	Upon the conqueror's death in 1547, his descendants retained ownership. His son Martín Cortés Zúñiga inherited the marquessate, but in 1566 he was involved in a conspiracy that sought to seize the government of New Spain, so he was expelled from the Viceroyalty. The houses and the extensive land remained in the hands of a legal representative and, already in poor condition, were sold to the Sacro Monte de Piedad in 1836.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      

<div>
  
    
      <div><p>In version 3.4, python shipped with a new module in the standard library,  <code>pathlib</code> . At the time of its release, I remember hearing some fanfare around it, but I didn’t quite understand the point of it. I had only recently stopped adding strings together to create paths to the files and folders I needed to work with, in favor of using the  <code>os</code>  and  <code>os.path</code>  modules. It took me a little while to experiment with it and plumb the documentation for useful&nbsp;bits.</p><p>Since then, I’ve learned a lot about the  <code>pathlib</code>  module, and as I have said before, <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/pathlib-my-new-favorite-module/">it is my favorite module in the standard library</a>.</p><p>While that’s the case, most people I talk to about it are working to hard to access files and folders with python. Many have either not heard about it, or they still don’t understand&nbsp;it.</p><p>They still write code like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p><span>OK</span>, so there’s nothing wrong with that code per se, but most pythonistas would agree that your code should be readable. I would argue that  <code>pathlib</code>  could make that line of code more readable<label for="readable"></label><span>One could argue that it’s not necessarily more readable, if you’re not as familiar with it. So maybe I should settle for it being shorter?</span>&nbsp;:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>I don’t know what your favorite module is in the standard library<label for="std"></label><span>Though, I would like to know what it is and why!</span> , but I imagine that most people don’t really think about&nbsp;it.</p><p>The reason why  <code>pathlib</code>  is my favorite module is that I have found it to be so very useful. And I really believe it can save you pain and effort in the months and years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>That’s why I created two resources for&nbsp;you.</p><p>The first is what I’m calling a “field guide” to  <code>pathlib</code> . It’s a standalone document, a little longer than one of my blog posts, that will introduce you to the module and some of its features I use the&nbsp;most.</p><p>I have also created a cheat sheet for the module, since there are over 40 useful properties and methods on a  <code>Path</code>  object, and I find that I could use a quick-reference guide to remind me of the ones I don’t use as&nbsp;often.</p><p>Look, I suggest the next time you are going to work with a file or folder, give  <code>pathlib</code>  a&nbsp;try.</p><p>It combines parts of the  <code>os</code> ,  <code>os.path</code> , and  <code>glob</code>  modules (and maybe more) in one useful&nbsp;package.</p></div>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="strings-arent-good-enough">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#strings-arent-good-enough">Strings aren’t good enough</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>One of the things I love about  <code>pathlib</code>  is that you are now working with an object instead of a&nbsp;string.</p><p>Strings are not the best way to work with data. You can’t ask a string what the name of the file is. Instead, you’ll have to come up with method to break the string apart and harvest that&nbsp;information.</p><p>One way to do that would be to use the  <code>basename</code>  method in the  <code>os.path</code>  module and split the&nbsp;result:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = '/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html'
file_name = os.path.basename(location).split('.')[0]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>That works, but it’s not the most readable. You have to do some mental gymnastics to unpack the four different things that happen in that one line of code. It could be challenging for people who are new to&nbsp;python.</p><p>Instead, you could use a  <code>Path</code>  object:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = Path('/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html')
file_name = location.stem</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Now, this is what I’m talking about! There’s no mental gymnastics to figure out how to split strings. There’s no having to remember what individual  <code>os.path</code>  methods do. It’s just simply asking an object what one of its properties&nbsp;are.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="express-yourself">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#express-yourself">Express yourself</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>Since it frees me from directly manipulating strings, I find that  <code>pathlib</code>  allows me to be more expressive with the way I write code that interacts with files and&nbsp;folders.</p><p>I write less code, and my mind feels more able to think about the problem at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>For instance, you can easily reference all of the  <code>json</code>  files in the current&nbsp;folder:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>You can even safely open a file, load its contents, and close it in one&nbsp;line:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')
for f in json_files:
    data = json.loads(f.read_text())</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>Even manipulating paths are easier with&nbsp;pathlib.</p><p>I see many people joining paths by adding strings together, like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># not the best way to manipulate a path
root_folder = 'path/to/content/folder'
config_file = root_folder + 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this can work, it’s not the best way to manipulate paths, as this way will break if you ever run your code on a different operating system, as Windows uses back-slashes to denote paths. All other platforms use&nbsp;slashes.</p><p>Also, it’s easy to introduce bugs like I did in that code. I didn’t include a trailing slash in the  <code>root_folder</code>  variable. So the resulting path would look like this, and would probably&nbsp;fail:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># result of previous code
'path/to/content/folderconfig/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>The next best way to join paths is to use the  <code>os.path.joinpath</code>  method. This will handle the “bug” I introduced&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = os.path.join(root_folder, 'config/config.json')
print(config_file)
'path/to/content/folder/config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this is better, it still doesn’t address the cross-platform&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Thankfully,  <code>pathlib</code>  not only makes it even easier to join paths, but it also allow you to write code that works on every operating&nbsp;system.</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">root_folder = Path('path/to/content/folder')
config_file = root_folder.joinpath('config/config.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Additionally,  <code>pathlib</code>  gives you the option to write less code when joining paths. This is equivalent to the line&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = root_folder / 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <h2 id="its-your-turn">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#its-your-turn">It’s your turn</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>Look, you seriously should give  <code>pathlib</code>  a&nbsp;try.</p><p><a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/resources/">Download my field guide</a>. Use it to get a basic understanding of how to use the  <code>Path</code>  object. Practice accessing files with it. Then, come back and download my cheat sheet, so you can better remember what attributes are at your disposal and be reminded of the ones you haven’t tried&nbsp;yet.</p><p>I’m confident you’ll enjoy working with files and folders more than you do&nbsp;now.</p><p>And also, let me know how you would improve these&nbsp;resources.</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you!</p></div>

There's this rather nifty feature of modern web browsers (such as
<b>Firefox</b> or <b>Chrome</b>) where the browser will automatically warn the
user if they happen to navigate to a "<i>malicious</i>" URL:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/malicious-site.png" alt="malicious-site.png">
</p> 


<p>
While <i>conceptually</i> simple, this feature actually requires more
engineering effort than one would expect - in particular, tracking the
set of known malicious URLs in a practical manner turns out to be
somewhat difficult.
</p>

<p>
This is because, on one hand, trying to store the database of <i>all</i>
known malicious URLs, which, bear in mind, may contain <i>millions and
millions</i> of entries, is something that is just practically
infeasible for most users. </p><p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/database_local.png" alt="database_local.png"> </p>


<p>
Conversely, sending <i>every</i> URL that a user visits to some external
service, where it could be <i>logged</i> and <i>data-mined</i> by nefarious
third parties, is something that most users should
probably not be comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, browsers actually implement this functionality by
means of a rather interesting <i>compromise</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Using a probabilistic data structure known as a <b>Bloom filter</b>,
Browsers maintain a approximate representation of the set of known
malicious URLs locally.  By querying this <i>space-efficient</i> local set,
browsers will only send up a <i>small proportion</i> of the honest URLs.
</p>

<p><b><i>Use a Bloom filter to act as a local proxy for queries to an external database</i>.</b>
</p>


<p>
This proxy technique, which safe-guards the privacy of millions of
users ever day, depends on <b>two key properties</b> of Bloom filters:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>No false negatives</dt><dd>This states that if a query for an URL in the
Bloom filter returns negative, then the queried item can be
guaranteed to not be present in the set of malicious URLs - i.e
<i>the Bloom filter is guaranteed to return a positive result for
all known malicious URLs</i>.</dd>

<dt>Low false positive rate</dt><dd>This property states that for any URL
that is <i>not in the set of malicious</i> URLs, the likelihood of a
Bloom filter query returning a positive result should be <i>fairly
low</i> - thus minimising the number of <i>unnecessary</i> infractions on
user privacy.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
This mechanism works <i>quite</i> well, and the guarantees of a Bloom filter
seem to be perfectly suited for this particular task, however it has
one small problem, and that is:
</p>

<p><b><i>The</i> widely cited expression <i>for the</i> false positive rate <i>of a bloom filter is</i> wrong!</b>
</p>


<p>
In fact, as it turns out, the behaviours of a Bloom filter have
actually been the subject of 30 years of mathematical contention,
requiring <i>multiple</i> corrections and even <i>corrections of these
corrections</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Given this history of errors, can we really have any certainty in our
understanding of a Bloom filter at all?</b>
</p>

<p>
Well, <i>never fear</i>, I am writing this post to inform you that we have
just recently used <code>Coq</code> to produce the <i>very first</i> <b>certified</b> proof
of the false positive rate of a Bloom filter, finally putting an end to
this saga of errors and returning certainty (pardon the pun<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>) to a
mechanism that countless people rely on <i>every single</i> day.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this post, we'll explore the main highlights of this
research, answering the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a Bloom filter?</li>
<li>Why did these errors initially arise?</li>
<li>What is the true behaviour of a Bloom filter? and how can we be certain?</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>If your an engineer you probably spend a lot of time using a terminal.
Some of your best productivity gains will come from understanding it better and making small improvements to repetitive tasks.</p><p>Many people know the basics for default shell shortcuts like Ctrl+a and Ctrl+e to go to the begining and end of a line.
There are also a few keyboard shortcuts you’ve probably found by accident like Ctrl+s, Ctrl+z, or Ctrl+c.</p><p>Here are some keyboard shortcuts I use regularly that you might find helpful too.
I’m focusing on zsh because that’s my preferred interactive shell but many of these shortcuts will work in bash or other shells too.</p><p>If you want more shell tips, check out my mastering zsh workshop <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh">https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh</a>.</p><p>We’ll start with some basic keyboard shortcuts and get progressivly more advanced.
Many of these shortcuts are default behavior but some will need code added to your configuration to enable them.</p><h3 id="basics">Basics</h3><p>I’m amazed how long it took me to learn these keybord shortcuts and see that people still don’t know them.</p><p><code>Ctrl+r</code>: Reverse search through your command history.
Kinda like pushing the up arrow with search.</p><p><code>Ctrl+c</code>: kill/interupt the current running process.
If you don’t want it to print <code>^C</code> every time you press it you can add <code>set echo-control-characters Off</code> to your <code>~/.inputrc</code> file.</p><p><code>Ctrl+d</code>: Close your current terminal.
Same as typing <code>exit</code> but way shorter.</p><p><code>Ctrl+l</code>: clear the screen.
Similar, but slightly different, to typing <code>clear</code>.</p><p><code>Ctrl+z</code>: Suspend process.
This is really helpful if you’re in your editor and you need to run a command real quick.
Instead of opening a new terminal press <code>ctrl+z</code>, run your command, and then type <code>fg</code> to bring the command back to the foreground.</p><h3 id="delete-word-behind-your-cursor">Delete word behind your cursor</h3><p>If you have a command typed out or selected from your history with Ctrl+r you probably want to change one or two words from it.</p><p>First you can move your cursor back a word with <code>Alt+b</code>.
Press it multiple times to keep moving back.</p><p>Once your cursor is at the end of the word you need to change/delete press <code>Ctrl+w</code> to delete it.
If it doesn’t delete up to the characters you expect try setting your <code>$WORDCHARS</code> variable to characters that should be considered part of the word.</p><h3 id="don-t-repeat-your-whole-arguments">Don’t repeat your whole arguments</h3><p>If you need to move a file to something like a $FILE.bak you can do that easily with <code>{,}</code>.</p><p>Don’t do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt.bak
</code></pre><p>Do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt{,.bak}
</code></pre><p>It works anywhere in the command too!
This will copy name.txt into new-folder (assuming it exists).</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/{my-long-file,new-folder}/name.txt
</code></pre><h3 id="enter-last-argument-from-previous-command-s">Enter last argument from previous command(s)</h3><p>There is a default shell variable <code>$?</code> which represents the last argument from the preceeding command (e.g. <code>echo $?</code>)
<code>Ctrl+.</code> is the keyboard shortcut to do the same thing.
Not only is it easier to type but you can push it multiple times to cycle through the last argument from previous commands.</p><h3 id="prepend-sudo">Prepend sudo</h3><p>I need this a lot.
You type out a command or find it from your history and need to run it with sudo but forgot it at the begining of the line.
Normally you would <code>Ctrl+a</code> type <code>sudo</code> then <code>Ctrl+e</code>.
This shortcuts does all that with a single shortcut.</p><p>Add this code snippet to your .zshrc
I prefer <code>esc, s</code> for the keyboard shortcut because it works well in vim mode and doesn’t clobber the default <code>Ctrl+s</code> shortcut.</p><pre><code># add sudo before command with esc, s
function prepend-sudo() {
  [[ -z $BUFFER ]] &amp;&amp; zle up-history
  if [[ $BUFFER == sudo\ * ]]; then
    LBUFFER="${LBUFFER#sudo }"
  else
    LBUFFER="sudo $LBUFFER"
  fi
}
zle -N prepend-sudo
# shortcut keys: [Esc] [s]
bindkey "\es" prepend-sudo
</code></pre><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/prepend-sudo.gif" alt=""></p><p>If you’re using oh-my-zsh you can add the <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/sudo/sudo.plugin.zsh#L32">sudo plugin</a> and the default key binding is <code>esc, esc</code>.</p><h3 id="open-command-in-editor">Open command in $EDITOR</h3><p>There is a really handy command <code>fc</code> which will open your last command in your $EDITOR.
It’s great for long or multi-line command edits.</p><p>There are lots of other ways to accomplish editing the last command you can check out <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/blob/master/docs/config/history.md#modifying-the-last-command">here</a>.</p><p>To edit your current command in your editor add this snippet to your .zshrc</p><pre><code>autoload -U edit-command-line
zle -N edit-command-line
# shortcut key: [Esc] [v]
bindkey "\ev" edit-command-line
</code></pre><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/fc-example.gif" alt=""></p><p>Now next time you copy/paste a multi-line command from somewhere it’ll be easy to edit.</p><h3 id="cut-current-line-and-then-paste-it-on-your-next-prompt">Cut current line and then paste it on your next prompt</h3><p>If you need to run a command before the command you currently have typed you can cut/yank it and then paste/pop it at your next prompt with yank-pop.
This gif explains it better.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/push-input.gif" alt=""></p><p>In zsh this is called <code>push-line-or-edit</code> and it’s a default widget you can enable with.</p><pre><code>bindkey '^q' push-line-or-edit
</code></pre><p>A bonus feature is your cursor line will be in the same place after the command is pasted to the new prompt.</p></article></div>]]>

In the previous article, we shared advice on how to lead your project to fail, today we will talk about how to ruin a relationship with a customer.</p><p id="cfd7">Most of the IT projects imply constant cooperation between the team members and customers. Although it might be often overlooked, the role and the importance of the client within the project is very crucial. Thus, it is in your interest to build a strong relationship based on trust. However, gaining trust on a single occasion is not a dealmaker — you have to maintain and reinforce it by every action.</p><p id="931c">As a project manager at <a href="https://maddevs.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=ruin-relationship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mad Devs</a>, I have worked with quite many clients and gained first-hand experience and knowledge on how to elevate trustful partnerships. Here are my <strong>5 wake-up calls, </strong>which indicate that you are on the verge of losing credibility and setting doubts on your expertise to clients.</p><ol><li id="5fc9"><strong>Lacking transparency</strong></li></ol><p id="c403">We often talk about the great importance of transparency for businesses in a modern-day world. Even though companies implement the latest software to achieve the required level of transparency in the documentation and on organizational levels, there are still easy to eliminate yet often overlooked aspects such as transparent communication.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Lacking transparency." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3" width="1000" height="643" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="426d">Nowadays, the ability to collaborate with people from around the globe is more feasible than ever before. As globalization brings us closer to each other, we have to remember that everybody comes from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Such cases are commonly found in slack group channels when someone starts speaking in the language that not every member of the group understands as a native speaker. Yes, maybe the majority do understand it, but the person who did not is going to feel left out and neglected.</p><p id="c8bd">I would suggest implementing a one language policy not only for video calls with the client but also for every group chat where he/she participates.<strong> Of course, it is not only about the language barrier but the overall feeling of inclusivity. </strong>It also would be better to avoid any inside jokes and topics that a person might not be familiar with.</p><p id="73dc"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Broken promises</strong></p><p id="14a4">Have you scheduled a deadline for fixing a bug with your front-end engineer, but he asks for an extension? Sounds familiar, right? I can’t even count how many times such irresponsible actions were putting me into a risky position with a client and upsetting the whole team. Because for a team to operate as a single entity, everyone should be self-organized and committed to common goals. The well-structured team is key to an outstanding final product, which will leave the client satisfied with the result and a feeling of a civil partnership. And as the word of mouth rules, good reviews can bring more customers to your services.</p><p id="6a88">I believe it is essential to create an environment where achievements and success can be regularly tracked and celebrated because it helps team members to stay focused and keep track of their responsibilities and tasks. For example, we at <a href="https://maddevs.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=how-ruin-relationship-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mad Devs</a> have been implementing the OKR approach (Objectives and Key Results). And I am already seeing the positive impact it brings to the teams because it provides each member with a clear vision of the goals. Clear goals make it easier for them to contribute and allocate their time efficiently.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Broken promises." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF" width="1000" height="626" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="4780"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Poor reporting</strong></p><p id="e23a">Reporting might be a point of frustration for companies in the early development stages or teams that don’t have a clear organizational structure. For example, you have signed off the project with the client and carefully planned it. Then you are proceeding to the execution stage. Your engineering team is working hard on developing the product, but at the same time, the client is continuously asking questions about the progress made. And don’t get me wrong, an interested, and involved client is an excellent thing! Yet clients repeatedly asking questions about development may be evidence of a poor reporting process in the team. <strong>The team should proactively share what’s going on in the project to keep everyone up-to-date.</strong></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Poor reporting." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2059">Nowadays, the client’s involvement in the project is higher than ever before. The client participates at almost every stage of the project. Therefore, it is vital to set the right plan for further interaction and give the client easy access to check the team’s progress. Moreover, modern-day solutions make it way easier to accomplish this goal by using project management apps such as JIRA, Trello, Basecamp, etc. You can create a very sophisticated and easy-to-comprehend schedule where all the deadlines and set goals can be tracked and updated while also giving customers more tools and room to be involved and supervise the project.</p><p id="c35f"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Discrediting the team</strong></p><p id="adf8">This point will probably better resonate with a project manager. Imagine a situation where the deadline is approaching you, but the QA team found new bugs that are delaying the release. And now, you have to explain your struggle to the client. This conversation is not going to be one of the most relaxed, but you have to remain calm and clear-minded, no matter what. Otherwise, it is easy to fall in the pitfall of assigning the blame to other team members and shedding the wrong light. You have to remember that any problems that may arise will be faced by the team together, and there can’t be any scapegoats. If something is falling apart, it indicates poor time management or a lack of planning and testing.</p><p id="2909">Aside from the previous example, it is essential to remember that disclosing any problems you have within the team with the client is probably not the best solution. If you have any complaints about a specific member, this feedback should be discussed directly with the recipient and in privacy.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Discrediting the team." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI" width="1000" height="639" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="db4e"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Ignoring clients’ needs</strong></p><p id="8aa4">Often some ideas of how the final product should look like are diverging between developers and clients. And, understandably, engineers are getting very committed to it throughout the project and trying to improve it in every possible way. Yet being absentmindedly carried away by such ideas can negatively result in your relationship with the customer. If the feature you are trying to implement is not on his/her priority list and you are spending a significant amount of time working on it, <em>(while the more appropriate stack of work is being pushed to the side</em>), you might end up not meeting the main goal and therefore not fulfilling clients’ wishes.</p><p id="9662">Even though such enthusiasm from team members is well appreciated, any modifications that are wished to be made should be negotiated and approved by the customer to prevent future misunderstandings.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Ignoring clients’ needs." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r" width="400" height="257" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r 400w" sizes="400px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="8f87"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p id="7c4d">Of course, these wake-up calls don’t cover every possible issue. However, I believe that these small miscommunications can be fixed without any pain and increase your credibility in the customers’ eyes. I hope this article will help you be more attentive to your actions, and no client/team relationship is going to be further harmed by any of the points I mentioned above.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3164/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png" width="1582" height="860" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="9888">Feel free to leave any comments or any other useful tips you have concerning this subject.

Functional Programming has been around for much longer than OOP as it dates back to the 60s.</p><p id="871c">Functional Programming is a paradigm. It follows the declarative pattern, which means, it focuses on what the program wants to achieve without indicating how. Particularly, JavaScript cannot be compared with functional languages like Haskell, Erlang, Elm, etc., but it supports the functional paradigm very well. Being engaged in functional programming, we design the application architecture and write code using only functions. Functional Programming is excellent for data processing, concurrent, high critical, and serverless systems.</p><p id="7406">In this article, we will consider the following concepts of Functional Programming in JavaScript with simple code examples:</p><ul><li id="d23f">Pure functions;</li><li id="32b5">Immutability;</li><li id="bb01">Referential Transparency;</li><li id="2836">First-class functions;</li><li id="2e78">Higher-order functions.</li></ul><ul><li id="a6ca">Readable;</li><li id="56e3">Concise;</li><li id="4dd1">Testable;</li><li id="af97">Enables Concurrency;</li><li id="ef3d">Robust.</li></ul><p id="6bfb">In Functional Programming, small modules can be coded quickly and easily. It is one of the main advantages of this paradigm. Besides, Functional Programming is a lot more concise than OOP. It tends to enforce the writing of the code in order of operations, which is more logical. Functional Programming has better predictability with pure functions than with impure ones. Pure functions in functional programming are predictable because the only thing they depend on is their input, and the only thing they do is return their output. This means it’s safer, and it’s harder to introduce bugs in your code. Also, it means that it’s easier to test code and find bugs if they occur.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Photo by chuttersnap on Unsplash." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7" width="6000" height="4000" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*QeXPFNyDX49PkDJ7?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@chuttersnap?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chuttersnap</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="d133">The pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments. It does not look at anything else from the outside scope. It only returns its output. It does not have any other effect on the world. Pure functions do not make any other changes than returning their return value.</p><p id="8853">There is a notion in Functional Programming called side-effects. A side-effect is when a function not only returns a value but also goes off and changes something on the side. When a function runs, it could change something while it’s running. You have to avoid side effects as much as possible. Sometimes you need side effects.</p><p id="b49f">Always try to minimize the scope of every variable that you make. It means that every time you make a variable has it live in the smallest possible scope and localize your variables as much as possible.</p><p id="78c0">Examples.</p><p id="6c59">Not pure function:</p><pre><span id="fffd">const name = 'Alice'<br>const sayHi = () =&gt; {<br>    console.log(`Hi ${name}`)<br>};<br>sayHi();</span></pre><p id="9400">Pure function:</p><pre><span id="345b">const sayHi = (name) =&gt; `Hi ${name}`;</span><span id="aa1c">sayHi(‘Alice’);</span></pre><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Photo by Ross Findon on Unsplash." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10624/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L" width="5312" height="2988" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*n6nag2q1vkEL1n5L?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rossf?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ross Findon</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="ec9c">Immutability is a concept that has its roots in Functional Programming. Whenever we want to introduce changes to some data, we should get a new object back with the updated data, instead of modifying the original one. You might think of immutability as “save as” because it returns a new object while traditional in-place mutation would be like “save” — updating original and letting go of the earlier state. It gives stricter control over your data, immediately making your code safer and more predictable.</p><p id="06b3">Primitives are only immutable values built into JavaScript. Consider the next example:</p><pre><span id="336b">let string = "An immutable string";<br>let otherString = string.slice(8, 17);</span></pre><p id="865a">Objects and arrays are mutable in JavaScript. It means that the data structure can be changed.</p><p id="9f80"><em>How to work with mutability in JavaScript?</em></p><p id="93f4">To begin with, most array methods are used, such as sort, push, pop, splice are destructive. There are indeed few non-destructive methods available — a slice. It returns a piece of a given array without modifying the original one.</p><pre><span id="4b56">let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"];<br>let citrus = fruits.slice(1, 3);<br>console.log(citrus); // Outputs: Orange,Lemon<br>console.log(fruits); // Outputs: Banana, Orange, Lemon, Apple, Mango</span></pre><p id="d1f7">As you can see, the original array was preserved.</p><p id="bcd0">JS includes the spread operator. It provides an easy way to create a new array by copying over values from another array. The real power of spread operators comes from combining the spread syntax to make different operations like adding, removing, and updating.</p><pre><span id="e527">let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange"];<br>let updatedFruits = […fruits, 'Mango']; // Outputs: Banana, Orange, Mango</span></pre><p id="e2d6">In this example, I’m copying all the previous items, but I am also adding a new one all at once. The original array was not changed and I have an updated array. Besides slice, few other array methods also return a new object, instead of modifying the original one (filter, map, reduce, concat, etc.).</p><p id="56e9">To make objects immutable, we need to freeze them. The Object.freeze() method freezes an object. Thus objects become immutable. Using this method, nothing can be added to or removed from the properties set of a frozen object. Any attempt to do so will fail.</p><pre><span id="21e0">const person = Object.freeze({<br>    name: "John",<br>    lastName: "Dell"<br>});<br>person.name = "Max";<br>//Outputs: Cannot assign to read-only property 'name'</span></pre><p id="3653">We have to consider that using Object.freeze(), the nested objects can be changed. Object.freeze() does only a shallow freeze. To make an object immutable, we have to freeze deeper.</p><pre><span id="c1ac">function deepFreeze(object) {<br>    var propNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object);<br>    for (let name of propNames) {<br>        let value = object[name];<br>        if (value &amp;&amp; typeof value === "object") {<br>            deepFreeze(value);<br>        }<br>    }<br>    return Object.freeze(object);<br>}<br>var obj2 = {<br>    internal: {<br>        a: null<br>    }<br>};<br>deepFreeze(obj2);<br>obj2.internal.a = 'anotherValue'; // fails silently in non-strict mode<br>obj2.internal.a; // null</span></pre><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Photo by Ricardo Gomez Angel on Unsplash." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5208/0*odB3FgdJTZZnquxz" width="2604" height="2906" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*odB3FgdJTZZnquxz 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*odB3FgdJTZZnquxz 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*odB3FgdJTZZnquxz 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*odB3FgdJTZZnquxz 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/54/0*odB3FgdJTZZnquxz?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ripato?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ricardo Gomez Angel</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="48fd">Referential transparency is another concept closely related to pure functions and side-effects. Referential Transparency means that functions do not rely on anything beyond their parameters, and consequence of this is that it becomes predictable in its behavior. It means that given the same parameters will return the same answer. It makes our code very testable.</p><p id="0015">If you are learning JavaScript, you might hear that in a language, functions are treated as first-class objects. This is because in JavaScript, as in other languages that support functional programming, functions are objects. A function of the first class can be an argument for another function, it can be assigned to a variable, in general, it can be handled just like any other object.</p><ul><li id="1bdb">Functions in JS can be assigned to variables:</li></ul><pre><span id="31cd">const sayHi = () =&gt; {<br>    return 'Hi ';<br>}<br>console.log(sayHi()); // Outputs: Hi</span></pre><ul><li id="3595">Functions in JS can be passed as arguments to a function:</li></ul><pre><span id="7fbf">const sayHiToSomeone = (callback, name) =&gt; {<br>    return callback() + ' ' + name;<br>}<br>console.log(sayHiToSomeone(sayHi, 'Max')); // Outputs: Hi Max</span></pre><ul><li id="315b">Functions in JS can be returned from a function:</li></ul><pre><span id="fd07">const greeterConstructor = greeting =&gt; {<br>    return country =&gt; {<br>        return greeting + ' ' + country;<br>    }<br>}<br>const engGreeter = greeterConstructor('Welcome to ');<br>console.log(engGreeter('England.')); // Outputs: Welcome to England.<br>const gerGreeter = greeterConstructor('Welkom Bij ');<br>console.log(gerGreeter('Duits.')) // Outputs: Welkom Bij Duits.</span></pre><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Photo by Shahadat Rahman on Unsplash." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*tQwfxl0Esx4DiF3d?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@hishahadat?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shahadat Rahman</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a79f">Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions by either taking them as arguments or returning them.</p><p id="2907">A higher-order function is a major concept in Functional Programming. These functions allow you to write simpler and more elegant code. Using higher-order functions, we can reduce bugs and make our code easier to read and understand.</p><p id="eba4">The fact that JavaScript supports first-class functions makes it possible to create higher-order functions. So, the concept of first-class functions explained how functions are treated in JavaScript and how we use them. The reason we use both of these concepts is it helps to understand what is possible and thus take advantage of the power of the JavaScript language. The most common application of higher-order functions in JavaScript is the callback. There are several methods in JavaScript that allow us to pass a function that will be used as part of that method. ES5 array methods illustrate this well. For example, the sort function on arrays is a higher-order function. The sort function takes a function as an argument or, with an anonymous function. Map, reduce, filter, forEach are other examples of higher-order functions built into JavaScript. So, always try to use the built-in <em>higher-order functions</em> in Javascript that we can all leverage to make our code more elegant instead of control loops like For.</p><pre><span id="23ec">let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Papaya", "Mango"];<br>let sorted = fruits.sort();<br>console.log(sorted); // Outputs: Apple,Banana,Mango,Orange,Papaya</span><span id="696b">[1, 2, 3, 4].filter(function(n) {<br>    return n &gt; 2<br>}) // Outputs: 3, 4</span></pre><p id="124a">Functional Programming these days is becoming the standard of building maintainable and modern JavaScript applications. Concepts from this article will allow you to take advantage of Functional Programming and write cleaner code. Also, in this article, I didn’t include other Functional Programming concepts like recursion, monads, functors, lambda, monoid, curry, etc. They are quite advanced, so they were skipped in this article. Understanding these concepts of functional programming will definitely give you the upper hand.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

We have implemented several projects with video or audio calls enabled. That’s why I want to share my thoughts on when to build your own solution from scratch, when to use open source alternatives and when to order a custom solution from a third-party vendor.</p><p id="e70f">First, let me say a few words on the experience we gained with WebRTC in the recent few years.</p><ul><li id="1121">We came up with a SIP via WebRTC solution for a taxi management system that works in the Namba taxi project (Kyrgyzstan).</li><li id="5826">We built a PoC solution for a live chat widget that also included video and audio calls.</li><li id="ce1d">We built a PoC solution for a click-to-call button for websites.</li><li id="72d2">Integrated video calls for <a href="https://teacherly.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teacherly</a> (UK).</li></ul><p id="f9b9">We needed to build a new dispatch system for Namba Taxi which was designed as a single-page web application. You could find more information about the differences between a mobile app and a single-page web application here:</p><p id="a935">We had several options for enabling calls to mobile phones in the browser, such as using a flash softphone and through WebRTC-based solutions. We decided on the second option because it was a brand new way to build audio and video communications, and flash was going to become an unsupported technology in a few years.</p><p id="a988">We solved a lot of problems on our way to a working solution. Finally, we found out that the combination of <a href="https://sipjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sip.js</a> and <a href="https://freeswitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreeSWITCH</a> is the most stable and feature-rich solution that covers all our needs.</p><p id="11dd">Here are the pros we found:</p><ul><li id="ddf8">It removed all our workarounds, like <a href="https://www.asterisk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asterisk</a>+<a href="https://www.doubango.org/webrtc2sip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webrtc2sip</a>+<a href="https://www.doubango.org/sipml5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sipml5</a> (these problems are described below).</li><li id="3121">This solution is neat and easy to understand for all project newbies.</li><li id="24f1">FreeSWITCH has more stable upgrades compared to Asterisk. They don’t break backward compatibility, and the overall quality of FreeSWITCH is better.</li><li id="f756">SIP.js is a well-designed and easy-to-use library that has better code and better compatibility with all browsers.</li></ul><p id="aa2d">And here are the cons of this solution:</p><ul><li id="b17e">Maintenance can be harder because everything has to be managed by your team. It’s hard to find a sysadmin with VOIP experience and an understanding of how it works.</li></ul><p id="9653">We also faced some issues with FreeSWITCH running in the production environment, see (1) &amp; (2) below.</p><ol><li id="30e0">Calls didn’t work on production on Firefox 38+, because their developers removed the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DTLS-SRTP</a> protocol and enabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PFS</a> by default. PFS for FreeSWITCH was enabled in the next release though.</li><li id="f171">We had problems with Chrome 48+ because their developers changed their WebRTC API design. We solved this issue by moving from <a href="https://jssip.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jssip</a> to sip.js.</li></ol><p id="299f">Here are the solutions we tried to use, before deciding on a combination of FreeSWITCH and sip.js:</p><ol><li id="2a6a">Asterisk with WebRTC enabled + SIPML5.</li><li id="ab45">Asterisk with webrtc2sip + SIPML5.</li><li id="3f04">FreeSWITCH + jssip.</li></ol><p id="a485">The problems we faced before combining FreeSWITCH and sip.js:</p><ol><li id="78ba">The call hold feature didn’t work. We found a workaround by muting the dispatcher’s microphone.</li><li id="ae07">Crashes of the webrtc2sip media proxy. We had to go with a workaround here: during alpha testing, we implemented an automatic restart on failure because Asterisk had problems with WebRTC implementation.</li><li id="dbf6">Asterisk stability issues and a lot of crashes. We tried to run Asterisk without a media proxy and discovered that it’s hard to make it work. We had different crashes for two versions of Asterisk and found out that the Asterisk + webrtc2sip combination works fine for us.</li><li id="4886">Wrong configuration for STUN and TURN servers on both sides. The wrong configuration leads to one-way or no-audio issues.</li><li id="e7d3">We had a problem when we hung up the call from a mobile device. In that case, SIPML5 was calling. We fixed it by checking the status of a call on ‘I_new_call’ event and then tried moving to jssip and, finally, to sip.js.</li><li id="394a">WebRTC calls stopped working when we upgraded our Asterisk to 1.7 version. The problem here was caused by the incompatibility of invites. When Asterisk bridges call, it sends an invite using the AVP transport, while the webphone accepts only AVPF transport. Hence we get 603 SIP error with “failed to get local sdp” message. We decided to use webrtc2sip as a media proxy before Asterisk.</li><li id="014f">Memory leaks in webrtc2sip.</li></ol><p id="1638">At first sight, it’s easy to get a working prototype. To deploy it in our production environment, we will need to make sure that all of the following has been done:</p><ul><li id="e197">Ensure that video calls work with all types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAT</a>.</li><li id="d8e8">Ensure that all codecs work on different devices matching them with each other.</li><li id="71c4">Solve connectivity issues between all peers.</li><li id="848c">Deal with tradeoffs between latency and throughput for the best user experience.</li><li id="13c7">Solve issues to build a working and stable set of STUN and TURN servers that will work fast to gain speedier connectivity to the call.</li><li id="555e">Deal with tradeoffs between choosing the right audio sources because when we have two users talking right now we will have issues with the quality of sound.</li></ul><p id="b0e7">Try to avoid development from scratch. You can implement it only if it’s a key feature of your product. Solving all these problems can increase your time-to-market metric, and your release day may be postponed.

Machine Learning and the future of mobile gaming

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OzJUNsPx60" width="320" youtube-src-id="4OzJUNsPx60"></iframe></p><p>I recently came across a YouTube video about an exciting new development. Researchers at NVIDIA enabled an AI to essentially recreate PAC-MAN after watching some 50,000 episodes of the game being played. The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/22/gamegan-research-pacman-anniversary/" target="_blank">blog post</a> makes for fascinating reading and it made me think more about the potential machine learning could have for mobile game development.</p><p>Machine learning is a fast growing industry that was worth $6.9bn globally in 2018 alone, according to <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/machine-learning-market" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Grand View Research</a>. Furthermore, recent research by <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/machine-learning-market-2494" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Market Research Future</a> indicates it is expected to grow by around "42.08% CAGR during the forecast period 2018–2024". A lot of reporting done by media outlets such as <i>Forbes</i> have highlighted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/01/19/roundup-of-machine-learning-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2020/#7e93fbb85c02" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">potential growth</a> in areas such as driver safety, internet security, applications in the financial market et al.&nbsp;</p><p>What about mobile gaming, though? Machine learning is already being used by companies in this space to improve <a href="https://addepto.com/monetize-mobile-gaming-machine-learning/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monetisation</a>&nbsp;(helping to create personalised in-game offers, for example),&nbsp;but I think there are some exciting applications for machine learning still to come:</p><div><ul><li>Rapid prototyping: train an AI to watch gameplay of say, hypercasual games, and feed in art and music to create prototypes of new games quickly and efficiently. You could easily create multiple variations if needed.</li><li>Crowd-sourced games: Imagine a social media site where game ideas are submitted. The most popular ideas are turned into games there and then.</li><li>Personalised 'Netflix for mobile games': Don't like the guns in your mobile FPS? Imagine a service where game assets are personalised on the fly. You could have games to play wherever you want them, how you want them.&nbsp;</li><li>New gift idea: this idea of intimate personalisation opens up the market for personalised mobile games as gifts. You could give someone a platformer, for example, just the way they like it, with their own ideas incorporated in it.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>With the emergence of this technology, it could also challenge existing business models and relationships between developers and publishers may change. How will it work if prototypes can be quickly made without too much human intervention? Will developers be paid per successful idea? Will everything be dependent on great art or music?&nbsp;</p><p>There are exciting and challenging times ahead and the games that emerge from this period will reflect that.&nbsp;</p></div>

As I wrote <a href="https://staticcatgames.blogspot.com/2020/07/do-mobile-game-revenue-models-need-a-rethink.html" target="_blank">recently</a>, Apple is altering contracts for some of its Apple Arcade developers as it focuses more and more on the need for engagement instead of throwing large numbers of games at subscribers and hoping something will stick. Apple execs have come to the conclusion that throwing money at games and building a large library of games just won't cut it. Bankrolling games for little to no return isn't a viable business model in the long term. <i>MacRumors </i>gives an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/30/apple-arcade-game-strategy-shift/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">example of the costs</a>, saying: "Apple has funded work on many games that have been created for ‌Apple Arcade‌, spending between $1 million and $5 million on several titles so far." <br> What they need are players to carry on, well, <i>playing </i>these games day in, day out.&nbsp; <br> The major problem Apple is facing is that none of the games in the Apple Arcade portfolio are major hits. It needs to rectify this and fast. Competition for the subscription service comes from its own app store, which offers a vast number of games (…

Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp; <br> While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp; Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series XNintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example.

<p>Historically, US Presidents have entered the White House at a <a href="https://t.co/v8DD3uCI85?amp=1">median age of 55</a>. </p>



<p>Trump was the oldest ever to become president. If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day. </p>



<p>We are going the wrong way.</p>



<p>Bernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn’t it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidate’s are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.</p>



<p>In terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&amp;journalCode=pssa">study </a>in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).</p>

<p>There are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person’s 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.</p>



<p>Politics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).</p>



<p>It is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.</p>



<p>Here are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella (52) </li><li>Apple’s Tim Cook (59) </li><li>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (56) </li><li>Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai (47) </li><li>Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang  (48) </li><li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (36) </li><li>Tencent’s Ma Huateng (48) </li></ul>



<p>The median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading bothing of those efforts.</p>



<p>The point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team’s quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn’t mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40’s to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America. </p>
