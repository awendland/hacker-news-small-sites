July 1, 2020 | https://yarmo.eu/post/keyoxide | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yarmo.eu/post/keyoxide">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, I'm excited to launch <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a>, the lightweight and FOSS solution to make basic cryptography operations accessible to regular humans.</p>
<h2>What is Keyoxide.org?</h2>
<p><a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> offers easy encryption, signature verification and decentralized identity proof verification based on PGP keys while demanding little in-depth knowledge about the underlying encryption program from its users.</p>
<p>This project aims to offer comparable functionality as services like <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> while reducing friction and being more open.</p>
<p>The project is MIT licensed, uses <a href="https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs">openpgpjs</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Codeberg</a>.</p>
<h2>Why only encryption and signature verification?</h2>
<p>These are the operations that are available when only having access to public keys instead of private keys. If you wish to decrypt messages and sign them, you need a keypair. If you have a keypair, you probably have the knowledge to use dedicated tools like the CLI or Kleopatra. And if you do, you probably won't be using <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> directly yourself.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you possess a PGP keypair, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> is the tool you send to others to interact with your public key more easily. Allow them to encrypt a message for you, to verify one of your signatures, to verify your online identities using decentralized proofs.</p>
<h2>What are those decentralized identity proofs you keep mentioning?</h2>
<p>You know how Keybase allows you to prove you have control over accounts on certain websites and services? A great function! Fortunately for you, this function can be even better and more secure by using <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/openpgp-proofs">decentralized OpenPGP identity proofs</a>. <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> will prove your identity on multiple platforms at the same time and yet, you are not required to make an account to use this function. How is that possible?</p>
<p>Well, it's called <em>decentralized</em> for a reason: <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> doesn't hold your proofs, your key does! Any software that can access your public key can verify these proofs for anyone. When better tooling comes around, you could verify those proofs using a mobile app, using a command-line utility, you name it. No single service holds your proof, only you do, stored inside your keypair.</p>
<p>I have written a <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides">guide</a> on how to add a proof for every platform currently supported by this website: <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/dns">domains</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/lobsters">Lobste.rs</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/github">Github</a>, a <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides">bunch more</a> and work is in progress to support even more still. Is your beloved service not in the list? <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Open an issue or make a PR</a>! Free open-source software FTW!</p>
<p>Oh, that reminds me, any <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/mastodon">Mastodon</a> instance can be used to prove your identity. Yes, <a href="https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3385">any</a>.</p>
<h2>So how does it compare to Keybase?</h2>
<p>There's a more complete <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/feature-comparison-keybase">guide on the Keyoxide website</a>, but in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>more privacy-friendly by not forcing you to create an account and handing over data</li>
<li>more secure by not asking you to trust the service with your private keys</li>
<li>open-source servers (<a href="https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/24105">a must</a>)</li>
<li>encrypt/verify with every public key accessible on the internet, not just those that have been uploaded to a proprietary server</li>
<li>almost all processing is done in the browser, no data is sent to servers*</li>
<li>no vendor lock-in</li>
<li>selfhostable</li>
</ul>
<p>* Only exception is decentralized identity proof verification: some service providers do not have the correct CORS headers (like Reddit) or require APIs (like Twitter). In these rare cases, simple PHP scripts (also open-source) run the proof verification instead.</p>
<h2>Can I get an account?</h2>
<p>No. <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> doesn't need your data on its servers. There are already several ways of exposing public keys on the internet, including <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/web-key-directory">web key directory</a> (WKD) and dedicated servers like <a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">keys.openpgp.org</a>. Let's use those instead of making yet another service where you need to upload your keys to.</p>
<h2>Can I get a profile page then?</h2>
<p>Yes! Append your PGP fingerprint or WKD id to the URL and there it is!</p>
<p>Want an example? Here's  my profile at<br>
<a href="https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d">https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d</a>.</p>
<p>Now you know what accounts on various services are mine, where to follow me if you wish to get updates on the project and if you wish to send me an encrypted message, that's also just two clicks away.</p>
<h2>What about my private keys?</h2>
<p>Don't upload your private keys to the internet, period. If a service wants your private keys on their (proprietary) servers, say no.</p>
<h2>You said selfhostable?</h2>
<p>Well, yes! It's not a fully supported use case just yet, but the browser does all the processing, the server is mostly just there to deliver the files to the user to perform the operations. <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Grab the code</a> and put it on your own PHP server!</p>
<h2>Any closing words?</h2>
<p>I built this to provide better tooling around modern-day encryption programs and reduce the friction for less tech-savvy people when interacting with public keys.</p>
<p>For those who wish to use encryption programs beyond OpenPGP, <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide/issues">let's talk about this</a>. Keyoxide doesn't have any reference to PGP in its name for a reason: it could serve as a platform for easy interaction with any public key, no matter the underlying encryption program.</p>
<p>And above all, I hope you see the same benefit and potential in <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> as I do and would like to see it grow as an open and accessible platform to push forward the democratization of online privacy and security.</p>
<p>Privacy is not a luxury.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://metacode.biz/@wiktor">Wiktor</a> for helping with the decentralized identity proofs.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
        <article>
            <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

        <div><div>
            <p><span>Abstract.</span> Papers on leaderless consensus protocols such as EPaxos and Atlas describe the protocols from the ground up. This approach helps a reader without prior knowledge to understand how they work, but at the same time it makes it hard for an expert to grok them because they need to trace and check all the assumptions from scratch rather than rely on already proved protocols. This may explain why the leaderless consensus protocols didn't get traction in the industry despite being known since 2013.</p>

            <p>In this post I present a leaderless consensus protocol built in a modular way on top of known consensus protocol. Its modularity helps in understanding and retrofitting into existing solutions.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div><div>
            <p>From an engineering perspective a consensus protocol is a replication protocol. Usually it is used to replicate a state of an application (a state machine) to increase its availability. The key difference between consensus and primary-backup replication is an ability to tolerate node and network failures without losing integrity of the data.</p>

            <p>One may think of consensus replication as a strongly consistent variant of master-master replication where any replica (a proposer) can initiate a change. Althrouth consistency is never compromised in practice the concurrent processes may abort each other and stall the performance. In literature this situation is known as dueling proposers.</p>

            <blockquote>"It’s easy to construct a scenario in which two proposers each keep issuing a sequence of proposals with increasing numbers, none of which are ever chosen", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"The presence of two concurrent leaders can prevent the commitment of any consensus decision and hence prevent progress", Deconstructing Paxos</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"if multiple processes detect that there is no leaser and all attempt to become leader an the same time, then none of the process is likely to succeed (again dueling proposers)", Google SRE book</blockquote>

            <p>The can't be dismissed as a fluke, take latency of CASPaxos when all requests to change the <span>same object</span> land the same replica and latency of CASPaxos when the requests are uniformly distributed across all five replicas.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/dueling.png"></p><p>We see that when there are 20 clients then the dueling reduces throughput 2.85 times from 4513 ops/s to 1581 op/s and increases p99 latency 10.37 times from 4467 microseconds to 46 milliseconds.</p>

            <p>The absolute numbers and the degradation ratio depend on the hardware. For this and all the follow up experiments I simulated <code>5+c</code> nodes cluster (where <code>c</code> is the number of the clients) with around 178 us RTT between any nodes, 655 bytes/us network throughput, 2 ms fsync disk latency and 1132 bytes/us disk throughput, although I haven't pushed the system to the limit of the bandwidth so the throughput numbers for disk and network don't really matter.</p>

            <p>The shape of the charts surprised me. Usually when a system reaches saturation the latency looks linear while throughput reaches plateau and stops growing. But in this case the shapes are inverted which implies that the system is far from saturation and that we can keep adding clients increasing throughput without affecting latency. It happens because CASPaxos replicates state instead of the commands so a proposer can apply multiple commands in chain to the stored state and replicate only the final version (batching on steroids) reducing the load on the network.</p>

            <p>Leslie Lamport suggested using a leader election abstraction to select a leader (a distinguished proposer) which is the only one capable of processing requests. It's worth noting that the idea of a leader is used to reduce contention and not to enforce consistency. Meaning the leader election may be weak and may not prevent the case where several replicas become leaders for the same period of time. It allows the use of a large class of protocols for leader election including randomised timeouts &amp; heartbeats, consistent hashing routering or external arbiter.</p>

            <p>But the idea of leader election has its flaws:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>hardware issues may degrade performance of a leader and affect the whole system</li>
                <li>after a leader fails and until a new leader is elected, a consensus based system becomes unavailable</li>
                <li>randomised leader election under unstable network creates non-trivial failure modes which may delay election of a new leader</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I built a leadered version of consensus replication and used fault injection to demonstrate the issues. The stable leadership is compared with ad hoc leadership which is known to suffer from dueling proposers under normal circumstances. The leaderd system uses 4ms election timeout while the fault injector isolates a random replica for 12ms.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leader.adhoc.unrest.png"></p><p>For 20 clients the fault injections cause the stable leadership to have 2.46 times lower throughput (709 ops/s vs. 1750 ops/s) and 1.5 times higher p99 latency (60ms vs. 40ms) than an ad hoc leadership approach.</p>

            <p>It looks like we have to choose between scylla and charybdis: either to have 6.36 times lower than optimal throughput (4513 ops/s vs 709 ops/s) during unavoidable transient issues under strong leadership or to have throughput profile independent of failures (1581 ops/s and 1750 ops/s) but both 2.85 times less than optimal under ad hoc leadership.</p>

            <p>The question is if there is a compromise between being fast without failures and being fast on a rainy day. The family of leaderless consensus protocols fills that niche.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/epaxos.png"></p><p>EPaxos solves the contention problem and provides excellent fault tolerance. But despite being around for seven years it hasn't generated enough traction and I don't know any product in the industry which is using it. The lack of interest is especially noticeable if we compare EPaxos to Raft protocol which was discovered around the same time.</p>

            

            <p>The lack of popularity may be attributed to the complexity. I've found several reports on implementing EPaxos: <a href="https://medium.com/princeton-systems-course/reproducing-epaxos-by-ang-li-and-robin-qiu-b5a8fc5262a2">Reproducing EPaxos</a> by Robin Qiu and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6246">EPaxos</a> by Blake Eggleston, and both of them mention the complexity of EPaxos:</p>

            <blockquote>One major drawback of the algorithm is its complexity. From our understanding, EPaxos is more like a two-dimensional Paxos on top of an eventual-consistency-like layer.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>We only implemented the basic EPaxos, and it is already much more complicated than Raft. We believe the fully optimized EPaxos will be even more complicated. In practice, complicated algorithms are hard to design, optimize, and maintain, making them less likely to be adopted in production.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>It’s still pretty rough, I just wanted to get it to a point where we could get a feel for the performance advantages and decide if the additional complexity was worth it</blockquote>

            <p>Funny enough the complexity of the protocol <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10917.pdf">manifested</a> in the official reference implementation of the EPaxos and TLA+ proof having a bug which leads replicas to diverge and break the linearizability of the replicated service.</p>

            <p>This post is an attempt to design a leaderless consensus protocol but keep it simple via the modular approach by reusing already proved components.</p>

        </div></div>

        
          
        <div><div>
            <p>The core idea of the pacified consensus is to order client requests and to let replicas to co-execute the same request in parallel. The preordering reduces contention and parallel execution increases fault tolerance. Even when one replica gets isolated or goes offline another finishes its request without a delay because it is already working on it in parallel.</p>

            <p>The parallel execution doesn't affect correctness because the effects of the parallel execution can be explained by the selective duplication of messages and Paxos tolerates this kind of intrusion</p>

            <p>The task of ordering client requests in a fault tolerant way and replicating it to the replicas sounds like a consensus problem. It is natural to suggest that running two consensus replication processes can't be faster than running just one but actually it is.</p>

            <p>The trick is that a major part of the latency comes from the disk IO. Even when we use NVM but target high throughput we should make small delays to accumulate writes (4 ms) and write them in batches.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/nvm.png"></p><p>4 ms is 20 times higher than intra datacenter RTT, so in-memory consensus in front of on-disk consensus doesn't contribute much to the overall end to end latency but completely eliminates contention.</p>

            <p>This idea isn't just wild speculations, I've built it and measured the performance. And the leaderless consensus performs on par with leadered when there are no faults, latency is just 23% worse but throughput is 36% better.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.leader.png">

            The leaderless consensus with faults performs a bit worse than leaderless consensus without faults.

            <img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.unrest.png"></p><p>Without context 67% increase in P99 latency (9267us vs 5535us) and 12% decrease in throughput (6154 ops/s vs 5392 ops/s) doesn't look good but when we compare it with other solutions it's almost an order of magnitude better.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>It seems like every day I get ready to finish part 1 of my MicroLED series, another AR news story breaks. And not just any AR story but one that Apple may be announcing their AR glasses soon along with a very few details.</p>



<p>I’m not an avid Apple follower, nor had I heard of the leaker, Jon Prosser, before today. But as just about every on-line tech and business magazine picked up the story and said Prosser past leaks usually came true, it gives the leak an air of credibility. <strong>For the sake of this article, I am going to assume Prosser is correct in his statements and then try to figure out what Apple could be doing based on the information.</strong> </p>



<p>This blog is not about breaking news, but more about analysis of existing information. Google Glass was old news when <a href="https://www.kguttag.com/2013/03/08/google-glass-and-himax-whirlwind/">this blog figured out that it was using a Himax LCOS Panel</a>. Magic Leap had already raised over $1B and had hundreds of patents when this <a href="https://www.kguttag.com/2018/08/23/ifixits-magic-leap-one-teardown-confirms-kgontechs-analysis-from-november-2016/">blog correctly figured out what they were doing about a year and a half before they shipped a product</a>.</p>



<p>I don’t have enough to go on today to know what Apple is doing precisely. As I wrote back in December, <a href="https://www.kguttag.com/2019/12/12/the-lack-of-apple-ar-patents-and-apples-leveraging-the-aias-ptab-banana-republic-courts/">Apple has not left much of a patent paper trail</a>. BTW, I find that <a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/">Patently Apple</a>, at least in the case of AR, &nbsp;tends to over sensationalize what appears to me to be either trivial patents or things that I doubt Apple will bring to market. Either Apple is not filing significant patents, filing them under the name of a shell company, or they are buying the technology from someone else.</p>



<p>This is another, I want to get this out in a hurry article. Expect more than the usual number of typo’s. There will probably be some corrections in the upcoming days. </p>



<h2>Front Page Tech Video Say Apple Glass Will Be Announce in Q4 2020 or Q1 2021</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Prosser-Apple-Glasses-01.png" alt="" width="580" height="539" srcset="https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Prosser-Apple-Glasses-01.png 793w, https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Prosser-Apple-Glasses-01-300x279.png 300w, https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Prosser-Apple-Glasses-01-768x715.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Prosser-Apple-Glasses-01.png 793w, https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Prosser-Apple-Glasses-01-300x279.png 300w, https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Prosser-Apple-Glasses-01-768x715.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Prosser-Apple-Glasses-01.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Today’s big news is that Front Page Tech’s (<strong>FPT</strong>) Youtuber Jon Prosser released a <a href="https://youtu.be/SfjSy6T4iE4">video giving information on the </a>Apple Glass name, planned announcement date, price, and some minimal technical information on the product itself. I’m going to try and tease out some additional technical details from the scant information given.</p>



<p>In the figure on the left, I have combined the video’s essential information from three slides Prosser presented. &nbsp;I should add that Prosser stated:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>I’m trying to get the green light legally to share a video of a prototype of these glasses that I’ve seen.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>So maybe we will see a video soon, but it was not clear to me if it will be a working prototype or just a mockup. While Prosser may be a tech enthusiast and good at finding leaks, he may not know what to look for in an AR headset.</p>



<p>An AR expert with just one look of a functioning headset could tell a lot about the optics they are using. And within a minute or two of using it could figure out what display technology they are using. Listening to Prosser’s video several times, I’m not sure he has looked through a working unit. Maybe he has seen a working unit, but I would expect to know a lot more from someone that has seen a working unit.</p>



<p>For the rest of this article, I am going to go through the bullet points from the video, where I feel I have something to add. I’m going to try and do some “<strong>thought experiment reverse-engineering</strong>” to tease out information from between the lines of what Prosser wrote. </p>



<h2>The Name “<em>Apple Glass</em>“</h2>



<p>No surprise and nothing original, but it looks like we have a name. iGlass and iGlasses like iWatch were already taken.</p>



<h2>“<em>$499 + prescription</em>“</h2>

<p>Interestingly this is the exact same price as Nreal’s AR glasses that plugs in smartphone via USB-C cable for the processing. While Prosser never says so explicitly, almost certainly the Apple Glasses have wireless data (more wireless data later), and probably why Prosser didn’t bother to mention it.</p>



<p>The $499 price gives a lot of clues. Figure that if the Nreal headset were in the Apple store, it would likely sell for more than $1,000 with <img width="273" height="171" src="">typical Apple margins. &nbsp;To meet typical Apple margins, Apple Glasses would need to have a bill of materials (BOM) about half that of Nreal’s consumer glasses. And Apple has wireless battery charging, a battery, and wireless communication that Nreal does not. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ODG-9494800-Fig-169-002.png" alt="" width="424" height="261" srcset="https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ODG-9494800-Fig-169-002.png 676w, https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ODG-9494800-Fig-169-002-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ODG-9494800-Fig-169-002.png 676w, https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ODG-9494800-Fig-169-002-300x185.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ODG-9494800-Fig-169-002.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Apple is going to want much sleeker and inherently more expensive optics than Nreal. The Nreal birdbath optics (essentially the same as the OGG optics on the right – <a href="https://www.kguttag.com/2019/01/29/ces-2019-nreal/">see here for more about how they work</a>), while inexpensive with excellent image quality, are too bulky and probably block too much light for Apple’s liking. The thinner optics are likely not going to have nearly as good an image as a simple birdbath.</p>



<p>So Apple Glass has to support higher margins and inherently more expensive optics but sell at the same price. Something has to give, and it is likely in terms of resolution, field of view (FOV), and image quality when compared to Nreal. It suggests that Apple Glass is going to be somewhere between Google Glass and Nreal when it comes to the image the user sees.&nbsp; I’m expecting the display resolution to be between 400 x300 and 800×600 pixels in resolution. Everything to me suggests that Apple is going for “style” over image quality. </p>



<p>I tend to doubt that Apple will use waveguides like Hololens (1&amp;2), Magic Leap, WaveOptics, Dispelix, and Vuzix. Given the available information, I would favor some form of thin freeform optics like what has been done by <a href="https://www.tooztech.com/">Tooz</a> or by the lesser know startup, <a href="http://oorym.com/">Oorym</a>. Tooz spun out of Carl Zeiss that <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/apple-ar-smart-glasses-carl-zeiss-augmented-reality-540835">back in 2017 was rumored to be working with Apple</a>. <strong>I’m not saying that it was either Tooz or Oorym specifically</strong>, but that the optic might be something similar to what these companies are doing. Freeform optics are going to be much more optically efficient than say diffractive waveguides, which translates into less power, which saves on heat and battery. Freeform optics are bigger for a given resolution, but if Apple’s resolution and FOV goals are modest (i.e. small), freeform optics would seem to be the best option. </p>



<p>Then we have the comment on cost about being “plus prescription.” This immediately says that Apple’s Glasses are not going to have the large eye relief of say Hololens that would let someone wear their own glasses. The cheap but ugly way, not the “Apple way, &nbsp;would be to add prescription inserts like Nreal and Magic Leap, as examples. By process of elimination, this leaves building the prescriptions into the optics. Once again, this tends to point to thin freeform optics. Tooz, for instance, supports building the prescription into their optics, and Oorym claims they will be able to support prescription lenses. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t have a much to go on in terms of the display type. I’m leaning to some form of flat panel, either a small OLED or a tiny pixel size (~20-micron pixel pitch) LCD. It could also be something like a <a href="https://www.himax.com.tw/products/microdisplay-products/front-lit-lcos/">Frontlit Himax LCOS device</a>. When you are talking a modest resolution and FOV, there are a lot of options.</p>



<h2>“<em>All data is processed on iPhone (example first gen Apple Watch)</em>“</h2>



<p>Quoting the video (from auto-transcript with minor corrections and punctuation):</p>



<blockquote><p><em>All data processing is going to happen on your iPhone, so similar to what we saw with the first gen Apple watch. That’s sort of what we can expect here with Apple Glass. Some of you might be surprised and bummed by that. But it makes sense. &nbsp;I know a lot of people are like expecting some sort of crazy holograph like Hololens type experience. Some life-changing device, so I want to sort of temper your expectations here, especially for the first generation product. But listen, it makes sense. Data processing happening, and depending on the iPhone in your pocket, that price point of $499 makes a lot more sense now. Anything more than that would probably increase the price of these things quite a bit.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Everything said above makes sense. Apple Glass is likely to be closer to an Apple Watch (448 by 368 pixels) in terms of display resolution than say an iPhone (1792 x 828 pixels). Apple Glass is likely to be more of a “data snacking” and for playing lower resolution Pokemon-Go-like games. So they can more than get away with using the phone’s processor. </p>



<h2>“<em>Final design could be different, likely won’t match crazy concepts (they’re meant to LOOK like glasses, not intimidating tech)</em>“</h2>



<p>The “look like glasses” tends to support the idea above that the prescription is built into the glasses. Supporting prescriptions probably works against the many “uni-lens” concepts I have seen. It would be a developmental and logistical nightmare to have a “uni-lens” with prescriptions.</p>



<h2>“<em>LiDAR on right temple, no other cameras on recent prototype (privacy) &nbsp;and Controlled via gestures on and in front of device</em>“</h2>



<p>Despite all the “shaming” and privacy concerns, I can’t see this type of product being successful without the ability to take pictures. I can believe Apple would do it just like they wouldn’t make a large iPhone for so many years (sometimes Apple outthinks itself). If they make it past Gen 1, then expect a camera on Gen 2.</p>



<p>Putting the LiDAR on the right temple and would seem to be worse for left-handed people (about 10% of the population). &nbsp;Also, gesture input can be very problematic in real-world situations.</p>



<h2>“<em>Wirelessly charge (flipped upside down) on provided plastic stand</em>“</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, not only does this say there is a battery; it also implies that there is wireless communication to the iPhone. Like the Apple Watch, it will probably use a combination of Bluetooth and WiFi.&nbsp; But wireless communication takes a lot of power per bit, so sending video tends to be power-hungry. I would not be expecting to watch movies on Apple Glasses. Maybe a low-resolution video clip occasionally but not a lot more.</p>



<h2>“<em>Displays in BOTH lenses</em>” – The Big Ask</h2>



<p>It sounds so simple to put “displays in both lenses” until you realize the ramifications. It was this one statement that made me want to write this article. &nbsp;It may sound like supporting two …</p></div></article></section></article></main></section></div></div></div>

                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching burndown charts. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A user story inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

	<div>
		<p>I've done both, through the system and out of it. I went to a higher education institute and learned most of what I know alone, using online resources and books.</p><p>In this post, I'll share the points that affected me. Others might view things differently and I encourage you to share your point of view in the comments section.</p><h2 id="the-good-">The Good:</h2><p>Learning alone, from online (or offline) resources gives you several degrees of flexibility:</p><p><strong>You can choose the content:</strong><br>You don't have to settle for the content that your education institute provides you. There are probably better resources out there, you can learn programming, economics, or architecture by handpicking the best resources every step of the way.</p><p>Searching for content will also give you a better understanding of your field of study, what are the main subjects to learn, what are the ways it's currently taught in. You can enrich your learnings with several media types, such as YouTube videos, books, and courses.</p><p><strong>3.5 months. No more:</strong><br>You don't have to stick to the 3.5 months semester format. If it takes you another month to learn a subject it's perfectly fine. The most important thing is that you end up understanding it. There is no such concept when going through college, if it takes you even 4 months, you "strike out" and need to retake that course.</p><p>It goes the other way as well. Sometimes you can complete learning a subject in less time. If your pace is faster no one forces you to drag it for 3.5 months.</p><p>You can schedule your learning time:<br>When taking a course at an educational institute, you're given a learning schedule and there's a specific time for classes and exercises. If it clashes with other things in your life, you'll have to adjust.</p><p>Self-learning allows you to fit learning into your existing schedule, or make lesser changes to your lifestyle. There's no real ability to work full-time when attending college, but it's possible if you can schedule your studies in the evenings and during the weekends. That said, there are obvious issues here that I'll touch in the cons section.</p><p><strong>A growth catalyst:</strong><br>To achieve the benefits of self-learning, we must grow and mature. This can be view as a con but I decided to list it in the pros. It's these experiences and hardships in our lives that spur growth. You have to be true to your word, invest the time required for learning and not trick yourself. It'll be hard. You might fail at times.</p><p>You have to maintain your integrity, not lie to yourself and do things outside of your comfort zone. The learning itself is just one of the challenges here. There's no group to drag everyone forward, no boss/teacher to give you exercises and there are no firm deadlines besides the ones you set yourself, which should be the hardest deadlines of them all.</p><p>Succeeding here will grant you mental sturdiness and competency. It will make you a formidable person, a force. You'll feel stronger because you'll know that you can execute plans and pull through inconveniences.</p><p>You'll also face the need to learn how to learn. This is an underrated skill that we rarely learn growing up. Self-learning will help you pay more attention to the way you learn and to your habits. You'll improve as you practice, thus be a more efficient learner.</p><p><strong>Learn for you:</strong><br>Self-learning usually comes from a place of need or desire. You either need the knowledge or are very curious about it (also sort of a need). Having a good answer to the "why" question will help you learn much better.</p><p>Self-learning allows you to choose your own "why". Growing up you didn't have a great part in the decision of what to learn and why. Now you're the authority. Maybe it's something you want to build, an improvement to your career path, or magical curiosity. The choice is yours.</p><p>Also, efficient learning requires a project, and self-learning enables you to choose your own. Choose a project that speaks to you, one that will make you feel it's a good use of your time. It'll give you a stronger purpose and a chance to use your newly gained skills along the way.</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong><br>It's much cheaper to be a self-learner. You can get the same knowledge for either free or a fraction of the cost of college. Books, online courses, YouTube Channels, Podcasts, all give you a great platform to learn from. You can also get certificates at platforms like edX and Coursera at an affordable price.</p><hr><h2 id="the-bad-">The Bad:</h2><p>Now for the cons of self-learning. Alongside the benefits of self-learning, there are disadvantages we should take into consideration.</p><p><strong>Underdeveloped maturity effects:</strong><br>Maturity develops with time. While still underdeveloped it can cause some pain.</p><p>Procrastination and excuses. Not finishing what you started or not investing enough time. These will anger you with yourself. You'll feel you're not cut out for it. Like you're not made out of self-learning material. Many people pass through this stage, and you should know that with dedication and persistence this can be overcome.</p><p>You need to be true to yourself about the amount of effort you invest and choose proper ways to exercise what you learned.</p><p>It's important to know when it's time to continue to the next stage. It's easy to stay in the new comfort zone of a topic you already understand. This requires maturity as well. It can cause you to stay at the introductory level or stick to tutorials and articles, not progressing with either the learning or the project you chose. I think the coined term is "Tutorial Purgatory".</p><p><strong>No people:</strong><br>Bringing people together is one of the most wonderful things about universities and colleges. I view it as the main reason for their existence.</p><p>Having all those people around you in college means that you can brainstorm a lot. You can gain access to the way other people think and learn. Learning from others is important and self-learning doesn't have that.</p><p>There are things you can do to compensate. You can be active in forums or, online groups, however, it's not a substitute for all that brain that naturally hangs out around you in environments like schools and universities.</p><p>Learning with people, there's also the "herd effect". It's easier to go through the experience of education as a herd, together. Students support and incentivize each other and share the load. It's a place we can start developing teamwork skills.</p><p>Also, it's more fun to learn with others. You have people to share newly learned concepts with. People to be curious or plot interesting projects with. Fun and connection is a great part of learning in particular and of executing in general and it's missed when learning alone.</p><p>With fewer people, there are fewer opportunities to develop your social skills and personal network. In college, you pass 3-4 intensive years together that create lifelong friendships and connections. While Self-learning, we meet fewer people with whom we share less time. It's a big con to consider.</p><p><strong>No mentors:</strong><br>There are usually no professionals to guide us when we self-learn. We can follow the advice of online tutors, but there's no one to approach personally and discuss your concerns and thoughts with.</p><p>The benefits of a mentor go beyond raw information. Good mentors show us the reasons behind what they do. They can give us the "why" that's always so important. Mentors also serve as professional role models, and unless you're actively searching, chances are you won't find one when self-learning.</p><p><strong>Less respected certificates:</strong><br>It's still the case that university diplomas are more appreciated than private course system's ones. There's also the problem of not having a certificate at all. If you study from a book, a YouTube channel or a private course, there's no one to certificate you.</p><p>It's a shame because when I study from books or courses, I usually end up knowing the material well enough to use it. With that, There's a shift going on these days, learners and employers decreasing their reliance on college diplomas. Experience speaks louder. The ability to execute start to matter more than whether or not you passed through a university. That said, diplomas still matter.</p><hr><p>We should view these cons as opportunities to improve self-learning. We can generate ideas to connect self-learners and spur interactions and discussions. Ideas that can lessen these cons or maybe even solve them. I bet on self-learning for the long run as a scalable solution, therefore, I think we must.</p><p>Surely this list of pros and cons is not an exhaustive one, and I might add to it in the future. The idea behind this list is not to help people choose between self-learning and the academy. You should ALWAYS strive to be a better self-learner, and if you have the privilege, go to a college as well.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>June 30, 2020<!-- --> <!-- -->•<!-- --> <span>programming</span></p></header><section><p>I picked up <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring, by Martin Fowler</a>, and I am learning a lot. The book is written like a catalogue that you can refer back to later. And, for those who are seeking, <strong>the book is an excellent chance to get your code reviewed by Martin Fowler!!</strong> 😮</p>
<p>Martin starts the book with an example that he goes on to refactor in the first chapter. Sensing an insane opportunity, I stopped right away and copied this original code in Ruby. I then went ahead, wrote down my thoughts and refactored the code like I would if it was an actual thing I was working on. Once I was done, I went back to the book and compared Martin’s notes against mine, and learnt from his thought process and code. I think this is the best way to read this chapter.</p>
<p>If you are someone who enjoys this, I highly recommend you give this a try too. And if not the book, use this blog to power your review.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the full original code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>We have a Theatre Company that perform plays in events. They charge customers based on the type of the play, and also provide a “Volume Credit” for future discounts. The Company stores data about their plays (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/plays.json">plays.json</a>) and bills (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/invoices.json">invoices.json</a>) in JSON files.</p>
<p>The simple code below is used to print a bill from an invoice. This is the code we will attempt to refactor. Assume that this code is part of a much larger system and we are refactoring while adding a feature to print bills in HTML. Moreover, the Company has plans to perform more types of plays in the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the refactored code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/ketanbhatt">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>Reading through the code, this is what stood out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>statement</code> method returns a formatted text right now. I would like it to return a structured statement that I can format later as I wish, for example: for sending Slack notifications, emails. Additionally, it simplifies writing tests for this and the formatter methods.</li>
<li>The code that adds extra <code>volume_credits</code> for <code>comedy</code> plays, the comment states that we add extra credit for every “10” attendees, but the code adds a credit for every “5” attendees. Either this comment has gone stale, or there is a bug in the code. Either way, we can make the code more readable and remove the comment. (Aside: I like <a href="http://antirez.com/news/124">antirez’s blog about writing comments</a> a lot.)</li>
<li>Overall, it is difficult to understand what is going on in the code. I think we can make it more readable easily.</li>
<li>The method is doing too much, calculating <code>volume_credit</code> and <code>amount</code> for each type of play, and creating the text. It would be better if I can hand over this calculation to a different class that would do the needful, and my method just creates the text.</li>
<li>Because of this “doing too much”, the code has become messy. It will become still messier if the calculation was different for each Play too (and not same for Plays of the same type).</li>
<li>Also, looks like that the calculation is in cents and is being converted to dollars in the text. The code should make this explicit. Maybe I could rename the variable to be <code>amount_in_cents</code>?</li>
<li>The code right now assumes <code>audience</code> to be present and to be a number. Maybe we should put in validations that <code>asserts</code> for this truth? Although it seems out of scope for our current exercise.</li>
</ol>

<p>I moved the code for calculating amount and volume credits to a different class and file. I also separated the calculation for the two types of plays.</p>
<p>In the future, adding new play types will just need a new class to be added.</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>

<span>class</span> <span>PlayTypeBaseStatementCalculator</span>
  <span>def</span> <span><span>initialize</span></span><span>(</span>play_id<span>:</span><span>,</span> audience<span>:</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@play_id</span> <span>=</span> play_id
    <span>@audience</span> <span>=</span> audience
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span><span>amount</span></span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span><span>volume_credits</span></span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>class</span> <span>TragedyStatementCalculator</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>PlayTypeBaseStatementCalculator</span>

  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<br>
I also implemented the calculation in a more verbose manner. I think this improves the readability of the code.
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>

I will call the refactoring done at this point.
<div><p>Although, I can’t seem to shake off this feeling that there is something more that can be done. I don’t think I am completely happy with the changes 😕 Let’s see what Sir Martin has to say.
</p></div>
<center>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/vA4EnqvJxDv2g/giphy.gif" alt="Excited Anticipation GIF"></p>
</center>

<p>The process that Martin followed for refactoring the original code, in his words, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Decomposing the original function into a set of nested functions</li>
<li>Separate calculating and printing code, the two phases.</li>
<li>Introducing a polymorphic calculator for the calculation logic.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I have learnt in this chapter, in the <strong>hypothetical scenario</strong> in which Martin Fowler does a code review of my changes, this is what he would have to say:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>“I like that you are using an intermediate structure to pass the calculation …</em></li></ol></section></article></div>

July 1, 2020 | https://skebanga.github.io/cpp-dev-in-spacemacs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://skebanga.github.io/cpp-dev-in-spacemacs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Two new emacs packages, <a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode">‘lsp-mode’</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode">‘dap-mode’</a>, have 
brought the power of Microsoft’s <a href="ttps://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/">Debug Adapter Protocol</a>
to emacs.</p>

<p>This is a guide to getting <code>lsp-mode</code> and <code>dap-mode</code> working in spacemacs for C++.</p>

<p>Spacemacs’ <a href="https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/c-c++/README.html">C++ layer</a> supports multiple backends for <code>lsp-mode</code>. We’ll be using 
<a href="https://clangd.llvm.org/">clangd</a>, a language server built on clang.</p>

<p>The distro I use in this post is Ubuntu 20.04.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em></p>

<p>I wrote this <em>after</em> figuring out how to configure everything, so it’s highly likely I’ve forgotten something or missed a step. Please let me know if this doesn’t work for you.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<h3 id="clang-tools">clang tools</h3>

<p>We will be installing our clang tools from the Ubuntu nightly repos provided by llvm.</p>

<p>Add the gpg key and repository config to apt:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://apt.llvm.org/focal/ llvm-toolchain-focal main"
$ sudo apt update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install the clang tools</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo apt install -y clang-format clang-tidy clang clangd libclang-dev liblldb-11-dev lldb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="node">node</h3>

<p><code>dap-mode</code> leverages the vscode debug adapters which are written in javascript. As such we need to install node</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo apt install nodejs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="lsp-mode"><code>lsp-mode</code></h2>

<p><code>lsp-mode</code> will run <code>clangd</code> and communicate with it in order to get information about your C++ code.</p>

<p>You need to tell <code>clangd</code> where to find <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html"><code>compile_commands.json</code></a>, the 
compilation database which describes how your code is compiled, where to find includes etc.</p>

<p>You probably want to do this on a per-project basis, so that different projects with different settings don’t interfere with eachother.</p>

<p>In order to do this you need to add configuration for <code>lsp-clients-clangd-args</code> to your project’s <code>.dir-locals.el</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>((c++-mode . ((lsp-clients-clangd-args . ("--compile-commands-dir=build"
                                          "--pch-storage=memory"
                                          "--background-index"
                                          "-j=4"
                                          ))
              )))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you can see that I’ve added a number of configuration arguments for clangd, the most important being <code>--compile-commands-dir</code>, here specified 
as a subdirectory <code>build</code>, which is relative to the source tree’s root dir.</p>

<p>The other options I’ve specified are performance related:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>--pch-storage=&lt;value&gt; - Storing PCHs in memory increases memory usages, but may improve performance
--background-index    - Index project code in the background and persist index on disk.
-j=&lt;uint&gt;             - Number of async workers used by clangd. Background index also uses this many workers.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="dap-mode"><code>dap-mode</code></h2>

<p>In order to communicate with gdb and/or lldb, we need to install the <a href="https://github.com/WebFreak001/code-debug">vscode debug adapter for gdb and lldb</a>.</p>



<h2 id="spacemacs-layers">spacemacs layers</h2>

<p>Now we need to configure the <code>lsp</code>, <code>dap</code> and <code>c-c++</code> layers in our spacemacs config.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
'(
  ....
  (lsp :variables
       lsp-restart 'auto-restart) ; if the server exits, just restart it without prompting
  (dap :variables
       dap-enable-ui-controls nil ; don't display the mouse buttons 
       dap-auto-configure-features '(sessions locals breakpoints expressions tooltip)) ; use the auto-configure layout, but no mouse buttons
  (c-c++ :variables
         c-c++-backend 'lsp-clangd)
  ....
  )
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="debugging-an-app">Debugging an app</h2>

<p>You can add debug configurations for individual apps to your project’s <code>.dir-locals-el</code> file</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>((c++-mode . ((dap-debug-template-configurations . (
                                                    ("my_app"
                                                    :type "gdb"
                                                    :target "/home/user/src/build/app/my_app"
                                                    )
                                                    )))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that added to your <code>.dir-locals.el</code> you can reload your project so that debug-template is added to <code>dap-mode</code>, and then start debugging:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>`SPC d b a`: adds a breakpoint at the current source line
`SPC d d d`: opens a list of debug-templates, select `my_app` and it should start
</code></pre></div></div>


  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I know, I know, by this point you want "Just Ship It" to be an actual person so you could punch it in the face. As an Indie Maker, that sentence can be super frustrating because it's tired, it's cliche, and your response is always "HEY! You don't understand... it's not that easy".  </p>&nbsp;<p>I agree, it's not easy, but it's always the right thing to do. </p>&nbsp;<p>Here's why.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started building an app on 01.01.2018. It was New Year's Eve and we just had the crappiest night ever. Yes, imagine a night <em>so bad</em> that at midnight you decide "you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna work on WEB DEVELOPMENT".<br>That bad.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The MVP was ready in a few days. I'm not that good of a coder, it's just a simple app. The 0.0.1 alpha version was more than ready. I could've released it, share it with a couple of people, and call it a day. I could've done that with every single version that I made, at any point from 2018 until now. I just wanted to add one more thing. One more feature. Just this one more thing and people will like it. One more screen and everything is gonna make sense. I swear, just this one last thing and it's ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>BAM, last moment decision from the world's biggest dumbass:
"People wouldn't use this if it doesn't have a proper native mobile app for it. Time to learn React Native and spend a few months on that 🤦️"   </p>&nbsp;<p>God, if time machines were real, past-Kitze would be shoved in a toilet so hard right now. </p>&nbsp;<p>After 2 years of development, juggling between the fucking horror that's the web platform, React Native, Expo, GraphQL, bitching about how there's no ideal tech stack, the good old jQuery and Filezilla days, switching to other projects, releasing <a href="https://sizzy.co/">other apps</a>, losing passion, finding passion, coming back to the app, etc. etc. etc...  </p>&nbsp;<p>I just dropped it.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was still using it but I stopped developing it and just dropped the idea of releasing the app, ever.</p>&nbsp;<p>After a while, I was using it, but I realized that I'm missing a lot of features, so I'd either have to go back to developing it, or I'd have to find an alternative.   </p>&nbsp;<p>And boy did I find one.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was scrolling their landing page and I was happy and furious at the same time. Someone solved the problem that I was solving. It was like someone literally read my mind and started coding. WHAT.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I have previously sent a video of my app to a couple of people (closest I came to shipping it) so I started getting suspicious if someone actually shared the video of my app with these people because they were solving literally the same problem, and they most of the features that I had.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started getting this overwhelming happy, sad, and panicky feeling. I literally cannot explain how I felt while scrolling their page.</p>&nbsp;<p>One moment I am scrolling their list of features giggling like a little kid with a 48$ bill in a candy store (yea I know 48$ bills don't make sense, but JavaScript doesn't make sense and you're still using it), one moment I want to find these people and THROW THEM IN A PIT OF LIONS.   </p>&nbsp;<p>FUCK.    </p>&nbsp;<p>It's not their fault. I was just slow. I didn't ship on time. I'm gonna go ahead and tattoo "JUST SHIP IT" on my forehead. Nah I wouldn't be able to see it there. On my arm maybe. Nvm, let me go back to scrolling their landing page.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Fuck. They have solved everything that I wanted to solve, and WAY more. Hey, maybe I should be happy? I don't have to code anymore. Yay!? No more web platform? BLISS. Oh crap... the world is never gonna see my app though. But at least I don't have to see React Native anymore. NICE! Wait... BUT I WASTED SO MUCH TIME ON IT. FUCK.  A bunch of mixed feelings.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Here comes the saddest part, so grab a pack of tissues.   </p>&nbsp;<p>After a little bit of hesitation, I made an account. I watched the videos in their help center. Every time I caught myself smiling about a clever way they implemented something I slapped myself. NO. Bad Kitze. You shouldn't like this. THEY'RE COMPETITORS. <em>sigh</em> Sure buddy, whatever you tell yourself. Competitors to a shitty codebase sitting on your hard drive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>For 2 frickin' years, I thought it's too early to release my app because it's clunky, buggy, it's missing features, blah, blah, blah. No one would ever use it, right? I was so wrong.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started using their app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Even though they were working on it for the past few years it's still slow, buggy, and super unpolished, it doesn't matter, because they shipped.   </p>&nbsp;<p>Their mobile app is terrible and it needs 10 seconds to sync. It doesn't matter, they shipped. And I'm looking forward to every single update they release.</p>&nbsp;<p>Their backlog of things to do is huge, but it doesn't matter, they ship every single week, and the app is growing along with the community.  </p>&nbsp;<p>"But Kitze, even though tHeY sHiPpEd no one would pay for something unpolished and broken, right?"  </p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, Indie Hackers. So clever, yet so naive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Today my 30-day trial has expired. A tear rolled down my cheek for every single digit of my credit card that I entered in their app. I am officially not only a subscriber, but also a fan. Every time I'll get a payment notification it's gonna feel like stepping on a lego ... glued to a knife. My bank might as well change the notification from "You have paid 5$ to ThatCompany" to "You never shipped, loser".   </p>&nbsp;<p>My app is officially dead.  </p>&nbsp;<p>99% of you are in the same boat right now, but hopefully just a few weeks into your project. Don't be a dumbass like me. Take a breath, roll your eyes at the cliche saying, but please...  </p>&nbsp;<p>Just Ship It.  </p>&nbsp;<p>P.S I would totally release and show you my app but ... it's not ready yet.  </p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

Their customers are a priority tomorrow. Or next quarter. Or next year. Right now, something else is more important. Internal politics. A logo redesign. A press write up. An internal promotion.

        <p>Metaphors are powerful tools to transfer ideas from one mind to another. Alan Kay introduced the alternative meaning of the term ‘desktop’ at Xerox PARC in 1970. Nowadays everyone - for a glimpse of a second - has to wonder what is actually meant when referring to a desktop. Recently, Deep Learning had the pleasure to welcome a new powerful metaphor: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH).
<!--more-->
But what idea does the Hypothesis try to transmit? In todays post we dive deeper into the hypothesis and review the literature after the original ICLR best paper award by <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a>.</p>

<p>Pruning over-parametrized neural networks has a long tradition in Deep Learning. Most commonly it refers to setting a particular weight to 0 and freezing it for the course of any subsequent training. This can easily be done by element-wise multiplying the weights $W$ with a binary pruning mask $m$. There are several <strong>motivating factors</strong> for performing such a surgical intervention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It supports generalization by regularizing overparametrized functions.</li>
  <li>It reduces the memory constraints during inference time by identifying well-performing smaller networks which can fit in memory.</li>
  <li>It reduces energy costs, computations, storage and latency which can all support deployment on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the recent advent of deeper and deeper networks all 3 factors have been seeing a resurgence in attention. Broadly speaking any competitive pruning algorithm has to address 4 fundamental questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>What connectivity structures to prune?</strong>: <em>Unstructured pruning</em> does not consider any relationships between the pruned weights. <em>Structured pruning</em>, on the other hand, prunes weights in groups, e.g. by removing entire neurons (weight columns), filters or channels of CNNs. Although unstructured pruning often allows to cut down the number of weights more drastically (while maintaining high performance), this does not have to speed up computations on standard hardware. The key here is that dense computations can easily be parallelized while ‘scattered’ computations can’t. Another distinction has to be made between global and local pruning. <em>Local pruning</em> enforces that one prunes $s$ percent of weights from each layer. <em>Global pruning</em>, on the other hand, is unrestricted and simply requires that the total number of weights across the entire network is pruned by $s$ percent.

 </center>
    <center><p>
     <em>Fig. 1: What, How, When and How often to prune?</em>
 </p></center>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How to rank weights to prune?</strong>: There are many more or less heuristic ways to score the importance of a particular weight in a network. A common rule of thumb is that large magnitude weights have more impact on the function fit and should be pruned less. While working well in practice, this intuitively may seem to contradict ideas such as $L_2$-weight regularization which actually punishes large magnitude weights. This motivates more involved techniques which learn pruning masks using gradient-based methods or even higher-order curvature information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How often to prune?</strong>: Weight magnitude is often only a noisy proxy for weight importance. Pruning only a single time at the end of training (<em>one-shot</em>) can become victim to this noise. Iterative procedures, on the other hand, prune only a small number of weights after one training run but reiterate the <em>train - score - prune - rewind</em> cycle. This often times helps to de-noise the overall pruning process. Commonly the pruning rate per iteration is around 20% and a total of 20 to 30 pruning iterations are used (which leaves us with only 1% percent of non-pruned weights). One can be more conservative - at the cost of training for a lot longer!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>When to perform the pruning step?</strong>: One can perform pruning at 3 different stages of network training - after, during and before training. When pruning after the training has converged the performance often decreases, which makes it necessary to retrain/fine-tune and to give the network a chance to readjust. Pruning during training, on the other hand, is often associated with regularization and ideas of dropout/reinforcing distributed representations. Until very recently it was impossible to trained sparse networks from scratch.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="frankle--carbin-2019---the-lottery-ticket-hypothesis-finding-sparse-trainable-neural-networks">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019) - The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks</h2>
<h3 id="paper--code">
<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl-b3RcF7">Paper</a> | <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/open_lth">Code</a>
</h3>

<p>While the traditional literature has been able to show that a fully trained dense network can be pruned to little parameters without degrading performance too much, for a long time it has been impossible to successfully train a sparse sub-network from scratch. So why might this the case? The smaller subnetwork <strong>can</strong> approximate a well performing function. But the learning dynamics appear to be very different compared to the dense network.</p>

<p>The original lottery ticket hypothesis paper <a href="#frankle_2019">(Frankle &amp; Carbin, 2019)</a> first provided insight why this might be the case: After pruning the resulting sub-networks were <strong>randomly initialized</strong>. If one instead re-initializes the weights back to their original (but now masked) weights $m \odot W_0$, it is possible to recover performance on par (or even better!) in potentially fewer training iterations. These high-performing sub-networks can then be thought of as winners of the weight initialization lottery. The hypothesis goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis</strong>: A randomly-initialized, dense neural network contains a subnetwork that is initialised such that — when trained in isolation — it can match the test accuracy of the original network after training for at most the same number of iterations. - Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019, p.2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how can we attempt to find such a winning ticket? <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> propose <strong>iterative magnitude pruning</strong> (IMP): Starting from a dense initialization $W_0$ we train our network until convergence to obtain $W_{T^\star}^{(1)}$. Afterwards, we determine the $s$ percent smallest magnitude weights and create a binary mask $m^{(1)}$ that prunes these. We then retrain the sparsified network with its <strong>previous initial weights</strong> $m^{(1)} \odot W_0$. After convergence we repeat the pruning process (masking additional $s^2$ weights) and reset to the initial weights with the newly found mask $m^{(2)}$. We iterate this process until we reach the desired level of sparsity or the test accuracy drops significantly.</p>

</p></center>

<p>If IMP succeeds it finds the <em>winner of the initialization lottery</em>. This is simply the subnetwork $m^{(n)} \odot W_0$ that remains after this iterative pruning process. Note that it is also possible to simply prune in a one-shot fashion - but better results are obtained when spending that extra compute (see figure 4 of <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a>). If we think back to the broad questions of the pruning literature IMP fits in as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://roberttlange.github.io/images/blog_posts_2020/05_Lottery_Tickets/imp_classification.png" data-lightbox="1"><img src="https://roberttlange.github.io/images/blog_posts_2020/05_Lottery_Tickets/imp_classification.png"></a></p>
<center><p>
    <em>Fig. 3: IMP and the pillars of pruning</em>
</p></center>

<p>Some key empirical insights of the very first LTH paper are summarized in the figure below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Panel A</strong>: Randomly reinitializing &amp; re-training pruned networks leads to deteriorated performance. Results shown are on MNIST with the LeNet architecture.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://roberttlange.github.io/images/blog_posts_2020/05_Lottery_Tickets/lth_1.png" data-lightbox="1"><img src="https://roberttlange.github.io/images/blog_posts_2020/05_Lottery_Tickets/lth_1.png"></a></p>
<center><p>
    <em>Fig. 4: LTH key results. Source: Adapted from <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl-b3RcF7">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a></em>
</p></center>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Panel B</strong>: Without any hyperparameter adjustments IMP is able to find sparse subnetworks that are able to outperform un-pruned dense networks in fewer training iterations (the legend refers to the percentage of pruned weights). The gap in final performance between a lottery winning initialization and a random re-initialization is referred to as the <em>lottery ticket effect</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Panel C</strong> &amp; <strong>Panel D</strong>: In order to scale the original results to more complicated tasks/architectures like CIFAR-10, VGG-19 and Resnet-20, <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> had to adapt the learning rate as well as include a warmup (annealing from 0 to the final rate within a predefined set of iterations) schedule. Note that the required Resnet learning rate is a lot smaller than the VGG-19 learning rate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So what can this tell us? First, IMP can find a substructure that is favourable for the task at hand and that the weight initialization of that subnetwork is <em>special</em> in terms of learning dynamics. Furthermore, over-parametrization is not necessary for successful training - it may only help by providing a combinatorial explosion of available subnetworks. A lot of the interesting follow-up work characterizes potential mechanisms behind the qualitative differences of winning tickets.</p>

<h2 id="frankle-dziugaite-roy--carbin-2019---stabilizing-the-lottery-ticket-hypothesis">Frankle, Dziugaite, Roy, &amp; Carbin (2019) - Stabilizing the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis</h2>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01611">Paper</a> | <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/open_lth">Code</a>
</h3>

<p>One limitation of the original lottery ticket paper was that its restriction to small-scale tasks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. In order to scale the LTH to competitive CIFAR-10 architectures, <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> had to tune learning rate schedules. Without this adjustment it is not possible to obtain a pruned network that is on par with the original dense network <a href="#liu_2018">(Liu, Sun, Zhou, Huang, &amp; Darrell, 2018; Gale, Elsen, &amp; Hooker, 2019)</a>. But what if we loosen up some of the ticket restrictions?</p>

<p>In follow-up work <a href="#frankle_2019b">Frankle, Dziugaite, Roy, &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> asked whether it might be possible to robustly obtain pruned subnetworks by not resetting the weights to their initial values $W_0$ but to weights found after a small number of $k$ training iterations. In other words, <strong>instead of rewinding to iteration 0 after pruning, we rewind to iteration $k$</strong>. Here is the formal definition and a graphical illustration:</p>

He had already experienced imprisonment and violence in his native land of Ireland, before he was exiled to the continent and eventually moved to the United States. His partner Mr Anthon gave the <a href="http://mysite.du.edu/~ttyler/ploughboy/Is%20the%20Whale%20a%20Fish.htm"><span>opening statements</span></a>: “It is fortunate…that this statute is not to be interpreted according to the refined and learned opinions of naturalists…but [is] to receive an interpretation according to their common and popular usage.” </p><p>While scientists quibbled over terms, functions, and definitions, laypeople had the common sense to know: a whale was a fish.</p><p>Sampson and Anthon represented the fish oil inspector James Maurice against a whale oil businessman named Samuel Judd. A recent shipment had arrived of new sperm whale oil. Candlemaker and oil merchant Samuel Judd had purchased three barrels of oil, but inspector Maurice claimed Judd owed fines on the oil in accordance with fish oil law. Since Judd had avoided the inspection, he owed the city a $75 fine. But Judd claimed that whales were not fish, and he did not need to pay the fee. When he still refused to pay, Maurice brought Judd to court.</p><p>As the largest creature of the water, common sense would probably lead most 18th century laypeople to conclude that whales were fish. Whales, dolphins, and fish all share a similar torpedo-like shape, smooth skin, and thick fins. They swim deep under the water and only surface for moments, shooting streams of water into the air. They dive, jump, and leap through the water. They are the kings of the oceans.</p><p>The entire court case hinged on a single question: is a whale a fish? Each side would parade a litany of names in front of the jury. But for the star expert witness, a medical doctor and natural historian named <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000831"><span>Dr Samuel Mitchell</span></a>, the answer was simple: “As a man of science, I can say positively that a whale is no more a fish, than a man; nobody pretends to the contrary now-a-days, but lawyers and politicians.” </p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1538707180091_7305"><div>

When Pliny divided animals into three major categories, terrestrial, aquatic, and insect, he classified animals according to their environment; and the deep oceans held mysterious creatures. He <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D1"><span>wrote</span></a>, “In the seas, spread out as they are far and wide, forming an element at once so delicate and so vivifying, and receiving the generating principles&nbsp;from the regions of the air, as they are ever produced by Nature, many animals are to be found, and indeed, most of those that are of monstrous form.”</p><p>These monsters included the “balenae”, dolphins, and orcas — which breathed with lungs, whereas other fish used gills. Roman polymath Pliny the Elder <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D6"><span>described</span></a> whales as such: “Balænæ have the mouths&nbsp;in the forehead; and hence it is that, as they swim on the surface of the water, they discharge vast showers of water in the air. It is universally agreed, however, that they respire, as do a very few other animals<span> </span>in the sea, which have lungs among the internal viscera; for without lungs it is generally supposed that no animal can breathe.”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1538707180091_13933"><div><p>Despite their habit of respiring air, whales and other large creatures of the sea remained a mysterious fish for ancient writers.</p><p>It was not until the 18th century that scientists began to systematically investigate how to classify the animal kingdom. The shape of the animal came to matter less, and scientists judged categories based on organ interaction and structure. The great taxonomist <a href="http://linnaeus.c18.net/Doc/lbio.php"><span>Carolus Linnaeus</span></a> embarked on this transformation with his publication <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#page/3/mode/1up"><span><em>System of Nature</em></span></a>. “I have submitted with patience to the scoffs of the ignorant and the malicious, who have either contemned the objects, or envied the success, of my laborious pursuits.” </p><p>He first published the method in 1735 and explained that his method required naming. To name something was to investigate its nature. Just as streams lead to rivers and lakes and larger bodies of water, so too did names organise the various parts of the world. He said, “The framer of a systematic arrangement begins his study by the investigation of small details.” To accomplish this process, Linnaeus examined the animal as a machine. The parts of the animal could then be divided into systems, like an engine, where each group was composed of its functioning parts, or in biological nomenclature, the organs. </p><p>And what were these particulars? As Linnaeus visited museums and collections around Sweden, he studied individual specimens and divided animals into six classes: Mammals, Birds, Amphibians, Fishes, Insects, and Worms. Mammals and birds were grouped together since they both had a four-chambered heart and warm blood. Amphibians and fishes were next grouped together since they were cold-blooded and had a heart composed of a single auricle and ventricle. Finally, insects and worms formed the final set, because they had a single auricle and ventricle and were cold-blooded. </p><p>Additional criteria based on functions defined the classes. For instance, mammals gave birth to live young, meaning mammals were viviparous, and the birds gave birth by eggs, making them oviparous. Linnaeus also pointed out that mammals milked their young, walked on four legs, and were mostly covered in fur. </p><p>Whales, however, were not so easily categorised. When Linnaeus introduced this group, he wrote, “All the animals of this order more readily bring to mind the Quadrupeds than the Fish, when we consider their internal structure: lungs, respiration, breasts, feet, appendages, live birth, etc. all indicate as much. We attach them, nevertheless to the Fishes by reason of their habitus, their medium, their swimming, etc. in order not to fall from Charybdis into Scylla.” </p><p>Thus, despite all the anatomical evidence showing that whales ought to be organised with mammals, Linnaeus felt common-sense forced him to class them with fish. </p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1538707180091_17103"><div>

Brisson was also interested in organising the animal kingdom in a systematic method that drew on empirical investigation of animal systems and organs. Working in the backrooms of the <a href="https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Origins_of_Museums.html?id=0LkhAQAAIAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y"><span>18th century French “Cabinets”</span></a>, the forerunners of museum collections, Brisson <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/141376#page/9/mode/1up"><span>examined</span></a> natural history specimens “which have daily set before my eyes the richest collections of nature’s production.”</p><p>Analogy helped Brisson categorise the animals. He thus defined creatures in terms of their relationship to the human body and divided them according to their blood, lungs, ventricles, reproduction, hair or fur, and number of appendages. By subtracting the number of similar analogies to human anatomy, Brisson identified nine classes: quadrupeds, cetaceans, birds, cartilaginous fish, fish, reptiles, crustaceans, insects, and worms.</p><p>Anatomy helped Brisson differentiate between similar animals. For instance, instead of including all marine creatures under the fish class, Brisson distinguished sharks and other cartilaginous fish compared to other fish. He followed the same strategy with whales. “Like the Quadrupeds, Cetaceans have two ventricles in the heart; breath with lungs; couple, give birth to live young, and milk their young,” he wrote. “They also resemble the Quadrupeds by their structure and use of their internal organs.” </p><p>Why then were they not classed with the other mammals? Again, the reason was their environment. “All the animals of this class always live in the water, and they never leave, without risking their lives,” Brisson wrote.</p><p>Museum “cabinets”, however, could only offer so much to natural scientists. Brisson was only able to examine a few cetaceans in the natural history collections. It would not be until 1787 when the whaling industry began to take off that natural history had more direct information on whales. </p><p>Before kerosene and the discovery of petroleum, whale oil lit the world and was the engine of industrialisation. Although a dangerous enterprise, hunting blubbery whales could yield huge profits. </p><p>Natural scientists like John Hunter commissioned other “scientific minds,” to help them collect specimens for dissection and further investigation, for “the animals which inhabit the sea are much less known to us than those found upon the land.” Hunter <a href="http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/77/371"><span>commissioned</span></a> one surgeon on a whale ship to Greenland to bring back a specimen. The surgeon had difficulty, and “the only return I received for this expense was a piece of whale’s skin, with some small animals sticking upon it.” His …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

    <p>I’ve been wanting to do a Show HN for my robotics developer tool <a href="https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2/">Yoga Studio</a> for a while.
But given that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s for programming robots</li>
  <li>you probably don’t have a compatible robot</li>
</ul>

<p>it wasn’t something you could immediately play with.</p>

<p><img src="https://yoga.dev/images/greppy1tlb_300px.jpg" width="150" height="317"></p>

<p>Now, you have <strong>remote access to a robot</strong> you can program with it! The 2-wheeled balancing robot (“Greppy”) is sitting in
our California warehouse ready to run your code. You’ll need to download and build
Yoga Studio to control it – see full instructions below.</p>

<p>When you check out the code, it includes an <code>examples/greppy</code> directory with some code to
make the robot balance and drive around. When you start the app and click “Run Live”, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connects to the robot through a port in our firewall.</li>
  <li>Acquires a lock (only one user at a time. Don’t bogart the robot!)</li>
  <li>Uploads <strong>your code</strong> to the robot (start with the example code, but you can hack it up later.)</li>
  <li>The robot compiles and runs your code</li>
  <li>The robot <strong>streams live traces</strong> of all the sensors and computations done by the code, and also a video from a camera looking at the robot.</li>
  <li>You can <strong>drive the robot</strong> with WASD.</li>
  <li>The bottom pane shows the code running, along with <strong>current values for every expression</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the code pane, numerical parameters are overlaid with gui sliders. <strong>You can drag them around and they’re immediately updated on the robot</strong>.</li>
  <li>When you’re done, hit Escape and it’ll download the high-res traces to your machine.</li>
  <li>While viewing a saved trace, you can adjust parameters and it’ll overlay a counterfactual graph of <strong>what the code would have done</strong> with the new parameters.</li>
  <li>The Yoga language is fully <strong>differentiable WRT its parameters</strong> so you can click on an output variable
 (like motor speed) and it’ll tell you what parameters you should change in which direction to affect it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>This is part of a project to make programming robots faster. My experience is that tuning the parameters of
robot control code takes 10x longer than getting the structure of the code right, so I designed a
language + IDE with a single-minded focus on solving the parameter problem. The language is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Differentiable with respect to its parameters</li>
  <li>Fast (statically typed and compiled)</li>
  <li>Purely functional (no side effects)</li>
  <li>Close enough to C for your editor’s syntax highlighting to work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The compiler extracts anything marked as a parameter into a separate data structure, with a link to the location
in the source code they came from. When the IDE renders the Yoga code, it shows the parameters as sliders.</p>

<p>Here’s what Yoga Studio looks like when controlling Greppy:</p>

<p>Feel free to hack on the code in <a href="https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2/-/tree/master/examples/greppy">examples/greppy</a>. See if you can make the robot do something cool!</p>

<p>Read more in the <a href="https://yoga.dev/yoga/">Reference Manual</a>.</p>



<p>It should work on either Mac or Linux (Recently tested on Catalina and Ubuntu 19.10 &amp; 20.04).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone <span>--recurse-submodules</span> https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2.git
<span>cd </span>yoga2
git config submodule.recurse <span>true
</span>make install.deps <span># On Mac, uses Brew. On Linux, apt-get.</span>
make <span>-j8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now fire up the Greppy example code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bin/yogastudio examples/greppy/main.yoga
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Click “Run live on on robot greppy1”.</p>

<p>It’ll then open up the real-time scope, showing live-scrolling graphs of several variables over time. And the video will show the robot starting to balance.</p>

<p>The greppy example code lets you drive the robot from your keyboard with WASD.</p>

<p>Try going to the <code>balance.yoga</code> file, and adjusting the first 2 parameters in the RHS of the assignment to <code>accel</code>. Those are roughly the P and D parameters of the main balance feedback loop. Start with
small adjustments and work up to large ones! The robot is attached to the ceiling with a rope, so you can’t do too much damage.</p>

<p>Hit Esc to end the live session, and switch to the recorded traces it just captured.</p>

<p>You can scroll back and forth in the recorded traces by scrolling left-right with your mouse. You can add or remove traces from the graph with the checkboxes on the left.</p>

<p>While looking at recorded traces, you can still drag parameters, but now rather than updating on the live robot, they <strong>redo the entire run</strong>, overlaying the counterfactual graphs. That is, it shows what the code would have done with the new parameters given the same inputs from the hardware.</p>

<p>To start another run on the hardware, hit Cmd-L (Ctl-L on Linux).</p>

<p>When you’re happy with the parameters, click “Save params” to write them back to the source code. If you’re following the example, that’ll be in the checked out directory under examples/greppy/</p>

    <p>In the beginning of times, there were centralized version control systems (<code>SVN</code> and <code>Perforce</code> are examples). This means that there is a server somewhere that contains all our code and the history of all the changes. If someone needs to work on that codebase they do a <code>checkout</code> (typically of the main branch) and they will get the newest version of all the files.</p>

<p>If the server looks something like this (Every letter represents a different commit):</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/source-control-server.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/source-control-server.png" alt="Source control server"></a></p>

<p>When a developer checks out <code>main</code>, they will get only the files at <code>D</code>, the commit history exists only in the server.</p>

<p>This has a two main disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is not possible to create local branches. If a developer needs a branch they have to push it to the server</li>
  <li>If the server explodes, all the history is lost</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>Git is a distributed version control system. What this means is that a developer <code>clones</code> a repo before it starts working on it. The developer’s machine will contain not only the files necessary for working, but also the history of all commits. By doing this, we avoid the two problems mentioned above.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-repo">Creating a repo</h2>

<p>If we want to create a new repo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>mkdir </span>new-repo
<span>cd </span>new-repo
git init
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="creating-a-commit">Creating a commit</h2>

<p>Once we are on a repo, the next thing we want to do is create a commit. A commit is an entry in the history of our repo. Let’s start by creating a file:</p>



<p>We can use <code>git status</code> to see the state of our repo, compared to the previous committed state:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span>in </span>what will be committed<span>)</span>

	README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> to track<span>)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The command tells us that we are standing in <code>master</code> and that we have a file that is not yet being tracked.</p>

<p>In git, the commit process has two stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select what we want to include in the commit</li>
  <li>Commit the changes</li>
</ol>

<p>When we select what we want to commit we say we are moving it to the <code>staging</code> area. Let’s do that:</p>



<p>We can see that the status changed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to unstage<span>)</span>

	new file:   README.md
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can now commit the change:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>git commit <span>-m</span> <span>'Added readme file'</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="looking-at-the-history">Looking at the history</h2>

<p>If we want to see the list of commits from where we are standing:</p>



<p>The output looks something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git log
commit 0eba2722139ff6e91baaeb6540d4ce76c5e33d48 <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; master<span>)</span>
Author: User Usernikov &lt;user@userni.kov&gt;
Date:   Thu Jun 25 21:53:16 2020 +1000

    Added readme file
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I personally prefer a more compact view that can be achived with this command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>git log <span>--graph</span> <span>--all</span> <span>--pretty</span><span>=</span>format:<span>'%Cred%h -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%ci) %C(bold blue)&lt;%an (%ae)&gt;'</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>* 0eba272 - (HEAD -&gt; master) Added readme file (2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000) &lt;User Usernikov (user@userni.kov)&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because that’s a very long command, I prefer to create an alias for it. To create an alias:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>git config <span>--global</span> alias.lg <span>"log --graph --all --pretty=format:'%Cred%h -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%ci) %C(bold blue)&lt;%an (%ae)&gt;'"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The command creates a git alias named <code>lg</code>. Now, we can use this command:</p>



<h2 id="branches">Branches</h2>

<p>In the section above, we can see <code>0eba272 - (HEAD -&gt; master)</code> as part of the log ouput. There are a few important pieces of information.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>0eba272</code> - The commit hash. A unique identifier for each commit</li>
  <li><code>HEAD</code> - Represents the commit where we are currently standing</li>
  <li><code>master</code> - Branch name</li>
</ul>

<p>From this information we can say that <code>master</code> is currently located at <code>0eba272</code> and our <code>HEAD</code> is pointing to master. Let’s create a new branch:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git branch first-branch
<span>$ </span>git lg
<span>*</span> 0eba272 - <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; master, first-branch<span>)</span> Added readme file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We created a new branch, but as we can see, <code>HEAD</code> is still pointing to <code>master</code>. Let’s see what happens if we create a commit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Git demo"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> README.md
<span>$ </span>git add README.md
<span>$ </span>git commit <span>-m</span> <span>'Add title to readme'</span>
<span>$ </span>git lg
<span>*</span> 0af5c64 - <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; master<span>)</span> Add title to readme <span>(</span>2020-06-25 22:03:42 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
<span>*</span> 0eba272 - <span>(</span>first-branch<span>)</span> Added readme file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that a new commit was created and both <code>HEAD</code> and <code>master</code> are now in that commit. Our <code>first-branch</code> was left behind. If we want to create a branch and move to it immediately, we can use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git checkout <span>-b</span> second-branch
<span>$ </span>git lg
<span>*</span> 0af5c64 - <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; second-branch, master<span>)</span> Add title to readme <span>(</span>2020-06-25 22:03:42 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
<span>*</span> 0eba272 - <span>(</span>first-branch<span>)</span> Added readme file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time <code>HEAD</code> moved. It’s now pointing to <code>second-branch</code>. To switch branches:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git checkout first-branch
<span>$ </span>git lg
<span>*</span> 0af5c64 - <span>(</span>second-branch, master<span>)</span> Add title to readme <span>(</span>2020-06-25 22:03:42 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
<span>*</span> 0eba272 - <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; first-branch<span>)</span> Added readme file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s se what happens when we create a commit from here:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span><span>touch </span>other.file
<span>$ </span>git add other.file
<span>$ </span>git commit <span>-m</span> <span>'Added other file'</span>
<span>$ </span>git lg
<span>*</span> 07c7128 - <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; first-branch<span>)</span> Added other file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 22:08:23 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>

<span>*</span> 0eba272 - Added readme file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The alias we created to see the history, has the advantage of showing us places where the history branches out. To see a list of all our branches:</p>



<h2 id="remotes">Remotes</h2>

<p>When we create a repo using <code>git init</code>, the repo exists only in the folder where we created it. Usually we want to host our repos in a centralized location so it acts as the source of truth for a team.</p>

<p>One interesting thing about centralized source code locations is that nobody works in that clone directly, it’s just a place for integration. The location where everybody pushes doesn’t have a working directory, it just keeps track of the history of all files. This is referred as a <code>bare</code> repo. We can create a bare repo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span># Assuming we are in `new-repo` folder</span>
<span>cd</span> ..
git clone new-repo main-repo <span>--bare</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This creates a new folder called <code>main-repo</code>, that contains something very similar to <code>new-repo/.git</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to use this new clone as the souce of truth for our repo. We would need to make <code>new-repo</code> aware of it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span># Assuming we are in `new-repo` folder</span>
git remote add origin ../main-repo/
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The main <code>remote</code> for a repo, is usually called <code>origin</code>, which is what we called our remote. We can have multiple remotes, but it’s common to have a single one. To see our remotes and where they are hosted:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git remote <span>-v</span>
origin	../main-repo/ <span>(</span>fetch<span>)</span>
origin	../main-repo/ <span>(</span>push<span>)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we <code>fetch</code> from <code>origin</code>, we will get all remote branches:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git fetch origin
From ../main-repo
 <span>*</span> <span>[</span>new branch]      first-branch  -&gt; origin/first-branch
 <span>*</span> <span>[</span>new branch]      master        -&gt; origin/master
 <span>*</span> <span>[</span>new branch]      second-branch -&gt; origin/second-branch
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can see them when we list all the branches (<code>-a</code> includes remote branches):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git branch <span>-av</span>
<span>*</span> first-branch                 07c7128 Added other file
  master                       0af5c64 Add title to readme
  second-branch                0af5c64 Add title to readme
  remotes/origin/first-branch  07c7128 Added other file
  remotes/origin/master        0af5c64 Add title to readme
  remotes/origin/second-branch 0af5c64 Add title to readme
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s very common to have the <code>master</code> branch track <code>origin/master</code>. What this means is that the local <code>master</code> will by default be pushed to <code>origin/master</code> and changes from <code>origin/master</code> will be integrated into local <code>master</code> when they are pulled. Let’s make our <code>master</code> track <code>origin/master</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git checkout master
Switched to branch <span>'master'</span>

<span>$ </span>git branch <span>-u</span> origin/master
Branch <span>'master'</span> <span>set </span>up to track remote branch <span>'master'</span> from <span>'origin'</span><span>.</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can now commit a change to master and push it to our remote:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we look at the history, we’ll see that both <code>master</code> and <code>origin/master</code> are positioned in the same place:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<h2 id="merging">Merging</h2>

<p>We can see in our history that <code>first-branch</code> is not part of the master branch. To add it to master, we need to merge it.</p>

They also argue that widespread testing, isolating infected people, and a community lockdown effectively stopped the outbreak in its tracks.</p><p>The town of Vò, with a population of nearly 3,200 people, experienced Italy’s first COVID-19 death on 21 February 2020. The town was put into immediate quarantine for 14 days. During this time, researchers tested most of the population for infection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, both at the start of the lockdown (86 percent tested) and after two weeks (72 percent tested).</p><p>The testing revealed that at the start of the lockdown, 2.6 percent of the population (73 people) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while after a couple of weeks only 1.2 percent (29 people) were positive. At both times, around 40 percent of the positive cases showed no symptoms (asymptomatic). The results also show it took on average 9.3 days (range of 8-14 days) for the virus to be cleared from someone’s body.</p><p>None of the children under ten years old in the study tested positive for COVID-19, despite several living with infected family members. This is in contrast to adults living with infected people, who were very likely to test positive.</p><p>As a result of the mass testing any positive cases, symptomatic or not, were quarantined, slowing the spread of the disease and effectively suppressing it in only a few short weeks.</p><p>Co-lead researcher Professor Andrea Crisanti, from the Department of Molecular Medicine of the University of Padua and the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said: “Our research shows that testing of all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, provides a way to manage the spread of disease and prevent outbreaks getting out of hand. Despite ‘silent’ and widespread transmission, the disease can be controlled.”</p><p>The results of the mass testing programme in Vò informed policy in the wider Veneto Region, where all contacts of positive cases were offered testing. “This testing and tracing approach has had a tremendous impact on the course of the epidemic in Veneto compared to other Italian regions, and serves as a model for suppressing transmission and limiting the virus’ substantial public health, economic and societal burden,” added Professor Crisanti.</p><p>As well as identifying the proportion of asymptomatic cases, the team also found that asymptomatic people had a similar 'viral load’ - the total amount of virus a person has inside them - as symptomatic patients.</p><p>Viral load also appeared to decrease in people who had no symptoms to begin with but later developed symptoms, suggesting that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission could contribute significantly to the spread of disease, making testing and isolating even more important in controlling outbreaks.</p><p>Co-lead researcher Dr Ilaria Dorigatti, from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Jameel Institute (J-IDEA), at Imperial College London, said: “The Vò study demonstrates that the early identification of infection clusters and the timely isolation of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infections can suppress transmission and curb an epidemic in its early phase. This is particularly relevant today, given the current risk of new infection clusters and of a second wave of transmission.</p><p>"There are still many open questions about the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as the role of children and the contribution of asymptomatic carriers to transmission. Finding answers to these questions is crucial to identifying targeted and sustainable control strategies to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and around the world.”</p><p>Professor Enrico Lavezzo, from the Department of Molecular Medicine at the University of Padua said: “The result concerning asymptomatic carriers is key. We took a picture of the Vò population and found that about half of the population testing positive had no symptoms at the time of testing and some of them developed symptoms in the following days. This tells us that if we find a certain number of symptomatic people testing positive, we expect the same number of asymptomatic carriers that are much more difficult to identify and isolate.</p><p>"The fact that the viral load is comparable between symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers means even asymptomatic infections have the potential to contribute to transmission, as some of the reconstructed chain of transmission obtained from the detailed contact tracing conducted in Vò confirmed.</p><p>"On the one hand, it is likely that a symptomatic infection transmits large quantities of virus, for example via coughing, but it is also reasonable to think that symptoms may induce a person with a symptomatic infection to stay at home, limiting the number of contacts and hence the transmission potential. On the other hand, someone with an asymptomatic infection is entirely unconscious of carrying the virus and, according to their lifestyle and occupation, could meet a large number of people without modifying their behaviour.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurekalert.org%2Fpub_releases%2F2020-06%2Ficl-wsr063020.php&amp;t=M2M1NjU2MjRkZjIyNmIzNTU0N2JhZTlhY2IxNDY1MzEzODllZDk4MCx2QUpQNjFOdw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F622389960556806144%2Fcovid19-asymptomatic-cases-study&amp;m=0">Imperial College London</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Suppression of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the Italian municipality of Vo’”, <i>Nature</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2488-1&amp;t=YjJhODJjNGNiOTM0ODVhM2FjMTE4MTBhYzAyYmMyYjYxYTNjM2I1MCx2QUpQNjFOdw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F622389960556806144%2Fcovid19-asymptomatic-cases-study&amp;m=0">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2488-1</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/615500611887235072/social-distancing-2022">New study: Social distancing could be needed until 2022</a></p>

<p>(this post originally appeared on <a href="https://medium.com/p/d6445dbb1b09"><strong>Medium</strong></a>)</p>

<p>(discuss on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7370682"><strong>Hacker News</strong></a>)</p>

<h2 id="who-the-f-k-is-joel-clark-jr">Who the f%*k is Joel Clark Jr.?</h2>

<p>_When I was five years old, we moved to Bonita Avenue, a collection of hippies, crazy people, lower class people working hard to move up, and upper class people taking enough drugs to move down.
One day, one of my older brother Jonathan’s friends, Roger, was over at our house. He pointed to an African American kid down the block who was riding in a red wagon and dared me:
“Go down the street, tell him to give you his wagon, and if he says anything, spit in his face and call him a _<strong><em>nigger</em></strong><em>.”</em></p>

<p>_I was terrified of Roger.
I began walking down the block toward the other kid. The distance was thirty yards, but it felt like thirty miles. When I finally got there, I could barely move. I did not know what to say, so I just opened my mouth and started talking:
“Can I ride in your wagon?” is what came out.
_<strong><em>Joel Clark Jr.</em></strong>_ said: “Sure”.
When I turned to see what Roger would do, he was gone. Apparently, his light side had taken over and he’d moved on to something else.
Joel and I went on to play all day that day, and we’ve been best friends ever since. Eighteen years later, he would be _<strong><em>the best man at my wedding</em></strong><em>.</em></p>

<p>(from the book, slightly edited and shortened)</p>

<h2 id="the-ugly-thing">The Ugly Thing</h2>

<p>Who is <a href="https://twitter.com/bhorowitz"><strong>Ben Horowitz</strong></a>?
And what is his book about?
And what’s ugly about it?</p>

<p>The book is called “The Hard Thing About Hard Things”, which I will refer to as <strong>THTAHT</strong>.</p>

<p>I will tell you what’s the “<strong>Ugly thing</strong>” in a minute, but let me make it clear: the book is <strong>excellent</strong>, easily one of the best reads you can hope for. However, if you read it carefully, you will be <strong>very unhappy</strong> afterwards.
Let’s go in order.</p>

<h2 id="ben-horowitz"><strong>Ben Horowitz</strong></h2>

<p>If you are reading this blog post, I assume that you have at least a vague idea of who <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong> is.
He’s a happily married man with three wonderful kids, but most of us are interested in him because he was a technical guy that worked at <strong>Netscape</strong> and went through its spectacular <strong>IPO</strong> and acquisition, and then with Marc Andreessen founded several other ventures. Most notably, he was the CEO of LoudCloud/Opsware for several years, and he’s now the co-founder of the VC firm <strong>Andreessen Horowitz</strong>, also called <a href="http://a16z.com/"><strong>A16Z</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*Pyn047_68az_qQx266OiSA.jpeg" alt="">Ben Horowitz can speak very clearly.Most people that know Ben personally all agree that he’s very direct. When I had the opportunity to watch him present on stage at Startup School 2012, I loved his talk, and I noticed that he wasn’t going around things. Straight to the point.
Most people would also agree that he’s been a legendary CEO, and a great VC in the latest few years.</p>

<p>And you know what? If you want to really know more, Google him. There’s no need for me to add more details here.</p>

<h2 id="the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</h2>

<p>On March 4th, Ben published his book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things (buy it on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062273205/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062273205&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=brunozzi02-20"><strong>Amazon.com</strong></a>, read about it on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/03/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things-ben-horowitzs-honest-and-real-take-on-entrepreneurship/"><strong>TechCrunch</strong></a>), or <strong>THTAHT</strong>.
First of all, 100% of the earnings of the book <a href="http://www.bhorowitz.com/why_i_will_give_100_of_my_book_earnings_to_women_in_the_struggle"><strong>will be donated to charity</strong></a>, and that’s a nice thing.</p>

<h3 id="the-book-wants-to-tell-you-what-the-reality-of-building-a-company-is">The book wants to tell you what the reality of building a company is.</h3>

<p>As you can guess from the title, Ben thinks that building a company is incredibly hard, but he also believes that the most important things, the HARD things, are never shared in management books or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Even if Ben doesn’t, I’d prefer to divide <strong>THTAHT</strong> in three parts.</p>

<p>The <strong>first part</strong> of the book recalls many moments of Ben’s life, either as a kid growing up and getting to know the world, or as a young technical employee at Netscape, and later as a CEO.
The great thing about this first part is its authenticity: I couldn’t stop reading, so much was the connection that he was able to create with me as a reader.</p>

<p>The <strong>second part</strong> is full of specific advice to deal with situations you can encounter in your life as a CEO, and in most cases Ben drags from his past experiences.
There are some recurring names, such as <strong>Bill Campbell</strong>, who Ben never ceases to refer to as an example to follow.
“If you do nothing else, be like Bill Campbell and build a good company.”
What I consider the starting point of this second part is Chapter 4, <strong>“The struggle”</strong>, which refers to the voyage a CEO should go through in order to succeed, and the costant feeling of struggling that never goes away.
This part is a bit boring sometimes, especially if you are not interested in becoming a CEO yourself, but at least all the stories and examples are great lessons.
“People at McDonald’s get trained, but people with complex jobs don’t. It makes no sense.”
The rest is as hard as it can get: firing people, firing co-founders, considering going bankrupt, dealing with profanity, fear and courage, peacetime CEOs and wartime CEOs, smart but bad employees, and so on.
In his view, the most difficult skill that a CEO should have is <strong>to manage your own psychology</strong>.</p>

<p>The short <strong>third part</strong> is specific to Andreessen Horowitz, his VC firm.
Too short for my thirst to know more about it, but great nonetheless.
In essence, Ben and his partner Marc Andreessen, after taking a look at the VC landscape, and realizing that out of 800 VCs, only 6 brought acceptable returns for their investors, decide to fund a new one, based on the following principles:
1) Technical founders are the best CEOs to run the company;
2) A16Z should help them become successful CEOs (skill set, network).
3) Every General Partner should be an effective mentor for the startups they invest in;
4) They offer a large network, comprising large companies, executives and engineers to hire, press analysts, investors and acquirers.</p>

<p>The rest, as they say, is history.
I had the privilege to meet with <strong>Frank Chen</strong>, and more recently with <strong>Chris Dixon </strong>—  both General Partners. I can safely say that A16Z is among the best VC firms that has ever existed, and I’ve never seen such quality, in every detail. Strange to think that 5 years ago it didn’t exist yet.</p>

<p>What can I say? If you want to be an entrepreneur, if you deal with CEOs and similar people all the time, and want to learn what they go through: <strong>BUY the book</strong>. As said, easily one of your best investment of money and time.</p>

<h2 id="the-ugly-thing-1">The Ugly Thing</h2>

<p>What’s this Ugly Thing, then?
Let me tell you.
Forget about what you read every day on TechCrunch.
Forget about the Lean Methodology.
Forget about these pictures of 20-something startuppers who sold their company and made a fortune.
The real life is much, much harder.</p>

<h3 id="i-knew-it-before-but-after-reading-this-book-i-m-scared-at-the-idea-of-starting-my-own-company-again">I knew it before, but after reading this book I’m SCARED at the idea of starting my own company again.</h3>

<p>(I’ve been many things, among which a “serial entrepreneur”, even if I didn’t call myself that, back then — I was simply a young guy who worked extremely hard, and was almost in perennial debt)</p>

<p><strong>This is the Ugly thing.</strong> Despite startups and entrepreneurship are sexy, fact is they aren’t. Ben’s book is a cold shower, but brings us much closer to reality.
I wish that many, many people will read this book.
**Not everybody is born to be an entrepreneur, or can become one. **Better to understand what it takes BEFORE you embark in the journey, rather than being forced to do terrible things when the ship has sailed already.
You might think that this is a sad end, but it’s not. If you take Ben’s story to heart, you can decide what you want to do with your life with much more awareness.
How much is that worth?</p>

<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>

<p>There’s also one more thing that I really loved about the book. Let me paste Ben’s words.</p>

<p>_One very hot day my father came over for a visit. We could not afford air-conditioning, and all three children were crying as my father an I say there sweating in the 105-degree heat.
My father turned to me and said, “Son, do you know what’s cheap?”
Since I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, I replied, “No, what?”
“Flowers. Flowers are really cheap. But do you know what’s expensive?” he asked.
Again, I replied, “No, what?”
He said, “Divorce”.
Something about that joke, which was not really a joke, made me realize that I had run out of time. Up until that point, I had not really made any serious choices. I felt like I had unlimited bandwidth and could do everything in life that I wanted to do simultaneously.
But this joke made it suddenly clear that by continuing on the course I was on, I might lose my family.
_<strong><em>By doing everything, I would fail at the most important thing.</em></strong></p>

<p>I’ve started realizing this same thing only recently, and I like to think that realizing it has saved my life. Thanks, Ben, for reminding me of this. It is too important not to think about it every day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The launch of the Hey email platform was one of the largest application launches in 2020.  It was reported that they had over 150k users signed up, so I thought it would be interesting to see what we could find about the tech stack.  Luckily <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">dhh</a> shared some good information.</p>
<h2>The HEY Stack</h2>
<p>One interesting piece of information was that someone did some investigation and <em>haystack</em> was the codename for the project and <a href="https://basecamp.com/">basecamp</a> had registered <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1231253948415135746">haystack.com</a> also.</p>
<p>It’s no suprise that this is a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> app since dhh is the creator of rails.  They are using <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus</a> as the javascript framework, <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">turbolinks</a> to speed up page loads, <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/trix">trix</a> for the editor and as yet unspecified <strong>NEW MAGIC</strong> on the front end.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> for the database, plus <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a> for DB sharding.  <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> for caching and short lived data. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">ElasticSearch</a> for searching and all on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> running on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.  He doesn’t specify if they are running their own kubernetes cluster or using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">EKS</a></p>

<p>After reading several of his tweets it seems to me that the architecture is really more of a <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-can-become-the-citadel/">Citadel</a>, which is also something he labeled.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.28.51.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>They use <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> for source control and code review, but <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> for issue tracking and documentation.  This is no suprise since the Rails community was an early adopter of github.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.20.52.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>His comments on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">GCP</a> were very interesting, obviously a bad experience but doesn’t give more details around when this happened.</p>

They want to bring things on prem in the future, but was happy to have the cloud scaling during the launch.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.27.13.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>The On-Prem costs he calculates are much smaller than the cloud.  This is a huge point of contention and is debated in many circles, for small companies it may be easy to calculate on-prim costs but for large companies there are so many hidden costs it’s hard to say.</p>

<!-- <hr> -->

<p>
	
	<a href="https://www.opencellid.org/">OpenCelliD</a> is the world's largest 
	open database of cell towers with a license
	<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>
</p>

<p>
	Data has full world coverage and freely available for
	<a href="https://www.opencellid.org/">download.</a>
</p>

<p>
	This tabular data[1] has ~40 million rows and 6 columns in it but only 3
	columns (latitude, longitude, and type) are used in this visualization.
</p>

<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/csv.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/csv.png" alt="">
</a>

<em>[1] Structure of input data.</em></p><p>
	Above table data is read line by line and grouped by their location info.
	Grouping is done as if they were <a href="https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/xyz-tiles-and-slippy-maps/">XYZ Tiles.</a></p>


<p>
	First, empty 2d integer arrays for each tile are created and its elements are 
	initialized with value = 0. 
	Those values hold a counter that shows the number of rows that 
	geographically contained in that pixel.
	Every row increases the relevant counter by one[2]. 
	After iterating all rows with this method, we end up with a bunch of
	integer values (in different 2d arrays) that represent row counts per region.
</p>

<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/step2.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/step2.png" alt="">
</a>
<em>[2] Each row increases relevant counter.</em></p><p>
	In order to achieve city-level resolution for visualization, tiles up to
	zoom level 9 should be generated. 
	<a href="https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/">
	For XYZ tiles, the number of tiles per zoom level is 4^zoom.</a>
	Therefore, for zoom levels between 0 to 9, the number of tiles that should be generated 
	becomes 4^0 + 4^1 + 4^2 + .. + 4^9 which equals to 349525.
	Every tile has 256x256 integer values.
	Even with using 32 bit-sized integer values, 
	one tile occupies 256 * 256 * 32 bit = 256 kilobytes of storage,
	and <b>349525 tiles</b> occupies <b>87 gigabytes of storage</b> which is 
	definitely not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	To solve this size problem every tile blob is compressed independently
	with a modern compression algorithm 
	<a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">brotli</a>.
	Despite being slow to encode, brotli has a fast decoding speed and high compression ratio
	compared to older compression methods like gzip. Additionally, 
	brotli-compressed-data is <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=brotli">
	natively decodable with all modern browsers</a>.
	Since there are no cell towers in oceans or uninhabitable areas, tiles for those regions 
	are full of zero values or very sparse. Due to this high redundancy,
	compression performed extremely well for those regions (256kb compressed to 20~100bytes).
</p>

<p>
    In order to simplify the algorithm, it is described as if there was only one 
    counter value in each pixel, but there are 4 counter values per pixel each
    holding number of row counts for different cell tower types[3]
</p>


<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/step3.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/step3.png" alt="">
</a>
<em>[3] Every pixel stores more than one channels (counter)</em></p><p>
    Even though these tiles are stored like XYZ tiles, they are not 
    valid XYZ tiles.Since these blobs are just brotli-compressed-integer-arrays.
    Visualization requires a blob to image conversion. This conversion is
    done by client side javascript and HTML5 Canvas API.
</p>

<p>
    Underlying map displaying library in this visualization is
    <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">leaflet</a>.
    Kudos to leaflet author(s) for writing such a well documented and extendable
    map library, I was able to write a custom tile layer for leaflet that 
    intercepts the image tile requests made by leaflet and redirects those
    image tile requests to an image generating (client-side) web worker that 
    works like a tile server. Web worker follows a simple algorithm for image generation.

    It reads the row count values pixel by pixel and generates a color for that
    pixel (higher the row count lighter and more opaque the pixel color).
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, this was a fun project for me to work on and I learned a lot 
    about data compression and multi-threading while working on this. 
    By off-loading compute-intensive tasks to web-workers, very impressive visualizations
    can be made even without sacrificing a single FPS drop on UI thread.

<p>Unlike Google Analytics, it's not free. I also get far less data from Fathom.</p>
<p>I happily pay $14/month for less data.</p>
<p>Fathom Analytics is far more simple. I don't get distracted by going down rabbit holes looking for "insights" or vanity metrics. I also don't invade my readers' privacy with cross-site tracking or cookies.</p>
<p>The interface itself can be understood in a single glance. Once I look at my metrics, I move on with my day to create more content. Knowing where my users came from and how long they stayed is more than enough data to understand my audience. </p>
<p>Data overload isn't valuable. It's overwhelming and distracting.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple interface</li>
<li>Beautiful design</li>
<li>Easy to setup</li>
<li>Simple goal tracking</li>
<li>Privacy focused</li>
<li>No cookie popups required</li>
<li>Multiple sites on one account/subscription</li>
<li><a href="https://usefathom.com/blog/google-analytics-seo">Doesn't mess with SEO</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paid</li>
<li>Not enough data for larger organizations with complex ad campaigns</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  Years ago, a colleague of mine read an article on Google's bitpacking algorithm for storing indexes and an idea was
  born to create a standalone text index and search solution (similar to Apache Lucene). This idea was brought to life
  in a C++ application called <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/zsearch">Zsearch</a>. In hindsight it was a little
  bit ahead of its time as a few years later we saw the emergence of a more powerful Elasticsearch that did all that
  Zsearch could do + a lot more. Anyways, this is a story of how we hunted down a memory leak in our application.
</p>

<div>

    <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
  </a></p><p>
    Can you find the leak?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The idea behind Zsearch was to see how big of an index we could fit into ram with the data being stored in a key/value
  database, which in our implementation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB">leveldb</a>. Since RAM was a
  precious commodity back in the day, we really wanted to find the right balance between keeping all of our data
  structures in RAM vs. leveldb. During our initial load testing on a linux box, we found a linear memory growth and
  therefore suspected a memory leak. We then tried to find a memory leak using the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>running a load test in a function and calling the function multiple times to test memory usage</li>
  <li>logging in destructors to check whether objects were being deallocated</li>
  <li>debugging the application using valgrind</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unfortunately for us, there were no memory leaks detected and eventually when testing on a mac, we found that memory
  stabilized at the expected peak. We therefore concluded that it was just the linux memory allocator that was acting
  weird. In reality, the memory allocator was doing what it was supposed to do but it did give us a good lead regarding
  how some of the C++ standard library was implemented. It turns out that one of our threads was making copies of an stl
  Map, which is ridiculously inefficient and something that we ended up reworking to keep our memory consumption on
  point :).

                    <blockquote>This is the adapted transcript of the talk I gave to my cat because all conferences had been cancelled, and my internet was too slow for online events.</blockquote><p>How urgent is it to fix bugs?</p><p>The question may sound ridiculous, but the answer isn't straightforward. Well, it depends on a bug, isn't it?</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/06/Is_the_bug_already_in_production_--1---1-.jpg"></figure><p>When it's not released yet, prioritisation is simple: we have to fix it before the release. Of course, there may be some exceptions, but it sounds like a reasonable rule for most of the situations. <br>What's about bugs which are already in production? What does worth fixing?</p><h2 id="it-s-all-about-impact">It's all about impact</h2><p>Do you need to fix a leaking tap on the kitchen?</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/06/image-1.png"><figcaption>Not everybody is annoyed by leaking taps [<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/LDiHT7CJyNU">source</a>]</figcaption></figure><p>Usually, it depends on how lazy you are, but I'll make the decision a little bit easier by giving you more data:</p><ul><li>Your partner likes to study there, and the sound of dripping water makes it hard to concentrate</li><li>The water bill was $40 higher this month</li><li>Last time you left some mugs in the sink, and they blocked the drain — you were just lucky to notice it and prevent the flood</li></ul><p>I think this information will help you make the right decision without hesitation.</p><p><strong>Same with bugs.</strong></p><p>As soon as you know the impact, prioritisation becomes much easier.</p><h2 id="four-streams-of-defects">Four streams of defects</h2><p>To prioritise effectively, you need to answer many questions:</p><ul><li>How many clients are affected?</li><li>Which piece of functionality does work incorrectly?</li><li>Are there other bugs we need to prioritise?</li><li>When did it start happening?</li><li>and so on</li></ul><p>The way organisations deal with those questions depends on how they detect bugs. There are four big channels you can use to discover defects in your systems:</p><ol><li>Customer feedback</li><li>Error reports</li><li>Exploratory testing</li><li>Stats anomalies</li></ol><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/06/image-2.png"></figure><p>Most of the time, companies rely on only one or a couple of channels and neglect the rest – I'll show the consequences of this approach later. For now, let's talk about each of the four streams of defects and how we can make the most of it.</p><h3 id="customer-feedback">Customer feedback</h3><p>That's a simple and the most ubiquitous way of finding bugs – to delegate it to your clients. They don't like something, and they complain – you just have to listen to it and schedule the work.</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/06/image-3.png"><figcaption>Some unhappy people [<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/cUhssb9roaU">source</a>]</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, a lot of companies stop there and use only this channel.</p><p>There is <strong>what it may lead to</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Not all features are covered.</strong> <br>Your clients aren't going to complain if you stop showing ads by mistake. They won't notice if you break behavioural tracking either, which is the same for all non-customer-facing features of your product.</li><li><strong>Number of complains as a prioritisation factor. </strong><br>Some clients naturally report more issues than others, but does it make their reports more important? What about the people who gave up and stopped using your product?</li><li><strong>Technical support becomes a bottleneck. </strong><br>Triaging incoming requests is tedious work that requires time and coordination. If all you have is plain text messages from users – it's going to be hard. Just be prepared.</li><li><strong>Hard to reason when it started happening. </strong><br>The fact that the bug is reported today doesn't mean it's a recent one – it may have been there for years until it bothered this particular user.</li></ol><p><strong>How to use this channel effectively:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Make sure clients can always send their feedback.</strong><br>Offer multiple ways to reach out to you, especially, if you use third-party widgets for collecting feedback (such as <a href="https://www.userback.io/">Userback</a>). Advertise your twitter account, email-support, anything that can be a backup communication channel.</li><li><strong>Allow users to send you attachments. </strong><br>Don't expect clients to send you proper bug reports using internal jargon. You may know that "☑️" is called <em>a <u>checkbox</u></em>, but for them, it's going to be <em><u>that thing</u> </em>or <em><u>that thing that doesn't work</u></em>. Allow users to send you screenshots, gifs and videos in any format – it'll save lots of time for both sides.</li><li><strong>Collect as much metadata as possible. </strong><br>Operating system version, browser type, screen resolution, locale, local time – everything that can help you reproduce the problem and is allowed by your privacy policy. This becomes even more important when clients report accessibility issues – they may have a non-trivial setup, but that doesn't make these errors any less important.</li></ol><h3 id="error-reports">Error reports</h3><p>Time for the next channel – error reports. You detect an exception in your code and report it to <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry</a> or something similar.</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/06/image-4.png"><figcaption>780 users are affected [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp2U0E3dpO4">source</a>]</figcaption></figure><p>It compliments client feedback by addressing its shortcomings:</p><ol><li>You have data for all features regardless of how important they are for users</li><li>You can see the overall impact based on the number of exceptions, not the number of complaints</li><li>These questions can be combined together to simplify technical support</li><li>Some of the errors would correlate with releases and could be mitigated by rolling them back</li></ol><p>As it may look like a perfect solution, <strong>it still has some downsides</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Not every bug causes an exception.</strong><br>Misaligned elements on your webpage may block important pieces of your workflow, but probably won't trigger an exception</li><li><strong>Number of exceptions as a prioritisation factor.</strong><br>Errors aren't equal, therefore prioritising bugs by a number of exceptions has the same issues as relying on the number of complaints.</li><li><strong>Hard to reproduce.</strong><br>Having an exact stack trace doesn't mean that it's going to be easy to fix, especially when an exception isn't originated in your business logic. Mysterious <code>cannot read property 'data' of undefined</code> can appear out of nowhere and frighten all the stakeholders by how many of them you receive</li></ol><p><strong>How to use this channel effectively:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Make sure you can easily locate all the recent changes. </strong><br>It's important to react quickly when you start receiving a new type of reports. Usually, it means that you've recently released a bug — but when and where? The more moving parts you have, the more important it is to journal all the changes and be able to correlate them with first occurrences of a new type of exception</li><li><strong>Setup SLAs for dealing with reports. </strong><br>Data is useless if nobody looks at it proactively. Setup the procedures for categorising new errors so you won't miss anything important</li><li><strong>Invest in traceability. </strong><br>Where this incorrect request came from? How come the system reached this state? The more subsystems are involved in use cases, the harder it may be to answer those questions if your code isn't instrumented properly.</li></ol><h3 id="exploratory-testing">Exploratory testing</h3><p>Does your company have people who continuously work to break your systems?</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/06/image-5.png"><figcaption>These folks are testing something, not sure what exactly [<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/Ek8oxbjnJtQ">source</a>]</figcaption></figure><p>I won't be surprised if it doesn't. Unfortunately, many businesses cut costs on manual testing as they see it outmoded and redundant. Such a view is gaining popularity because manual testing is often perceived as repetitive execution of pre-defined scenarios. This type of work indeed has to be automated.</p><p>Exploratory testing, in contrary, is a process of breaking the system without predefined scenarios to find situations that developers didn't think about. When organised properly, it can cover the blind spots of <em>Customer feedback</em> and <em>Error reports</em>:</p><ol><li><strong>Testers can find bugs in all types of features, even if they don't generate exceptions. </strong><br>If the banners on your website aren't visible because of wrong CSS-styles, testers will catch it</li><li><strong>Testers can find reproduction steps for mysterious exceptions. </strong><br>If you vaguely know where the exception comes from, your QA team will stress-test that piece of the system in order to cause the same crash and find a way to do it reliably</li><li><strong>Testers can test new features before you enable real clients. </strong><br>The biggest downside of other streams of defect is that they only catch bugs which are already impacting clients. Regardless of how good your auto-tests are, there are still use-cases the engineers haven't thought of. QA-engineers with the right tooling and good experience can make new releases smoother</li></ol><p><strong>How to use this channel effectively:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Invest in tools for testing. </strong><br>Do your QA engineers have different environments for testing or they use the same setup for everything? Try to provide them with all the right tools: virtual machines, mobile devices, accessibility software</li><li><strong>Automate as much as possible. </strong><br>Obviously, it's a huge waste if smart testers have to manually do something that can be done by machine. If they need to perform the same actions every test cycle — automate it</li><li><strong>Make sure they know how your system should behave.</strong> <br>In other words, document your features. Many teams rely on common sense and expect that testers will a bug when they see it. Unfortunately, it's not always the case: if a tester asks colleagues if something is a bug — it's a sign of unclear behaviour that should be documented.</li><li><strong>Involve testers in prioritisation.</strong> <br>QA engineers should not only find a bug and create a ticket — they should have all the information to assess the damage and suggest a priority. Make sure they can detect if something is a new regression, know the relative impact of different features and have all the necessary information about past and planned releases.</li></ol><h3 id="stats-anomalies">Stats anomalies</h3><p>Do you collect statistics? Page views, registrations, orders, clicks on advertisement? If yes, this channel can be the most important one for your business because it shows how bugs affect your key metrics.</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/06/image-6.png"><figcaption>Something doesn't feel right looking at this stats... [<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/JKUTrJ4vK00">source</a>]</figcaption></figure><p>You released a new version and number of registrations suddenly fell by 15% — having this data makes prioritisation much more straightforward.</p><p>Although, it may sound like a panacea, using only this channel can be not enough because:</p><ol><li><strong>Anomalies don't necessarily correlate with your releases.</strong><br>There are many factor which can affect your system, and you may need to dig deeper to understand how to fix it.</li><li><strong>Stats may be impacted by various factors, not only bugs. </strong><br>Anomalies can be caused by genuine reasons: weather, public holidays, major events — not all of them are bad, even if your metrics go down.</li><li><strong>Changes aren't always rapid. </strong><br>It's simple when you update business logic that lives on the …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

I recently came across Andrew Kensler's fascinating <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/">Business Card Raytracer</a>. His code, in just 1337 bytes, generates a full raytraced image complete with depth of field, reflections, a sky gradient, and a textured floor. In a similar vein, I set out to create a full neural network that could fit on the back of a business card. The code below is the result, creating a 3-layer fully-connected neural network with leaky-relu activations and training it to generate a small image of my name.

You can view the output here by clicking the play button. (I hate to admit it's not actually running the code in the browser :P, but you'll see the same or similar output if you run the code yourself).
</p>



<p>
The code is only 878 characters, and (as mentioned previously) creates and trains a small neural network. I'm sure it's possible to make it shorter still, but I was happy enough to get this far! I think making it any shorter would make it impossible to reason about, now at least new layers can be added or removed easily and the forward/back propagation is pretty neat! (I'm not biased I swear).
</p>

<p>
Here's a small breakdown of how it works.

Define simple imports and typedefs. The two floats define constants used for the 'leak' of leaky relu, (I.e. the \(K\) in \(f(x) = max(Kx, x)\)), and the learning rate.

Start of the layer struct <code>L</code>. The constructor takes the input and output sizes, and initializes a weights matrix in an approximation of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-in-neural-networks-a-journey-from-the-basics-to-kaiming-954fb9b47c79">Xavier Initilization</a>. Ideally, the random variable would be normally distributed, but linearly seems to work decently too!

Two functions for the layer struct. <code>F</code> performs forward propagation, taking the input vector and returning the output. Some values are cached for later. <code>B</code> performs backward propagation, taking the derivative of the output, updating the weights matrix, and returning the derivative of the input. Both are using leaky relu.

Start of main, create a 3 layer network. The network takes 40 values for input, and has two hidden layers with 50 nodes each, and returns single value at the end. The input is based on the x,y coordinate currently predicted, and the output is a single value for whether this pixel should be a space or '#'. At the end we open the training loop, which runs for 500336 iterations, which is a multiple of the output size; 243.

From the output of the network, <code>y</code>, calculate \(\frac{dE}{dy}\). We use mean squared error, so the derivative is just \(2(y-\hat{y})\), where \(\hat{y}\) is the target value and is encoded in a string. When written with non-ascii characters this is a lot shorter.

Output: Choose different chars based on how high/low the value predicted is. Then print special characters if we're at the end of a line (<code>i%27==0</code>) or we've done a full epoch (<code>i%243==0</code>). Finally, when we're finished, <code>i==0</code> and we print the end text.

Thanks for reading! I'd love to hear suggestions on how to make it shorter, or any other ideas.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>We started Repl.it to break down what we thought of as needless barriers to start coding. Naturally, our first product was the repl -- a simple editor and console for evaluating code. Turns out that’s all our users needed to learn enough coding to make meaningful programs. From there, Repl.it started to grow incredibly fast among students, developers, and educators. As we watched what our most active users did with the platform, a pattern emerged around coding in the classroom: teachers would prepare a doc or a PDF with instructions and a base repl for their students to fork. Students then would open the PDF side-by-side with the repl and start coding. When finished, they would copy the link and email it back to their teachers. Finally, teachers would block off an afternoon to evaluate and give feedback on their students’ code. The process, while better than using a local IDE and passing around files, seemed tedious and we wanted to solve it -- that’s how <a href="https://repl.it/classroom">Repl.it Classroom</a> emerged.</p>
<p>Repl.it Classroom digitized and streamlined the workflow teachers already had in the classroom. However, although teachers loved the experience and Classroom began to grow a slight tension emerged: Classroom used a custom environment which was hard to evolve in tandem with the repl environment. Right now repls are so far ahead in terms of IDE and runtime features that it makes more sense to consolidate and build our education platform on top of repls. Especially with the introduction of Multiplayer, we’ve seen teachers use both -- Classroom for small assignments and repls for projects. This works okay but the experience feels disjointed and hard to manage. That’s why today we’re excited to introduce Repl.it Teams, specifically Repl.it Teams for education which is jam-packed with features that will make teaching and collaborating on Repl.it nothing short of a seamless and amazing experience. </p>
<p><em>We believe that by propelling coding out of the old world of IDE setup and emailing code files, Repl.it Teams will be seen as the most significant innovation in CS and programming education.</em></p>
<p>In this post, we’ll go over what upgrading to Teams for education will get you, some details on pricing, and release timeline and roadmap.</p>
<h2 id="multiplayer-by-default">Multiplayer by default</h2>
<p>Multiplayer is the fastest growing feature on Replit. Teachers and students who already use Google Docs will instantly see how game-changing this is for coding. Especially now, with the rise of distance learning, it’s more important than ever to have a real-time collaboration system. </p>
<p>Where this gets really interesting with Teams is that repls created in the team are multiplayer by default, which means teachers can “drop-in” into the student repl and see what student(s) are working on and provide direction in real-time. Imagine teachers walking around the class looking at students coding and providing feedback behind their shoulders, but all virtually. We even took it a step further so that teachers have access to their students’ entire codebase and have the ability to run their code or fork it if they need to.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.repl.it/assets/typing.gif" alt="multiplayer"></p>
<p>Upgrading to Teams will give you a sense of presence over your classroom and will make collaboration a breeze. </p>

<p>Right now in Classroom assignments are a flat list which gives very little in the way of organizing your course into units. With Teams, you’ll be able to create as many folders in your shared Team as you need to. You can also easily create your own private folders and repls and move repls into the shared team folder as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/folders.png" alt="folders"></p>
<h2 id="conversations-around-code">Conversations around code</h2>
<p>One of the coolest things that Repl.it classrooms introduced to the teacher workflow is the assignment-submission workflow along with the notifications you get when your students submit an assignment. </p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So glad I made the jump to <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> for Higher computing. Young folk seem engaged, and I'm getting far too excited every time an assignment notification comes in 😄</p>— Fraser McKay (@mrmckaycomp) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmckaycomp/status/1271426729358381057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>We’re looking to go even further with Teams. We want to build a new way to have conversations around code. Comments on code should not be disembodied (like they are in the classroom). They should be contextual, and you should be able to easily mention your student, TA, or collaborator. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/mention.png" alt="mentions"></p>
<p>This is still in early development, but once it lands, upgrading to Team will give you the ability to give contextual feedback on code. </p>
<h2 id="code-centered-discussion-boards">Code-centered discussion boards</h2>
<p><a href="https://repl.it/talk">Repl Talk</a>, our code-centered forum, started out when we noticed our users wanted to help each other by answering questions, sharing programs, and finding mentors and collaborators. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/qa.png" alt="qa"></p>
<p>Teams will ship with its own discussion board instance private for you and your students for Q&amp;A, sharing, and discussion. </p>
<h2 id="expanded-language-support">Expanded language support</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that Classroom includes only a subset of the <a href="https://repl.it/languages">languages</a> that we support, and that’s because it takes a lot of effort to integrate a language into a bespoke environment. However, the Repl.it IDE is generic enough that languages are much easier to add. And even if we don’t support your favorite language, you’ll likely be able to get it working on our base bash repl--many of our users have done before. </p>
<p>Additionally, the repl text editor is based on VSCode’s Monaco which ships a lot of useful editing shortcuts, better syntax highlighting support, and, for some selection of languages, advanced <a href="https://blog.repl.it/intel">code intellisense</a>. </p>
<p>On top of that, you'll get access to the ever-increasing selection of <a href="https://repl.it/templates">starter templates</a> -- from frameworks like Rails and Django to personal blogs and bots.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.repl.it/assets/templates.png" alt="languages"></p>
<p>In short, upgrading to Repl.it Teams will net you a 2x+ increase in language &amp; template selection and a much smoother editing experience.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-support">Mobile support</h2>
<p>When the pandemic hit and students around the world were forced to stay in and learn from home, we were saddened to hear that many students lost access to desktop computers. Luckily they had access to smartphones, and while mobile support wasn’t the best on Repl.it we worked really hard to improve it. It’s now so easy to code from your phone that you can code and spin up a website all from your phone’s web browser. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.repl.it/mobile"><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/mobile/preview.png" alt="mobile"></a></p>
<p>This is only the start. We’ll continue to invest in mobile coding because making programming more accessible is a core part of our mission. Upgrading to Teams will allow your students to code on the go, and, for those less fortunate who don’t have a computer at home, they will be able to continue learning uninterrupted.</p>
<h2 id="native-graphics">Native Graphics</h2>
<p>As coding moves to the cloud, we risk losing some of what makes programming special. As much as we like web programming, it’s not always the easiest to teach or learn. Graphics and game frameworks like <a href="https://repl.it/languages/pygame">PyGame</a> or <a href="https://repl.it/languages/love2d">LOVE2D</a> make making games a joy. That’s why Repl.it not only supports popular game frameworks but also anything that would want to render to native graphics drivers like Python’s <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/python-plots">matplotlib</a>.</p>

<p>Once you upgrade to Teams we bet it would be a lot of fun to build games with your students, teach them plotting, and overall engage in some of the most fun aspects of programming.</p>
<h2 id="team-profile">Team profile</h2>
<p>It's always cool to show off that you belong to one team or another, that's why you'll get to have a Team Profile complete with an avatar and "pinned" repls. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/profile.png" alt="qa"></p>
<p>Teachers and students under the team will also get a nice profile icon that shows affiliation with the team!</p>
<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
<p>GitHub being the world’s largest code repository hosting, we made it so that you can bring in any repo, configure it, and run it in under a minute without leaving your browser.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2fZ_B6juNc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p> Not only does Repl.it integrates with Github very well, but we also partnered with the fine folks at GitHub education to make learning to code a breeze with Repl.it + GitHub Classroom. Read more <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-26-code-in-the-browser-with-github-classroom/">about it here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/github-classroom/demo.gif" alt="GitHub Integration with Repl.it"></p>
<p>In addition to code-hosting, <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a> provides auto-grading functionality (similar to Repl.it Classroom) and makes it easy to manage your classroom and assignments.</p>

<p>So now that we’ve walked you through some of the benefits of Teams, let’s talk about what this means for the Classroom product. <strong>First, if you currently depend on the Classroom, don’t worry, we’d never take it away or deprecate before a) giving you ample time to move off, and b) making it easy to upgrade to Teams</strong>. We are, though, building Teams to be a superior experience and a superset of what Classroom currently provides.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Repl.it, or about to introduce it for the first time to your classroom then we suggest you start out with the Teams product, and where it’s lacking -- the biggest thing would be auto-grading and learning management -- supplement it with a combination of <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a>, or your own LMS like Google Classroom. </p>

<p>It’s our goal to get Repl.it into the hands of every code learner in the world. We really believe there’s not a better tool for teaching or learning to code. </p>
<p>First, if you currently depend on the Classroom, don’t worry, we’ll never take it away or deprecate it before a) giving you ample time to move off, and b) making it easy to upgrade to Teams. So if you're an existing Repl.it Classroom subscriber (free or paid), this doesn't change anything for you. Any new customers will have to subscribe to teams in order to get access to Classroom.</p>
<p>So that all said, in order to make it easy and so you don’t have to worry about how many students will be in your class from semester to semester, we’ve simplified our pricing for educational institutions with an affordable flat rate. And it's cheaper!</p>
<p><strong>Pricing tiers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single-classroom teachers (up to 50 students): <strong>$20/month</strong></li>
<li>College professors (up to 250 students): <strong>$50/month</strong></li>
<li>Schools and departments (unlimited students): <strong>$100/month</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And if you’re used to having to get annual budget approval or pausing your edtech subscriptions over the summer, we’ll give you two months off for an annual plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>50 students: <del>$240</del> <strong>$200/year</strong></li>
<li>250 students: <del>$600</del> <strong>$500/year</strong></li>
<li>Unlimited: <del>$1,200</del> <strong>$1,000/year</strong></li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I'm loath to fall into the C# vs F# discussion, but I had an interesting discussion recently with several experienced .NET developers who have been exploring some of the new features in C#8 (and now version 9!) many of which fall into the domain of functional programming in some way - although just like when LINQ first came out, this is not always obvious at first glance (see <a href="https://www.danclarke.com/2020-more-succinct-csharp">here</a> for the excellent original post by Dan Clarke that started the discussion).</p>
<p>Part of the discussion centered around something I am often asked about, which is if I'm somehow concerned that C#'s growing feature set will "overtake" F# and render it useless. I'm really not worred about that happening, and I promised to document the reasons why. So this is the first post in a short series that hopefully answer that question; as you might expect, the answer is not a simple one-liner and has got me thinking about many of the reasons why I think that this is.</p>
<p>This post starts the series by looking at the basic premise of whether by adding features that are similar to those in F#, C# can effectively <em>replace</em> F# - and gives six reasons why this really isn't likely to achieve a satisfactory result.</p>
<h2>1. Every new feature must work with <em>every existing feature</em></h2>
<p>Every feature that is added to a language has to co-exist with the rest of them harmoniously; it's not simply a case of throwing random new features and seeing which ones stick, but a case of adding them in such a way that they "plug in" to the existing patchwork of features already laid out. Think of it as a <em>recipe for a meal</em> rather than <em>a menu at a restaurant</em>. You can't pick and choose which features you want in the language on any given day.</p>
<p>And just like all the ingredients in a recipe have to blend together properly (and some ingredients simply don't go well together), sometimes language features directly work <em>against</em> other features - making it sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to bring in a new feature. This is especially true here as one of the core principles of .NET languages is to as rarely as possible introduce breaking changes.</p>
<p>This might mean that features may sometimes be added, but only in a limited sense - leaving you with a feeling that a feature isn't that powerful, when in reality, it is limited <em>by necessity</em>. Here are three simple examples of this. You might not even be aware that these features are (currently) somehow limited in comparison to other languages!</p>
<h3>Type inference</h3>
<p>Type inference is a powerful and useful feature, but in C# it is limited in comparison to other languages. This is not because C# is "bad", but simply because other features such as method overloading and implicit conversions actively hamper what you can do with type inference.</p>
<h3>Nullability</h3>
<p>C#8 has done some excellent work to introduce nullability checking - I can only imagine how difficult it has been to add this in. But there are limitations to what can be achieved:</p>
<ol>
<li>For starters, it's an optional feature (understandable - otherwise, this would be a breaking change).</li>
<li>It's been added using features such as branch and flow analysis as opposed to a genuine participant in the type system. One of the effects of this that it is (as I understand it) a "best endeavours" approach, rather than something that can be provably correct through the type system.</li>
<li>It's a complicated feature, not only for the C# to implement but, importantly, for developers to <em>reason about</em>. This is, again, in part due to the fact that nullability has been added in version 8 of C#, and not at version 1. There's flow analysis, attributes to help guide the compiler, new operators such as <code>!!</code> - all of these contribute to what I believe could make it challenging for developers to understand <em>why</em> a decision has been by the compiler as to why something is nullable or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>The F# approach to nullability is quite different, using a simple type to indicate optionality - there's no "special" language support or custom operators. One of the benefits of this means it's much less effort to learn how to use it, since it uses standard F# types such as unions.</p>
<h3>Switch expressions</h3>
<p>Switch expressions are a nice addition to C#. However, using classes, they are somewhat limited - for example, you cannot exhaustively switch across all combinations (giving you the confidence that you've dealt with all conditions). This might well be possible in the future with the addition of <em>another</em> feature known as case classes or union types.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The C#9 roadmap <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/welcome-to-c-9-0/">has now been published</a>; discriminated unions have now been pushed back to C#10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider type inference above - in C#, it's a feature of relatively limited value. In F#, it supports many refactoring patterns and figures in a much more fundamental way that we write code. If you've never <em>used</em> a language like F# though, this might never occur to you and you'll be left thinking that type inference is simply "var for the left hand side of assignment".</p>
<h2>2. Less is sometimes more</h2>
<p>We generally think of features in a language as simply additive, but it's more complex than that; we often don't think about the benefits of <em>not</em> having a given feature! Some features we often think are essential for software development but in reality, they're not; the benefits of <em>not</em> having a feature in a language is sometimes difficult to spot.</p>
<p>It's beyond the scope of this post to provide all the details, but it's something I'll be covering in the next post in this series. For now just understand that although F# provides very good interop to C#, there are a number of features which are either more challenging to use from, or are simply not available in, F# - and removing these features has not only simplified the way we write code, but has also enabled <em>other</em> features to be strengthed.</p>
<h2>3. Consider the teams you'll be working on</h2>
<p>If you <em>truly</em> embrace functional programming in C#, consider the rest of your team and how you'll be writing code alongside them. I can speak from personal experience in this regard - you run the risk of writing code that the rest of your team see as completely atypical, and may find difficult to understand. In effect, you could be developing code that has a completely different style to the rest of the codebase, despite the fact that it's written in the same language - and you may be the only person on the team that can maintain it.</p>
<p>This is often one of the reasons I hear people that want to benefit from FP saying when they use C# in their teams - unfortunately, simply using C# syntax but writing code in a fully FP style will simply mean that the majority of C# developers will not appreciate the code style you adopt - and will potentially be left with the feeling that FP is simply a bad idea.</p>
<h2>4. There is no such thing as a free lunch</h2>
<p>C# is a great language; however, it would be foolhardy to say that it can do <em>everything</em> perfectly. Writing code in a functional style in C# is a bit like driving a Ferrari through the jungle - it's simply not what it was designed to do. Conversely, on the Autobahn where there are no speed limits, it shines. The further you go into the world of FP in C#, the more and more keywords you need (adding complexity throughout) to achieve the same things that F# achieves <em>for free</em>. This is not about saying that F# is intrisincally <em>better</em> than C#, but where the underlying strengths of both languages sit - and importantly, which style better suits how you like to model solutions.</p>
<p>Don't fool yourself into thinking that by adopting higher order functions and using switch expressions that you're now "doing" FP - you're only scratching the surface, and the cost that C# imposes upon you the more you "push against" the natural tendencies of the language, the more you will end up with a negative impression of FP. I say the same thing to F# developers when they try and write imperative code using mutable objects, inheritance and so on - it's not what the language was designed to do. Listen to the language.</p>
<p>The simple truth is that there is no short cut to getting the full benefits of functional programming, which on .NET is served through F#. There is no magic keyword that can negate the real benefits F# provides by offering features such as expressions and immutability as first-class features that are pervasive <em>throughout</em> the language and libraries.</p>
<h2>5. Language defaults are important</h2>
<p>When I used to advocate using F#, I could easily point to features in the language that C# didn't have and illustrate some of the ease-of-use. For example, tuples, records, pattern matching, discriminated unions etc.. Today, things are a little different - C# contains (or will soon contain) variants of all of those features. I think that it's not especially worth talking about <em>the set of features</em> of either language, but instead focusing on <em>defaults and fundamentals</em> instead.</p>
<p>There are some fundamentals at play in a language that often simply <em>can't</em> easily be changed. This point is really about acknowledging that, and understanding and appreciating that these defaults have far-reaching consequences. If you want to gain the benefits of functional programming, you must pay the "cost" - and that means playing by the rules of FP, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expressions</strong>, <em>not</em> statements</li>
<li><strong>Immutability</strong>, <em>not</em> mutability</li>
<li><strong>Separation of state and behaviour</strong>, <em>not</em> objects with hidden state</li>
<li><strong>Pure functions</strong>, <em>not</em> side effects</li>
<li><strong>Declarative</strong>, <em>not</em> imperative</li>
<li><strong>Composition</strong>, <em>not</em> inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>Now think about C# and how things have changed over the years. I would suggest that when C# first came out, virtually all of the characteristics on the <em>right</em> column were prevalent - think about how the early versions of file system access used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern">Template pattern</a>, for example. Since then many features have been added that have brought in some elements from the <em>left</em> side. Sometimes, the two sides can play together nicely; other times, it can be difficult to mix and match.</p>
<p>Even though you may be writing code that favours - such as immutability or declarative code - the roots of C# are firmly geared in …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>It’s been over a year since I first started building my car computer with the Raspberry Pi. In the time since, it’s traveled over 15000km through four Australian states. The majority of the distance has been on dirt roads and tracks, pushing the hardware to its limits.</p>
<p>As a whole the car computer has performed great, but after time on the road. There are some changes and fixes that I would make if I was starting again. Along with a rough road map for planned future functionality.</p>
<div id="attachment_1342"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1342" src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mt_number_3.jpg" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mt_number_3.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mt_number_3-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1342">The Raspberry Pi Car Computer has suffered a lot of torment getting shaken violently on rough tracks around the country.</p></div>
<p><strong>A New Screen</strong></p>
<p>Before we even set off on the trip, I managed to damage the touchscreen! Eventually the computer is going to be mounted permanently in the center console of the car but for ease of patching,testing and development etc it has just been tied up to the grab bar on the passenger side.</p>
<p>Early one morning, when putting it back into the car I, didn’t realise the computer was in a bag that I handled a little roughly and some of the glass on the side of the touchscreen got broken off (pic).</p>
<p>Financial and time limitations before our departure date meant that the screen could not be replaced. In its defense, it still worked for the most part.</p>
<p>Overtime, the touch functionality started to stop working in the lower half of the screen though.<br>
<img src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/broken_screen.jpg" width="500" height="357" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/broken_screen.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/broken_screen-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><br>
The plan was to live with it and replace the screen when I finally mounted it in the car for good. But, as more time passed, the slightest vibration would have the cursor randomly moving around clicking things.</p>
<p>The random playing, stopping and starting of songs was starting to get to me! The system was becoming unusable so I paid the money and got a brand new Raspberry Pi touchscreen delivered.<br>
<img src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_screen.jpg" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_screen.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_screen-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><br>
The original display was purchased a few days after release, so it had the v1.0 display controller. The new unit has a v1.1 controller board, so the backlight brightness can be controlled from the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Even using “night mode” having the display backlight at full power causes a lot of glare in the cabin at night. So functionality to control the screen brightness will be added to the Car Computer settings pages as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Power Connections</strong></p>
<p>The power coming into the computer travels from a connector to a voltage converter, which then provides power to the USB hub and the Pi. The wire connections are a source of pain, dirt roads in the outback are commonly heavily corrugated from water. Driving across them literally shakes your car apart. Terminal connectors holding the wiring together need periodic tightening, otherwise the car computer randomly turns off and on as the wires gets shaken around.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be an issue for a car that never leaves tar roads. But if any off road travel is planned, crimp or soldering the wires together as best as you can or the vibration will play havoc with the system.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Drive </strong></p>
<p>Setting out, I thought car vibration may cause issues with a normal 3.5 inch notebook hard drive. But due to the cost of larger solid state hard drives I decided to risk it anyhow.</p>
<p>So I am glad to say, the hard drive has up till this point, no issues whatsoever. If money was no object, I would choose an SSD, given the lower power consumption. But the notebook drive has performed well enough and given the 1TB storage size offers, a huge amount of storage for little cost.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p>
<p>Originally a Huawei K3715 3G Dongle was used for Internet connectivity on the road. But in the days of 4G mobile networks it was slow, reception was never great and seemed to also draw a lot of power.</p>
<p>So I purchased a <a href="https://www.development-cycle.com/2017/04/zte-mf832-inside/">Telstra Branded ZTE MF823 4G LTE dongle</a> for $39 from an Australia Post outlet. It has sockets for two external antennas allowing me to use an Axis CLR8 7-9db external 4G antenna mounted on the bull bar for improved network reception.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4g_aerial.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4g_aerial.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4g_aerial-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Another added benefit from the upgrade was system simplification. Originally I was using the sakis3g script to control the mobile network connection. The <a href="https://www.development-cycle.com/2017/04/zte-mf823-inside/">ZTE MF823 has a different architecture though</a>, rather than being a standard mobile dongle. It also houses a small embedded Linux system that appears on the host system as a standard ethernet adapter. The embedded system manages the connection so the sakis3g script is no longer needed.</p>
<p><strong>UI Design</strong></p>
<p>The layout of a user interface hugely important to the usability application but for the most part it’s not something that most of us think that much about. Most of the changes to the system while on the road have been changes to the layout of the application to try and minimise the amount of input required from the user.</p>
<p>A perfect example is <a href="https://github.com/anthony-mills/raspberrypi-carputer/commit/87002930938cabfa8a60f673bb1c1535360d8d69">commit 8700293</a>, automatically starting the playback of a play list when loaded, if music is not already playing. Before this change, a user would have to select the play list they wanted, navigate back to the homepage and then select the “Play Queue” option from the main menu. It’s only two more taps, which may not seem like a great deal but when off road the car is jumping around on an unstable and unpredictable surface, so aiming and landing a tap in the right area of the screen can be an extremely frustrating pain in the arse.</p>
<p>So the new approach to the code base is going to be ‘interaction minimisation’. Anything music related that can be handled with less input from the user, is going to simplified as far as it can. Most of the time in the car you just want some music; it’s not something I want to get frustrated at, because I cannot get something working while bouncing around.</p>
<p><strong>Future Direction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The trip meter and trip mapping functions still suck. This functionality in theory should be easy:&nbsp; collect some data points, calculate the distance between then and plot the data on to a map. In the real world, it’s not so cut and dry though. Extensive road testing has at least given me more trip data and I am to use this to sort out the bugs that seem to keep popping up in this part of the application.</li>
<li>Backlight brightness control: as mentioned earlier in the post, the official 7inch Raspberry Pi touchscreen v1.1 and above allows the user to control the display brightness. This will be controllable from the settings screen and will help reduce glare in the cab at night.</li>
<li>A down loadable image file, building the system from scratch is all well and good but its time consuming. Over the next couple of months, I am going to try to create a small (few gigabytes tops) image file that can be written on to a SD Card, and the put into a Raspberry Pi to get a user up and running as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Longer term, the application has been built using Ionic Framework 1.x which has now been deprecated. So I need to investigate the work required to bring the application up to date with the latest releases.</li>

<p>The Innovator’s Dilemma begins as an exciting new market opportunity presents itself.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5xno5j7CDDuFS8zJOQFj1sh7s0RfUFS-8BxODztxKaxfhPOFue9hTPGAVPbmZ1qtg9a9a_ScYSLK8qQhib3hT5cH5ZNQrKAzImyBx5y8_SQcEDBOV-nsyyichbkHeIWr0F_Rb_pD" alt="" width="435" height="413" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Blue enters the market by providing a solution. It solves some customer problems by leveraging its new Circle technology.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2sGAzyW-fT45C1TXmU8WEuE8lId2i_yq7cjQ5Pm6FP-2PJVVDxgqu7Ot7rqhojRghJV68VSOuXtO8R7OirzWrWuYTZ9EPHb9vAmmsGSPbkm7UoY6pFbzlt8rvWEGOGax_AlyWZHM" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Blue doubles down on Circle technology and continues to grow. Eventually, it captures the majority of the market.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/y6TW8zGUX7YNxndzWUg3oKlafHUvLZpLp2DinhyeO1prrgT_8pVt_LXHvhsbses-NflIcdiF7zY2nvU8dX0VK5ZXs7MHaNzM0zU-M3NSZ4YsnaJFPEtLfngDW5tOFiLJvLngaSmA" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>But markets aren’t stagnant. They constantly change. Go back and look how the corners of the outlined area have been evolving. This represents new customers with unique needs who Circle technology can’t serve.</p>



<p>Then Green enters the market. It’s a startup pioneering Triangle technology. It serves the needs of the corner of the market. Blue doesn’t change because Circle is still a better solution for the majority. Besides, it might lose focus if it tries to specialize in Triangle.</p>

<p><em>This article is part of a series of conversations with the founding members of Apache Kylin and Kyligence on the origins of Apache Kylin. You can find the first installment here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://kyligence.io/blog/apache-kylin-through-the-eyes-of-the-founders-episode-one/" target="_blank">Episode One</a></em>.</p>







<p><strong>Episode Two: The Journey Begins&nbsp;</strong></p>







<p>Apache&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kylin (opens in a new tab)" href="https://kyligence.io/apache-kylin-overview/" target="_blank">Kylin</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;an open source distributed analytical data warehouse built with big data in mind.&nbsp;Via a clever combination of multi-dimensional cubes, plug-in architecture and&nbsp;<a href="https://kyligence.io/blog/the-evolution-of-precomputation-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="precomputation (opens in a new tab)">precomputation</a>&nbsp;technology, Kylin&nbsp;can provide near constant query speeds&nbsp;no matter the size of your dataset with sub-second latency&nbsp;â€“ cutting costs for adopters of this technology in both time and manpower needed for effective analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This recipient of multiple industry awards has been adopted by over a thousand organizations worldwide seeking a solution to the problem of storing and analyzing big data fast enough for their insights to make an impact on their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the&nbsp;origin&nbsp;story&nbsp;of&nbsp;the unexpected hero of modern big data analytics,&nbsp;Apache&nbsp;Kylin, as told by its inventors.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>







<p><em>As we continue our conversation on the origin of the open source, top-level Apache Software Foundation project, Kylin, with its six founding members, Iâ€™d like to learn more about the specific role each of you has played in making Apache Kylin the globally respected platform that it is today. </em></p>







<p><strong><em>What roles have each of you held in</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Kylin</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>over the years and what features have you
developed or contributed?</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Iâ€™m sure there are too many to name, so can
you give us a few key highlights?</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>L U K E</strong>:&nbsp; The very first role I had on Kylin was just
as a developer. I oversaw one main component. I also served as a product
manager and took charge of talking to management and the clients inside eBay. </p>



<p>The metadata component was my initial focus.
The metadata is the core of the project where we define the data models,
illustrate how we combine them into dimensions and metrics, how we store and
optimize that, and all the things we need to extract to make our system work. I
wrote the entire model in the beginning. </p>



<p>When I was a developer, I just focused on my coding, but when I began to market the product within eBay, and later on with the Apache Software Foundation, a lot of things changed in the way I communicated â€“ this is one reason I think I was picked to be Kylinâ€™s first Project Management Committee Chair. The PMC Chair is a community role, so I did a lot of communication in that position. </p>

<p>The skills I developed there have helped me in a lot of ways â€“ being able to chat with different people, bring differing opinions together and find common ground, to resolve conflict and know how to prioritize all the right stuff. This has changed me a lot from a very technical guy, sort of a geek, into a product manager and leader.</p>







<p><strong><em>Conflict resolution is no small talent â€“ and
itâ€™s particularly essential when you work with such a passionate team in an
international community.&nbsp;Shaofeng, you are Kylinâ€™s current PMC Chair. What
was your journey to the PMC like?</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>S&nbsp;H&nbsp;A&nbsp;O&nbsp;F&nbsp;E&nbsp;N&nbsp;G</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;When I joined the project as a software engineer, I first
started working with metadata and&nbsp;the
build&nbsp;engine, but I quickly expanded to other areas.&nbsp;Later,&nbsp;I&nbsp;became a
Committer and contributed regularly by working on releases, answering questions
in the community, putting up new features, and, in time, I was recognized as a
PMC member.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, I became the PMC Chair for Apache&nbsp;Kylin, taking over the role from Luke.&nbsp;Iâ€™ve&nbsp;worked on many features in my time with Kylin. Iâ€™ve published several technical blogs&nbsp;about them&nbsp;on the Apache&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;website. For example, I developed&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="near-real-time streaming (opens in a new tab)" href="https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2016/10/18/new-nrt-streaming/" target="_blank">near-real-time streaming</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Spark cubing engine (opens in a new tab)" href="https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2017/02/23/by-layer-spark-cubing/" target="_blank">Spark cubing engine</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2016/03/19/approximate-topn-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Top-N measure (opens in a new tab)">Top-N measure</a>, and the fast-cubing algorithm. These are the big features that Iâ€™ve&nbsp;worked&nbsp;on.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>I look forward to reading your blogs, Shaofeng.&nbsp;Jason, you have contributed very heavily to the&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;community. Where did you start?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>J&nbsp;A&nbsp;S&nbsp;O&nbsp;N:</strong>&nbsp; At first, I was a front-end programmer. I wrote the front-end code&nbsp;and also&nbsp;some REST API. We only had one front-end programmer at that time â€“ me. Iâ€™m now the Senior Director responsible for the South China Business group with&nbsp;Kyligence, the enterprise-ready version of Kylin. There are so many features Iâ€™ve worked on I couldnâ€™t tell you one by one. Itâ€™s been three years since I worked on&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;directly and I am&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;listed as one of the top six Contributors on Apache&nbsp;Kylin.</p>







<p><strong><em>Thatâ€™s incredible! Hongbin, as one of the
earliest members I am sure youâ€™ve held a lot of positions.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>H</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>G</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>N</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes,
I have. At first, I was a Junior Software Engineer. I joined this project very
early. Yang joined just a few days before me. Iâ€™ve played many roles over the
past four years. First, I became Senior Software Engineer. Later, I became a
team leader, then Director and now I am VP of Engineering at&nbsp;Kyligence, so&nbsp;this has been
a&nbsp;really
fast-paced&nbsp;career path
for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mainly worked on the query engine part of the project. I remember in the first few months after I joined the Apache&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;team, I was assigned a task to complete the OBDC driver for the query engine. I was very young and passionate at the time, so I did a lot of research and finished the prototype within one week, which I felt was a very impressive accomplishment.</p>







<p><strong><em>That level of commitment and passion is very
impressive. You have all demonstrated incredible drive and vision throughout
this project. Yang, could you tell us some more about the beginning of it
all?&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Y A N G</strong>: &nbsp;In the early days, it was more of a transition period between Xu Jiang, the initial technical lead, and me. In the beginning, we worked from a peer-to-peer style.&nbsp;We&nbsp;didnâ€™t&nbsp;have a lot of people,&nbsp;so there were no politics. It was just a group of technical engineers with the passion to create something new.&nbsp;After Xu left, I was the most senior member, so people would come to me for decision making or for guidance if they were in doubt.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Yang-Kylin-Amazon.png" alt="Yang Kylin Amazon" srcset="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Yang-Kylin-Amazon.png 964w, https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Yang-Kylin-Amazon-300x227.png 300w, https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Yang-Kylin-Amazon-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 964px) 100vw, 964px"><figcaption><strong>Yang Li Presenting Apache Kylin to Amazon, 2014</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Is there anything</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>in particular that</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>stands out in your mind as the secret to</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Kylinâ€™s</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>success?</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Y A N G</strong>: &nbsp;I remember, apart from building the product itself, the team put quite a lot of effort into marketing, and I would say that was quite an important thing in the early days. It was led by me and Luke mostly, but the whole team was involved. Luke and I were more media-facing.&nbsp;I think if we were to say why Apache&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;was the first successful open source project from China â€“ and successful internationally, at that â€“ I think the major difference for this project was the marketing. </p>



<p>I think Luke played a very good role in this. Thanks to eBayâ€™s connection with Silicon Valley, we participated in a lot of global conferences starting very early on in Apache&nbsp;Kylinâ€™s&nbsp;development and we made some big-name connections, which was a very important element of our success, I think.</p>







<p><strong><em>That makes sense. Could you tell us about
some of the features</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>youâ€™ve</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>developed?</em></strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Y A N G</strong>: &nbsp;What
features did I work on? Perhaps, everything! But if I had to pick one key
thing, I would say that is the plug-in architecture beneath the surface of
Apache&nbsp;Kylin, which
was mostly driven by me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kylin&nbsp;is a
precalculation engine and there are a few major components in the platform, one
is the build engine, another is the storage&nbsp;engine, and
finally the query engine. Basically, the build engine is where data gets loaded
and precalculated, the storage&nbsp;engine&nbsp;is&nbsp;where the calculated
data is stored (in the early days it was HBase), and, finally, the query engine
is where the SQL is executed, analyzed and optimized based on what we have
precalculated and stored.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we have
what we call a plug-in architecture where the three major pieces have a very
clear interface and they can be replaced without impacting the other components
too much.&nbsp;We created
this design roughly between versions 0.6 to 1.0. It turned out to be quite
useful because we did replace the three parts gradually over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the early days, the build engine was mostly MapReduce and, as time passed, we knew MapReduce was going to go away and be replaced by Spark, and that did happen recently. The same thing happened in the storage part. HBase was the most balanced storage engine we could find in the early days. It had everything we needed â€“ cache, storage, and good throughput, but&nbsp;itâ€™s&nbsp;not a fully distributed calculation engine. </p>



<p>HBase is not perfect. It has a co-processor, which is at least something but&nbsp;itâ€™s&nbsp;a weak form of distributed calculation. The query engine was initially based on Calcite, an open source query engine. In the enterprise version, we replaced it with Spark.&nbsp;Weâ€™re&nbsp;now working on contributing that Spark query engine back to the open source community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think
that was a&nbsp;pretty clever&nbsp;move on our
part in the early days.&nbsp;We set the
foundation for these major parts to be able to evolve, which prepared us&nbsp;pretty well&nbsp;to adapt. As
the technical trends move forward and develop,&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;is able to&nbsp;catch up
whenever we want it to.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Kylin-Ecosystem.png" alt="Kylin Ecosystem" srcset="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Kylin-Ecosystem.png 908w, https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Kylin-Ecosystem-300x143.png 300w, https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Kylin-Ecosystem-768x365.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"><figcaption><strong>http://kylin.apache.org</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>It certainly sounds like that level of
flexibility would come in handy and help&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;evolve with related
technology.&nbsp;Dong, could you tell us about your experience working
on&nbsp;Kylin?</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>D&nbsp;O&nbsp;N&nbsp;G</strong>:&nbsp; Absolutely. My first project with Apache&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;was to implement some additional BI integrations. Before I joined,&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;could only&nbsp;be connected with&nbsp;Tableau for BI users. My first job was to expand&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;to more BI tools like Excel and&nbsp;PowerBI, and so I took on the <a href="https://kyligence.io/resources/kyligence-odbc-driver-for-apache-kylin-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OBDC driver (opens in a new tab)">OBDC driver</a> component, which is a connector between&nbsp;Kylin&nbsp;and different BI tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kylin&nbsp;started out as
just a query engine. It was just a server running on a machine, so the challenge
was …</p></div></div>

June 30, 2020 | https://yannbriancon.com/blog/automatic-login-django-ldap-authentication-tutorial/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yannbriancon.com/blog/automatic-login-django-ldap-authentication-tutorial/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Django is one of the most famous Python frameworks. In this tutorial, I explain how to automatically log in users in its built-in admin interface using an LDAP.</strong></p>
<p>Django provides a very useful admin interface that permits to manage users, display and modify model data. But have you ever tried to integrate a Django application in a big company?</p>
<p>I have and, most of the time, they already have an authentication system to authenticate their users. For example, 95% of Fortune 1000 companies use Active Directory from Microsoft to manage their users.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ActiveDirectory?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ActiveDirectory</a> is used by 95% of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortune1000?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fortune1000</a> companies <a href="http://t.co/5WRsFBHJXv">pic.twitter.com/5WRsFBHJXv</a></p>— Active Directory Tips 💡 (@ADTipsTricks) <a href="https://twitter.com/ADTipsTricks/status/627282678618923008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2015</a></blockquote> 
<p>Therefore, the users are authenticated all over the network and <strong>there is no point adding the Django Admin login page with custom credentials</strong>. Not to mention the company security department that would probably not accept a different credential database.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s see how we can automatically log in users with a concrete example!</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before creating our application, you need to install <strong>python</strong> and <strong>pip</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/" title="Article explaining how to install pip fr python">This article</a> gives the installation details on Mac and Linux.</p>
<p>We will also need <strong>pipenv</strong> to create a contained environment and avoid conflicts with other projects (<a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/2/why-python-devs-should-use-pipenv" title="Article explaining the reasons to use pipenv">more details on why using pipenv</a>).</p>
<p>You can install it with this command: </p>
<pre><code>pip install pipenv —-user
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>Creation of the Django application</h2>
<p>The first step is to create our contained pipenv environment and install Django and ldap3, a library to connect to an LDAP:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir DjangoApplications &amp;&amp; cd DjangoApplications
pipenv install Django ldap3
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have a configured environment, we can create our Django application and initialize the database:</p>
<pre><code>pipenv run django-admin startproject AutomaticDjangoAuthentication
cd AutomaticDjangoAuthentication
pipenv run python manage.py migrate
</code></pre>
<p>We have now a Django application called <strong>AutomaticDjangoAuthentication</strong> ready to be run.</p>
<p>Let’s launch it: </p>
<pre><code>pipenv run python manage.py runserver
</code></pre>
<p>The application is launched and you should be able to access the admin dashboard on <a href="http://localhost:8000/admin/" title="Django admin dashboard">http://localhost:8000/admin</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/8twii33rysmo/1GF0QmMYoWxtRLKKbywaQH/bb46954d3df6ef651f3bb40638b9ca48/image.png" alt="Django Admin Login Page"></p>
<p>By default, Django uses a user-oriented authentication with a login page. To connect on the admin dashboard and add other users, we need to create a user with all the permissions (super user) using the <em>createsuperuser</em> command:</p>
<pre><code>pipenv run python manage.py createsuperuser
</code></pre>
<p>You should be able to connect using the user you created and access the <a href="http://localhost:8000/admin/" title="Django admin dashboard">admin dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We can now customize the default Django authentication process</strong> to authenticate using LDAP and auto-create the users in the Django database.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Auto-create users in the Django database on login</h2>
<p>The default Django authentication uses backend classes to authenticate the users. On login, each backend authenticate method is called by priority until a user is returned or no more backends are to try.</p>
<p><strong>In order to have an interesting external authentication system, I used a public LDAP server</strong> shared by <a href="https://www.forumsys.com/" title="Forumsys website">forumsys</a>. It provides several users and different groups that make LDAP tests very easy (more details <a href="https://www.forumsys.com/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/" title="Forumsys link to their online ldap test server">here</a>).</p>
<p>I created a service to check the user can authenticate in the LDAP given a username and password:</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/4b68970f035c0123cdcbd76537775428" data-card-width="100%" data-card-controls="0">Embedded content: https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/4b68970f035c0123cdcbd76537775428</a></p>
<p>Then <strong>we can create our custom authentication backend</strong>. We check that the user can access the LDAP (or your own authentication system).</p>
<p>If so, we create and return a Django user with the permissions we want him to have. Here I give him only the right to access the admin dashboard (see Django permissions):</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/0a281db8a90d5db980254d4bb4d77109" data-card-width="100%" data-card-controls="0">Embedded content: https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/0a281db8a90d5db980254d4bb4d77109</a></p>
<p>The last step before trying our new login is to override the default configuration. To do this, <strong>we add our backend in the Django app settings file</strong> <em>settings.py</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/b293409f0a87835797e707db488ce707" data-card-width="100%" data-card-controls="0">Embedded content: https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/b293409f0a87835797e707db488ce707</a></p>
<p>Now we should be able to log in the <a href="http://localhost:8000/admin/" title="Django admin dashboard">admin dashboard</a> with one of the <a href="https://www.forumsys.com/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/" title="Forumsys link to their online ldap test server">LDAP</a> users, newton, euler, einstein…, with the password password. 🎉</p>
<hr>
<h2>Automatic user login</h2>
<p>With a single sign-on protocol implemented, like Kerberos in Active Directory, the users only have to log in once to be authenticated over the network. It is then not UX friendly to ask the users to log in another time.</p>
<p>To avoid that, <strong>we will use the Django middleware to automatically log in instead of displaying the login page.</strong></p>
<p>Django uses several middlewares, which are defined with a priority in <em>settings.py</em>, to ensure security, cookies, authentication and more.</p>
<p>Each middleware is a layer wrapping the view that can implement five hooks. Each hook is a step to manage the request, display the view and manage the response and potential exceptions (more details in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/http/middleware/" title="Django 1.7 middleware documentation">Django documentation</a>). </p>
<p>In the schema below you can see in which order the hooks are called in Django 1.7:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process_request and process_response hooks have been removed in Django 2.2 (see the details <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/middleware/" title="Django 2.2 middleware documentation">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/8twii33rysmo/slLuqmqtspSuxXwSFRQFS/3a48fd45d10c99f589d5f9bfda9ea75f/image.png" alt="Django 1.7 Middleware Request Process"></p>
<p><strong>We will then add a new middleware after the AuthenticationMiddleware to automatically authenticate the users:</strong></p>

<p>It is very basic!</p>
<p>We try to authenticate the user if he is not already authenticated.
Then we either log in the user in the app or return a Forbidden response if the user cannot be authenticated.</p>
<p>As with the backend, we have to add the middleware to the Django configuration file <em>settings.py</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/80ef4634af3c6ddf1c39409c2ad23b40" data-card-width="100%" data-card-controls="0">Embedded content: https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/80ef4634af3c6ddf1c39409c2ad23b40</a></p>
<p><strong>To simplify this article, I did not implement a complex Kerberos server. Instead, I used query strings to pass the user’s credentials.</strong></p>
<p>We must then modify our custom authentication backend to get the query strings from the request:</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/63798c31fb4249b5e790a8f3625d6736" data-card-width="100%" data-card-controls="0">Embedded content: https://gist.github.com/yannbriancon/63798c31fb4249b5e790a8f3625d6736</a></p>
<p>Now you can try to access the <a href="http://localhost:8000/admin/" title="Django admin dashboard">admin dashboard</a></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And receive a 403 Forbidden! 🤯 (if you’re already logged in, log out and retry)</p>
<p>That’s because you need to send your credentials as query strings to be authenticated.</p>
<p>Let’s try again with <a href="http://localhost:8000/admin/?username=euler&amp;password=password" title="Link to django admin with username and password query strings">http://localhost:8000/admin/?username=euler&amp;password=password</a> … Magic, it works 🎉</p>
<p><strong>We can now authenticate each user without going through the login page.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>How to implement it with Active Directory</h2>
<p>A concrete implementation would not use query strings. Instead, we would use the external authentication system to get the users’ information. For example, I integrated this solution with Active Directory.</p>
<p>Active Directory is a Microsoft solution that uses the LDAP protocol and the Kerberos single sign-on protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li>LDAP permits accessing and storing information on the users.</li>
<li>Kerberos permits to securely authenticate the users through the network using encrypted tokens (more explanations in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_44CHD3Vx-0" title="Youtube video explaining the Kerberos permissions">this video</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to plug with an Active Directory Kerberos, you can follow <a href="https://blog.scottlowe.org/2006/08/10/kerberos-based-sso-with-apache/" title="Active Directory Kerberos tutorial">this tutorial</a>. Once you configured Apache, you will be able to access the user’s username in the request REMOTE_USER header.</p>
<p>With the username, you will then be able to fetch the user information from the Active Directory LDAP and create the user in the Django database.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, <strong>I have shown how to use a custom authentication to automatically log in Django admin.</strong> </p>
<p>With this strategy, you avoid the implementation of a new authentication protocol and a complete copy of your existing database.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can easily customize it with your own authentication system. You can also personalize the user experience by setting the user’s permissions using LDAP groups.</p>
<p>You can see, clone, fork the whole project on Github: <strong><a href="https://github.com/yannbriancon/AutomaticDjangoAuthentication" title="Github repository containing the source code of this tutorial">AutomaticDjangoAuthentication, yannbriancon</a></strong> 👨‍🎓.</p>

<p><span><em>This is an ongoing development series about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/chaotic-era">CHAOTIC ERA</a>, an interstellar strategy game. <strong><a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/subscribe">Join the beta waitlist here</a></strong> or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/chaotic_era" aria-describedby="a11y-external-message"><strong>follow us on Twitter</strong></a>&nbsp;for the latest updates.</em></span></p>
<p><span>It’s often said that the meaning of a piece of art comes after it’s been made—the audience assigns their own ideas and emotions to it; they see trends and patterns that not even the original artist was aware of.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just as in painting or sculpture or songwriting, the same principles apply to the art form of game design. Whatever a developer has in their head when they’re creating a game is only half the equation. The art direction, the gameplay, the end goal they have in mind… while these are important factors, ultimately there will also be inspiration beneath the surface, deep within their subconscious, that find their way into a game whether they’re aware of it or not.</span></p>
<p><span>This has definitely been the case for <a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/chaotic-era">Chaotic Era</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>When we first started work on the game years ago, we had a vague notion of what the final product should look like. We wanted to build a strategy game on an epic scale; one that would take place across an entire universe.</span></p>
<p><span>We wanted to capture the mystique and vastness and excitement of games like No Man’s Sky and Elite Dangerous while working in ideas from our favourite sci-fi classics.</span></p>
<p><span>And in our first phase of development, where we mostly focused on navigation UI and worldbuilding, those influences couldn’t be more clear.</span></p>
<p><span>Our minimal FUI design combined our love for the retrofuture of Blade Runner and Alien, with the modern interfaces of fighter jets and helicopters. The AI-worshipping interstellar universe dominated by shadowy corporations drew from a wide range of sources like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Battletech, and Dune.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0110/1938/6902/files/spinners-ENVIRON-CTR_1024x1024.gif?v=1593361746"></span></p>
<p><span><em>Image via <a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/">www.scifiinterfaces.com</a></em><br></span></p>
<p><span>But once we started getting into the nuts and bolts of the game—the actual gameplay and game rules—we started making our way down a rabbit hole with little idea of where we might end up.</span></p>
<p><span>Each exploration started to take on a life of its own as we began adding components that felt like they made sense.</span></p>
<p><span>How would you build new ships? Well, I guess we need worker units. Where do worker units come from? Well, I guess we need building units that house workers. And those workers require population and energy to produce. And energy comes from reservoirs you discover, and harvest with those same workers.</span></p>
<p><span>And so on it went, until we came to our current point in time: with a fleshed out game experience whose influences surprised us.</span></p>
<p><span>Once we were able to look back on what we built, we quickly began to retrospectively see patterns that we weren’t even aware of.</span></p>
<p><span>Our isometric grid, world planning, and disasters? We realized those were pulled out of ninth grade memories spent beating Sim City 2000 in computer labs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Worker units created by factories, sent to harvest resources, and used to construct new buildings? Hours sank into Starcraft were surfacing in unexpected ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Without even realizing, but thankfully so, we were building a strategy game that was subconsciously heavily influenced by some of our favourite RTS trailblazers: Sim City 2000, Starcraft, Command &amp; Conquer, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0110/1938/6902/files/71104_screenhi_930x524_en_US_01___2014-04-01-11-01-16_088f82de4701f05aa0a16904261a1f3be30ae43b_grande.jpg?v=1593361854"></span></p>
<p><span>Each planet in Chaotic Era is like its own Sim City or Starcraft match; the main difference being here that as you expand your empire, you’ll find yourself balancing many matches at once. And those matches will suddenly have complex interdependencies and domino effects based on the decisions you make, or don’t make.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The interesting thing is that I feel like if we had intentionally set out to create a game that emulates these classics of the genre, then we would’ve ended up with an end product much flatter and less exciting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By chasing a notion of what we wanted to build—looking at the world and feelings we were trying to evoke—we let our minds pull together these influences without even realizing, ultimately creating something that we’re incredibly proud of (and constantly surprised by). We weren’t forcing building blocks together, instead we were chipping away at marble and uncovering the hidden forms underneath the surface.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, it’s been a while since our last progress update, so I wanted to cover a few things along the lines of how early real time strategy games have been driving our recent game design.</span></p>
<h2><b>Changes in visual direction for planets</b></h2>
<p><span>At lower levels of elevation, the camera aligns to an isometric, 45º point of view, allowing the player to see a different level of detail than when zoomed out. As well, a subtle "ground" texture has been added to suggest terrain, populated by perlin noise.</span></p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>A dust effect was explored as well, inspired by the ground conditions of a comet captured by a European probe:</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b026c4244e490af668e696bf39a125d5dc5e2120/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6d6f732e636d732e66757475726563646e2e6e65742f765668414d536d38774d715a345a4c716978767368432d313032342d38302e676966" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80933480-e9c50900-8d91-11ea-8157-2b1f59fa1251.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Outline shaders were explored but ultimately dropped due to difficulty required to achieve a certain level of quality, but also additional visual noise that would be introduced. The shader will be re-examined when there's an opportunity to display models in higher levels of detail (ie. a "unit details" view)</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80932750-e3815d80-8d8e-11ea-9e25-8029bd3a9bf2.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<h2><b>Garage tiles</b></h2>
<p><span>Introduces a finite grid to the garage which consists of tiles that are owned by the player, not owned but purchasable, not purchasable and not owned, and unknown. The majority of the "board" consists of unknown tiles, acting as a fog of war mechanic. Tiles that are unowned but purchasable are represented by a single dot and when tapped, are purchased for a fixed price immediately.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80932925-8cc85380-8d8f-11ea-8c33-5c44c285691c.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The previous set of rules dictating validity of a unit's position have been adjusted too, now discriminating against a few more rules than before, such as whether or not a tile is unowned, non-purchasable, or of an unknown state.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80933612-7ff92f00-8d92-11ea-8525-028ca760aeb7.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<h2><b>Workers</b></h2>
<p><span>A new Unit class and mechanic has been introduced, </span><span>TileUnit</span><span> and </span><span>Tile</span><span> respectively. </span><span>TileUnits</span><span> can be purchased in the same way </span><span>ShipUnits</span><span> can be purchased, and placed in the garage in the same way too. The only difference is </span><span>TileUnits</span><span> can produce </span><span>Workers</span><span> which are required for performing various functions, starting with terraforming the surface of a single body so additional units can be placed. This is all in the vein of making energy and population generation/consumption more transparent, where there will eventually be a unit for generating energy and population, and population will be literally countable by the number of worker units in a single garage.</span></p>
<p><span>This work began with exploring how to subdivide a 2D cell into n subdivisions, and creating connected pathways across the lengths of the cell for workers to travel across.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935377-11d7cb80-a787-11ea-8830-a29d29d24d51.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The step after this was investigating how to fill available space around the paths with as large shapes as possible in order to fill them with decorative elements such as tents and satellites.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935379-18fed980-a787-11ea-9da6-7db9d2276ff8.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>From here, it was a matter of figuring out a way to place assets in these available spaces.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935407-55323a00-a787-11ea-8a1e-f210ca71be6f.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Work was then done to ensure entrances were calculated by neighbouring entrances to ensure seamlessness of interlocking tiles.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935428-8448ab80-a787-11ea-8215-a56dcb77b5d7.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The final result was actually inserting worker units and their assets and having them follow these paths towards assigned targets.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935451-b0642c80-a787-11ea-9d9c-3a2618e3fb11.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>This involved a new Job-Worker design which now gets encoded to save files. The user creates jobs by performing an action like clicking an available cell, and a new </span><span>Foreman</span><span> class takes inventory of "idle" workers, dynamically assigning workers closest to the job location, or reassigning assigned workers by pulling them off a job they are already stationed at.</span></p>
<p><span>This design will need to continue evolving over the next few months to fill in functionality gaps, such as the ability to move and perform work while the game is closed. This and many more aspects will be refined as unknowns are uncovered.</span></p>

            <p>NEW YORK -- 
	Athletic apparel maker Lululemon Athletica Inc. said Monday it's acquiring at-home exercise startup Mirror for US$500 million.</p>
<p>
	The deal is part of Lululemon's plan to expand beyond just selling yoga tights and other workout clothing.</p>
<p>
	"The acquisition of Mirror is an exciting opportunity to build upon that vision, enhance our digital and interactive capabilities, and deepen our roots in the sweat life," Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald said in a statement.</p>
<p>
	The move also comes as Americans have been forced by gym closures to work out at home during the pandemic. And even as some gyms have reopened with new safety protocols, many customers are still not willing to go back because of worries about catching the virus.</p>
<p>
	Mirror, which launched in 2018, sells a $1,500 interactive mirror that streams workout classes, offers weekly live classes and thousands of on-demand workouts, as well as immersive one-on-one personal training.</p>
<p>
	The deal builds on a partnership between the two companies that began in mid-2019 when Lululemon made an initial investment in Mirror.</p>
<p>
	It also marks Lululemon's first acquisition. Once the deal closes, Mirror will operate as a standalone company within Lululemon, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
<p>
	Brynn Putnam will continue as Mirror's CEO, reporting to McDonald.</p>

	<p><i>June 30th 2020</i></p>

	<p>How have you spent your time in lockdown? Well, if you're anything like me, you've been drowning yourself in work and side projects to get through the long lockdown months. It's been glorious, I work in the morning, then geek out on side projects all afternoon. I'm at peak productivity, and have completed so many <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> whilst the world has been falling apart.</p>

	<p>Last week though, things started to go very wrong.</p>

	<p>Monday rolled around, and I was excited for a new week of building things. However, by the end of the day, I'd managed to tick only half of the items off my to-do list. The next day my productivity plummeted even more. My focus had gone, and my work output was tiny.</p>
	
	<p>So, on Wednesday, after a work call in the morning, I headed off to the beach for a relaxing day off. I knew I'd come back feeling refreshed and super productive the day after.</p>

	<p>It didn't work though, Thursday was even worse. I sat at my laptop all day and probably achieved 1 hour of useful output. Worse, I was beating myself up because my day off had done nothing.</p>

	<p>I had reached what I now call <b>lockdown burnout</b>. Maybe you've experienced this too. After 3 months of creating, building and coding during lockdown, something inside me had broken. I felt absolutely fine, I wanted to build, but I simply could work no more.</p>

	<p>A single day off was not going to fix lockdown burnout. Instead, I took 3 days of pure rest: BBQ's, video games, reading, and even some camping. Not a single line of code was written.</p>

	<p>Monday once again arrived, but this time things were different: I ended up having one of the most productive days of my life. One hour of work probably had the same productive output as 5 hours of "work" before my lockdown burnout. I'd gained superpowers.</p>

	<p>Lockdown is a creator's dream. Its the ultimate excuse to stay indoors and build things all day. On the flip side, it can be really hard to know when to stop building when there's no end in sight. Programmers are hardwired to build and problem solve. We literally keep going at something until its done, even when you're not actually "doing" much.</p>

	<p>Taking a break to get more done can seem so counterintuitive, but it really works. I'm not talking about the odd day off, but several long, uninterrupted days of deep rest to fully recharge.</p>

	<p>If you've forgotten to stop the past few months, take a break.</p>

            <p>
	<a href="https://cnn.com/2020/04/18/asia/singapore-coronavirus-response-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">Singapore</a> is distributing a <a href="https://cnn.com/2020/06/05/tech/coronavirus-tracking-apps/index.html" target="_blank">digital</a> contact-tracing device to people who don't use smartphones, as part of the city-state's efforts to contain coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	The TraceTogether Tokens are aimed at vulnerable seniors who aren't digitally connected but are at higher risk from coronavirus, according to a statement from the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO).</p>
<p>
	Distribution started on Sunday and the tokens aim to protect people without smartphones in the same way as the existing TraceTogether app, which uses Bluetooth to alert users if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>
	The tokens send Bluetooth signals to other tokens, or smartphones with the app, and each one uses a personalized QR code.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank"><em><strong>Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</strong></em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	Coronavirus tracking has sparked concerns about privacy around the world, but the SNDGO says any data recorded will be encrypted and stored for only 25 days.</p>
<p>
	The tokens only collect proximity data, rather than geolocation data, and have no cellular or internet connectivity. This means encrypted data cannot be taken from the token remotely, and the data will only be downloaded if the individual tests positive for coronavirus, according to the statement.</p>
<p>
	The tokens have an estimated battery life of six to nine months and don't need to be charged, plus they're small and light enough to hang from a lanyard.</p>
<p>
	Teams of volunteers will deliver the tokens and provide simple instructions for use, said SNDGO, which is continuing to develop their design and functionality for future batches.</p>
<p>
	Singapore was one of the first countries to roll out a fully functioning Bluetooth tracking app. The app asks for some personal information, like a mobile phone number, and data is shared with health authorities after a positive coronavirus diagnosis.</p>
<p>
	The app is voluntary and by June 8 it had been downloaded by 1.8 million people, according to a government fact sheet. In June last year, Singapore recorded a total population of 5.7 million.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>This guide is an excerpt of my eBook and course Python for Investors. Shameless Plug: If this guide interests you here’s a <a href="https://buy.paddle.com/product/599120">link to get my upcoming course for 50% off </a>.</p>

<p>Python is a beginner friendly programming language that is extensively used in scripting. Scripting is making executable code files perform a certain task. Python is popular because of it’s beginner-friendly syntax yet it offers a powerful ecosystem for almost everything from web to machine learning. The vast libraries of Python offer everything from Data Visualisation, Machine learning to Image Processing and even building games.</p>

<p>Knowing Python, you can do a lot more with data than you can do in an excel or what the pre-built softwares offers.</p>

<p>If this is your first time writing code, I advise you to write the code as you go and come back to the tutorial if any error occurs.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-python">Setting Up Python</h2>

<p>There are many ways to setup Python but the most easiest, no matter what OS you are on, is to simply go to https://colab.research.google.com/. Click on New Notebook and start writing code. Executing the code is as simple as hitting Shift+Enter or navigate to Runtime and Run all.</p>

<h3 id="lets-get-started">Let’s get started</h3>

<p>In programming, we have variables and constants. Variables are the identifiers of the data but the data can change constantly. Variables have different types like Numeric Types, Text Type, Sequence Types and Boolean Types. The types are the category of the variable.</p>

<p>Variables are intialized as</p>

<p><code>x=10</code></p>

<p>We have a variable x that is assigned  the value 10.</p>

<p><code>name="John"</code></p>

<p>is a type of String since John is a string meaning sequence of characters.</p>

<p><code>x=4.5</code></p>

<p>is a floating type.</p>

<p><code>x=[1,2,3]</code></p>

<p>is a list.</p>

<p>Lists are just as they are named:  list of elements.</p>

<p>List are intialised like:</p>

<p><code>days=["sunday","monday","tuesday","wednesday","thursday","friday","saturday"]</code></p>

<p>Lists can also be empty like:</p>

<p><code>empty_list=[]</code></p>

<p>List has different methods meaning different actions you can perform on them. Like reversing a list, adding more elements to the list, appending the list.</p>

<p>For example, on the new cell, type in:</p>

<p><code>new_list=[]</code></p>

<p><code>print(new_list)</code></p>

<p>You should see the output :
<code>[]</code></p>

<p>Now go ahead and edit the code to:</p>

<p><code>new_list=[]</code></p>

<p><code>new_list.append(5)</code></p>

<p><code>print(new_list)</code></p>

<p>You should see the output <code>[5]</code></p>

<p>Here, <code>append()</code> is a method that takes one argument. What does an argument mean? Basically it’s an input to the method that the method does something with it like in our case adding the element at the end of the list.</p>

<p>Methods also called functions in other programming languages are very important in Python and we’ll be using many library defined methods in our cases.</p>

<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>

<p>Methods have the following syntax:</p>

<pre lang="python"><code>def method_name(args):
	do something
</code></pre>
<p>Methods are “called” which will be clear by the following example.</p>

<p>We’ll create a method where we input our name and  we are greeted. So the input to the method is the name and thus the parameter is name too.</p>

<pre lang="python"><code>def greet(name):
  print("Hello"+" "+ name)
our_name=input()
greet(our_name) 
</code></pre>
<p>Type the above code in a new cell and run it. You should be shown a box to write your name, Type your name and hit enter. You’ll be greeted. IF any error occurs, check the spaces. Python very much minds the spaces so be sure, the indendation is correct.</p>

<p>Here, we have the method called greet, that takes in our name. We have set <code>our_name</code> as input meaning whatever a user inputs is set as <code>our_name</code>. The method is called using <code>greet(our_name)</code>. And we get the output “Hello your_name_here”</p>

<h2 id="matplotlib-for-plotting-data">Matplotlib for plotting data</h2>

<p>Python is a popular language for data science due to its vast library. Libraries are imported using <code>import</code> keyword in Python.</p>

<p>We’ll start by importing our library <strong>matplotlib</strong> that we want to get introduced to in this guide.</p>

<p>Start a new notebook and type in the following</p>

<p><code>import matplotlib as plt</code></p>

<p>Here we’re importing the library matplotlib and naming it plt because the name it too long. We can use whatever name we like but don’t forget to use the same name in the program too.</p>

<p>Let’s suppose we have a dummy data for market cap of Apple Inc. for the last 7 days,</p>

<p><code>market_cap_in_billions=[1.5,200.2,300,45.2,100,45,48]</code></p>

<p>We want to plot it against</p>

<p><code>days=["sunday","monday","tuesday","wednesday","thursday","friday","saturday"]</code></p>

<p>Now add,</p>

<p><code>plt.ylabel("days")</code></p>

<p><code>plt.xlabel("Market Cap in Billions")</code></p>

<p>We now have set out Y-axis label of the plot to “Days” and X-axis label to “Market Cap in Billions”.</p>

<p>Now we’re gping to plot and to do show, add in,</p>

<p><code>plt.plot(days,market_cap_in_billions)</code></p>

<p>We’re calling the method like we did previously with greet(). This time we haven’t defined it anywhere but that’s what the matplotlib is there for. We’ve imported the library so now we can define whatever method is defined there. Documentation is your best friend when searching for methods inside a library.</p>

<p>But the plot still doesn’t show, that’s because we haven’t written the code to show it, which is:</p>

<p><code>plot.show()</code></p>

<p>The final code is</p>
<pre lang="python"><code>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
market_cap_in_billions=[1.5,200.2,300,45.2,100,45,48]
days=["sunday","monday","tuesday","wednesday","thursday","friday","saturday"]
plt.xlabel("Market Cap in Billions")
plt.ylabel("days")
 
plt.plot(days,market_cap_in_billions)
plt.show() 
 </code></pre>

<p>And you should get the plot of market cap vs days.</p>

<p>In the next part, we’ll dive deeper into matplotlib and learn how to read data from CSV files and play with it.</p>

<p>The best way to learn is to play around with code, break things and iterate. Feel free to ask questions if you get confused.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- Toc if any -->
                
                <!-- End Toc -->
                <p>For folks who’ve made post mortems more meaningful at your company, it is important that you spread that learning around. A lot of companies have teams that do postmortems really well and a lot of engineering managers(EMs) want to spread it organically, but writing and following postmortems is the kind of practice that a lot of devs really just don’t think about or care about and it can get extremely hard to force this practice, especially without support from upper management. So what can you do as an engineering manager?</p>

<h2 id="retrospectives">Retrospectives</h2>

<p>A lot of the best gains that most EMs made were either through word of mouth or providing a good example. First off, give people the time to actually do a good job with the retrospective process. Don’t make it sound like people need to rush things out the door to move on to “real” work. Second, you also must highlight how well-done postmortems are affecting how you’re thinking and approaching the work you’re looking at for the next month or quarter. <a href="https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/">John Allspaw</a> has a lot of text on this basically saying that you know you have a healthy retrospective culture when you see teams attending other teams’ retrospectives.</p>

<h2 id="rethinking-action-items">Rethinking “action items”</h2>

<p>One must also keep in mind that postmortems shouldn’t be about action items per se, but what you learned about how things work from a postmortem. It might appear to be a hard sell if your organization has a fixed mindset on intelligence or ability and might require conquering any inclusion and psychological safety issues at first, but it’s easier than it looks. Saying “we’re doing X because it was an action item from last month’s postmortem” is less interesting than “I understand why this thing we’re doing is important, because of how Cindy used this thing in the last incident”.</p>

<p>A common notion that you’ll have to dispel is that no one is going to want to participate in an honest retrospective if they think they are going to get screwed by doing so or if they think that the only thing anybody cares about is action. You need to make people realize that a retrospective with no action items was not a failure. Intangibles can be a hard sell.</p>

<p>For teams that spend a lot of thought on “action items” and “what can we do to prevent this from happening again” will notice that those action items lose a lot of the value along the way and the real fixes had happened already by the time you have retro discussions because the teams that own the systems know what it takes to improve them and want to improve them. Right after an incident, you might informally establish a time window when anything goes without a lot of planning overhead. But more often than not, all the formal action items might fall out of that, the highest ROI ones are, generally speaking, done informally.</p>

<h2 id="postmortem-evangelism">Postmortem Evangelism</h2>

<p>So, how do you spread this team’s good habits around and how do you create the circumstances in which a really good post mortem is possible? One thing you can do is highlight and embrace the improvements that organically happened between the incident and the retro. Make it normal and expected to immediately address urgent issues. Instead of asking “what can we do better tomorrow” ask “what is better now”. The general observation is “action items” generally just leads to a giant pile of remediation items that never get done because no one thought they were actually worth it.</p>

<p>It also helps if your postmortems are interesting to read because that’s probably how most people are going to see it, at least if your company is of any size. Postmortems must not be a) dry and boring, or b) so inscrutable that no one without a deep knowledge of the incident or the systems involved can understand it. Consider this while hiring potential postmortem authors, whether they can write or tell a story, and understand that telling people about their problems is key to actually getting what you want.</p>

<h2 id="management-approach">Management approach</h2>

<p>From a management perspective, it is important to change your expectations from a postmortem. Most teams view management within incident reviews with a fair bit of dread and anxiety unless they are there only to listen. Instead of saying “we need to have items so this NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN”, establish the expectation that there is an improvement but separate from the “learning” retro. The creation of those remediation items requires people to have a good idea of how to materially improve their product already, and also a good grasp on how to choose the right level of generality for their fix. In all probability, an incident for which you just had a postmortem, will not happen again exactly like that time, and also your remediations are changes that also have the potential to break things too. Instead, center the retro/learning around broadening the team’s knowledge so that next time (or five times down the line) they have good ideas. You can also look at incentivizing the improvements by framing learning about better practices as a growth or stretch opportunity. Owning or championing incident management for a team can convert to bigger opportunities to own a critical project. Spreading awareness of best incident management practices across teams can be seen as mentorship. You can provide company-wide visibility regarding the impact of improved incident management, by calling it out (and naming names/teams who did the work!) publicly somewhere where the management can see. The idea is to a) help them see that this work is critical and highly valued, rather than a literal or figurative chore that’s a lower priority than feature work and b) use it to help grow your incident commanders.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-impact-to-improve-adoption-and-learning">Measuring impact to improve adoption and learning</h2>

<p>One way engineering and product managers can see the need for improvement is by tracking the “impact on engineering” of incidents. The actual method might not be that important, but what is important is the realization that “this incident wasted so many hours we could have used more productively”. This can have more impact than by saying “we lost X in revenue”. It is also important to include generous “context switch” padding because in the hour after an incident nobody who is involved gets anything done.</p>

<p>Your teams need to be strong enough to be able to figure out how to improve their situation without “rewriting everything”. If you highlight on a regular basis the work that comes out of postmortem-team and how their $desirable_metric has gone up because of it, other teams may slowly follow. Having said that, I would caution against thinking correlation == causation.</p>

<h2>Render anything as HTML checkboxes</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Checkboxland is a JavaScript library for rendering anything as HTML checkboxes.</p>
<p>You can use it to display animations, text, and arbitrary data. It also supports plugins, so you can build more powerful APIs on top of it.</p>
<p>Checkboxland is dependency-free, framework-agnostic, and fun! 🙃</p>
<small>Why does this even exist? <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/06/06/checkboxland/">Here's some background</a>.</small>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Having lots of elements on a webpage <a href="https://web.dev/dom-size/">can impact runtime performance</a>. Checkboxes are no exception. Checkboxland attempts to mitigate some of these issues, but you'll likely run into performance issues if you are displaying large grids (1500+ checkboxes), and trying to update them rapidly.</p>
<p>For best results, stay below 1500 checkboxes. Some good sizes in this range include <code>32x32</code>, <code>48x24</code>, and <code>64x16</code>.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Install this package via npm:</p>
<pre><code>npm install checkboxland</code></pre>
<p>Import it into your application, and create a checkbox grid:</p>
<pre><code>import { Checkboxland } from 'checkboxland';

// Create a 16x16 checkbox grid inside `#my-container`
const cbl = new Checkboxland({
  dimensions: '16x16',
  selector: '#my-container'
});</code></pre>
<p>If no options are provided, the following defaults will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dimensions</code>: <code>'8x8'</code></li>
<li><code>selector</code>: <code>'#checkboxland'</code></li>
<li><code>fillValue</code>: <code>0</code> (meaning, all boxes are unchecked)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: if you really want to load it with a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, consider using an <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/">inline es6 module</a>, as shown below:</em></p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="module"&gt;
  import { Checkboxland } from 'https://unpkg.com/checkboxland?module';
  window.Checkboxland = Checkboxland;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>Let's display a heart on a checkbox grid:</p>
<pre><code>import { Checkboxland } from 'checkboxland';

const cbl = new Checkboxland({ dimensions: '8x7' });

// Create a data representation of the heart.
const heart = [
  [0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0],
  [1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0],
  [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],
  [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
];

// This updates the grid with the data we provided.
cbl.setData(heart);</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/docs/img/checkbox-heart.png" alt="a grid of checkboxes displaying the shape of a heart"></p>
<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>We created a JavaScript matrix (an array of arrays) to represent the grid. Each location in the matrix represents a checkbox, where:</p>

<p>By passing this matrix to our <code>setData()</code> method, we update the checkbox grid on the page.</p>
<p>For more ways to interact with the checkbox grid, see the API methods below.</p>
<h2>Low-level API</h2>
<p>The low-level API lets you update the checkbox grid with raw data.</p>
<h3>getCheckboxValue</h3>
<p>Gets the value of a single checkbox in the checkbox grid.</p>
<p>Requires an (x,y) coordinate to identify the checkbox location.</p>
<p><em>Note: the top-left corner of the grid represents the origin (0,0)</em>.</p>
<pre><code>.getCheckboxValue(x, y)</code></pre>

</ul>
<h4 id="getcheckboxvalue-returns">Returns</h4>
<p>(number): Returns a 0, 1, or 2 (where 0 represents "unchecked", 1 represents "checked", and 2 represents "indeterminate").</p>
<h3>setCheckboxValue</h3>
<p>Sets the value of a single checkbox in the checkbox grid.</p>
<p>Requires an (x, y) coordinate to identify the checkbox location.</p>

<p>(array): A matrix (array of arrays), representing the full state of the checkbox grid.</p>
<h3>setData</h3>
<p>Sets the values in the checkbox grid to those in the provided matrix.</p>
<p>By default, the matrix will overwrite the existing data in the grid, starting at the top-left corner. Options exist for more targeted data setting.</p>
<pre><code>.setData(data, [options])</code></pre>
<h4 id="setdata-arguments">Arguments</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>data</code> (array): A matrix (array of arrays), containing the data you want to set to the checkbox grid.</li>
<li><code>options</code> (object)
<ul>
<li><code>x</code> (number): The x-coordinate where you want to begin setting data. <em>Default: 0.</em></li>
<li><code>y</code> (number): The y-coordinate where you want to begin setting data. <em>Default: 0.</em></li>
<li><code>fillValue</code> (number): If the data you are setting won't fill the whole checkbox grid, you can optionally provide a checkbox value (0, 1, or 2) which will then be used to fill the leftover areas. <em>Default: <code>undefined</code>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="setdata-returns">Returns</h4>
<p>Nothing</p>
<h3>clearData</h3>
<p>Clears all data from the checkbox grid. Result: all checkboxes in the grid become unchecked.</p>
<pre><code>.clearData()</code></pre>
<h4 id="cleardata-arguments">Arguments</h4>
<p>None</p>
<h4 id="cleardata-returns">Returns</h4>
<p>Nothing</p>
<h3>getEmptyMatrix</h3>

<h4 id="cleardata-arguments">Arguments</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>options</code> (object)
<ul>
<li><code>fillValue</code> (number): The value you want to pre-populate the returned matrix with. <em>Default: 0.</em></li>
<li><code>width</code> (number): The width of the returned matrix (in columns). <em>Defaults to the width of the existing checkbox grid.</em></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cleardata-returns">Returns</h4>
<p>(array): A matrix (array of arrays), with the dimensions of the existing checkbox grid containing only <code>0</code> values (unless otherwise specified).</p>
<h2>Extended API</h2>
<p>Checkboxland comes with built-in plugins that extend the API with higher-level functionality. The following are the API methods provided by these "core" plugins.</p>
<h3>print</h3>
<p>Prints text to the checkbox grid. This text overwrites the existing checkbox grid, starting in the top left corner.</p>
<p>Most of the characters in <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/checkboxland/blob/master/src/plugins/print/font-5x7.js">the default font</a> are 5x7 checkboxes in size. Supported characters include the following:</p>
<pre><code>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789`<a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d4aaf594">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#$%^&amp;*()-_+=[]{}|\/;:"',.&lt;&gt;?</code></pre>
<p>For a working example, see <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/checkboxland/blob/master/docs/demos/textbox/demo.js">the textbox demo</a>.</p>
<pre><code>.print(text, [options])</code></pre>
<h4 id="print-arguments">Arguments</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>text</code> (string): The text you want printed to the checkbox grid.</li>
<li><code>options</code> (object)
<ul>
<li><code>font</code> (object): An object containing character data for a custom font, if you want to use one. For a working example, see <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/checkboxland/blob/master/docs/demos/clock/demo.js">the clock demo</a>.</li>
<li><code>x</code> (number): The x-coordinate where the text should start on the checkbox grid. <em>Default: 0.</em></li>
<li><code>y</code> (number): The y-coordinate where the text should start on the checkbox grid. <em>Default: 0.</em></li>
<li><code>fillValue</code> (number): If the text data won't fill the whole checkbox grid, you can (0, 1, or 2) which will then be used to fill the leftover areas. <em>Default: <code>undefined</code>.</em></li>
<li><code>dataOnly</code> (boolean): If <code>true</code>, returns a data matrix for the text instead of updating the checkbox grid. <em>Default: <code>false</code></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="print-arguments">Returns</h4>
<p>None, UNLESS <code>options.dataOnly</code> is set to <code>true</code>. If this is the case, it returns a matrix (array of arrays).</p>
<h3>marquee</h3>
<p>Animates a block of data, by making it scroll across the checkbox grid from right to left.</p>
<p>For a working example, see <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/checkboxland/blob/master/docs/demos/marquee/demo.js">the marquee demo</a>.</p>
<pre><code>.marquee(data, [options])</code></pre>

<li><code>callback</code> (function): A callback to be executed when the animation is complete.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="marquee-returns">Returns</h4>

<h2>Using Plugins</h2>
<p>Checkboxland supports plugins, which extend the API and provide higher-level functionality.</p>
<p>Here's a (realistic, but fake) example on how use a plugin to extend Checkboxland:</p>
<pre><code>import { Checkboxland } from 'checkboxland';
import mirrorPlugin from 'checkboxland-mirror';

Checkboxland.extend(mirrorPlugin);

const cbl = new Checkboxland();

// Mirror the data on the grid
cbl.mirror();</code></pre>
<p>You can see <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/checkboxland/blob/master/src/index.js">more examples of plugins being used in Checkboxland's core files</a>.</p>
<h3>Existing Plugins</h3>
<p><em>(if you write a 3rd-party plugin for Checkboxland, I'll list it here)</em></p>
<h2>Creating a Plugin</h2>
<p>Checkboxland plugins are just JavaScript functions that get special access to …</p></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/lawn-chair-curbside-sign.png"></p><p>As states have introduced restrictions in response to the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, most restaurant and retail organizations have worked quickly to shift operations to phone/online ordering and curbside pickup. While curbside pickup has reduced the number of in-person interactions required, each companys' implementation and success has been wildly different. Restaurants built on years of takeout/delivery experience are thriving while some sit-down restaurants and retail stores are struggling to adapt.</p> <p>Let's talk, with a smattering of snark and candor, about some of the curbside pickup experiences I've seen in the wild, where they fall short, and how they can be better.</p> <h2 id="what-do-customers-want"><a href="#what-do-customers-want">#</a> What do customers want?</h2> <p>I want to arrive, let you know I'm here, and get my order. That's it. No muss, no fuss.</p> <p>This is surprisingly difficult to find. Let's dive into some of the major pain points.</p> <h3 id="don-t-force-me-to-go-inside-your-establishment"><a href="#don-t-force-me-to-go-inside-your-establishment">#</a> Don't force me to go inside your establishment</h3> <p>We aren't all wearing holsters strapped with lysol cans looking for germs to spray. If you aren't enforcing <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social distancing guidelines</a> and promoting customer/employee safety in public, I don't have high confidence you're doing so behind closed doors.</p> <blockquote><p>Customers are unlikely to return if they feel required to sanitize all goods purchased from your business.</p></blockquote> <p>We know your top priority is keeping your staff healthy and your building clean so it can stay open. In addition to the impact on sick employees and their families, you're facing a quarantine, deep cleaning, and sanitization. This is a huge expenditure and loss of revenue that lasts beyond reopening day. No one is champing at the bit to patronize a business immediately after a reported COVID-19 outbreak.</p> <p>Even if your state is re-opening, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported cases</a> continue to rise. This isn't going away anytime soon.</p> <p>Limit exposure to limit business risk.</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of forcing me to go inside, make me wait outside of the building, in my car, or outdoors. I don't need to be breathing on you or another customer's food.</p> <h3 id="don-t-make-me-install-an-app"><a href="#don-t-make-me-install-an-app">#</a> Don't make me install an app</h3> <p>I know, I know. You've got an app. You want to send me push notifications with the latest deals. Bump those engagement metrics, I get it.</p> <blockquote><p>Not all customers want to be part of your loyalty program.</p></blockquote> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/office-depot-curbside-sign.png" width="55%"></p><p>The app might be a worthwhile experience once I have it, but think about how this plays out for those who don't. We’re expecting a quick interaction and pickup and this isn’t it.</p> <p>I pull into the parking lot to pick up my order of Sriracha, Lucky Charms, and toilet paper. Before I can get my order I have to wait to download your app, accept permissions, and sign up for an account. Do I already have an account? What is my password? I have to do all of this just to let you know that I’m here to pick up my order. Too many hoops that take too long.</p> <p>What is the market penetration for your app amongst your customer base? What percentage of those customers without the app will purchase for curbside pickup? These are all of the customers that are negatively impacted by this process.</p> <blockquote><p>"I should receive my order and leave in less time than it takes me to download your app."</p></blockquote>  <p>Consumer of goods and services</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of an app, why not a website? I don't have to download it and it's accessible by every smartphone on the planet. Make it available via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QR code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFC tag</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short url</a>. Heck, include it in my receipt. Viewing a website and providing my information is infinitely (math checks out) faster than installing an app.</p> <h3 id="do-not-make-me-wait-on-hold"><a href="#do-not-make-me-wait-on-hold">#</a> Do not make me wait on hold</h3> <p>You only have one phone line that you're using for curbside pickup calls and taking new orders. Not great.</p> <p>Einstein wrote a paper in 1905 positing that <code>flavor = time * salt / moisture ^ 2</code>. Once it enters that clamshell, takeout food has a shelf life of around four seconds. The longer I have to wait to notify you that I'm waiting decreases the quality of the food exponentially. Soggy burger buns make me question returning to your restaurant and humanity in general.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/red-robin-curbside-sign.png" width="30%"></p><blockquote><p>Help me help you.</p></blockquote> <p>Don't make me block your phone line from taking new orders while I tell you that I'm in parking spot #4 driving a Pontiac Fiero and would like extra ketchup. How many potential customers call back a restaurant to make an order if the line is busy? How many potential food orders are <em>you</em> losing?</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of waiting on hold, I'd rather do <strong>anything</strong> else. Do you have a business line with multiple numbers? Use a different one to separate orders and pickups. Use different phone extensions. Use anything other than the phone for pickups if it's going to be in contention!</p> <h3 id="don-t-ask-for-redundant-information"><a href="#don-t-ask-for-redundant-information">#</a> Don't ask for redundant information</h3> <p>Why do you need my name <em>and</em> order ID? Why aren't your order IDs unique? A description of my car? I just gave you the reserved pickup parking spot number I'm in.</p> <p>I'm wearing a hat. Does that help?</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/restaurant-touch-app.png" width="35%"></p><p>I made a curbside pickup at a big box electronics company recently. I filled out the required online check in form upon arrival. A worker came to my car, asked me if I had filled out the form and then proceeded to ask me for the <em>same exact information</em> that I had already provided.</p> <blockquote><p>Don't ask for three pieces of information when one will suffice and sure as heck don’t ask twice!</p></blockquote> <p>Dr. Seuss</p> <p>Ambassador of curbside pickup, Whoville.</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of asking for more, change your workflow to ask for less. To complete a curbside pickup, you only need information for the following:</p> <ul><li>Uniquely identify an order</li> <li>Identify my current physical location</li></ul> <p>Leverage technology for this.</p> <p>Provide customers unique order identifiers in their email receipts that can be easily referenced. Identify your reserved curbside pickup spaces with separate phone extensions or unique QR codes. Customers notifying you that they are waiting will automatically have location context provided. Are they in parking spot #3? Are they at the side door? That's another piece of information you don't have to ask for and they don't have to think about.</p>  <p>With all that said, I am biased. I have a <s>dog</s> soggy bun in this fight. I built <a href="https://routegy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Routegy</a> to create wonderful customer experiences within physical spaces and since the COVID-19 pandemic, people have started leveraging it to improve their own curbside pickup experiences.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/orenji-curbside-sign.png" width="50%"></p><p>With <a href="https://routegy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Routegy</a>, you can create signage outside of your establishment with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QR codes</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFC tags</a> that customers can interact with directly from their phones. Customers are asked for <strong>only</strong> the information you need to identify their order and Routegy will gather the rest. That's it. <strong>No app required!</strong></p> <p>With Routegy’s integrations, employees inside are instantly notified when customers arrive and have relevant order information at their fingertips. Once an order is delivered to the customer, it can simply be marked as done.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/trello-curbside-waitlist.png"></p><h3 id="want-to-learn-more"><a href="#want-to-learn-more">#</a> Want to learn more?</h3> <p>Routegy is helping a number of local businesses in the Washington area with contactless curbside pickup. Take a look at <a href="https://blog.routegy.com/2020/06/18/orenji-streamline-curbside-pickup-routegy/">our case study for Orenji Sushi &amp; Noodles</a>, our <a href="https://docs.routegy.com/tutorial/streamline-curbside.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contactless curbside pickup tutorial</a>, or contact us at <a href="mailto:connect@routegy.com">connect@routegy.com</a>.</p> <h3 id="don-t-want-to-use-routegy"><a href="#don-t-want-to-use-routegy">#</a> Don't want to use Routegy?</h3> <p>Hey, that's fine too. I hope after reading this that you've discovered some ways to improve your own curbside experience to build loyal customers and fans.</p> <p>Using different tools/technology?

June 30, 2020 | https://www.rdsaunders.co.uk/indieweb/2019/12/03/post-short-notes-to-a-jekyll-blog-using-ios-shortcut | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.rdsaunders.co.uk/indieweb/2019/12/03/post-short-notes-to-a-jekyll-blog-using-ios-shortcut">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>As I take steps to host all my content to my site first, I wanted to start adding notes and eventually push these to Twitter.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://indieweb.org/note">Indieweb</a> defines a note as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A note is a post that is typically short unstructured plain text, written &amp; posted quickly, that has its own permalink page. Creating, publishing, and owning your own notes is a key step towards reducing dependence on Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently created an iOS shortcut to post a photo to the photos section of my site. In the same vain this post outlines another iOS shortcut that I created to post a short note.</p>
<h2>Note collection</h2>
<p>As this site is currently built using Jekyll, I setup a new collection called notes that would be available at <a href="http://www.rdsaunders.co.uk/notes">www.rdsaunders.co.uk/notes</a>.</p>
<p>Each note is based on the time stamp that its is created to provide a unique URL that can eventually be posted to Twitter or shared elsewhere. Once the collection was setup and I had a listing to display all the notes I set about creating a note shortcut.</p>
<h2>iOS Shortcut</h2>
<p>This shortcut is a relatively simple one. The main effort was creating the file name from the current date/time stamp. The shortcut takes advantage of the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#create-or-update-a-file">GitHub API</a> to submit the note directly to my repo on GitHub.</p>
<p>I’m using Netlify to build and host my site so once the note is committed, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> sees the changes in my repository then builds and deploys the changes.</p>
<p>You can download a copy of the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/63116bd5272d415199f3805d65e85bca">iOS Shortcut</a> for yourself. When installing the shortcut you’ll need to configure it with your own GitHub credentials.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>GitHub username</strong> – used to authenticate to the GitHub API</li>
<li><strong>GitHub repository name</strong> – the repository you are uploading to.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub personal access token</strong> – this must have read/write access to the appropriate repository. View the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line">Github docs</a> to find out how to create a access token.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub committer</strong> <strong>name</strong> and <strong>email address</strong> – used when committing files to the repository.</li>
<li><strong>Note upload path</strong> – where the markdown file should be created e.g. _notes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What the shortcut does</h2>
<ol>
<li>The shortcut asks you: What do you want to say? This text is used as the note.</li>
<li>Uses the current date and time to generate a unique filename e.g 201912302911.md.</li>
<li>BASE 64 encodes the text to send to GitHub.</li>
<li>Creates and uploads a markdown file containing the date, and the notes text via the GitHub API.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Yaml front matter structure</h2>
<table>
    <caption>A table explaining how the front matter is populated</caption>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th>Front matter field</th>
        <th>Data population</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>date</td>
        <td>Uses the creation date of the note.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>content</td>
        <td>The note text is used in the primary content area of the markdown file.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Notes / quirks</h2>
<ul>
<li>The shortcut relies on access to <a href="https://shrtcts.app/">https://shrtcts.app/</a> to use some of the date / string utilities.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="frontend-stack">Frontend Stack</h2>
<p>Until somewhat recently, I think that hosting was probably a more important concern for creating a personal site than the frontend stack. But with options like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the hosting part of the equation has become a whole lot easier. Nowadays a personal site is all about what you build it with. I think it's fair to say most people looking to build a personal site are, in equal parts, wanting to get a professional foothold on the web and also just have fun building something new. And when building something new, there is a whole lot of new out there. So much so, that many people cannot even bring themselves to begin because they're afraid of picking the wrong stack.</p>
<h3 id="picking-a-framework">Picking A Framework</h3>
<p>A good question to ask yourself when picking a framework is which of the two following focuses is most important to you.</p>
<h4 id="1-javascript">1) Javascript</h4>
<p>Javascript, the necessary evil turned eternal turf war, is probably at top of mind for most people looking to build a personal site in order to "play with new tech". This is also a great splitter of options if you do know what javascript framework you want to work in. If you still cannot decide on a framework, then you probably have more this vs that javascript framework articles to read.</p>
<h5 id="react">React</h5>
<p>If you must work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsbyjs</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> are very popular and capable options. Gatsbyjs takes a more holistic approach between the frontend and the backend whereas Nextjs is mostly concerned with creating a static and ssr environment for React apps.</p>
<h5 id="vuejs">VueJs</h5>
<p>If you must work with Vuejs (my personal favorite), <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxtjs</a> (what <a href="https://formcake.com/">formcake.com</a> is build on), <a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</a>, and <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a> are all great options. As is often the case in the world of Vue, it is often easiest to compare Vue based project's with their React equivalents. Gridsome is like Gatsbyjs and Nuxtjs is like Nextjs. VuePress is much more targeted to those who want to create a site for blogging.</p>
<h5 id="angular">Angular</h5>
<p>I cannot really imagine someone making a personal site in Angular unless they really want to force themselves to learn Angular for a job of some kind but there is an interesting <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> static site generator project called <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully">Scully</a> that I have been meaning to try. If anyone reading this has played with Scully, send me your thoughts to <a href="mailto:david@formcake.com">david@formcake.com</a>.</p>
<h5 id="x-cool-kid-framework">X Cool Kid Framework</h5>
<p>You are on your own.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are more concerned with creating a blog and how a framework's authoring experience works than what technology powers the rendering of html. X JS forward frameworks tend to require a lot more configuration than those made specifically for creating a simple site. If this is your situation, you are in luck. There are tons of options and they are all fantastic for this purpose. I will go more in depth on some of these options since they are more tailored for a small perosnal site.</p>
<h5 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h5>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the one of the oldest static site generators that made authoring a top concern with its use of Markdown. Built in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Jekyll was part of the Rails era of web development where developer productivity was considered paramount to everything else. Jekyll is still very popular but is a bit of a non starter for many because it is built in Ruby. Still a great choice for a developer blog but you will have to use RubyGems instead of NPM.</p>
<h5 id="hugo">Hugo</h5>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a more modren framework than Jekyll. It tries to solve more problems out of the box than Jekyll, is more flexible, and considers the speed at which it creates pages to be a top concern. Part of Hugo's popularity comes from the fact that it is written in Go. This contributes to its speed but also contributes to some of the annoying aspects about it. Go is an interesting language but most of us don't have the opportunity to use it in our work. It is therefore best for those who love Go and don't mind using Go's templating libraries. You will also have to give up NPM if you choose Hugo.</p>
<h5 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h5>
<p>One of the newest kids on the block, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is somewhere inbetween Hugo and Jekyll. It's focus is on flexibility and speed. It is super modular so it does take a little bit more time to get setup but for those looking for flexiblity, Eleventy has it in spades. It supports 11 templating language and best of all, it is a node library so you can use NPM for your entire project. This may be my personal choice if I were creating a new blog.</p>
<h2 id="other-concerns">Other Concerns</h2>
<h4 id="3-static">3) Static????</h4>
<p>Yes. In 2020 there is no reason to choose a framework that does not support static generation of pages for a small personal website. Every framework listed above supports static generation. If you need to be convinced of the power of static websites, checkout <a href="https://jamstack.org/">jamstack.org</a> which does a good job of going into all the benifits.</p>
<h4 id="4-hosting">4) Hosting</h4>
<p>As long as we have made the decision to use static generation, hosting is quite easy. There are still a lot of options however. Here are some of the top options and some of the thinking for when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="netlify">Netlify</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is the hosting platform behind the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> movement. Founded in 2014, Netlify has grown rather quickly and has become the defacto hosting platform for static sites. With Netlify you can host static sites, deploy lambdas, and create git based workflows with extreme ease. I would recommend Netlify above all other options for a personal site.</p>
<h5 id="vercel-previously-zeit">Vercel (Previously Zeit)</h5>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is a very similar hosting platform as Netlify. Founded in 2015, Vercel boasts a fully featured platform for hosting static sites including git workflows and lambdas. I have used Vercel for years and I can recommend it. Vercel is a solid choice but I would recommend Netlify above Vercel for a fully featured static hosting platform.</p>
<h5 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h5>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> is quite an old option in the space of static website hosting. Launched in 2008 Github pages originally only supported Jekyll and static files but now supports other frameworks through some configuration. Github pages was once unique in that it automatically was integreted into your github account but this is now a common feature with the likes of Netlify and Vercel. Github pages is underpowered at this point but will always be free. If you want to host something simple and never think about it again, Github pages may be just the right choice.</p>
<h5 id="firebase">Firebase</h5>
<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a platform as a service hosting provider that has some seriously robust features and is backed by Google. Firebase is not a static website hosting provider and aims to solve much more complicated issues around creating and hosting a sophisticated web application. The only reason you would want to choose Firebase is if you wanted authentication for some reason. Firebase allows for simple authentication and storage via it's flagship features <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth">Firebase Authentication</a> and Firebase <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database">Realtime Database</a>. Firebase may also be a good option if you want to play with server tech but don't want to go too deep into the subject.</p>
<h5 id="heroku">Heroku</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> lit the world of application hosting on fire in 2007 when it made hosting a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application as simple as a couple of key strokes using the Heroku CLI. Like Firebase, Heroku aims to solve much more complex problems than a simple static website but is a great system for those who like to tinker with their backend. Heroku is for those who need to solve more complicated problems like storage or authentication, but want to do it with open source software instead of google invented technologies. If you are building a personal site to learn server tech, Heroku is a great option.</p>
<h4 id="5-apis">5) APIs</h4>
<p>Assuming you went with one of the hosting platforms specifically designed for simple static websites, you may be wondering "But what if I need a server for X". You are in luck, there is a great resource created by <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyer</a>, of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> fame, that lists services that are great for static websites without a server, <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major">https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major</a>. <a href="http://formcake.com/">Formcake</a> also perfectly solves the problem of how to create a contact form on a static website. Formcake is committed to always having a useful free tier for developers with small projects. Consider checking it out the next time you tackle building your personal site.</p>

Students at Yale will dine at the&nbsp;<em>Schwarzman Center</em>&nbsp;for decades to come, courtesy of the Blackstone founder’s massive $150 million gift.</p><p>In addition to fortifying one’s legacy, not only does wealth&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;perish – it grows – courtesy of compound interest (the so-called&nbsp;<em>eighth wonder of the world</em>). And when properly allocated, it can beget more wealth… and more wealth…</p><p>Much ink has been spilled about the “playbook” to achieve said wealth. The metaphors usually involve&nbsp;<a href="https://nathanbarry.com/wealth-creation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ladders</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/climbing-the-wealth-ladder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">step functions</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BootyX5ASIY/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pyramids</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://moretothat.com/money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vertical spectrums</a>. This trajectory is “Maslowian:” first basic needs, next psychological needs and ultimately culminating in fulfillment and self-actualization.</p><p>Along this journey, one increases their autonomy and freedom – while&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://radreads.co/time-is-money/">converting money into time</a>.</strong></p><p>Enter the perishability.</p><hr><p>Watts use the metaphor of his “childish desire to send someone a parcel of water in the mail.” In this flippant example:</p><blockquote><p><em>The recipient unties the string, releasing the deluge in his lap. But the game would never work, since it is irritatingly impossible to wrap and tie a pound of water in a paper package.</em></p></blockquote><p>You know what’s also&nbsp;<em>irritatingly impossible to wrap and tie?</em>&nbsp;<strong>Autonomy, freedom, and time.&nbsp;</strong>Just like your corporate vacation policy, they all share the distinct perishability property of&nbsp;<strong>“use it or lose it.”</strong></p><hr><p>Why the&nbsp;<em>memento mori</em>, so early on a Saturday?</p><p>It means that the tiny speckles of life are infinitesimal sources of wealth. An idea that I actually find quite calming.</p><p>In Peter Barton’s memoir <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2NDS5I2">Not Fade Away</a></em>, the 47 year old media entrepreneur – hugely successful, happily married, and the father of three – receives a sudden cancer diagnosis.</p><p>In this moving passage, Barton describes a jet ski trip he takes with his then-teenage daughter. Frail and breathing oxygen through tubes coming from his backpack, together they:</p><blockquote><p><em>Zipped and bounced along. Kate held on to my back; her cheek was against my shoulder. It was like she was a little girl again, and I was a young and healthy and protecting father.</em></p><p><em>We explored a bunch of little coves around the resort. The water was a hundred shades of blue and green; sunlight glinted off it so brightly that it almost hurt. Everything amazed us; we just pointed at things and giggled.</em></p><p><em>I choke up when I recall this story. But not because I’m sad. Because there’s more joy in the recollection that I can hold.&nbsp;</em><strong><em>There was a lifetime worth of pleasure in that single day.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>In that moment, Barton encounters imperishable wealth: <em>“That excursion on the water taught me that each moment is a life, that life is renewed every time we’re walloped by beauty, every time we’re shaken up by gratitude and love.</em>​<em>“</em></p><div><div id="tve_tcb2_blank" data-state="2" data-form-state=""><div data-tl-type="shortcode_580"><div><div id="tve_editor"><div data-css="tve-u-05d5f19b06f29a"><p data-tag="h2"><h2 data-css="tve-u-15d5f19b06f2d4">Stop letting Monday ruin Sunday</h2></p><p data-css="tve-u-35d5f19b06f343">Join 17,115 RadReaders who kissed the&nbsp;<em>Sunday Scaries</em>&nbsp;goodbye!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Information architecture is one of the most important user experience elements of a website because it directly affects navigation, often affects URL structure, and it is important to both SEO and conversion optimization. On ecommerce websites, product “merchandising” may impact aspects of information architecture. To ensure that users can find the information they are looking for as quickly and as easily as possible, it is important to understand the technical differences between categories and attributes.</p><h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2><p>Attributes are a form of <em>description</em> which outline the properties of an object (a product, a blog post, a user, etc.). An attribute defines an <em>objective</em> feature or quality regarded as a characteristic or inherent part of an object. Generally attributes are <em>immutable</em>, meaning they do not change over time. However, there are some attributes, such as a product’s rating or price, that may change over time. A single item may have a number of different attributes, but generally each item will have only one value for each attribute.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Attributes are generally <em>adjectives</em>.</p><p>Not all attributes need to be visible to a user, however attributes that are displayed may be combined <a href="https://schema.org/">with special markup</a> and other technology to provide relevant information to search robots, crawlers, and assistive technology. This information can be used to enhance search results and provide a superior user experience. For example, attributes allow items to be easily compared, and because attributes may represent values on a range, attributes can be used to easily filter a large collection of items. This helps users quickly locate items that meet a specified criteria.</p><p>A t-shirt has a <em>size</em>, <em>color</em>, and <em>style</em> (and many other attributes like <em>price</em>, <em>manufacturer</em>, <em>material</em>, and <em>rating</em>). A consumer may want to compare <em>price</em> and <em>rating</em> for <em>black</em>, <em>v-neck</em> t-shirts that are either <em>small</em> or <em>medium</em>. Through the use of attributes, these types of complex filters and comparisons are made possible. The more accurately an object is described through attributes, the easier it will be to search, sort, or filter the object.</p><h2 id="categories">Categories</h2><p>Categories are a form of <em>classification</em>, or grouping, according to shared qualities or characteristics. Categories (sometimes referred to as “collections”) are <em>subjective</em> collections of items that may be curated manually or automatically based on a set of predefined rules. Categorization is subject to change over time and may be hierarchical, meaning that each category may have sub-classifications that allow a collection of items to be further refined. Objects may also exist simultaneously in any number of categories.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Categories are generally <em>nouns</em>.</p><p>Categorization is heavily reliant upon marketing and merchandising and often defines a website’s URL structure and navigation, therefor it has a pronounced impact on both user experience and SEO.</p><h2 id="crossover">Crossover</h2><p>On ecommerce sites, it is common for an important attribute value to also be used as a category; this may happen if an attribute is particularly popular, necessary in navigation or SEO, or is essential to marketing. Generally when attributes must be surfaced as categories, it is best to automate the categorization with rules so that the overhead of catalog maintenance remains low.</p><p>It may be helpful to think of categories as shelves, drawers or containers to place items inside of. Moving an item from one container to another does not change the qualities of the object itself (it’s attributes), but it does change it’s classification (category).</p><p>Going back to our previous t-shirt example, a v-neck t-shirt may be included in a “Featured” category which highlights items that are highly valued by customers or business objectives; this type of category would not need to rely on an attribute because being “featured” is not an objective quality of the t-shirt itself, instead it is a subjective grouping. The same v-neck t-shirt may also appear in a “V-necks” category that is populated automatically with all the available v-neck t-shirts. This “promotion” of the <em>style</em> attribute will allow visitors to locate the item, and other similar items more quickly particularly if the category is featured prominently in navigation, and by appearing in search results.</p></div></article></div>]]>

<p>Some time ago I decided to build a personal website that would last through time. So nothing fancy, no cool animations, no pages, almost no JavaScript and 3rd party services just a plain single page with my basic who-i-am Infos and contact information. And I realized that plan with a static website built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/" title="Hugo">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>But today after some planning and brainstorming, I decided to make updates to this website but keeping in mind the principles I’ve set to myself from the begging.</p>
<p>So here is what’s changed…</p>
<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
<p>I have had my website hosted on <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" title="Firebase">Firebase</a> for more than a year or two because it was free and with a pretty simple deployment procedure using their CLI tool. After some research, I decided to give a try to <a href="https://netlify.com/" title="Netlify">Netlify</a>, which has a much more generous free plan than Firebase. But what really made me switch to Netlify was their automatic deployment. After setting up the build commands, Netlify would make a new build and deploy on every git commit, so cool!</p>
<h2 id="optimizations">Optimizations</h2>
<p>Initially, I would build a website and pass it through some <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" title="Gulp">Gulp</a> modules for code minification and optimizations. But that operation could be expensive on Netlify since on a free plan you have only 300 minutes of monthly build time. This is more than enough for this kind of website but I wanted not to worry about that in the future, so I removed gulp and moved all minifications and optimizations to <a href="https://cloudflare.com/" title="Cloudflare">Cloudflare</a>, which also takes care of caching and content distribution across their CDN network.</p>
<h2 id="content-management">Content management</h2>
<p>The biggest change was the implementation of blogging functionality, which I was missing right from the begging. Doing this was fairly straightforward in Hugo, I even made “works” section to share past and current projects. Hugo also provides out-of-box shortcodes for more dynamic content like YouTube, Twitter post.. etc. Everything went flawlessly.</p>
<p>The only thing I wanted less “technical” was how I was managing content. Which is, I would open Vim, edit content, and push the change to GitHub. This approach is ok, but I wanted to edit the content from anywhere and without CLI.</p>
<p>So the solution was <a href="https://forestry.io/" title="Forestry">Forestry</a>, which is Git-based CMS with support for Hugo. It’s a free service for up to 3 websites, and it does just what I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>Adding blogging functionality also brings images and this where it can get tricky. Hugo already provides some basic image processing functionality but the implementation is not that easy and if not handled well all of the free build time and bandwidth would be used. So I moved all of the images hosting and manipulation to the <a href="https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/eguswydqkh52glxjybrs" title="Cloudinary">Cloudinary</a> service.</p>
<p>Cloudinary has a powerful manipulation API, where I manage all placeholders and responsive images through their HTTP-based API parameters. Besides that, with their free hosting plan I would off-load the unnecessary bandwidth usage from Netlify.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That’s it as of the upgrades, I hope you like and found useful my first blog post.</p>

Here's part of their conversation.</p>  <p><strong>Is there any doubt about the outcome of this referendum?</strong></p>  <p>There is no doubt. Putin is 100-per-cent&nbsp;risk-averse. He only does things in advance, when he knows the outcome.</p>  <p>That outcome is that the presidency will be effectively extended into perpetuity for him. It may not say that exactly on the documents, but that's the intention.</p>  <p>And then when he runs for president — which will also be a predetermined outcome — he'll then be re-elected and will serve as president for life.</p>    <p><strong>And yet this government is so desperate to secure a high voter turnout in order to lend more legitimacy to this referendum. Why is that so important to Putin, if he's got it all sewn up anyway?</strong></p>  <p>Well, what does he have sewn up? He can cheat —&nbsp;change the numbers if he wants. He controls the television stations. He can put pressure on people.</p>  <p>But people do have to vote in a referendum, and if the outcome is so dramatically different — or if people think that the outcome is so dramatically different — than what they intended to do, people could rise up.</p>  <p>That's his fear. He doesn't fear courts or parliaments or media, but he fears 142 million Russian people who — you know, all you need is a million people rising up and then he's going to hightail it to some friendly state that will give him asylum.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>He doesn't fear courts or parliaments or media, but he fears 142 million Russian people.<svg focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="23px" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g display="none"><g display="inline"><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg></span><cite>- Bill Browder</cite></span></blockquote>    <p><strong>If he stepped down or if he lost power, what do you think his fate would be?</strong></p>  <p>Well, it's clear&nbsp;he's committed so many crimes —&nbsp;he's stolen so much money — that if he were not in power he'd be arrested by his successor, put in jail, stripped of all of his money, and possibly worse.</p>  <p><strong>This is happening as there are indications that Vladimir Putin is more unpopular inside Russia than he's ever been.</strong></p>  <p><strong>The coronavirus is hitting the country hard, the economy is tanking.

    <p>People are amazing creatures. When discussing a complex issue, they are able to keep multiple independent
arguments in their heads, the pieces of supporting and disproving evidence, and can collapse this system
into a concrete solution. We can spend hours navigating through the issue comments on Github, reconstructing
the points of view, and making sense of the discussion. Problem is: we don’t actually want to apply this
superpower and waste time nearly as often.</p>

<h2 id="problem-with-technical-discussions">Problem with technical discussions</h2>

<p>Have you heard of <code>async</code> in Rust? Ever wondered why the core team opted into a completely new syntax for this feature? Let’s dive in and find out! Here is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640">#57640</a> with 512 comments, kindly asking everyone to check <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50547">#50547</a> (with just 308 comments) before expressing their point of view. Following this discussion must have been exhausting. I don’t know how it would be possible to navigate it without the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640#issuecomment-456624074">summary</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640#issuecomment-456625030">comments</a>.</p>

<p>Another example is the loop syntax in WebGPU. Issue <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/569">#569</a> has only 70 comments, with multiple attempts to <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/569#issuecomment-610041440">summarize</a> the discussion in the middle. It would probably take a few hours at the minimum to get a gist of the group reasoning for somebody from the outside. And that doesn’t include the call transcripts.</p>

<p>Github has emojis which allow certain comments to show more support. Unfortunately, our nature is such that comments are getting liked when we agree with them, not when they advance the discussion in a constructive way. They are all over the place and don’t really help.</p>

<p>What would help though is having a non-linear structure for the discussion. Trees! They make following HN and Reddit threads much easier, but they too have problems. Sometimes, a really important comment is buried deep in one of the branches. Plus, trees don’t work well for a dialog, when there is some back-and-forth between people.</p>

<p>That brings us to the point: most technical discussions are <em>terrible</em>. Not in a sense that people can’t make good points and progress through it, but rather that there is no structure to a discussion, and it’s too hard to follow. What I see in reality is a lot of focus from a very few dedicated people, and delegation by the other ones to those focused. Many views get misrepresented, and many perspectives never heard, because the flow of comments quickly filters out most potential participants.</p>

<h2 id="structured-discussion">Structured discussion</h2>

<p>My first stop in the search of a solution was on <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>. It is successfully used by many communities, including <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">Rust users</a>. Unfortunately, it still has linear structure, and doesn’t bring a lot to the table on top of Github. Try following <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-2020-growth/34956">this discussion
</a> about Rust in 2020 for example.</p>

<p>Then I looked at platforms designed specifically for a structured argumentation. One of the most popular today is <a href="https://www.kialo.com/">Kialo</a>. I haven’t done a good evaluation on it, but it seemed that Kialo isn’t targeted at engineers, and it’s a platform that we’d have to register in for use. Wishing to use Markdown with a system like that, I stumbled upon <a href="https://argdown.org/">Argdown</a>, and realized that it concluded my search.</p>

<p>Argdown introduces a syntax for defining the structure of an argument in text. Statements, arguments, propositions, conclusions - it has it all, written simply in your text editor (especially if its VSCode, for which there is a plugin), or in the <a href="https://argdown.org/sandbox/html">playground</a>. It has command-line tools to produce all sorts of derivatives, like dot graphs, web components, JSON, you name it, from an <code>.argdown</code> file. Naturally, formatting with Markdown in it is also supported.</p>

<p>That discovery led me to two questions. (1) - what would an <em>existing</em> debate look like in such a system? And (2) - how could we shift the workflow towards using one?</p>

<p>So I picked the most contentious topic in WebGPU discussions and tried to reconstruct it. Topic was about choosing the shading language, and why SPIR-V wasn’t accepted. It was discussed by the W3C group over the course of 2+ years, and it’s evident that there is <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/847#issuecomment-642497578">some</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23089745">misunderstanding</a> of why the decision was made to go with WGSL, taking Google’s Tint proposal as a starting point.</p>

<p>I attempted to reconstruct the debate in https://github.com/kvark/webgpu-debate, building the <a href="https://github.com/kvark/webgpu-debate/blob/b28252ea99aef8989858ece09f74dc0758e3d46c/arguments/SPIR-V.argdown">SPIR-V.argdown</a> with the first version of the argumentation graph, solving (1). The repository accepts pull requests that are checked by CI for syntax correctness, inviting everyone to collaborate, solving (2). Moreover, the artifacts are automatically uploaded to Github-pages, rendering the <a href="https://kvark.github.io/webgpu-debate/SPIR-V.component.html">discussion</a> in a way that is easy to explore.</p>

<h2 id="way-forward">Way forward</h2>

<p>I’m excited to have this new way of preserving and growing the structure of a technical debate. We can keep using the code hosting platforms, and arguing on the issues and PR, while solidifying the core points in these <code>.argdown</code> files. I hope to see it applied more widely to the workflows of technical working groups.</p>

One, product based on an idea you have. Two, trying to solve your own problem. And three, solving an audience’s problem.</p><p>Let’s start with the first one, which is building a product based on an idea you have. In this case you’re basically saying you have some insight about how the world works and you’re curious to see if you’re right about that.</p><p>This is pretty dangerous because effectively you’re hoping you understand the world correctly. You’re hoping there are people that find the problem you’re solving important. You’re also hoping people actually understand and like your solution. And lastly, you’re betting on the fact that you can go out and then go find these people who meet all this criteria.</p><p>A fun one I’ve tried to do before was where we said, Hey, what about mothers of newborns who are trying to lose weight? Right. Absolutely no grounding in reality, we just thought maybe that’s a problem. They’re probably going to be super tired, super short on time. Why don’t we create a thing called MyMammaFit and see how this turns out.</p><p>So we didn’t actually build anything other than a landing page cause we were so concerned that this could be a complete nonsense. And then we use this landing page to go to a bunch of Facebook groups and reach out to newborn mothers to see what they thought of this type of idea. Definitely felt like we were maybe incorrect about how the world works in that case.</p><p>After a bunch of conversations, it was so clear that we knew so little about what’s going on there that we just decided to pivot to an audience we were more familiar with.</p><p>This is where you see some really wacky consumer ideas and… Which is fine, a lot of successful products started out as wacky ideas like Facebook and Microsoft. But when this goes wrong is when someone spends months or years building something out only to be very, very frustrated at the end of it when no one wants what they’ve built.</p><p>This works well, when you set a hard limit, like a week or a day, and then you build the thing out and then you just search and search and search to figure all those questions out. Like, where are the people who want this thing? Who are they? And a lot of times you’ll even find whatever you’ve built doesn’t work exactly how you meant it to. But with the help of the audience you discover you can iterate based on their feedback.</p><p>So ultimately lots and lots of feedback that you get after just building something in a day or a week will allow you to start destroying a lot of the ambiguity around your idea.</p><p>I think another ironic place where products get built based on ideas of the world is inside of large corporations. It’s ironic because large corporations have so much information qualitatively and quantitatively about what people want. And on top of that they have a huge audience to start with but then sometimes you’ll see a product come out of a lot of group think and with no real customer involved. And end up as a disaster.</p><p>I think Hacker news posts I recently saw talked about how Sun* built this computer that allowed you to work remotely from anywhere with just a little card. And they had all their employees using this amazing software and loving it actually and this isn’t like 1990 or something.</p><p>And when they try to get people to buy this in the real world. Well, no one used Solaris* and no one was ready for this sort of solution. It was so ahead of its time. So because they weren’t grounded in the reality of the world even though their idea was great. It just never took off.</p><p>To end on a positive one for this one, it’s Zappos. If you’ve heard the story. They thought, Hey, do people want to buy shoes online? And they had no idea, but the internet was something that was becoming popular. So they went downstairs where there was a shoe store, took a bunch of pictures of the shoes. Then, posted those pictures online and set up their product that way.</p><p>Then when people actually bought the shoes, they would just go downstairs, purchase those same shoes at the same price and ship it to them. This was an amazing way to validate that, yes, in fact, people did want to buy shoes online. And it only took them I believe a day or a couple of days to figure this out.</p><p>The next one is about building something for yourself, solving your own problem. This one’s great because you’re probably not gonna want to build something that’s not very important to you. And if you’re honest with yourself, you’ll know if it’s a good solution or not. On top of that you’ll probably hang out with people similar to you. That’s just human nature. And then of course if things do pick up and you get traction, you’ll already know some of the next steps of what to build.</p><p>Really the risk is whether or not you’re so unique that there’s only a hundred more people like you a thousand more people. There’s a very little market. Y Combinator is huge on preaching this approach and that’s because beyond the nice properties of it, even if it is a tiny audience that you get ahold of initially you can then use adjacent value propositions to get the value out to more people. Or you can look for adjacent markets that will also enjoy your solution.</p><p>It gives you an audience to then iterate and build with, even if ultimately it doesn’t end up being your final audience. This is great cause then you’re not building something in a vacuum. You’re not just taking an idea, like we talked about in the first approach and then hoping your reality of the world is correct.</p><p>Let’s talk about what being honest with yourself is about. One instance of this that I’ve personally experienced is when we built a meal planner for losing weight. The idea was meal planner that allows you to cook food that’s delicious yet still lose weight. This was a big game changer for me who usually dieted by eating a pound of chicken every day for six months.</p><p>What I found happening was I love the meal planner. It’s very useful at first but over time I just stopped using it. Cause I just gravitate towards my favorite meal. And then eat that every day. Stop looking at the meal planner. And if you looked at my usage, you would clearly see this pattern of churning.</p><p>So even though I was enamored with the fact that it’s our own solution. Realistically, it wasn’t getting the job done as a product. So then when we realized this we thought, what other high frequency tasks are important around this. And the other one was about weighing in every morning. So every morning you weigh in and then you check to see how your progress is in the last seven days on average.</p><p>So we built that and that was great, but then it was on web. So that was a huge hassle to have to go to your computer or find that on your phone in the browser. So then we were thinking, okay, next how do we build that into a mobile app. And then next, how do you just avoid having type in anything manually at all? How do you sync?</p><p>So you really have to be a perfectionist. You have to make yourself very happy because chances are people who are not you are gonna expect even more than you. So it’s really difficult to be that honest with yourself since there’s so much dissonance from building it yourself.</p><p>If you truly solve it for yourself, though, where you’re using it every time you do that task. Then you’ll have something you can convince people like you to try.</p><p>One company who’s notorious for doing this as Apple. They literally just take a team of people and lock them up in a room for five years so to say. They’re building consumer products like a phone or Apple TV, or a laptop. Things that millions and millions of people already have before Apple even releases their very first product.</p><p>They don’t have to worry about the size of the market. They don’t have to worry about whether or not people understand. That’s actually a big reason why Apple releases products as a late entrant rather than an early entrant. Because if you just focus on the things you find most important as you’re building out this technology that’s already understood. If you perfected by having all the important tasks, be very easy, basically take as close to zero time and effort as possible. Then people are gonna find it extremely delightful. And the product will be a big success. And that’s exactly what Apple does over and over and over again. They take something that’s already well understood in the market. And then they deliver a much more delightful solution by optimizing the key tasks that exist in it and making the UX be extremely simple and easy to use.</p><p>And then the last one, which is basically trying to solve a whole audience’s problem. This one is the lowest risk approach by far. When you start with an idea or you solve your own problem, you’re ultimately trying to get to this point. Here you start with the audience and then the risk of course is if you’re unable to find the most important problem for that audience. Or if you’re unable to solve one of the most important problems for this audience.</p><p>Where can this come from? Something like a big Twitter following a newsletter, a podcast, some sort of community you’re involved in. Which is different than finding a community after building a product for yourself. This is where you are in a community that you already can talk to everybody.</p><p>What’s amazing about this is you can start by learning so much from the audience right away. You iterate with them right off the bat. Hopefully you have enough rapport where you can get feedback and best case scenario if you successfully solve this for them you will have your first few paying customers.</p><p>The fallacy I’ve seen with this one is where someone like a consultant tries to solve all the problems that they do in their consulting job. And that’s just not realistic when you’re trying to …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of it’s mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

    <p><br>
I’ve been thinking about writing this article for a bit, but have been most prompted by a post grandly titled “<a href="http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html">Async Python is not faster</a>”. The post was rooted with some good motivations and observations, but also fell somewhat into a polarising mode of discussion that I’d like to see our communities try to move beyond.</p>

<p>Async concurrency necessarily brings with it an element of ecosystem split, and this can mean that it’s a bit of a divisive area to try to have conversations within.</p>

<p>However I think we could probably benefit from a bit more recognition of where there is shared ground. And in areas where there’s less clarity, to be able to have constructive conversations around the relative merits in differing approaches.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="-why-you-shouldnt-care-about-performance">★ Why you shouldn’t care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>If you’re starting a new project, and choosing a python async framework vs a python sync framework, then any “performance” metrics around the frameworks <em>almost certainly don’t actually matter</em>, and are almost always a nonsense point of debate.</p>

<p>What is <em>actually</em> critical to your business is the development experience and strength of the surrounding ecosystem. What is your time to market going to be? How will the maintenance overhead be? How robust and evolvable is your codebase?</p>

<h3 id="-why-you-might-care-about-performance">★ Why you might care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Having said that, there <em>are</em> a small portion of cases where the performance characteristics are a valid consideration. Particularly if your web framework makes lots of outgoing HTTP requests or other networking and I/O.</p>

<p>It’s important for the Python ecosystem that it ought to compare favourably to other dynamic languages in domains where async is beneficial. We don’t want to be in a position where “we’re using JavaScript because we believe it’ll scale up better” is a valid market blocker vs. choosing Python.</p>

<h3 id="-what-were-talking-about-when-we-talk-about-performance">★ What we’re talking about when we talk about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Like-for-like a single async function call in isolation will be marginally slower than a plain function call. That’s not contentious.</p>

<p>What we’re actually interested in is how <em>efficiently</em> we can interleave multiple concurrent tasks. In I/O bound systems co-operative concurrency (async) performs more efficiently under high concurrency than threaded concurrency (sync). Again, not contentious.</p>

<p>Again - Async Python is not faster. It <em>is</em> more efficient. Which will <em>tend</em> to mean that on I/O bound systems, the latency will <em>continue</em> to remain low even as the level of concurrency increases.</p>

<h3 id="-there-are-no-good-benchmarks">★ There are no good benchmarks.</h3>

<p>JSON “hello world” benchmarks are junk. Almost all cases of “I’ve created this benchmark myself” are likely to be junk. The prevalence of new frameworks overly focusing on nebulous benchmarking claims is generally junk. An obsession on benchmarking numbers can also sometimes result in poor overall design choices, such as obfuscated or unnecessarily coupled bits of codebase, because some not-very-meaningful metric is being prioritised over the code design itself. None of this should be contentious.</p>

<p>It’s not <em>always</em> true, for example, when Sanic was introduced there was a genuine step forward which was worth talking about, so I can understand why there was a focus there. But there’s still a ridiculous hype-cycle attached as a result, and we need to be really careful about trying to step beyond that.</p>

<p>It’s also reasonable if benchmarking is discussed in a sensible context and placement. For example, to the extent that Uvicorn and Starlette have discussed performance it has only ever been with a view to making a solid case that having a <em>properly specified</em> server/framework boundary API isn’t a negative performance consideration. Prior to the introduction of ASGI, Python’s async web ecosystem had generally bundled together both the low-level HTTP handling and the high level framework, and there was a notion that needed dispelling that introducing a properly specified separation of concerns wasn’t a good approach because <em>“something something performance something”</em>.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> going to look at web framework benchmarks for some very rough first-pass ideas about relative efficiency then the TechEmpower benchmarks should almost certainly be your baseline, since they’re at least independent, and have a decent range of test cases. If you’re going to diverge from them have some good argument for doing so.</p>

<p>The “Async Python is not faster” benchmarking is a reasonable example here, since it had clearly applied a decent degree of thoughtfulness. Even so there were still problems with the methodology, as <a href="https://twitter.com/llanga/status/1271719778324025349">Łukasz Langa did a good job of unpicking</a>.</p>

<p>Having said that, the TechEmpower benchmarks only show throughput, and don’t include any <em>meaningful</em> latency information. There’s actually a good reason for that, since
comparing latencies is really difficult. You can’t arrive at a single “95% latency” figure, because the figure you’ll arrive at <em>also depends on what throughput load you’re putting the system under</em> at the time of measuring the latency.</p>

<p>As a result measuring latency is only ever really meaningful if you’re looking at <em>graphs of how the latencies vary over a range of different throughputs</em>. Amber Brown’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxP1I-tm_2c">DjangoCon 2019 keynote talk does a fantastic job of showing some examples here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-asgi-is-a-really-positive-step-for-the-async-ecosystem">★ ASGI is a really positive step for the async ecosystem.</h3>

<p>Having a decently specified server/framework interface is a <em>really good thing</em>. Andrew Godwin’s design for ASGI fills this gap with a WSGI-like approach. That has a set of trade-offs, but it’s a pretty pragmatic and well rounded choice.</p>

<p>This should not really be contentious.</p>

<h3 id="-its-about-functionality">★ It’s about functionality.</h3>

<p>Async isn’t just about achieving higher levels of concurrency-per-server, it also makes it a bunch of new functionality more feasible, including…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handling long-lived network connections like Websockets.</li>
  <li>Long-lived HTTP connections and server sent events.</li>
  <li>Dealing with background tasks without necessarily needing a full blown task queue subcomponent.</li>
  <li>Parallelizing outgoing HTTP requests or other high latency I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-not-everything-is-perfect">★ Not everything is perfect.</h3>

<p>The async ecosystem is far more immature than the existing thread synchronous. There are different challenges there, such as ensuring that <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">backpressure is handled consistently throughout the various async APIs</a>, or in <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">applying the lessons of structured concurrency</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is the “stdlib asyncio isn’t perfect” line a good argument either against asyncio specifically, or against async/await in general.</p>

<p>It’s okay that there’s still work to do in places. We know.  Let’s get that work done.</p>

<h3 id="-async-is-harder">★ Async is harder.</h3>

<p>Having to <em>think</em> about if a function does or doesn’t make I/O or could otherwise block <em>is unarguably more complex than not having to think about it</em>. It’s also more precise - you’re having to think about that for a reason, and done properly it’s presenting you with more information as a result. Being able to reason more clearly about which parts of your framework stack do or don’t perform I/O has a cost but also brings benefits.</p>

<p>There’s an analogy to make there in that writing Python using explicitly enforced typing is likely to be a harder than writing Python in an untyped style. It’s harder because you’re <em>also being more precise</em>. That’s not necessarily either good or bad, but it is definitively <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>This also gets to the point about why the “<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">What colour is your function</a>” argument isn’t actually a good case against async code, even if it seems to make clear sense on first pass. We’re coloring our functions because we’re <em>enforcing the exposure of some important information all the way throughout the stack</em>. That’s not an inherently bad thing to do.</p>

<hr>



<p>If those are areas where I think we ought to be able to reach consensus on, then there’s also a few areas where I think that the possible outcomes are less clear…</p>

<h3 id="-you-take-the-high-road-and-ill-take-the-low-road">★ You take the high road, and I’ll take the low road.</h3>

<p>There’s a few different tacks we might take onto introducing async into the Python web framework ecosystem…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promoting mostly staying with threaded web frameworks. There’s actually a perfectly decent case to make that Python <em>on the whole</em> should eschew a <em>wide move towards async</em>. That the drawbacks of moving large swathes of the ecosystem towards an async model outweigh the advantages. (Pros: Simpler for the end developer. Huge existing ecosystem.)</li>
  <li>Working towards blended approaches. This is being championed within the Django community which is incrementally adding async support, largely off the back of some Herculean work by Andrew Godwin and others. This approach can either be in the form of adding support for async at the server level, while keeping the framework level strictly thread-synchronous. Or it can gradually start to expose optional async capabilities all the way through the stack. (Pros: Brings along the existing ecosystem, while adding async capabilities when they’re needed.)</li>
  <li>Working towards async-native frameworks. (Pros: Lower overall complexity of the stack then blended approach. More efficient since there’s less overhead in marshalling between two style all the way through the stack. If we’re having to write large amounts of new code then it’s not a bad inflection point at which to also rethink and finesse other aspects of how we’re putting together new frameworks.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t really say which of these will yield the best dividends. Personally I <em>happen</em> to be working in the last of those three slices, simply because I can see a bunch of areas where I can contribute meaningfully towards the ecosystem there.</p>

<h3 id="-positioning-asyncio-and-trio">★ Positioning asyncio and Trio</h3>

<p>There another big question mark over the relative positioning of asyncio and Trio in the ecosystem. Trio is a newer approach to a Python async framework, that’s meticulously designed, and based on the principles of structured concurrency, that have been outlined by it’s author, Nathaniel Smith.</p>

<p>The difficulty this brings is that Trio is necessarily incompatible with asyncio, and introduces an ecosystem-split within an ecosystem-split.</p>

<p>There’s a few different …</p></div></div>

Not names he owned and parked, but domains he owned &amp; developed. This was another early project of his – a job board solely focused on the ranching industry. All aspects – cattle, outfitters, dude/guest, hunting, and even associated businesses like horseback riding. He’d launched it in 1998, and done an admirable job developing the brand and building an audience. But other projects had hijacked his attention, and the site had become a bit stale. Its revenue had evaporated.</p>
<p>I knew David from a partnership between DudeRanch.com (mine, at the time) &amp; GuestRanches.com (his). We had grouped them together to sell advertising. A handshake deal. Stronger together, we assumed. And we were right. Over the years, we were able to (more than) double revenue by leveraging the authority of our sites as one entity, versus two.</p>
<p>The more we worked together, the more we shared business opportunities with one another. At one point he shared his portfolio with me, <em>and that’s when I discovered <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RanchWork.com</a></em> .</p>
<p>At that time, I’d been poking around for a second project to develop, and came up empty after a year or so of searching. My usual avenue for acquisition, the <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expiring domain name market</a>, hadn’t yielded anything of value, so my wandering mind lead me to David.</p>
<p>When I uncovered RanchWork, it reminded me of a friend – <a href="http://shanepike.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shane Pike</a> – who’d built, developed, and successfully sold a nursing job board several years before. And from what I remember, he did it solo. The straightforward nature of job boards was attractive – direct, simple, &amp; sans-fluff.</p>
<p>The niche was compelling, so after I slept on it, I pinged David. To see if he’d let me test a project on it. I was already deeply entrenched in the dude ranching industry, so it seemed like a natural extension. The rough idea was this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Point the RanchWork.com nameservers to me, and I’ll cover the costs of re-development, plus oversight &amp; maintenance.</li>
<li>Once developed, I’d allow <em>free</em> job listings for ranchers to encourage a regular stream of postings. </li>
<li>I’d also allow <em>paid</em> listings (which would post at a faster clip, and remain active for a longer period. </li>
<li>To ensure simplicity, I’d avoid any type of login or account creation. If a rancher was hiring, they’d simply fill out a form, enter credit card info (if needed), and submit. Done deal.</li>
<li>David would receive 25% of all job board revenue the site collected; the remaining 75% would fall into my pocket. Ad publisher revenue was also under my wing.</li>
<li>David would continue to own the domain, 100%, outright.</li>
</ol>
<p>What makes it easy (&amp; fun) to work with David is his ‘<em>screw it, let’s do it</em>‘ attitude. I very much admire that about him, as I tend to follow the same outlook on life. And he brought that spirit into this project as well.</p>
<p>So he agreed. And I got to work.</p>

<p><em>Now, sure, from the outset, I could have viewed this idea from a defeatist attitude, that being, “What? I’m gonna try to compete with Indeed, SimplyHired, Monster, and the like? They’re VC backed heavyweights… I have no chance.”</em></p>
<p>I rarely approach projects from this mindset. I tend to approach them from the perspective, “what do I have to lose”. And usually, the answer is  “not much”. And then that thought morphs into “let’s see what kinda shit I can stir up”.</p>
<p>So to start, I purchased a $60 job board theme, and took a full week to properly architect the site for mobile devices and seo. I researched competitors. $25 seemed like the average rate for paid job postings, so that became my base price. Another close friend, <a href="https://www.workinsports.com/blog.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Clapp</a>, suggested I add a ‘Job Wanted’ listing for folks searching for ranch employment. I was skeptical that need existed, but added it anyway. And then I happily overpaid for the fastest, most reliable WordPress host I could find. </p>
<p>Essentially, the site changed from this:</p>

<p>An improvement, I thought. Not perfect, but better. Simpler in a way. </p>
<p>I re-launched the site in October of 2013.</p>
<p>At first, I seeded all the jobs myself. Then ranchers started submitting their own. Then I shifted into curation &amp; verification. </p>
<p>Then, over the next 7 years, site traffic did this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats.png" alt="" width="700" height="158" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats.png 700w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats-300x68.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>From virtually zero traffic, the site ramped up to roughly 40k-50k visitors a month. Typically 200,000 pageviews every 30 days. I had to start managing overage fees with my hosting provider.</p>
<p>Jobs of all types started pouring in. </p>
<p>As the sole curator, I made sure they followed the singular track I defined. And overall, they did.</p>
<p>Jobs like this, where you <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/packers-trail-guides-maintenance-crew-needed-at-grand-canyon-az/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had to ride a mule to &amp; from your work location</a> at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Or this one, for a <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/mountain-permit-rider-needed-at-wyoming-cattle-ranch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mountain Permit Rider</a>, responsible for all for all aspects of yearling cattle care &amp; management in private ranch pastures and mountain forest grazing allotments near Cody, Wyoming. </p>
<p>Or this Job Wanted from 2017, an <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/position-wanted-ranch-hand-91817/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">individual looking for work in the Cave Creek / Scottsdale, Arizona area</a>.</p>
<p>Job posting pictures were equally as endearing. All user submitted. Pics like this:</p>

<p>The more jobs (and job wanted) postings we listed, the more positive feedback we’d receive. That we were a great help for a remote ranch with limited hiring resources. That they were in financial straits, and our Free offering allowed them to hire the right Manager to turn their operation around. <em>And the avenue I was most skeptical about</em> – Job Wanted postings – wound up assisting individuals who craved an escape from the city into life on a working ranch (as well as contributing 30% of our overall revenue). &gt;&gt; <em>gracias, Mr. Clapp</em></p>
<p>The feeling was familiar. It felt like my <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vidalia</a> project. That I was making a positive impact. Satisfying a unique pain point, subtly, as a solo operator.</p>
<p>This project – originally a passing glance – became my mini workhorse. And such a proud production that I wound up buying the whole project from David in 2017. I doubled down in 2019 by investing $10k into a fancier backend and refreshed design. The site deserved that – a proper identity.</p>

<p>I tend to approach online businesses this way. Not intentionally – I just found myself on this path. Find a good domain name; build a product/service; see if it solves a problem &amp; makes people happy; <strong>*and only then*</strong> attempt to make it profitable. Purpose always comes first. As does contentment. Revenue always comes second. Sure, this approach has bitten me in the ass before, but I don’t care. When it’s worked, the results are wondrous. And this project checked those boxes.</p>
<p>And while RanchWork.com isn’t a flashy VC funded endeavor, or even some high flying 6-figure revenue generator, it’s not that I don’t care. The <em>site</em> doesn’t care. Cause it’s too busy. Working. Quietly. </p>
<p>My Twitter friend <a href="https://ian.is/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ian Nuttall</a> identifies these types of projects aptly; as nice, <em>humble</em> internet businesses. </p>
<p>I like humble internet businesses … </p>
<p>… and I’m quite proud to be this job board’s proprietor.</p>

<hr>
<h2>post script</h2>
<p>I knew I was in a pickle. </p>
<p>While I owned and operated RanchWork.com, I didn’t own the .com name of this niche industry. That being <em>RanchJobs.com</em>. It was owned by a 3rd party, and undeveloped.</p>
<p>That didn’t sit well with me.</p>
<p>So in 2018, I reached out to the owner. I got lucky, in that – – he responded. We had mutual friends, so that helped. The email:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1.png" alt="" width="700" height="445" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1.png 700w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>He was aware of my RanchWork project, and the price point reflected that. And he wouldn’t go lower. I couldn’t wrap my head around the price, so I shelved it. </p>
<p>Until 2020, two years later. When COVID-19 hit. The financial world went sideways. I was a bit frazzled as well. This domain name bubbled up into my brain, though. That this might be an opportunity.</p>
<p>So I leveraged a 3rd party domain marketplace platform where I could remain somewhat anonymous. I submitted an offer of $2,500.</p>
<p>They countered at $9,999. </p>
<p>I didn’t respond.</p>
<p>A broker from the marketplace called. Nice guy. He probed like a domain broker should do. He asked if they got down to $5k, if it’d be a range we’d consider. I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>They brought the $5k offer to the table. </p>
<p>I understood I was in a halo of time where this price could disappear as quickly as it appeared, so I went ahead &amp; accepted it.</p>
<p>I wanted that chess piece off the board, essentially. Another barrier to entry. </p>
<p>It’s fun to see how many times this domain is typed into a browser, though (238 times per month, tracked via re-direct). If I look at it from an advertising perspective, &amp; apply a $0.50 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-click" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CPC</a> to each visit, this domain should pay for itself by 2023. 🤠</p>
<p>I’m so fortunate the internet exists.</p>

                <section>
                    <div>
                        <h2 id="you-are-100-responsible-for-everything-i-mean-everything-"><strong>You are 100% responsible for everything. I mean everything.</strong></h2><p>At least that's how you should live your life.</p><p>You're at work, and something happens–a colleague didn't do what they were supposed to one time. Your jerk boss decides last minute to blame you for something that you raised concerns about a month ago. Your spouse is oblivious to what you've been doing around the house and yells at you for not doing the dishes. <em>Again</em>. And yes, I know, you did them all last night.</p><p>But you are responsible.</p><p>I've always struggled with this. It seems unfair, almost unjust. Why should I take responsibility for something that is clearly, utterly, and completely is beyond my control? Why should "they" get away with it? If I take responsibility, aren't I enabling and reinforcing that bad behavior?</p><p>Actually, no.</p><p>The book, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,</em> finally helped me understand. Responsibility and fault ARE NOT the same. It's not your fault that the deadline was missed but you ARE responsible for what you're going to do about it.</p><p>And hell, maybe you do nothing. Maybe that's the best choice. But you are <strong>responsible</strong>.</p><blockquote>See, things happen. Whether it's people, nature, or God, shit happens. This is a universal truth and we cannot escape it. Some of the things that happen are good, some are bad. Some are preventable or in our control. Others aren't. And frankly, none of that matters.</blockquote><p>Things happen and then it's up to you to decide how you want to respond. Responsibility is not about taking the blame, it's about taking control. If you realize that you are responsible, then you can act. And when we act, we can be authors of our own fate. Or at least try.</p><p>Too often we blame others. So much breath is wasted blaming, arguing about who's right, who's wrong, and what "they" should do.</p><p>But you can't control them, you can only control you. So respond. Take action to make whatever outcome you want to happen, happen. Or at least a more likely outcome.</p><p>Take control over your feelings. Yes, those things that try to control us and come out of nowhere.</p><blockquote>Impossible? No. Difficult? Yes.</blockquote><p>Be responsible for how you feel. Be responsible for how you act. Your reaction is up to you. "Re" and "act" meaning, your action that happens in response to a stimulus.</p><p>Because you got angry when someone cut you off does not mean that you have to speed up and flick them off. You will have impulses, and that's fine. But your "re-action" is under your control.</p><p>The blood flowing to your limbic system, reducing your ability to think clear does not make you a monkey. You can still think. You can still breath. Talk yourself off the emotional, reactive ledge, and think.</p><p>That magical tool of cognition that humanity &nbsp;has developed. Thinking. Think about what your reaction is going to be. Be responsible for your action.</p><p>Responsibility is painful. It's shitty, frustrating, and requires extra effort. But as you realize that you're in more control than you think, other things begin to happen as well. You are no longer controlled by others.</p><p>Or at least less so. You may be fired. It might not be your fault. And bitching about it for a month is justifiable. And it would feel oh sooooo good.</p><p>But, your response is your choice. You can respond with bitching, or you can respond with gritting your teeth and looking for new jobs.</p><p>Either way, the choice is yours.</p>

  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-06-30-scalability-concepts-zero-downtime-deployments/cover-deployment-and-users.png" alt="In the middle, a server. On the left, code, which is being uploaded to the server. On the right, users making requests to the server."></p>
  <figcaption>How can new code be deployed to a server while users are making requests to that server?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While certain applications can tolerate some planned downtime, typical consumer-facing applications with an international audience need to be up-and-running at all hours. Clearly, with a single backend server, some downtime is inevitable. Multiple servers make it possible to avoid downtime.</p>

<p>Technically, even small companies will implement the techniques in this post, especially since cloud providers provide tooling for zero-downtime deployments. However, it helps to understand the underlying concepts, how easy it is to implement it yourself, and what the implications are once you reach massive scale.</p>

<h2 id="building-blocks-of-zero-downtime-deployments">Building blocks of zero-downtime deployments</h2>

<p>Before understanding how zero-downtime deployments are possible, let’s talk about some general building blocks. These tools and techniques are useful in many contexts, not just deployments.</p>

<h3 id="graceful-shutdown">Graceful shutdown</h3>

<p>At a high level, <strong>graceful shutdown ensures in-flight requests are fully handled before the server shuts down</strong>.</p>

<p>Serving a request is not instantaneous. If your application handles many concurrent users, you may have many requests started—but not finished—the moment you tell the server to shut down.</p>

<p>The naive response to this shutdown request is to simply drop the in-flight requests. Not only does this lead to failed requests, but if your server processing is non-transactional, you may have completed only part of a multi-stage process, leaving your users in an incomplete state. That’s something you should always handle, but it’s still preferable to avoid these errors when possible.</p>

<figure>
  <p><a href="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-06-30-scalability-concepts-zero-downtime-deployments/graceful-shutdown-timeline-complete.png"><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-06-30-scalability-concepts-zero-downtime-deployments/graceful-shutdown-timeline.gif" alt="Animation of the sequence of events described below"></a></p>
  <figcaption>With graceful shutdown, requests that are in-flight continue being served, while new requests are rejected. Click to see the final diagram without animation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Instead, a server that shuts down gracefully does the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>While the server is running, incoming requests are accepted as normal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the shutdown is initiated, new incoming requests are immediately rejected. This is necessary so the server can shut down eventually.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the last pre-existing request is completed, the server finally shuts down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point, no new requests are accepted because there’s no running server to handle the requests.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There are other ways to avoid existing requests from being dropped (which I’ll talk about later), but the general concept of serving existing requests while not taking in new requests is a common one.</p>

<h3 id="load-balancing">Load balancing</h3>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-06-30-scalability-concepts-zero-downtime-deployments/load-balancer.png" alt=""></p>
  <figcaption>Load balancers allow multiple servers to operate as one, routing an individual user request to a single server.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The next building block is the load balancer. <strong>A load balancer allows multiple (identical) servers to serve requests behind a single network address.</strong></p>

<p>In the context of deployments, a load balancer is absolutely necessary. The multiple backing servers are what enable <em>some server</em> to successfully handle traffic while another server is being deployed to.</p>

<p>The concept of multiple servers backing a single interface is useful for many other reasons too. One is horizontal scaling: the ability to handle more traffic by adding more identical servers. Another is redundancy, not only during deployments, but also if one server faces an uncaught error that causes that server to shut down. For these reasons, you’ll see load balancers pretty much in any production environment that cares about reliability.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-routing-and-health-checks">Dynamic routing and health checks</h3>

<p>The last concept that’s useful to know about is dynamic request routing, especially as implemented with health checks. When a load balancer points to a fleet of servers, one or more of those servers may go offline. This can happen during the deployment, but also otherwise if a server encounters an unhandled error. In these cases, the load balancer needs to not send any traffic to those servers.</p>

<p>There are three ways a load balancer can stop sending traffic to a server (and once again send traffic to that server later):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Passive health checks.</strong> If the load balancer fails to reach a server during normal operation, the load balancer can mark that server as unhealthy and stop sending it traffic. While needed for unexpected server downtime, this approach means some request needs to fail, degrading the user experience. It’s also hard to know when the server is ready to accept traffic again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Active health checks.</strong> The load balancer can make <em>out-of-band</em>, or non-user-initiated, requests to a separate endpoint on each server. These requests are made periodically to see if the server is healthy. In this way, the server can itself declare itself unable to take traffic, and later declare itself as ready to take traffic again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dynamic configuration.</strong> Some external application can tell the load balancer to stop sending traffic to a particular server, or to start sending traffic to that server. All without restarting the load balancer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Both active health checks and dynamic configuration are ways to prepare a server for deployment, without the server failing to serve user-initiated requests.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-zero-downtime-deployments">Implementing zero-downtime deployments</h2>

<p>We can now compare two strategies for zero-downtime deployments that make use of one or more of the above building blocks.</p>

<h3 id="bluegreen-deployments">Blue/green deployments</h3>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-06-30-scalability-concepts-zero-downtime-deployments/blue-green-deployments.gif" alt=""></p>
  <figcaption>Blue/green deployments deploy an entire fleet of servers, then switch the load balancer to point to the new fleet of servers. The old fleet is not used until the next deployment.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With blue/green deployments, you maintain two identical fleets of servers. Only one fleet takes traffic at a time, controlled by a load balancer. The other, unused fleet is the one you deploy to, after which you switch the load balancer to point to the newly-deployed fleet. Now, the old fleet becomes the deployment target for the next version.</p>

<p>Here, health checks are useful for ensuring the new fleet of servers is operational. However, health checks are not needed for the old fleet, as traffic switches to the new fleet before the old fleet actually initiates a shutdown. Mainly, dynamic configuration of the load balancer is used here.</p>

<p>Blue/green deployments have two huge upsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deployments are fast.</strong> Servers can be deployed to in parallel, because the inactive fleet takes no traffic until the deployment is complete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rollbacks are painless.</strong> Because the old version of the app sticks around, a rollback is as simple as switching the load balancer to point at the old fleet of servers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, the downsides are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You need two full production environments, both of which must be identical. That means twice the number of servers, <em>after</em> accounting for redundancy and extra capacity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s more expensive to have extremely frequent deployments, where you may even have three versions of the application running at once (the stable version, the next version that’s almost fully deployed, and the next <em>next</em> version that’s just getting started).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: if you’re willing to have the same application running twice on a single machine, you can get away with each version of the application running on a different port per machine. This would mitigate some of the overhead of parallel environments.</p>

<h3 id="rolling-deployments">Rolling deployments</h3>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-06-30-scalability-concepts-zero-downtime-deployments/rolling-deployments.gif" alt=""></p>
  <figcaption>Rolling deployments update individual servers one at a time, until all of the servers are updated.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Rolling deployments take a less atomic approach, where an individual server is taken offline, deployed to, then brought back online. Here, “taking a server offline” means removing it from the list of available servers for the load balancer to route to. Doing so means the load balancer will not send traffic to that server for the entire duration the server is being updated.</p>

<p>This type of deployment does mean the fleet of servers is in a mixed state during the deployment, so the two application versions need to be compatible with each other. However, as I’ll explore in later posts, this is something you’d aim for anyway, so this isn’t that big of a downside.</p>

<p>Rolling deployments mean some sort of active health check or dynamic request routing is crucial. A single server has to be marked as offline before it can be shut down.</p>

<p>The advantages are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fewer resources are needed.</strong> Assuming the fleet of servers has enough redundancy to handle a few servers going down, you may not even need any extra servers to handle the deployment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>More frequent deployments are possible</strong>, as a pipeline of three versions can be prepared at peak deployment hours (the stable version, the next version, and the next <em>next</em> version).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The downsides are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deployments are much slower.</strong> Because you can’t take down all the servers at once, you have to deploy servers sequentially. This can be mitigated partially by taking down a few servers and updating them at once, but there’s a trade-off between extra capacity and deployment parallelism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rollbacks are painful.</strong> With the old version no longer running on extra servers, rollbacks entail essentially re-deploying the older version one server at a time.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Zero-downtime deployments ensure updates can be made available to users, without degrading their experience while the update happens. This in turn enables smaller, more frequent updates.</p>

<p>The cost of implementing zero-downtime deployments, however, is quite high due to the need for a load balancer and multiple servers. Fortunately, much of the added complexity is useful for other purposes, like redundancy and increased traffic handling capacity. In fact, the tools needed for zero-downtime deployments are so common that if you’re using cloud hosting, you’re probably using these tools already.</p>

<p>As closing note, I visualized how zero-downtime deployments can be implemented using off-the-shelf tools in <a href="https://github.com/avik-das/zero-downtime-deployments-demonstration">my zero-downtime deployments demonstration on Github</a>. Given how little custom code there is, I hope the demonstration makes it easy to play around with the concepts from this post.</p></div>

      <h2>All about Modelica</h2>
      <p>
	by <b>Marco Bonvini</b> on Monday June 29, 2020
      </p>
    <p>Early in my career, when ML and AI weren’t as cool, I fell in love with modeling and simulations.
As Joel Spolsky recently <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2020/06/18/hash-a-free-online-platform-for-modeling-the-world/">put it</a>,
sometimes you’re working on something that’s just too complicated to reason about with simple math, you can’t even begin to guess
how the inputs affect the outputs. In such cases, simulation models will help you understand better complex problems.<!--more--></p>

<p>While working with modeling and simulations, I discovered Modelica, a language for developing simulation models.
I worked <a href="https://marcobonvini.com/research">extensively</a> with Modelica, both during my Ph.D. as well as
in my first job at <a href="https://eta.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>.
Modelica is a great tool for modeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system">cyber-physical systems</a>,
for example to study the fuel efficiency of an hybrid vehicle, or to evaluate the interactions between renewable energy sources
and the electrical grid.</p>

<p>In this post I will provide a general overview on Modelica, and I’ll showcase some of its main features.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-modelica">What is Modelica?</h4>

<p>Modelica, as the name suggests, is a modeling language.
Which type of models? Mathematical models.
Modelica does not focus on a particular application domain, and gives you the freedom
to model a variety of problems ranging from electro-mechanical systems for automotive
or aerospace applications, to financial models for banks.</p>

<p>You can use the language to create mathematical models using any combination of the
following formalisms</p>

<ul>
  <li>differential equations</li>
  <li>algebraic equations</li>
  <li>difference equations</li>
  <li>discrete event systems</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can imagine, this kind of flexibility makes it easier to tackle lots of
different and interesting engineering problems, including cyber-physical systems.
Typical examples of such systems are cars. Cars are characterized by mechanical components that interact
with electronics and hydraulic systems, all under the supervision of multiple control systems.
So if you want to know how a car is actually going to behave, you need to simulate the whole shebang.</p>

<p>Ignoring the interaction between components – a rookie mistake in the world of simulations –
would lead to a poor understanding of the system.</p>

<figure>
   <img src="https://marcobonvini.com/images/posts/hybrid-car-scheme.png" alt="A car, typical example of cyber-physical system.">
   <figcaption>
      A car, typical example of cyber-physical systems.
   </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s not hard to find other examples of cyber-phyisical systems, they’re everywhere you look:</p>

<ul>
  <li>every private or public transportation vehicle – from airplanes to e-bikes</li>
  <li>the electrical grid that powers our houses</li>
  <li>data centers that process our data, etc.</li>
  <li>our homes, thanks to the increasing adoption of PV panels, batteries, EV cars, and IoT devices</li>
</ul>

<p>So, at this point you should be convinced that cyber-physical systems are a big part of
everyday life. Modelica allows engineers and scientists to model these systems accurately,
giving us a chance to improve their performance. <strong>This is why Modelica matters</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="modeling-the-real-world">Modeling the real world</h4>

<p>Ask any engineer, and they’ll tell you - “It’s tough to model the real world!”
Engineers perform a balancing act when they create models of complex
physical systems, building detailed simulations while at the same time struggling
against overwhelming complexity or irrelevant detail.</p>

<p>The Modelica modeling language has several features that make it the right choice for
modeling complex engineering systems. Modelica is not some abstract academic toy
disregarded by the modern industry.
In fact, in the last few years Modelica has been adopted by some of the world’s biggest
automotive companies – Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, Toyota, and VW. These companies
use Modelica to design energy efficient vehicles, improve air conditioning systems.
They Ferrari F1 team uses Modelica too for designing their racing cars!
And the automotive sector is just one of many that find this language effective.
The aerospace and energy industry are increasingly adopting Modelica, and the US Department
of Energy has been steadily investing in this technology for <a href="https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings">modeling buildings</a>
and improving their energy efficiency.</p>

<h4 id="modelica---a-first-example">Modelica - A first example</h4>

<p>As described on the <a href="https://www.modelica.org/">Modelica association</a> website,
<em>Modelica is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based language to conveniently model
complex physical systems including a variety of different aspects, including mechanical,
electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.</em></p>

<p>The following diagram shows the big picture behind any Modelica model</p>

<p><img src="https://marcobonvini.com/images/posts/modelica_toolchain.png" width="100%">
</p>


<p>The steps are the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>an engineer/scientist writes a Modelica model that represents an idea as a series of equations,</li>
  <li>a Modelica tool analyzes the model and verifies its correctness – Does the model have the same number
 of variables and equations? Are there typos?</li>
  <li>the tool compiles the model and generates an executable</li>
  <li>run the executable to simulate the system and produce data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Before diving into some of Modelica’s core concepts let’s start with an example,
a kind of <strong>HelloWorld</strong> of differential equations. We’ll use the simplest
differential equation you can imagine</p>

<p>
$$ \frac{d \, x(t)}{dt} = -2 \, x(t) $$
</p>
<p>with initial condition \( x(t_0) = 5 \)</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="modelica"><span></span><span> 1 </span><span>model</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>  <span>"The simplest differential equation ever"</span>

<span>15 </span><span>end</span> <span>HelloWorld</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>The keyword <code>model</code> defines the beginning of a model named <strong>HelloWorld</strong>.
The model is divided in three sections: declarations, initializations and equations.
The model starts by declaring variables, constants and parameters. <strong>Variables</strong> represent
quantities that are expected to change over time. <strong>Constants</strong>, meanwhile, are fixed
quantities that will never change. And finally <strong>parameters</strong> are quantities
that do not change over time but may change between simulations.
In this case parameter <code>x_start</code>, constant <code>a</code> and variable <code>x</code> have the same type,
<code>Real</code> type meaning a floating point number.</p>

<p>The keywords <code>initial equation</code> introduce the second part of our model.
Here we define the initial conditions of the system, for example the value of <code>x</code> at
the beginning of our model’s simulation time.</p>

<p>The keyword <code>equation</code> introduces the third and final part of our program,
where we finally get down to writing the equations of the system.
In this case there is one variable <code>x</code> and one differential equation <code>der(x) = a*x</code>.</p>

<p>One important thing to note is the <code>der(...)</code> operator that indicates the
time derivative of the expression inside the brackets.
The ability to express derivatives in such a clean and concise way is very helpful
when dealing with mathematical models.</p>

<h3 id="modelicas-key-principles">Modelica’s key principles</h3>

<p>So we’ve completed a simple example to get familiar with Modelica. Now, let’s look at
some of its most interesting features. As I mentioned at the beginning of the post,
Modelica is an object-oriented equation-based modeling language.
What exactly do those words mean? Let’s have a look, keeping in the context of
mathematical modeling.</p>

<h4 id="equation-based-modeling">Equation-based modeling</h4>

<p>Computer programs are nothing but clever set of instructions to let a computer solve a particular
problem for us (If this sounds familiar, bear with me. I’m going to make a distinction between
assignments and equations that you might not be familiar with).
Let’s consider the following problem: <em>given two numbers compute their sum</em>.
The following code snippet shows a solution to the problem implemented in C</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span></span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>){</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
  <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
  <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
  <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>What happens here when the program is executed is that the value 4 is inserted in the memory space
associated to variable <code>a</code>, the value 3 is inserted in the memory space
associated to variable <code>b</code> and then their sum is assigned to the memory space associated to variable <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>Given the initial problem, this program implements a particular solution to it. And, most of the
time when we write algorithms we are writing specific solutions to certain problems.
In this case the problem and its algorithmic solution were pretty straightforward!</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker: when dealing with mathematical modeling the situation is quite different.
You typically start with a set of equations that describe the general understanding of the system
you want to model.</p>

<p>Then, you can collected data about that system, and feed it into those equations to start
generating some interesting answers to your questions. Often there are  multiple questions to answer,
so the model should be as general as possible so that it can be be easily manipulated to
answer all the questions.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to our problem: <em>given two numbers compute their sum</em>. The following
is an example of a Modelica model that solves it</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="modelica"><span></span><span>1 </span><span>model</span> <span>Sum</span>
<span>2 </span>   <span>Integer</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>3 </span><span>equation</span>
<span>4 </span>   <span>c</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>5 </span>   <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
<span>6 </span>   <span>b</span> <span>-</span> <span>3</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>7 </span><span>end</span> <span>Sum</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>The content of line 4 is the essence of equation-based modeling. It all boils
down to two concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>c - (a + b) = 0</code> is an equation and <strong>equations are not assignment</strong> like the ones we’re used to
 write in C, Java, Python, etc.</li>
  <li><code>a = 4</code> and <code>b - 3 = 0</code> are located on lines 5 and 6. Both lines come after
 the first equation, and because <strong>equations are not assignment, their order does not matter</strong>.
 The only thing that matters is that the model has the same number of variables and equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>So it turns out that equation-based modeling is all about writing equations with code. The Modelica tool
of choice will know how to symbolically analyze the model, extract equations, substitute variables
in equations, sort them and apply the proper numerical methods to find the solution.</p>

<h4 id="working-with-causality">Working with Causality</h4>

<p>The equation-based paradigm opens the door to an interesting concept called a-causality.</p>

<p>Before focusing on the meaning and implications of a-causality let’s have a look at an example …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitter’s SRE team is one of the most advanced in the industry, managing the services that capture the pulse of the world every single day and throughout the moments that connect us all. We had the privilege of interviewing <strong>Brian Brophy</strong>, Sr. Staff SRE, <strong>Carrie Fernandez</strong>, Head of Site Reliability Engineering, <strong>JP Doherty</strong>, Engineering Manager, and <strong>Zac Kiehl</strong>, Sr. Staff SRE to learn about how SRE is practiced at Twitter.<br></p><p>As a company, Twitter is approximately 4,800 employees strong with offices around the world. SRE has been part of the engineering organization formally since 2012, though foundational practices around reliability and operations began emerging earlier. Today, SRE at Twitter features both embedded and core/central engagement models, with team members that hold the SRE title as well as those without but who perform SRE responsibilities. Regardless of their role or title, a key mantra among those who care about reliability is “let’s break things better the next time.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>To learn about how Twitter’s reliability practices have evolved to support their explosive growth, let’s dive into their SRE journey together.</p><h3>SRE’s beginnings: Accelerating the growth of operational excellence&nbsp;</h3><p>While the SRE team was officially declared in 2012, its practices predated 2012 in that there already existed operations and software engineers who had incredible focus and impact around reliability.<br></p><p>Prior to 2012, Twitter had a traditional ops team with sys admins who were responsible for data center operations, provisioning systems, DNS, package management, deploys, and other typical responsibilities. The release engineering team was responsible for deploying the Ruby on Rails monolith, and built testing and infrastructure around safely rolling it out. At the time, with the monolithic codebase, there were fewer service boundaries as well as limited service interfaces and APIs, making it difficult to detect problems.&nbsp;<br></p><p>These early reliability-oriented teams began working on developing signals to monitor resource utilization, rolling out alerting across their instances through a phased approach. Simultaneously, the engineering organization began decomposing the monorail onto scala microservices. This led to a restructuring from one engineering team working on a single monolith to multiple service-oriented teams for core product areas such as Tweets and Timelines.&nbsp;<br></p><p>SRE emerged as a practice to provide operational experience and readiness across these distributed core software teams, beginning with embedded SREs within teams. Over time, as the architecture went from one service to hundreds and thousands of services, a dedicated SRE team also formed: the 24x7 Twitter Command Center, also known as TCC.&nbsp;</p><h3>The SRE team’s remit and the importance of blameless culture</h3><p>Twitter SREs have pioneered key initiatives to drive consistency and repeatability, including the following:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Deployment and testing: A single deploy process, redline testing, synthetic load testing</li><li>Durability as well as instrumentation and metrics across the system to provide situational awareness</li><li>Large event planning, incident management and postmortems<br></li></ul><p>The TCC also monitors visualizations of infrastructure and product health in realtime, as well as drives incident management when product and/or reliability impact occurs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Such practices and resources allow the team to be prepared for the questions that they have trained themselves to ask, and to drive consistent response across engineers, such as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><em>Will the system support the load expected?</em></li><li><em>How much capacity is needed?</em></li><li><em>What are the next bottlenecks?</em><br></li></ul><p>Large-traffic events are particularly interesting: the spikes may not necessarily be larger than daily peaks, as Internet traffic on Twitter ebbs and flows throughout a global day. The key difference is that a daily peak might take several hours to gradually ascend and then come back down, whereas with large events it can be inside of a minute, creating far greater risk of instability. Engineers use stress and failover testing to inform event preparedness.&nbsp; The team creates playbooks to prepare for large traffic events that begin with key summary details such as who’s on-call, the various ways to reach them, escalations, and top-line metrics around the product area to determine if the service is in a healthy or unhealthy state. They playbooks also dive into how to anticipate what could go wrong based on existing knowledge about the systems and what agreed-upon actions to take if any of those occur.&nbsp; As Carrie points out, “Twitter also has automated infrastructure that takes corrective actions based on various SLO performance degradation”.<br></p><p>In the aftermath of incidents, the team adheres to a blameless postmortem process. The primary objective of the postmortem is to surface contributing factors that can be intelligently tackled, and to generate follow-up action items (as well as consensus on prioritizing follow-up work). With better documentation and focused action to address gaps in rate limiting, alerting, or other processes, the team is aligned on how to prevent a similar incident from happening again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>An important feature of Twitter’s blameless culture is the distinction of accountability looking forward instead of backward, so that team members are not held accountable for past decisions that may have been mistakes or oversights. Team members assume positive intent, and that their colleagues made decisions based on the tooling and context they had available. Rather, the typical notion of accountability is flipped on its head, so that it focuses on what <em>should</em> <em>be done</em> to address the vulnerabilities that created room for the failure. In other words, did something about the tooling lead team members to a suboptimal result, and what can be done to improve that?<br></p><p>Carrie adds, “during the postmortem process, it’s often more straightforward to focus on a defect or bug as being the root cause of an incident. The consequence of that approach can mean similar incidents may continue to occur,&nbsp; but in other services or with a slightly different presentation.&nbsp; Twitter has evolved its postmortem process to also look at process failures and opportunities to automate those processes in order to systematically address potentially broader issues that are presented during a single incident.”<br></p><h3>SRE structure and staffing</h3><p>While there are individuals that are hired into Twitter specifically as SREs, some also laterally “branch out” from internal teams into the SRE role. Furthermore, while there are some who formally have SRE as a title, Twitter also has software engineers and platform teams that may not have reliability in their title, but it's core to their skillset and the foundation it plays in the infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Regardless of their title, Twitter is fortunate to have extraordinary service owners who understand the dependencies in a multilayered distributed service architecture, and when anomalous patterns arise, they are the first ones paged due to their ability to triage complex situations.<br></p><p>Furthermore, as reliability has been such a core aspect of Twitter engineering’s evolution over time, it is hard to isolate the impact of SRE. As an example, decomposing the monorail into microservices was supported by <a href="https://twitter.github.io/finagle/">Finagle</a>, Twitter’s RPC library which implements many core reliability features. Maintained by Twitter’s Core Systems Libraries (CSL) team, Finagle delivers many of the reliability engineering features to Twitter’s service stack, including connection pools, load-balancing, failure detectors, failover strategies, circuit-breakers, request timeouts, retries, back pressure, and more. While Finagle wasn't built or delivered by SREs, it is a big part of Twitter’s reliability story that has gotten the SRE practice to where it is today.</p><h3>How SRE shapes Twitter’s biggest moments</h3><p>Brian, Zac, and JP also point to leadership support as essential to making reliability a first-class priority, which helped catalyze initiatives and hiring to support reliability. Due to Twitter’s unique place in the public dialogue, crashes due to events with huge influxes of Tweets like New Year’s Eve and the airing of Castle in the Sky received outsize attention. While the Fail Whale was originally intended to showcase the fact that scalability fixes were underway, it also became a signal to leadership of reliability’s importance to business success and public perception. The organization as a whole became relentlessly focused on how to “fail gracefully” and minimize the impact of future large-scale events.<br></p><p>The preparations for the World Cup in 2014 were an especially proud moment for the team. The engineering organization implemented synthetic load testing frameworks to simulate spikes of traffic in events and their potential impact on core services. They went through a production readiness review process (which can be thought of as a pre-production launch) to audit their runbooks, dashboards, and alerts. As part of the exercise, the team reviewed their load shedding playbook, which dictated the order of steps should there be a need to shed load to the site during a catastrophic scenario.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The game day prep helped the team prioritize what they cared about and the actions they were going to take, reducing risk and stress in the event of an actual incident. In a testament to their remarkable efforts, everything went off without a hitch on the big day.<br></p><p>Expected traffic is just that<strong>—</strong>expected<strong>—</strong>so in preparing for large traffic events, there is always an element of guesswork. But over time, the Twitter engineering team has become increasingly resilient and adept at weathering complex events, yielding a strong sense of purpose and validation of all the upfront investment in reliability.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>This is the first article of a two-part series.

June 30, 2020 | https://www.modernretail.co/startups/how-stitch-fix-built-a-culture-of-silence-among-stylists/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.modernretail.co/startups/how-stitch-fix-built-a-culture-of-silence-among-stylists/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>Two weeks after styling service Stitch Fix announced that it was laying off its 1,400 California stylists between now and the fall, morale was low in The Thread, the company’s internal messaging system. Stylists were discussing challenges they were facing in finding the right items to send to clients for their orders, internally called “fixes.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s SO disappointing when I really am trying my hardest and doing the absolute best I can for my clients, even when it’s semi-impossible due to lack of inventory,” wrote one stylist in a message viewed by Modern Retail. “Combined with the fresh feelings from losing this job, the pandemic, and everything else going on in the world…it’s just a lot to take.”&nbsp;</span></p><div id="piano-cta">
<p><span>A second stylist lamented how “it’s so hard when we aren’t given the tools to do our job, and we get criticism from both sides,” referring to customers, as well as managers, internally called leads. “What frustrates me the most is when we get vague communication like, ‘we know this will affect your metrics and we understand,’ yet we still get pressured when things go into the red,” she added.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>A styling supervisor jumped in telling stylists that “Covid has created some unique challenges with inventory vendors that are out of our control,” but that, “I can speak for all of us when I say that we want you to be supported and care so much about how this is making you feel.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“They are going to do what’s best by their shareholders,” said one Pittsburgh stylist, when asked by Modern Retail for her reaction to the message. “I do not feel supported.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Modern Retail spoke with eleven</span> <span>current and former stylists, more than half of whom joined the company before Stitch Fix’s 2017 IPO. All spoke on condition of anonymity, as Stitch Fix — like many tech companies — has a very broad <a href="https://investors.stitchfix.com/static-files/8715b2d9-c3e9-49e3-8e3a-b7f26f937b8b">definition</a> of what is considered confidential information that stylists aren’t supposed to disclose. Stitch Fix has all of its employees, including stylists, sign confidentiality agreements. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Stitch Fix has long maintained that its business model is a blend of art and computer engineering. “We’re experts at both data science and human empathy,” its former CMO Deirdre Findlay <a href="https://www.adweek.com/inside-the-brand/women-trailblazers/how-stitch-fix-cmo-deirdre-blends-art-and-science-for-career-success/">told Adweek last year</a>, about its stylists. Stitch Fix has developed proprietary algorithms that are supposed to help better predict what clothes customers are interested in over time. Yet similar to other so-called tech platforms — like Uber — that rely on a growing fleet of part-time workers, this precarious workforce makes up the service’s real front lines.</span></p>
<p><span>But some stylists said they feel like the artistic side of the company has increasingly been devalued. Since launching in 2011, Stitch Fix has transitioned from a scrappy startup to a profitable publicly-traded company. The vast majority of stylists are part-time, don’t get access to health insurance and are given limited benefits, like one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours work. (</span><span>They are not, however, independent contractors like Uber driver.) </span></p>
<p><span>Stylists typically have to work between 15 and 29 hours per week, and depending on the region, start out at around $14 to $16 an hour. After a year with the company, they are promoted to “senior stylists,” and are given around a $1 raise to their hourly rate. Going forward from there, they are given raises if Stitch Fix has determined the cost of labor has risen in their particular zip code. One stylist said in nearly three years, her pay has risen just five cents per hour.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Some stylists also said that Stitch Fix has — in explicit and implicit ways — increasingly discouraged stylists from voicing negative feedback about internal changes and processes. Leads will turn off comments on threads announcing big internal changes, like the impending layoffs of California stylists. Stylists are instructed to post “kind” and “solution-based” messages in the Thread, which makes it hard for them to commiserate with coworkers, according to the current and former stylists Modern Retail spoke with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Because Stitch Fix’s stylists are remote, some of them feel like they don’t have many options to escalate feedback to the rest of the company, beyond speaking directly with their manager. During the pandemic, the current stylists that Modern Retail spoke with said they felt like they’ve received conflicting messaging from Stitch Fix about the company’s priorities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In response to a list of questions sent by Modern Retail, Stitch Fix provided the following comment: “</span><span>Our stylists are instrumental in building relationships with clients and creating the highly personalized experience Stitch Fix is known for. Their feedback, in partnership with our talented team of merchandisers and data scientists, helps us to continually improve the personalized recommendations of items and outfits we send to our clients.”</span></p>
<p><span>The statement went on: “All of our Stylists care deeply about their clients’ experiences and we encourage them to share feedback, ask questions and discuss learnings. We are committed to providing an open forum where this can take place in a safe and constructive way.”</span></p>
<p><span>The California stylists who are being laid off accounted for 1,400 of Stitch Fix’s roughly 5,100 stylists. Stitch Fix’s other styling hubs are in cheaper locations for the company to operate: Austin, Dallas, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis. So, Stitch Fix is instead hiring 2,000 part-time stylists in its other hubs between now and the end of next year, and offering laid off California stylists the option to apply to relocate to another styling hub. Stylists who do decide to relocate will get money to move, the company said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple stylists told Modern Retail that these consolation moves were not enough.“[Stitch Fix] has a very toxically positive environment that I really bought into,” said one former California stylist. “I liked it, but in hindsight after being laid off, I now see that as not sincere and not authentic.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Running afoul of Threadiquette<br>
</b><span>When Stitch Fix went public in 2017, it had 2.3 million active clients. Today, that number is up to 3.4 million. The company lost $33.1 million in the most recent quarter due to challenges from the coronavirus. But up until this point, Stitch Fix has consistently reported a profit. In fiscal 2019, Stitch Fix reported a net income of $36.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span>The way that Stitch Fix’s model works is that customers pay $20 for a “fix,” in which stylists send customers five items of clothing and/or accessories they think a customer will like, based on what data the stylist has on that customer’s style. That $20 gets credited towards anything from their fix that they decide to buy. Over time, the company’s algorithms are supposed to be able to better predict what clothes a particular customer will like, and make it easier for the stylist to select clothes for that client.</span></p>
<p><span>Stitch Fix has long referred to its stylists as the “heartbeat” of the company. “It’s more than just an hourly job,” CEO Katrina Lake <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-tech/is-stitch-fix-the-goldilocks-of-fashion">told Business of Fashion in 2016</a>. Despite being on the front lines, some stylists feel they have few ways to air their grievances.</span></p>
<p><span>Stylists are judged on a variety of metrics, such as how many items their clients end up keeping. In the fall, Stitch Fix raised the number of fixes stylists are expected to complete per hour from 4.25 to 4.6, according to six current and former stylists, adding another new challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The current and former stylists Modern Retail spoke with said they felt their ability to challenge or get answers on why some changes were made to their jobs were also hampered by Stitch Fix’s communication processes.</span></p>
<p><span>On the Thread, conversation is broken up by different business-related topics. Oftentimes, conversation will turn to laments about inventory, or stylists talking about if they are struggling with a particular fix. The stylists said that leads have sometimes jumped into discussions critical of the company and instructed stylists to take concerns directly to them via email. </span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re not in a typical company where you can go and stand by the water cooler and voice your frustrations to a coworker — not necessarily complaining about the company, but just…feeling like you are not alone,” said a second former California stylist. “It just seemed like you weren’t even allowed to do that because you were looked upon as being negative.”</span></p>
<p><span>There are rules governing use of the Thread — internally called ‘Threadiquette.’ “Thoughts and feedback are what drive change, but how those messages are delivered is important,” read one message viewed by Modern Retail instructing stylists on Threadiquette. Stylists are told to frame critiques with <a href="https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2020/05/12/how-people-drive-success-at-stitch-fix/">Stitch Fix’s OS</a> in mind; they’re instructed to be bright, kind and motivated by challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, Stitch Fix defines “motivated by challenge” as being, in part, “someone who thrives in ambiguity and is resilient. Someone who operates with hunger, #StitchFixGrit, and perseverance.” The current and former stylists said that they sometimes feel Stitch Fix uses terms like grittiness and perseverance as an excuse to not make changes that stylists are pushing for, like to inventory or to the algorithms that they use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In an exchange viewed by Modern Retail, one stylist, for example, asked her lead for more specifics when Stitch Fix told stylists in 2019 that, going forward, it would be giving raises only if the cost of labor rose based on the zip code each individual stylists worked in. This was a change to the previous model — one that likely resulted in the stylist getting a pay cut. She expressed some disappointment to her lead about the change. The stylist’s lead changed the conversation away from compensation details and pointed her to Stitch Fix’s core values, including being “motivated by challenge,” asking if that clause resonated with her. The stylist interpreted her lead’s email as insinuating that she was not representing Stitch Fix’s core values by questioning company changes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This follows a trend; some stylists said leads …</span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Among all economic sectors impacted by Covid19, air traffic was hit the hardest. Airlines are suffering a lot, and consequently so do airports. Now that most EU countries are reopening their borders, air traffic is slowly going up again.<br>
Obviously, current traffic is nowhere near pre-covid levels, and it does not make sense for an airport to open all its terminals.<br>
The stakes are high: delaying a terminal reopening by even a few months can represent dozens of millions of euros of savings.<br>
I was recently involved in a project with #1 EU airport to work on this problem:<br>
if you’re an airport, given airline traffic forecasts over the next decade, and financial data on your terminals (fixed/variable costs/revenue), how can you optimize the reopening sequences for all terminals?</p>
<p>First of all, you have to define the objective. In our case, the objective was to maximize profit, and minimize capacity mismatch (between airlines traffic forecasts and open terminals capacity), which is reasonable. Concretely, my plan was to load traffic forecasts and financial data into Pytorch tensors, and then use Autograd to run an optimization with a carefully-built loss function (with a profit term, and a capacity mismatch term).</p>
<p>I had traffic forecasts from each airline over a 90-months period, so my traffic tensor had shape (nb_airlines, nb_months). I had airport terminals financial data separated into 6 metadata: fixed costs/revenue if closed/open, variable cost/revenue per PAX, so my terminal metadata tensor had shape (nb_terminals, 6).</p>
<p>The first problem I encountered was the problem constraints: an airport is not a simple organization, and you can’t just assign any kind of traffic to any terminal. Some traffic is international, other is Schengen (EU borderless area), all terminals do not have the same capacity for one or the other.<br>
Moreover, not all companies can be assigned to any terminal, for operational reasons (a given company may not have available subcontractors in a given area) or historical reasons (companies with strong brands do not want to confuse regular customers).</p>
<p>As in all optimization situations, you have to dumb down the problem, model it, run optimizations, and once you grasp the dynamics, you can start adding constraints to increase realism.<br>
In our case, I decided to ignore at first airlines/terminals assignments, and just focus on traffic allocation to terminals (schengen, and international). Concretely, this means I loaded airlines traffic forecast into Pytorch tensors, and sum them along the airlines dimension, to have aggregated traffic sums for international and Schengen traffic. I had then 2 traffic tensors (International/Schengen) with shape (1, nb_months).</p>
<p>The second problem I encountered was the modelization of the problem. At first, I wanted to have as variables open/close binary flags for each terminal, month by month. I would then compute the effective available capacity, the mismatch with airlines traffic forecasts, and compute fixed+variable costs and revenue for each terminal.<br>
Problem is, Pytorch Autograd needs the loss function to be differentiable, which means it has to be continuous, almost everywhere. This does not work well with binary integer flags for terminals open/close states.<br>
So, I then decided to use continuous variables. Concretely, I used a float32 tensor of size (nb_terminals, nb_months) of values between 0 and 1. I could then, with a few tensor operations, compute in the loss function the profit over time, and traffic capacity mismatch.</p>
<p>The third problem I encountered was about variables bounds enforcement. Obviously, you want terminal open/close rates to be between 0 and 1. If you’re not careful, the optimizer will output negative open rate for terminals that have bad cost structures (they lose money most of the time so the optimizer might assign a negative open rate = negative traffic to make it profitable, which of course does not make sense).<br>
As it turns out, constraining a variable in [0,1] range with Autograd is not that simple, in practice, and in theory as well. In practice, Autograd does not have (as of June 2020) a built-in way to specify variables bounds. This could be overcome with the use of torch.min and torch.max in the loss function (= “soft clamp”, the “soft” part is important because you need to have gradients, don’t use torch.clamp).<br>
But the problem was bigger than that. I first tried to be clever, and include a term in the loss function to ensure open/close rates were as close as possible to 0 or 1. Concretely the term was about minimizing square(square(x) – x). 0 and 1 are the only floats where “square = identity” so I expected the optimizer to try to have mostly 0/1 floats at the end of the process.<br>
I put a strong multiplicator coefficient on this “bounds enforcement” term of the loss function, to make sure the optimizer took it seriously. Problem is, it totally discouraged exploration: the optimizer found it too costly to go too far from initialization point, and this “soft binary constraint” made it impossible for the optimizer to find paths that would change a terminal open/close state.<br>
In the end I had to remove this constraint, and accept any value between 0 and 1 for terminal open/close state, to let the optimizer explore all possible states.</p>
<p>The fourth problem I encountered was normalization. This one was not too hard to solve, basically if different terms of the loss function have different orders of magnitude, the gradient will be biggest for the biggest term in the loss function, which means the other term will not impact much the optimization. The best solution is to make sure each term of the loss function is normalized. For traffic capacity mismatch, I assumed the biggest traffic mismatch is “all terminals closed” so I used the mismatch in that situation as the denominator to normalize the mismatch term of the loss function. For profit, I assumed the biggest profit is when all terminals are at full capacity, I used the profit in that situation as the normalization denominator for the profit term of the loss function.</p>
<p>If I sum up, at this stage, I was able to run an optimization and get the optimal reopening sequence of airport terminals, given the air traffic forecasts from each airline, and the terminals financial characteristics. Optimal is defined as: maximal profit, under the constraint of satisfying airline forecasted capacity needs.</p>
<p>Then came the question of companies/terminal allocations. This one is very tricky, because basically, the airport wants all companies to be able to fly right now, wants to open as few terminals as possible, and wants to move as few airlines as possible (because airlines hate switching terminals). Those needs are contradictory, which is not shocking in itself, it’s the basis of almost all real-world optimization problems. If there are no contradictory factors, then the problem is generally easy.<br>
Taking into account airlines/terminal allocations has a very nasty problem: the airport operations come with many exceptions. Airlines from the same group (ex: StarAlliance, SkyTeam etc) have to be grouped together where possible. Some airlines cannot move, some others can, but only between terminals X and Y etc.<br>
When it comes to optimization, this is not good news, especially in my situation where I use Pytorch Autograd, which needs the problem to be differentiable. All those constraints could be implemented with “if”-like code, but branching logic in your loss function really makes it hard for differentiability.</p>
<p>Moreover, I knew that given all those constraints, it was very likely that the optimal scenario would be very hard to find, and would probably consist in moving just a handful of airlines out of the almost 200, between a few terminals, to delay the reopening of a handful of terminals by a few months. In other words, finding the right small touch to optimally change airlines/terminals allocation was going to be like finding a needle in a haystack.<br>
I arrived at the conclusion that given the time constraints, it was wiser to start from the usual airlines/terminal allocation, and have a human with good domain knowledge look at the previous optimization results (optimal terminals reopening sequence from a pure traffic/financial perspective), and use that as a compass to manually try a few airlines/terminals reallocation scenarios.</p>
<p>In the end, using Pytorch and Autograd was obviously not a magic wand that could take into account all airport constraints and output a universally optimal scenario. But by using Autograd on a simpler problem (traffic/terminal allocation to maximize profit and minimize effective/needed capacity mismatch), we were able to identify good terminal candidates whose reopening should ideally be delayed, and then that information was used by a consultant with expert airport knowledge to propose a few good airlines/terminal reallocation scenarios.</p>
<p>This project used Pytorch and Autograd but did not involve neural networks at all. Some might say that it is a bit of an overreach to use the “AI” word, and it’s true that this project would probably be better defined with the term “differentiable programming”.<br>
Yann LeCun said a few years back “Deep Learning est mort. Vive Differentiable Programming!” and <a href="https://fruty.io/2019/11/04/deep-learning-in-the-real-world-how-to-deal-with-non-differentiable-loss-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I agree</a> that we’ll see more and more great demonstrations with Pytorch and Autograd without necessarily involving neural networks.</p>

It was the only way to get an audio interface free of KO parameters like a short battery life, blocked ears, non-configurability, and an uncomfortable fit. </p><p>What did I know about hardware design before I got started? </p><p>Absolutely nothing.</p><p>Having tested a variety of headphones, headsets, and earbuds already, I knew that bone conduction tech was the best bet for getting an all-day experience. The other route was using directional speakers, but I wouldn’t have the option of tuning out of my surroundings by plugging my ears. This was essential because blocking outside noise improves concentration.</p><p>In the spirit of J. C. R. Licklider, my main premise was to augment humans in the most natural and efficient way. A way that helps us achieve our goals and be more conscious. An audio interface, as we established in Part II, was the best possible augmentation.</p><h2 id="designing-from-first-principles">Designing from first principles</h2><p>We’ll talk about hardware in a lot more detail in a separate blog post. For now, here’s an overview of my personal experience as a complete beginner.</p><p>I speculated that when building new hardware, I should start from first principles. How do you set up communication between a human and a computer? The fundamentals for a seamless interface are input, output, and ergonomics.</p><p>The goal is to maximise the bandwidth of information exchange and make sure this “relationship” benefits us.

I moved one layer up to our five senses: Sight, Hearing, Smell, Taste, Touch.</p><p>For <em>Sight</em>, AR glasses are too far off to be usable.</p><p><em>Smell </em>and <em>Taste </em>are…well, impractical. They’re rather low bandwidth for information, and the technology to support them will not fit in a wearable (as of now).</p><p><em>Touch </em>is interesting. Subtle nudges or taps can indicate a notification, a change of state. The information is mainly binary unless you are using morse code. However, the bandwidth on any complex information is low.</p><p><em>Hearing</em><strong>: </strong>spoken word is high in terms of bandwidth, and a natural way to receive information.</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> Well, one can imagine countless ways that we express ourselves and relay information. Speech, facial expressions, posture, gesturing, manipulating our environment…or lifting your eyebrows. Remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/25/snappables-snapchat-games/">the weightlifting snapchat filter game</a>?</p><p>In terms of human-computer interface, I focused on hand movements and speech. We learn to type fast. An interface made for rapid typing is not wearable—and not always accessible to you seamlessly. Some companies have tried creating wearable keyboards that looked similar to gloves, but people don’t use them. Plus they’re still too large.</p><h3 id="-computers-">|Computers|</h3><p><strong>Input: </strong>Any change in current can be considered an input for computers.</p><p><strong>Output: </strong>Computers combined with specific hardware can generate sound waves or light pixels, move physical things, print on paper…the only limit is our imagination (and technological advancements).</p><p>I filtered through the options and looked at possible output for wearables. Speakers, or bone conduction transducers, to transmit sound. Smart glasses to transmit light via pixels, or LED to indicate state.

It was all worthwhile, but out of the scope of this blog.</p><p>Tl;dr—I had to make the interface disappear.</p><h3 id="-interface-">|Interface|</h3><p><strong>Output:</strong> <em>Speech (captured by microphones):</em> Microphones can pick up vibrations from the air, or from the body (Bone conduction microphones. The most common placements are on the throat or in the ear canal. I tested throat microphones and the quality was awful. They’re bulky and uncomfortable. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/B5_eI9ungGE?t=228">this video</a> if you want more info.) </p><p>In-ear microphones have been used in products such as Bragi Dash to improve sound quality.</p><p><em>Hand movements (captured by touch surfaces):</em> Buttons provide physical certainty that the action was performed.

The haptic response has to be built in to provide feedback for the user that the gesture was successful.</p><p><strong>Input</strong>: I really started from square one for input. How do we hear? Through our ears. What parts of the ear are involved for air conducted versus bone conducted sound? The sound travels through bone, so where on the skull should the transducer go? Forehead? Jaw? Near the ear?</p><p>I ordered various types of bone conduction transducers, got in touch with both high-end and low-end transducer manufacturers, and requested samples. Then I tested every possible location on my skull to see which position gave me the best sound quality and clarity.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/bone-conduction-transducer-samples.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/bone-conduction-transducer-samples.png 600w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/bone-conduction-transducer-samples.png 940w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bone conduction transducer samples</figcaption></figure><p>While figuring this out, I continued wearing various types of bone conduction headsets every day to help me understand what’s essential, what’s wrong with their design decisions, and how my day changed with this new technology.</p><p>I was able to stay connected throughout the day to both my surroundings and my phone.

<p>This post is a continuation of <a href="https://cryptolens.io/2020/03/licensing-software-to-customers-with-thousands-of-employees-b2b/">Licensing software to customers with thousands of employees (B2B)</a> where we talked about common issues that might arise when licensing software to larger clients. In this post, we will focus on the case when your clients do not have internet access (e.g. hospitals) or where you would like to have more control over who can use your software within the client company.</p>



<h3>Use cases</h3>



<p>Specifically, we will explore the following cases:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Controlling who can activate</strong>: Typically, new devices are activated automatically, until the maximum number of machines is reached. However, you might not want that to happen, especially if you sell to a specific department in the company and don’t want users from other departments to use the software.</li><li><strong>Companies with no internet access</strong>: When your clients don’t have internet access, the solution is to send them a license file where all devices are already activated. However, this quickly becomes problematic if there are thousands of employees whose device needs to be activated.</li></ul>



<h3>Solution</h3>



<p>Both of the cases above share a common problem: gathering machine codes from a large number users and then activating them from your end. </p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="3442" data-permalink="https://cryptolens.io/2020/06/activating-large-number-of-employees-when-licensing-software-to-larger-clients-b2b/manual-activation/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cryptolens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/manual-activation.png?fit=1131%2C538&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1131,538" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="manual-activation" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cryptolens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/manual-activation.png?fit=300%2C143&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cryptolens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/manual-activation.png?fit=1024%2C487&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/cryptolens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/manual-activation.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p><strong>Gathering machine codes from all employees</strong></p>



<p>To gather machine codes (aka. hardware ids)  from all  employees, Customer IT  needs to run a special batch script. We have prepare one that can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Cryptolens/admin-tools/blob/master/manual-activation/machinecodescriptsha256.bat">here</a>. Typically, your client will use a system similar to Microsoft SCCM, which allows the customer IT to run a script on all computers and collect the result.</p>



<p><strong>Activating multiple devices at once</strong></p>



<p>Once the customer IT has collected all the machines, they can send the file with all the results to you. Our script will compute both the machine code and a device name (to make it easier for customers to differentiate between different activations). The can then be activated on the <a href="https://app.cryptolens.io/extensions/ActivateDevices">following page</a>.</p>



<p>For more details, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/Cryptolens/admin-tools/tree/master/manual-activation">following GitHub repository</a>. As always, let us know should you have any questions! You can reach us at support@cryptolens.io.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
		<p>I have trained <code>3,600</code> Random Forest Classifiers (each with <code>1,000</code> trees) on <code>72</code> data sets (from <a href="https://docs.openml.org/benchmark/">OpenML-CC18 benchmark</a>) to check how many trees should be used in the Random Forest. What I’ve found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the best performance is obtained by selecting the optimal tree number with single tree precision (I’ve tried to tune the number of trees with <code>100</code> trees and single tree step precision),</li>
  <li>the optimal number of trees in the Random Forest depends on the number of rows in the data set. The more rows in the data, the more trees are needed (the mean of the optimal number of trees is <code>464</code>),</li>
  <li>when tuning the number of trees in the Random Forest train it with maximum number of trees and then check how does the Random Forest perform with using different subset of trees (with single tree precision) on validation dataset (code example below).</li>
</ul>

<p>The details of my study is below. The link to all code in <a href="https://github.com/mljar/website_snippets/blob/master/how_many_trees/how_many_trees_in_RF.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>. If you have any questions, you can email me at: <a href="mailto:piotr@mljar.com">

<h2 id="the-data-sets-from-openml-cc18-benchmark">The Data Sets From OpenML-CC18 Benchmark</h2>

<p>The data sets used in this study are from <a href="https://docs.openml.org/benchmark/#openml-cc18">OpenML-CC18 benchamrk</a>. Each dataset were carefully selected from thousands of data sets on OpenML by creators of the benchmark.</p>

<p>In the plot below are presented distribution of the number of rows and columns in the datasets, and scatter plot with data sizes:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/website_snippets/master/how_many_trees/dataset_description.png" alt="OpenML-CC18 dataset description"></p>

<p>Most of the datasets have up to few thousands rows and up to hundred columns - they are small and medium sized datasets. Eeach data set in the benchmark suite has a defined train and test splits for <code>10</code>-fold cross-validation.</p>

<h2 id="training-the-random-forest-classifiers-with-scikit-learn">Training the Random Forest Classifiers with Scikit-Learn</h2>

<p>For each train and test split I added <code>5</code>-fold cross-validation (internally), so I have a validation data which can be used to tune the number of trees. To make it clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>each data set has defined train and test split (with <code>10</code>-fold CV),</li>
  <li>for each train data, I additionally split it into train and validation with <code>5</code>-fold CV,</li>
  <li>for each set of (train, validation, test) data I have trained a Random Forest classifier from <code>scikit-learn</code> with <code>n_estimators=1000</code> (other hyper-parameters are left default).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="compute-the-performance-of-the-random-forest-classifier">Compute the Performance of the Random Forest Classifier</h2>

<p>To compute the model’s performance I use the test data and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html"><code>logloss</code></a> metric. I check what is the performance of the Random Forest with <code>[100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000]</code> trees. <strong>Please notice, that I’m not training <code>10</code> Random Forests models with different number of trees! I’m reusing the Random Forest with <code>1000</code> trees, with setting different numer of <code>n_estimators</code> before prediction.</strong> This saves a lot of computational time when doing a hyper-parameters search.  The final response is the average prediction from the <code>5</code> Random Forests (trained with internal <code>5</code>-fold CV).</p>

<p>In the second approach, I search for the number of trees which will minimize the <code>logloss</code> on validation data. In this method, I iterate over all trees in the forest and compute predictions from single trees. The prediction of the Random Forest is the average from all trees in the subset (I’m doing manually what is done internally in <code>predict_proba</code> in the Random Forest). As ealier, the final response is the average over all <code>5</code> models (from internal CV). Notice, that each model from internal CV can have (and have) different number of trees.</p>

<p>The results are presented as boxplots for each data set. On the x-axis, there is a number of trees. The last box in each plot is the result from optimized number of trees (on x-axis marked as ‘Selected’). On the y-axis, there is <code>logloss</code> metric.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/website_snippets/master/how_many_trees/boxplots.png" alt="The results of analysis"></p>

<p>To compare all results in the single plot, I used ranking (for each data set and repetition, I ordered the losses and assign rank from <code>0</code> to <code>10</code> from the best to the worst predictions, so the lowest rank is the best). The average rank is presented below:</p>

				A few years ago, I started doing small projects with the 65C02 processor to build up to using it to make a graphing calculator. There are a few different languages that you can use to write programs for this processor with assembly offering the best performance. One of the projects I worked on is an optimizer to make assembly programs run faster. It works by tracing program flow then assigning fixed addresses to local variables in functions instead of storing them on the stack. To figure out how much of an improvement the optimizer adds, I made a game in Python then ported it to both traditional assembly and the new optimized assembly format. I also ported the game to C and Forth to see how fast they are compared to the assembly versions.

				The </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C02">65C02</a> is an improved version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a> used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">first</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">two</a> computers made by Apple. Because the 65C02 is made with more modern CMOS transistors, it’s much more energy efficient and runs at up to 14 MHz, compared to the 1-3 MHz of the original 6502. Both of these things make it a good choice for a graphing calculator. For comparison, the very common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series#TI-83_Plus">TI-83+</a> made by Texas Instruments has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Zilog Z80</a> running at 6 MHz. Since the Z80 needs 3-4 times more cycles to accomplish the same work as a 6502, a 65C02 running at full speed should be 7-9 times more powerful than the Z80 in a TI-83+. Another advantage of the 65C02 is that it’s still sold in a DIP package, so it’s easy to find and experiment with on a breadboard. There aren’t many better choices in a throughhole package. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">Motorola 68000</a> is more powerful MHz for MHz, but it's already used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89_series">TI-89</a>, so I would like to use something different. Some throughhole microcontrollers have much more processing power, though not much RAM and no way to add more without an external address bus. The throughhole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers#PIC32M_MIPS-based_line">PIC32</a>, for example, runs at up to 50 MHz, but only has 64 kB of RAM. For comparison, the TI-89 introduced in 1998 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_49/50_series#49G">HP-49G</a> from 1999 had 256 kB and 512 kB of RAM respectively. Since the 65C02 has an open address bus, there is no limit to the amount of RAM and ROM it can access.

			<h2>The Languages</h2>
			
			<p>
				These are the languages that I want to compare:
			</p>
			</a><ol><a name="TheLanguages">
				<li><b>Traditional assembly</b> - This is plain old 65C02 assembly. Like many 65(C)02 (ie 6502 or 65C02) programs, it uses the X register as a stack pointer for a data stack (more details on this below). Some functions copy and save data from the fastest region of memory called zero page to free it up for use and restore the data when the function ends (more details on this below too).</li>
				<li><b>Optimized assembly</b> - This version of the game differs from traditional assembly since it doesn’t use the X register as a data stack pointer. Instead, local variables in each function are assigned a fixed address at compile time. The addresses are determined by a Python script that analyzes the flow of the program and tracks how much memory each function needs (more details below).</li>
				</a><li><a name="TheLanguages"><b>C</b> - This version is compiled with </a><a href="https://cc65.github.io/">CC65</a>, which seems to be the most popular C compiler for the 65(C)02.</li>
				<li><b>Forth</b> - This version is compiled using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/scotws/TaliForth2">Tali Forth 2</a>. I picked this Forth since it generates subroutine threaded code (STC) which is generally the fastest, though largest, type of Forth code.</li>
			</ol>

			<a name="TheSimulator">
			<h2>The Simulator</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/65C02_Emulator">65C02 Emulator on GitHub</a></p><p>
				All of the code runs on a JavaScript-based simulator I made that works in the browser. The simulation itself runs very fast on a separate thread using a web worker, while the main page is only responsible for the interface. This setup lets the simulation run at the equivalent of 40-50 MHz, several times faster than an actual 65C02 running at 14 MHz. Because it runs in the browser, you can try running each version of the game for yourself:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TradAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Traditional assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/OptAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Optimized assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/CC65/main.html">Robot Game - C version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TaliForth2/main.html">Robot Game - Forth version</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has sixteen memory banks of 16 kB each for a total of 256 kB of memory. The 65C02 has a 16 bit address bus, so it can only address 64 kB of memory at a time. To access the memory outside of the first 64 kB, the simulator simulates a memory banking system. Each 16 kB range of the 64 kB address space can point to any of the sixteen memory banks. This was a common strategy in retro computers to get around the limitations of a small address space.
			</p>

			<p>
				Memory map:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0x0000 to 0x01FF - No banking</li>
				<li>0x0200 to 0x3FFF - Memory window 1</li>
				<li>0x4000 to 0x7FFF - Memory window 2</li>
				<li>0x8000 to 0xBFFF - Memory window 3</li>
				<li>0xC000 to 0xFFDF - Memory window 4</li>
				<li>0xFFE0 to 0xFFFF - Peripherals</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The first 512 bytes are not banked since they contain the fast zero page memory and the hardware stack which always need to be visible from all banks. The last 32 bytes are for peripherals like the keyboard and for vectors for reset and interrupts. Each peripheral is assigned a specific address in this range, and the processor communicates with them by reading and writing to those addresses. Four bytes in the peripheral region control which of the sixteen memory banks each window points to. For example, if memory window 2 points to memory bank 7, then reading the first byte of memory window 2 at 0x4000 will access the first byte of memory bank 7 which is at 0x1C000.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The video memory is mapped one byte per pixel and takes up the 32 kB from 0x10000 to 0x17FFF (memory banks 5 and 6). The resolution is 256x128. Each byte has two bits each of red, green, and blue. Valid color codes are therefore 0-63.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has some interesting tools that helped port the game. Some of them were added during development because a specific problem arose that I needed to add them for. The main page lets you step through the code and shows the status of all the registers and each memory region that it accesses. There is also a memory viewer and a log of exactly which instructions have been executed. Copying this information into Excel or a text diff program helped track down several bugs in the game.
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_simulator.png" alt="Screenshot of simulator Robot Game runs on">
			<span>Simulator debug interface</span></p><p>
				Getting the cycle counts right for the executed instructions was a little tricky. For example, when an X-indexed instruction fetches an address where adding X to the low byte of the address overflows and the high byte of the address has to be adjusted, the instruction takes an additional cycle. After I got the logic for that fixed, the test code I was using was still a few cycles out of 3.5 million cycles off. Single stepping the program through all of those cycles to figure out which instruction was off would take too long. Instead, I loaded the code into the <a href="http://exifpro.com/utils.html">Kowalski simulator</a> then used a Python script to automate pressing the single step button and record the cycle count for every instruction. This generated way too much data to load into a spreadsheet, so I made another script to compare those cycles to the ones I generated in my own simulator and tracked the problem down to incorrect cycle times for the STZ instruction.

			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/RobotGame">Robot Game on GitHub</a></p><p>
				The game is made in Python with the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">PyGame library</a>. It was easy to read one big image into memory then copy parts of it into individual tiles that PyGame draws to the screen. Here are the images I came up with in Paint:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_tiles.png" alt="Graphics tiles for Robot Game">
			<span>Graphics tiles for Robot Game</span></p><p>
				Several of these are tiles that I was experimenting with that didn’t make it into the game. Bright magenta (0xFF00FF) and bright cyan (0x00FFFF) are replaced with transparency when the tiles are created. Most of the tiles only have placeholder colors and are used as the basis to create other tiles. For example, the green, yellow, and grey color in the generic crystal graphic above are filled in depending on what type of crystal the game needs to draw:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_crystals.png" alt="Crystal tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The rock and lava tiles are constructed similarly from the generic tile above. There are four dirt tiles that are colored slightly differently and rotated at 90, 180, and 270 degrees to give the background some variety:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_dirt_tiles.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				There is only one type of monster which is always colored the same, so a few tiles like that don’t have any pixels that change colors. Adding in some stats and a randomly generated map gets us to the main game window:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_main_screen.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The map is formed from the output of a random number generator. Using the same generator algorithm for each port results in the same beginning map for all four versions (and the same gameplay if the player makes the same decisions). I had to try several seed values for the RNG until I got a map I liked the look of as seen in the screenshot above. Here are a few that didn’t make the cut:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_failed_maps.png" alt="Random maps for Robot Game that failed"></p><p>
				The rest of the game is just the three menu screens. The first displays a couple of stats and an inventory page. Moving the cursor over an item shows that item’s stats and what is currently equipped in that slot. Equipping an item changes the color of the corresponding part of the robot to match. In the tiles page above, the image of the robot is drawn with different colors that all correspond to the same colors that the generic item tile has. This means that the easy find and replace function to color in the individual items also works with the same color information on the larger image of the full robot.

        <p><em>This post details a backtracking algorithm for solving scramble square puzzles. This is a deceptively simple looking puzzle, with only 9 pieces, but it
 can be very challenging to solve, with over 23.8 billion possible arrangements.</em></p>

  <figcaption>Serengeti scramble square puzzle by <a href="https://www.scramblesquares.com/shop/geography/serengeti-scramble-squares/">Scramble Squares</a> </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When I was a child, I used to spend many hours trying to solve a scramble square puzzle. An example is shown above.
The puzzle consists of nine square pieces and four images spread across the squares. 
On each side on each square is half of one of the four images. For example the top half of an elephant.
Some of the other pieces have the corresponding half, like the bottom half of the elephant.
The aim to is arrange the pieces in a 3x3 grid such that all inner images are aligned - all halves are matched.
This is actually very difficult, and I was not able solve it.</p>

<p>Much later, when I was in university, I returned to this puzzle. I wondered if there was a procedural method to solve it. Such methods exist for Rubik’s cubes.
I was not able to find any, but I did find a depth first search backtracking algorithm for it described in this <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.953.6583&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a>.
This algorithm is rather painful to do by hand, but easy to implement with a computer.
I wrote up the algorithm in Python, and within a second, I found the two solutions for my puzzle.
So much for hours of frustration when I was younger!</p>

<p>The rest of this post will describe this algorithm in detail.</p>

<h2 id="the-algorithm">The algorithm</h2>

<p>The search space for this puzzle is surprisingly large. 
There are $9!$ permutations for placing each puzzle piece, and each piece has 4 orientations, except for the middle piece
(because rotating this piece just rotates the entire puzzle).
This gives $4^8 9! \approx 23.8$ billion arrangements of the puzzle. 
Therefore, just trying every puzzle arrangement is too slow.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/2020-06-26-scramble-puzzle/order.png" alt="backtracking order">
</figure>

<p>The backtracking algorithm is more efficient.
In this algorithm, each piece is placed one at a time in the order shown above.
Then either the piece fits, and we move onto the next position, or it does not and we try a new piece.
If we run out of pieces, we backtrack to the last position where a piece was placed, and try a new piece.
If we reach position <em>k=8</em> and the last piece fits successfully, a solution is registered. Then we backtrack again to find other solutions.</p>

<p>This algorithm very effectively cuts down the search space. 
If a piece does not fit in the <em>k</em>th position, then all arrangements with the piece in that position are skipped.
So if for example, a piece does not fit in position <em>k=1</em>, then all $4(4^7 7!)$ arrangements with the piece in this position are skipped.
That’s 1.4% of the total search space.</p>

<h2 id="the-python-code">The Python code</h2>

</figure>

<p>The Serengeti puzzle I posted above has no solution<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. So instead I’ll use a mock-up of a puzzle I had as a child. This is shown above. 
The goal here is to match triangles with blocks of the same colour.
I’ve labelled each piece from 0 to 8. 
Each piece is encoded as an array using the following rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Colours are mapped to a number: blue → 1, green →  2, red → 3  and purple → 4.</li>
  <li>Triangles are positive and blocks are negative.</li>
  <li>Sides are labelled starting from the top and going clockwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, piece 0 is encoded as <code>[-2, -3, +1, +4]</code>. 
The rest of the pieces look like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>blue</span><span>,</span> <span>green</span><span>,</span> <span>red</span><span>,</span> <span>purple</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>
<span>pieces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
	<span>[</span><span>-</span><span>green</span><span>,</span><span>-</span><span>red</span><span>,</span><span>+</span><span>blue</span><span>,</span><span>+</span><span>purple</span><span>],</span>

	<span>[</span><span>+</span><span>red</span><span>,</span><span>-</span><span>purple</span><span>,</span><span>-</span><span>green</span><span>,</span><span>+</span><span>purple</span><span>],</span>
	<span>[</span><span>-</span><span>blue</span><span>,</span><span>-</span><span>red</span><span>,</span><span>+</span><span>green</span><span>,</span><span>+</span><span>purple</span><span>],</span>

<span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The state of the puzzle can be summarised in two variables: <code>order</code>, a list of the order of placements of pieces, and <code>rot</code>, the current rotation applied to each piece.
A rotation is encoded as a number from 0 to 3.
I created a simple class to store this state. I’ve also made a nice representation for the <code>print</code> function, and two functions that I’ll leave abstract for now.</p>

<p>I’ve written the algorithm as a recursive function, so that Python’s memory stack can keep track of different puzzle states for us.
This could also be done in <code>for</code> loop, but then the backtracking has to be explicitly implemented.
Note: the constants are <code>NUM_ORIENTATIONS=4</code> and <code>SIZE=9</code>. The <code>calls</code> variable is useful for analysing the results.</p>

<p>Now let’s elaborate the abstract functions<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. The <code>fit_2pieces()</code> function is simple.
Two pieces “fit” if the sum of the touching sides is 0. So it is written as:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>fit_2pieces</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>piece1</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>],</span> <span>rot1</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>side1</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> 
                      <span>piece2</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>],</span> <span>rot2</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>side2</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>piece1</span><span>[</span><span>side1</span> <span>-</span> <span>rot1</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>piece2</span><span>[</span><span>side2</span> <span>-</span> <span>rot2</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Pieces are “rotated” 90° counter-clockwise by subtracting a value from the index. The indexing behaviour of Python conveniently wraps around with negative numbers,
so something like <code>piece1[0 - 1]</code> is evaluated as <code>piece1[-1]=piece1[3]</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>fit_position()</code> function is not as straightforward. Each piece needs to fit with the previous piece, but the sides which are compared are different at each position. 
Also, at positions 3, 5, 7 and 8, two sides on the piece need to be checked.
I found it was easiest to hardcode all this. This is what it looks like, after some refactoring:</p>

</p>
<p><!--  height:100% else get weird stretching effects  -->
These are the only two solutions for this puzzle.
In total, it calls <code>solve</code> 588 times. The final <code>calls</code> list looks like: 
<span> <code>[1, 9, 43, 165, 70, 151, 68, 60, 19, 2]</code>. </span>
So, 19 times the code placed 8 pieces, but only 2 of those times was it able to progress to a solution.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is tough puzzle to give to someone. Certainly, as an engineer and as a programmer, I would approach this problem with an algorithmic way of mind.
However, when I was younger, I was not thinking along those lines at all. I wonder though, if with guidance, it is worthwhile showing this to a young student.
It would teach them the value of algorithms. 
They do not need to know how to code - it is possible to implement this algorithm by hand. Although it took me 1.5 hours, I was able to do this recently.
Part of the reason it took so long was because I was trying to be clever and skip steps.
But once I followed the simple rules with the physical stack in my hand, I got into a rhythm and it went quickly. 
In any case, it is definitely a worthwhile coding exercise in backtracking and recursion.</p>

            <p><span>Abstract.</span> Papers on leaderless consensus protocols such as EPaxos and Atlas describe the protocols from the ground up. This approach helps a reader without prior knowledge to understand how they work, but at the same time it makes it hard for an expert to grok them because they need to trace and check all the assumptions from scratch rather than rely on already proved protocols. This may explain why the leaderless consensus protocols didn't get traction in the industry despite being known since 2013.</p>

            <p>In this post I present a leaderless consensus protocol built in a modular way on top of known consensus protocol. Its modularity helps in understanding and retrofitting into existing solutions.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div><div>
            <p>From an engineering perspective a consensus protocol is a replication protocol. Usually it is used to replicate a state of an application (a state machine) to increase its availability. The key difference between consensus and primary-backup replication is an ability to tolerate node and network failures without losing integrity of the data.</p>

            <p>One may think of consensus replication as a strongly consistent variant of master-master replication where any replica (a proposer) can initiate a change. Althrouth consistency is never compromised in practice the concurrent processes may abort each other and stall the performance. In literature this situation is known as dueling proposers.</p>

            <blockquote>"It’s easy to construct a scenario in which two proposers each keep issuing a sequence of proposals with increasing numbers, none of which are ever chosen", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"The presence of two concurrent leaders can prevent the commitment of any consensus decision and hence prevent progress", Deconstructing Paxos</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"if multiple processes detect that there is no leaser and all attempt to become leader an the same time, then none of the process is likely to succeed (again dueling proposers)", Google SRE book</blockquote>

            <p>The can't be dismissed as a fluke, take latency of CASPaxos when all requests to change the <span>same object</span> land the same replica and latency of CASPaxos when the requests are uniformly distributed across all five replicas.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/dueling.png"></p><p>We see that when there are 20 clients then the dueling reduces throughput 2.85 times from 4513 ops/s to 1581 op/s and increases p99 latency 10.37 times from 4467 microseconds to 46 milliseconds.</p>

            <p>The absolute numbers and the degradation ratio depend on the hardware. For this and all the follow up experiments I simulated <code>5+c</code> nodes cluster (where <code>c</code> is the number of the clients) with around 178 us RTT between any nodes, 655 bytes/us network throughput, 2 ms fsync disk latency and 1132 bytes/us disk throughput, although I haven't pushed the system to the limit of the bandwidth so the throughput numbers for disk and network don't really matter.</p>

            <p>The shape of the charts surprised me. Usually when a system reaches saturation the latency looks linear while throughput reaches plateau and stops growing. But in this case the shapes are inverted which implies that the system is far from saturation and that we can keep adding clients increasing throughput without affecting latency. It happens because CASPaxos replicates state instead of the commands so a proposer can apply multiple commands in chain to the stored state and replicate only the final version (batching on steroids) reducing the load on the network.</p>

            <p>Leslie Lamport suggested using a leader election abstraction to select a leader (a distinguished proposer) which is the only one capable of processing requests. It's worth noting that the idea of a leader is used to reduce contention and not to enforce consistency. Meaning the leader election may be weak and may not prevent the case where several replicas become leaders for the same period of time. It allows the use of a large class of protocols for leader election including randomised timeouts &amp; heartbeats, consistent hashing routering or external arbiter.</p>

            <p>But the idea of leader election has its flaws:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>hardware issues may degrade performance of a leader and affect the whole system</li>
                <li>after a leader fails and until a new leader is elected, a consensus based system becomes unavailable</li>
                <li>randomised leader election under unstable network creates non-trivial failure modes which may delay election of a new leader</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I built a leadered version of consensus replication and used fault injection to demonstrate the issues. The stable leadership is compared with ad hoc leadership which is known to suffer from dueling proposers under normal circumstances. The leaderd system uses 4ms election timeout while the fault injector isolates a random replica for 12ms.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leader.adhoc.unrest.png"></p><p>For 20 clients the fault injections cause the stable leadership to have 2.46 times lower throughput (709 ops/s vs. 1750 ops/s) and 1.5 times higher p99 latency (60ms vs. 40ms) than an ad hoc leadership approach.</p>

            <p>It looks like we have to choose between scylla and charybdis: either to have 6.36 times lower than optimal throughput (4513 ops/s vs 709 ops/s) during unavoidable transient issues under strong leadership or to have throughput profile independent of failures (1581 ops/s and 1750 ops/s) but both 2.85 times less than optimal under ad hoc leadership.</p>

            <p>The question is if there is a compromise between being fast without failures and being fast on a rainy day. The family of leaderless consensus protocols fills that niche.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/epaxos.png"></p><p>EPaxos solves the contention problem and provides excellent fault tolerance. But despite being around for seven years it hasn't generated enough traction and I don't know any product in the industry which is using it. The lack of interest is especially noticeable if we compare EPaxos to Raft protocol which was discovered around the same time.</p>

            

            <p>The lack of popularity may be attributed to the complexity. I've found several reports on implementing EPaxos: <a href="https://medium.com/princeton-systems-course/reproducing-epaxos-by-ang-li-and-robin-qiu-b5a8fc5262a2">Reproducing EPaxos</a> by Robin Qiu and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6246">EPaxos</a> by Blake Eggleston, and both of them mention the complexity of EPaxos:</p>

            <blockquote>One major drawback of the algorithm is its complexity. From our understanding, EPaxos is more like a two-dimensional Paxos on top of an eventual-consistency-like layer.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>We only implemented the basic EPaxos, and it is already much more complicated than Raft. We believe the fully optimized EPaxos will be even more complicated. In practice, complicated algorithms are hard to design, optimize, and maintain, making them less likely to be adopted in production.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>It’s still pretty rough, I just wanted to get it to a point where we could get a feel for the performance advantages and decide if the additional complexity was worth it</blockquote>

            <p>Funny enough the complexity of the protocol <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10917.pdf">manifested</a> in the official reference implementation of the EPaxos and TLA+ proof having a bug which leads replicas to diverge and break the linearizability of the replicated service.</p>

            <p>This post is an attempt to design a leaderless consensus protocol but keep it simple via the modular approach by reusing already proved components.</p>

        </div></div>

        
          
        <div><div>
            <p>The core idea of the pacified consensus is to order client requests and to let replicas to co-execute the same request in parallel. The preordering reduces contention and parallel execution increases fault tolerance. Even when one replica gets isolated or goes offline another finishes its request without a delay because it is already working on it in parallel.</p>

            <p>The parallel execution doesn't affect correctness because the effects of the parallel execution can be explained by the selective duplication of messages and Paxos tolerates this kind of intrusion</p>

            <p>The task of ordering client requests in a fault tolerant way and replicating it to the replicas sounds like a consensus problem. It is natural to suggest that running two consensus replication processes can't be faster than running just one but actually it is.</p>

            <p>The trick is that a major part of the latency comes from the disk IO. Even when we use NVM but target high throughput we should make small delays to accumulate writes (4 ms) and write them in batches.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/nvm.png"></p><p>4 ms is 20 times higher than intra datacenter RTT, so in-memory consensus in front of on-disk consensus doesn't contribute much to the overall end to end latency but completely eliminates contention.</p>

            <p>This idea isn't just wild speculations, I've built it and measured the performance. And the leaderless consensus performs on par with leadered when there are no faults, latency is just 23% worse but throughput is 36% better.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.leader.png">

            The leaderless consensus with faults performs a bit worse than leaderless consensus without faults.

            <img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.unrest.png"></p><p>Without context 67% increase in P99 latency (9267us vs 5535us) and 12% decrease in throughput (6154 ops/s vs 5392 ops/s) doesn't look good but when we compare it with other solutions it's almost an order of magnitude better.</p>

		<p><img alt="explorer5" src="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/explorer5.png" width="448" height="336" srcset="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/explorer5.png 640w, http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/explorer5-440x330.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px"></p>
<p>I’ve been wanting to write something about <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001692">Explorer</a>&nbsp;for a long time. The more that contemplative exploration games like Proteus, Dear Esther and Fract become an established thing, the more interesting this little (read: absolutely gigantic) 1986 game seems to become.</p>
<p>Explorer was created for the ZX Spectrum by UK coders Graham Relf and Simon Dunstan (under the software development wing of <a title="Sinclair User article about the RamJam Corporation" href="http://archive.today/Q0Jk">George Stone, one of the men behind Max Headroom</a>).&nbsp;The premise is that your spaceship has crash-landed on an alien jungle planet and broken into bits, which have in turn scattered themselves across the entire globe (somehow). You have to explore and find them all.&nbsp;And there’s some serious exploring to do, because the game has <em>40 billion </em>procedurally-generated&nbsp;“graphic locations” (in the marketing terminology of the time).</p>
<p>Look at one of those locations, and there’s something interesting about Explorer that’s hiding in plain sight:&nbsp;<em>it’s in first-person. </em>That’s no mean feat for the mid-’80s. It’s all smoke and mirrors, of course: 8-bit computers would have wept actual blood trying to build Explorer’s world in actual full-on 3D. Relf and Dunstan’s ‘Rotovision’ layered flat layer upon flat layer, generating static (and slow to draw) views of your immediate and distant surroundings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thelordsofmidnight.com/index2.html">The Lords of Midnight</a>&nbsp;had pioneered a similar technique. But Explorer didn’t ape the clean, two-colour, comic book style world of Mike Singleton’s masterpiece. Instead, it took a step towards realistic first-person environments. The impressionist sense of scale and distance was unusual for the time, and even now there’s a painterly quality to the environments and their use of silhouette and shading.&nbsp;Those trees, in particular, are somehow simultaneously a bit of a mess (mostly thanks to the Spectrum’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_clash">colour clash</a>) and surprisingly evocative of a real jungle towering over you.</p>
<p><a href="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/explorer2.png" rel="image_group"><img alt="explorer2" src="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/explorer2.png" width="512" height="384" srcset="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/explorer2.png 640w, http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/explorer2-440x330.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>Explorer has a unique atmosphere, heightened by an unerring stillness throughout. Everything in this world is motionless except for the odd pool of water, and behind the dense forest lie hauntingly quiet villages, with strange stone totems towering over huts that have been abandoned by whatever used to live in them. Every so often, you encounter a shimmering warp gate — again, provenance unknown — that you can use to fly to a new area of oppressively empty wilderness. The only action is a sporadic (and clumsily implemented) attack by skittering bugs.</p>
<p><a href="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/explorer3.png" rel="image_group"><img alt="explorer3" src="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/explorer3.png" width="512" height="384"></a></p>
<p>All this quiet beauty (a little phrase I’ve borrowed from Samantha Nelson’s very prescient article about <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/theres-hidden-beauty-abandoned-world-warcraft-citi-203779">World of Warcraft’s ghost cities</a>), coupled with the focus on just walking around and discovering what’s over the horizon, makes Explorer something of a forgotten granddad in the exploration game family tree.</p>
<p>Yes, you could successfully argue that earlier first-person games — Mercenary, The Eidolon — created a similar atmosphere of exploring the unknown. But Relf and Dunstan’s game&nbsp;has a much deeper connection to today’s “walking simulators” (and by the way, I love Ed Keys’ point that if we’re going to deride exploration games on those terms, <a href="http://videogametourism.at/node/1966">we should just go ahead and call FPSs “face clickers”</a>).</p>
<p>Because Explorer was born from a&nbsp;<em>literal&nbsp;</em>walking simulator.</p>
<p>Two years before Explorer, Graham created The Forest, first for the TRS-80 and then for the Spectrum. It’s a game proudly described on its title screen as “a simulation of orienteering” — Graham created a <a href="http://www.grelf.net/omaps/theforest.html">full OS-style map for it</a> — and it was probably the only 8-bit game ever deliberately built around the joy of walking. It got a rave review from Crash magazine, too. Explorer was, in Graham’s words, a “less orienteering-oriented version” of the same concept.</p>
<p><a href="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/theforest.png" rel="image_group"><img alt="theforest" src="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/theforest.png" width="512" height="384" srcset="http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/theforest.png 640w, http://pixelatron.com/blog/media/theforest-440x330.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>It’s fascinating to learn of Explorer’s orienteering heritage, then trek forward to today where Proteus is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/01/proteus-games-playstation-3-vita">influenced by Ed Key’s childhood walks in the Wiltshire countryside</a>&nbsp;and has a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlJc_ght5s0">trailer</a>&nbsp;filmed in the Lake District.</p>
<p>It’s just a shame that&nbsp;Explorer is, essentially, empty.&nbsp;There’s no <em>reward&nbsp;</em>for exploring —&nbsp;no puzzles like Myst, no story like Dear Esther, no enchanting you with colours and sounds and wondrous sights like Proteus. The eerieness of Explorer’s nameless planet, the empty buildings clearly once built and inhabited by&nbsp;<em>something</em>, suggest the beginnings of a mystery — but it’s actually the beginning&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the end. There’s nothing to uncover. Just nine bits of spaceship and 39,999,999,991 empty locations.</p>
<p>As such, Explorer’s reviews were less than glowing. Still, it’s fun in retrospect to see game journalists of the ’80s as mystified by Explorer as many of today’s gamers are by genre-defying indie gems. Here’s Popular Computing Weekly’s verdict on Explorer:</p>
<blockquote><p>[It] really does defy categorisation. It’s not an adventure, it’s certainly not an arcade game, and it’s too surreal to be a strategy game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>If Explorer had incorporated text adventure elements — probably the most fitting option in the era it was made — I suspect it’d have got better reviews, and moved it into the family tree of Myst (a game that both Proteus and Fract have often been compared to). And in fact, Explorer’s sketchbook look, and the lack of on-screen indicators and counters, lends it a similar atmosphere to ’80s graphic text adventures, which also often sent you alone into a foreboding forest or jungle (I’m reminded of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/mindshadow/screenshots/gameShotId,152839/">the early stages of Activision’s 1985 adventure Mindshadow</a>&nbsp;in particular).</p>
<p>Or perhaps if Graham and Simon had made Explorer a true sequel to The Forest, a proper walking game, just you and nature, with views that opened out rather than walls of rainforest that constantly closed in on you… well,&nbsp;it would probably have got even <em>worse&nbsp;</em>reviews. But as <a href="http://videogametourism.at/node/1967">Tale of Tales told the VideoGameTourism site</a>&nbsp;in response to all the “walking simulator” jibes about their games:</p>
<blockquote><p>Walking is one of the nicest things one can do on this planet. Very worthy of simulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been in touch with Graham for this blog post — and after I contacted him, he’s started busily building a new version of The Forest in HTML! You can view the progress for yourself&nbsp;<a href="http://www.grelf.net/forest/forest.html">on Graham’s website</a>.</p>

    <p>Amazon has released their EC2 M6g instances for a while, they are powered by ARM-based AWS Graviton2 processors. And Amazon announces that M6g delivers up to 40% better price performance over current generation M5 instances. A straight price comparison of m6g.2xlarge against m5n.2xlarge in Tokyo region results in about 35% reduction.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(0.612 - 0.396) / 0.612 =&gt; 0.3529
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So it’s really confusing how does the 40% better price performance is calculated, here we don’t even put in the potential performance reduction a single ARM core compared to a normal X86 core. But I was still going to make some real tests, there might be miracles.</p>

<p>I made a test with the Mixin Kernel as an archive node. Mixin Kernel is a distributed ledger, and the node will do many crypto verifications, which is a pretty good choice for a CPU performance test, especially the node utilizes all cores to do parallel computations and uses a lot of RAM for cache, and the persistence layer of the node is  built upon BadgerDB, which is a key value database that makes use of the property of SSD  a lot to facilitates the data reading and writing.</p>

<p>I spin up a M6g instance with 8 vCPU and 30 GB memory, processor flags are simple. Good.</p>

<p><img src="https://vec.io/images/2020/06/30/arm-cpu.png" alt="ARM CPU"></p>

<p>There is no default ARM build in Mixin releases, so I need to build it by myself on the server. Golang is king, I downloaded the go arm64 build, installed <code>build-essential</code> because the <code>zsdt</code> package utilizes cgo, then I built mixin successfully, no hurdles. Then I started <code>mixin kernel</code> to sync the full graph, and for direct comparison I also launched a fresh m5n.2xlarge instance.</p>

<p>The result was very frustrating, after 3 days, the ARM one had lagged behind about 50% and would never catch up with the new transactions finalized. I don’t have time to profile the exact performance bottlenecks yet, and I made more m6g.4xlarge instances to test and they all never synced up.</p>

<p>Until recently I updated the mixin code to the latest master which has some performance related commits, and I’m shocked that a m6g.2xlarge is capable of syncing millions of transactions in 20 hours and keeps synced with the graph. I also did the same update on a m5n.2xlarge server, it still performs better than the ARM server, but only slightly, about 30 minutes ahead to sync about 3 million transactions.</p>

<p>Of course not 40% better price performance, but somewhat competitive.</p>

    </em></small>
  </span></p><p>Recently on my Twitter I’ve been seeing some buzz about a new email app called <a href="https://hey.com/features/">HEY</a>. It seems to improve some ergonomics with traditional approaches to email, like moving receipt emails to a “paper trail” area, better screening of new contacts, and some other things.</p>

<p>Fundamentally though, it’s still email under the covers. This made me wonder what an evolution of what email actually <em>is</em> would look like.</p>

<p>Maybe it would help to consider where email is already evolving. Email began as exchanging plain text electronic letters between humans but now it is used for so much more.</p>

<p>For example, every time you place an online order you immediately get an order receipt, sent from a machine. When your order ships you get an update with a tracking number. As your shipment proceeds towards your house, you get tracking updates until the item arrives. This isn’t traditional correspondence between humans any more, this is <strong>data exchange</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="data-schemas">Data schemas</h2>

<p>Google had in fact already recognized this evolution and introduced <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/reference">special markup</a> that annotates the unstructured text and image format of email into structured data. When a sender includes this structured data in an email, Google’s email service Gmail recognizes the type and can display display special <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/actions/actions-overview">“actions”</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/highlights">“highlights”</a>.</p>

<div>

<p>This structured data vocabulary is the same approach that Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">advises web developers to use</a> to help its crawlers accurately understand content across the Web by the way. For example, an online store annotating a product’s page with an <a href="https://schema.org/Offer">Offer</a> may give you a snippet like this in Google search results:</p>

    <em>Searching Google for a specific product may return <a href="https://econsultancy.com/what-are-rich-search-results-and-how-can-you-get-them/">rich results</a> like this</em>
  </p>

<p>Applying data schemas to mail messages is a rich vein that hasn’t been fully explored yet, and I think could enable new types of data to be stored that don’t fit in the mail-like mold. I’ll give some examples further down.</p>

<h2 id="public-writable-log">Public-writable log</h2>

<p>When I think of email as a data structure, I think of it as a public-writable <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">log</a>. Anybody who has my address is allowed to append to my log, given they pass some basic filtering (e.g. spam, size of message).</p>

<div>
  <p><img integrity="sha256-2ROP92BDhCTlXoXAsECyeoD4oCYKnvu547BdvjPrL4w=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://abevoelker.com/assets/emails-successor/log-d9138ff760438424e55e85c0b040b27a80f8a0260a9efbb9e3b05dbe33eb2f8c.png">

<p>
    <em><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">Log</a> data structure</em>
  </p>

<p>I think this is the <strong>key insight</strong> of email and definitely worth keeping in the next evolution.</p>

<h2 id="data-sharing">Data sharing</h2>

<p>What email <em>doesn’t</em> currently have is a way to share access to your data with others.</p>

<p>What I think would be interesting is to be able to scope queries to certain pieces of data, and give read access to third parties for this data.</p>

<p>Let me give an example.</p>

<p>Right now, when I’ve placed online orders on various websites, I get a wide mix of different email notifications. Almost all of them email me a receipt for the order immediately. Most of them email me when the order ships. Some of them email me updates every time the status of the parcel changes.</p>

<p>Just to cover my bases, I’m also signed up for USPS Informed Delivery®, UPS My Choice®, and FedEx Delivery Manager®, so that I get notified whenever a package is scheduled to arrive at my address regardless of who it’s from (I don’t like surprises!).</p>

<p>It’s all very scattershot, and to keep track of what’s coming and going I’m usually jumping between emails, comparing tracking numbers here to order information over there.</p>

<p>What would be nice is if I had some personal dashboards, say one for Orders and one for Postal Mail that showed me the status of all my orders across all vendors, and all the postal mail that would be arriving soon (with hyperlinks between Orders and Postal Mail even). This could be either something I build myself, or a third party service that I allow keyhole access to just my orders and shipments from my personal log.</p>

<div>
  <p><img integrity="sha256-u+yZ6ECALFVEg+O85km7k4l57flfPL1Xs1cfwEBhtzg=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://abevoelker.com/assets/emails-successor/orders-example-bbec99e840802c554483e3bce649bb938979edf95f3cbd57b3571fc04061b738.png">
  </p>
</div>
<p>
    <em>What if you had an Orders dashboard like Amazon's, but for <strong>all</strong> your online orders?</em>
  </p>

<p>This may not sound that appealing if 99% of your orders come from Amazon. But when you order from a wide array of online shops, it could be useful. In the current climate of gun buying for example, I’ve had to use spreadsheets to keep track of what’s arriving from all the various vendors that I order from!</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I unironically love that gun-related shopping was spared the consolidation of Amazon et al and you still commonly buy gear from Geocities-esque sites like it's 2003 <a href="https://t.co/HWvZpXQAuK">https://t.co/HWvZpXQAuK</a> <a href="https://t.co/Drez8WkbTQ">pic.twitter.com/Drez8WkbTQ</a></p>— Abe Voelker (@abevoelker) <a href="https://twitter.com/abevoelker/status/1184218082144854017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>I’ll give more examples in the following sections.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-data-scope">Expanding data scope</h2>

<p>Right now there is a lot of personal data that doesn’t fit into email or a mail-like messaging system that would be a good fit for a personal log / database.<sup id="fnref:log-database"><a href="#fn:log-database">2</a></sup></p>

<p>For example, I’ve moved addresses several times over the last decade. Every other year or so I’ve seen a new optometrist, and I always opt to get those laser retina scans done. But I’m certain that every time I’ve switched to a new optometrist, there is no history carried forward from the previous optometrist - I have a bunch of retina scan records scattered across multiple offices.</p>

<p>What would be nice is if there was a “medical” section of my personal log, and my optometrist could (with permission) append my latest retina scan to my log, and (with permission) pull previous scans out for comparison. This way I’m the primary hub, and owner, of my own medical data.</p>

<p>Obviously the above scenario could also apply to doctor and dentist visits.</p>

<h2 id="example---changing-mailing-address">Example - changing mailing address</h2>

<p>On the topic of changing addresses, if you’ve ever moved I’m sure you’re familiar with having to update all the various services you use with your new mailing address, and how you’ll almost certainly miss some.</p>

<p>Imagine if you could annotate your personal log with your current mailing address. When you move, you simply update this annotation, and authorized third parties are able to pull the new data (imagine something similar to a webhook).</p>

<p>Put another way, you could think of it as a rudimentary “home address DNS”:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i've often wanted home address DNS.</p>— Petulant Fig Nemesis (Mark 11:12-14) (@mwotton) <a href="https://twitter.com/mwotton/status/869696220347981824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="example---bank-accounts-and-financials">Example - bank accounts and financials</h2>

<p>Money is another fundamentally personal bit of data that would be interesting to include in the personal log.</p>

<p>What if your bank account and credit card ledgers were synchronized to your personal log? Instead of getting an email with a PDF or CSV statement at the end of the month, each individual credit or debit was immediately replicated to your log?</p>

<p>At the very least, I’d be grateful to have the full history of my bank account(s) in my log, because for some reason the banks I use seem to not show transactions past about a year.</p>

<p>And if my employer could attach my W-2 to my personal log (or schools attaching 1098-T, etc.), couldn’t filing taxes be as simple as running a rollup query against my (and/or my spouse’s) data? At least as a first approximation.</p>

<h2 id="open-question---other-data">Open question - other data?</h2>

<p>I’m curious what other type of data could fit in the personal log. On some occasions I’ve had to find my vehicle’s license plate number and VIN; previously I’ve had to search my email for PDF scans of insurance quotes I’ve gotten, but could this data live in the log as a first-class citizen?</p>

<p>Can the personal log be adapted to fit generalized notes, like people used to (still?) use Evernote? Or would that be too much sprawl? Could one build a structured data personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">knowledge graph</a> with it?</p>

<p>How about the people who do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">“quantified self”</a> tracking and measurements of their own bodies - seems like the personal log would be a good place to store that instead of some proprietary database. If your doctor could pull up your Apple Watch’s heart rate history and correlate that with the physician-kept medical records it seems like they could <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/11/through-apple-heart-study--stanford-medicine-researchers-show-we.html">do some cool things</a>.</p>

<p>What about all the pictures and video I take (particularly of my family); wouldn’t that be a good data stream to add to the personal log? Would it be easy to share data streams with say my wife or other family members?</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>There are plenty of difficulties to be addressed in building a system like the above.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">“Worse is better”</a> is an obvious consideration. Adding schemas to data opens up new possibilities, but the sheer simplicity of plain text remains empowering. The fact that Unix commands are still primarily strung together with plain text after half a century should be a testament to that.<sup id="fnref:shells"><a href="#fn:shells">3</a></sup> For this reason untyped data would still need to be supported in the personal log.</p>

<p>Security is another consideration. Like email, having an account stolen or forgetting credentials would be a very bad thing to happen. But when you’re adding fine-grained medical and financial data the stakes are much higher.</p>

<p>Further, deciding on schemas to use for the data could be a bit tricky. <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> does a good job with certain properties, although it’s not the only ontology in town.</p>

<p>Looking at medical data in particular, there would certainly be difficulties syncing up the different formats of electronic medical records (EMR), although in the US, the National Library of Medicine has created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Medical_Language_System">Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)</a> which does unify some of it.</p>

<p>Bank account ledgers would also have all kinds of different formats between banks and across international boundaries.</p>

<p>Yet, it would be interesting to see if the need for such a system would create incentives to unify some of this data that before seemed unlikely to ever be unified. If the Web can do it, why can’t this?</p>

        <section>
            <p>I'm one of those people surprised at the success of the Go programming language. Here is a language that prides itself in offering less than languages designed decades ago, unabashedly not OOP, and without a decent dependency management system (at least initially), but still wildly successful, with a number of significant open source projects written in it (e.g. Docker, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform">Terraform</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>). Another intriguing thing is that people who use Go as their primary language rarely complain about it (maybe a <em>generics would be nice</em> here and there), while those who come into initial contact with it can't stop swearing, at least initially (<em>mea culpa</em>). I used this gap in affinity as a chance to understand the intricacies of Go by diving into the platform, and writing down what I think is necessary knowledge for newcomers to become productive on it. The target reader group would be developers already proficient in one language and platform; as the text is already quite long, I didn't want to explain common programming terminology. Unavoidably, my perspective is skewed by the technologies I'm acquainted with, especially Python, with which I frequently compare Go, but it should be useful for all newcomers, even those without too much programming experience. I hope that those already working in Go can also find a useful tip here and there.</p>

<p>And now to the "Why" in the title. The design of Go is a bit curious, in that it leaves out most features of other popular programming languages, going for simplicity rather than recommending itself with more features. My aim was to make a proper attempt at understanding the context for this choice, by following the path from expectations from a language, to design principles, to language features, and finally to the embodiment of the language in terms of compiler, runtime and tooling. This process is never perfect for any technical product, as there are incidental turns taken at every step, but I think the knowledge of how different aspects of a language came to be the way they are, while depending on each other and the context, is very important and useful. I therefore attempted to start with an overview of the "intellectual" history of Go, connecting following discussions of features to this history.</p>

<p>This first part in what I intend to be a two-part series will concentrate on the Go toolchain, that is, the set of tools for writing, verifying, compiling and maintaning Go applications. As we will see, Go tooling has come a long way, and offers a first-class development environment for writing correct and performant applications. The second installment will deal with the most important features of the language, also in the light of Go design decisions. I would like both parts to stay as up-to-date and relevant as possible, so if you have any comments on improving, do leave a comment, and I will make sure to address it.</p>

<h3 id="whyisgothewayitis">Why is Go the way it is?</h3>

<p>In order to appreciate the design decisions that went into the Go language, it's important to understand where the language designers started from, and what problems they expected their language to solve. As Rob Pike explains in detail in <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article">this article</a> from 2012, Go was not designed to experiment with PLT concepts. The languages and technologies it intended to replace were those in daily use at Google (C++, Java and Python); Go was designed to solve the problems these platforms presented at Google scale. A rough three-part categorization of the problems Go is intended to address can be done as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Build issues</strong>: The problems that C and C++ model of compilation presents are well-known. As explained in the linked article, compiling a moderately large C++ codebase can lead to gigabytes of IO. Go avoids this and similar issues by making unused imports an error, and replacing header files and includes with an inverted dependency model of compilation. Circular imports are also not allowed. One interesting side effect of this stress on dependency hygiene is that copy-paste is preferred to importing large packages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dependency hygiene trumps code reuse. One example of this in practice is that the (low-level) net package has its own integer-to-decimal conversion routine to avoid depending on the bigger and dependency-heavy formatted I/O package. Another is that the string conversion package strconv has a private implementation of the definition of 'printable' characters rather than pull in the large Unicode character class tables; that strconv honors the Unicode standard is verified by the package's tests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Developer ergonomics</strong>: Go is a minimalist language that tries to do away with features of languages used at Google, such as C++, Java and Python, which are not coincidentally also quite popular in the rest of the dev community. In fact, as <a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">this candid blog post</a> explains, the initial drive to develop Go came from unpleasant experiences developing concurrent code in C++, and the intention of the standards committee to make the language even more complex. While differentiating itself from popular languages, Go cannot stray too far away from them, as it is intended to be used in production at a company the size of Google. As such, it has to be easy to learn, and familiar to junior developers. This simplicity is at the service of solving modern programming challengs, foremost being concurrency. Concurrency in Go is provided through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">communicating sequential processes (CSP)</a>, the advantage of which is that it is easy to integrate into a procedural language. Another modern feature that now meets a C-like language in Go is garbage collection. Due to the type system and memory allocation features of Go, however, garbage collection is different from the way it works in languages like Java or Python; we will discuss this in the follow-up post.</p>

<p><strong>Google-scale</strong>: The design of Go is optimized for disambiguity and parsability. The underlying reasons are the ease of writing external tools and avoiding discord in large developer teams. As an example, Pike <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_4.">mentions</a> that having languages that are whitespace-sensitive, such as Python, is not an issue in itself, but Python embedded in SWIG declarations turns out to be a huge problem. In order to preclude such nuisances, Go has curly braces and clear formatting rules. Another example is the now famous auto-formatting tool that provides a standard through implementation. This, and similar tools like <code>gofix</code> which we will discuss later, are possible because the language is easy to parse and unambiguous (in comparison to e.g. C++, which can have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse">statements that can be parsed multiple ways</a>). These tools enable standards to be set within large groups, and also systematic changes such as API changes to be made on large code bases. Generally, it can also be said that the rest of the design concerns gathered in the previous categories also contribute to scaling Go, especially those concerning concurrency primitives and strong standard library support. Another aspect of scale is the number of people working on a project. As Pike correctly observes, developers tend to stick to a subset they understand of a complex language with many features. As Go has a rather limited set of features, there is no subset to agree on.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all the design choices that went into Go can be explained through these points. There are quite a number of things that are put to good use in other languages, but are explicitly shunned in Go, such as OOP, exceptions and generics. In my opinion, there is one general thread that connects the dots, which is that in Go, things that are a pain in the large are not allowed in the small, either. Or in <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_7.">Rob Pike's words</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As with many of the design decisions in Go, it forces the programmer to think earlier about a larger-scale issue … that if left until later may never be addressed satisfactorily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another important aspect you need to keep in mind when reading Go documentation, and wondering at how <em>basic</em> it is, is that priorities in keeping the implementation simple and feasible in certain areas led the designers to simply omit what one takes for granted in other languages, but leads to hidden complexity in the implementation. As stated in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_doesnt_Go_have_feature_X">official FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go was designed with an eye on felicity of programming, speed of compilation, orthogonality of concepts, and the need to support features such as concurrency and garbage collection. Your favorite feature may be missing because it doesn't fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="thegotoolchain">The Go toolchain</h3>

<p>The core of the Go toolchain is the <code>go</code> command line tool that bundles the most important components, including the compiler. In the rest of this text, Go refers to the language and ecosystem, whereas go (with lowercase g) refers to the command line tool. Go adheres to the recent pattern of delivering development tools where the entry point is one single command which accepts a first argument as an action (other examples could be git and kubectl). In daily work, when building Go code, one rarely has to deal directly with the actual compiler or linker, which are hidden somewhere in the Go distribution. The Go compiler is in fact written in Go itself, and thanks to this fact and the snappy compile times, boostrapping the Go toolchain is one of the simplest ways to get an up-to-date version on your computer. You will first need to get the out-of-date but still useful version of go from system repositories, as in <code>apt install golang</code>. Afterwards, download the latest source package …</p></section></article></div></div>

If so, you're not alone&nbsp;— and there is Canadian science to back you up.</p>  <p>As political and business leaders push to reopen the economy hoping to get restaurants, retailers and factories making money again, there may be good economic reasons for putting at least some of the work-from-home crowd back into the office as fast as it's safe to do so.</p>  <p>Canadian research on "computer-mediated communication," begun long before the current lockdown, shows video chat is an inadequate substitute for real-life interaction. The real thing, dependant&nbsp;on non-verbal cues, is extraordinarily more effective in creating rapport and getting ideas across.</p>  <p>Not only that, but the familiarity and trust we currently feel with coworkers during the lockdown's remote calls rests on connections remembered from back when we sat at a nearby desk or met for lunch.</p>  <h2>Bad for business</h2>  <p>As the lockdown stretches out and the mix of colleagues changes, it may be almost impossible to establish healthy trusting working relationships using remote video chat tools alone.</p>  <p>That's bad for business, said&nbsp;organizational behaviour specialist Mahdi Roghanizad from Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Business. The reason:&nbsp;getting a good reading on your fellow workers has been repeatedly shown to be essential for business efficiency, reaching common goals&nbsp;and establishing trust.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | 'Zoom fatigue' is real and it's setting in:&nbsp;</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Many people are feeling drained because of an increase in video conferencing and psychologists have started describing it as “Zoom fatigue.”<!-- --> <!-- -->2:06</span></span></span></p>  <p>It is why teams <u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/employment-remote-work-1.5269792" target="_blank">that worked remotely</a></u> even before the pandemic lockdown always met periodically in person. The latest research shows human-to-human bonding is like a kind of intuitive magic.</p>  <p>"Say you are seeing a person for the first time," explained Roghanizad. "After two&nbsp;to five&nbsp;minutes of interaction, you will have a better chance of a more accurate prediction about their cooperativeness or generosity. This is how our brain evolved."</p>  <p>The crucial point is that merely "seeing" the person is not enough.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This ability goes away when the same interaction happens in video-to-video communication as is happening today through Zoom or Google Meet or Skype," explained Roghanizad, who started his career as an electrical engineer and has since used the tools of hard science to investigate the failures of computerized communication.</p>    <p>The scientist's interest began more than decade ago with&nbsp;research quoted in the Harvard Business Review that showed face-to-face communication was <u><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-face-to-face-request-is-34-times-more-successful-than-an-email" target="_blank">34 per cent more effective</a></u> than email in persuading people to donate to a good cause.</p>  <p>To those of us today with loaded electronic in-boxes, the results of that research may not be surprising. At the time, however,&nbsp;it was considered revolutionary because people in the study expected outcomes for email and personal contact to be about the same.</p>  <p>The results inspired Roghanizad and others to look into the reasons why person-to-person contact increased bonding and established a sense of trustworthiness.</p>  <h2>The smell of success</h2>  <p>Candidates included pheromones — the subtle fragrances we give off — plus a series of muted hand and body gestures such as crossing your arms and leaning back that in various combinations researchers have shown inspire confidence and "are predictive of economic behaviour," according to one <u><a href="http://robotic.media.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/01/Desteno-etal-PS-12.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a>.</u></p>  <p>Roghanizad's most recent research is helping to prove is that without real-life contact, those non-verbal cues simply don't register in a key interactive part of the human brain responsible for what scientists call "<u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2695977050" target="_blank">theory of mind</a></u>" —that creation of understanding between people working in groups.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A dog looks at Brussels Grand Place square as restaurants and bars reopen after the COVID-19 lockdown earlier this month.

No matter how many times people roll their eyes, passwords are a problem. The fact remains, strong passwords are hard to remember, and strict company password policies and rotation bother employees. These difficulties allow for attacks such as phishing attacks and password re-use. We all know we need another solution. There have been multiple attempts to solve the password problem, such as biometrics and password managers, but they all have their own quirks and flaws. Enter FIDO2. The FIDO2 specification aims to get rid of passwords once and for all, without sacrificing security. In this talk, we have an in-depth look at what FIDO2 offers, whether it solves the password problem and discuss its security model.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://remesh.blog/@PDilyard?source=post_page-----d0fd14f8fb9b----------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Paul Dilyard" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*CvVDXFeZQ9gF-ekB-Ixl_A.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="4b5e">Before a company incorporates AI into their product offerings, it’s important to consider a few critical steps that lead to a core parent level concept: a well rounded and extensible data strategy. Data strategies can come in different forms and for the most part are structured in a way to support both a business and future iterations of technology. With that said, let’s take a look at what these steps consist of in the context of solving problems with AI.</p><p id="049b">Data is a critical piece to supporting performant machine learning <em>(Note: Performance is something defined by an organization as it can be unique case by case — performance also doesn’t necessarily just mean accuracy since accuracy can be treated as a subset of performance.)</em>. No surprise to anyone, hopefully. With every iteration of a product, or delivery of an MVP, there should always be early conversations with Science and Data teams to answer questions around data collection.</p><blockquote><p id="ec6f">E<strong>xample:</strong></p><p id="ce05">A team set out to see if their unique data could predict whether a person was thinking about hurting themselves or others. This unique data consisted of internet browsing instances including Google searches, YouTube, or various web pages. The team had millions of events that consisted of discrete page visits that were timestamped and could be threaded across a selected interval. What the team was missing was the classification of those pages, in other words, whether the pages were related to self-harm or not. The team was looking to employ a supervised learning model (data events or instances that are labeled) but did not have enough labeled data. The team employed a simple model. In doing so the team released a low complexity model with a tradeoff of high bias. As a data collection strategy, the team released this model with a simple UI that enabled users reviewing the output to validate or categorize the data. This data collection strategy enabled the team to feed more data into the model over time and develop more complex and lower bias models.</p></blockquote><p id="d872">Often times this is facilitated by a data warehouse and data pipeline. Being able to access a diverse set of data easily helps Science and Data teams move and iterate quickly!</p><blockquote><p id="947d"><strong>Example:</strong></p><p id="7f90">A team was supporting an eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score) that used open text inputs from various sources (i.e. surveys, slack, notes documents). The objective was to try and find topics and sentiment across how employees were feeling about the company. By combining data from different sources, the team was able to feed a machine learning model different types of text. This type of study was run pretty frequently so having all of the data in one place and accessible made it really easy for the team to continue to iterate and generate outputs for the company.</p></blockquote><p id="b8e1">At the cross section of business and technology you find the opportunity to establish components of your products core value. In an age where more data generally leads to thoughts of higher valuations, it’s important that the first step has an iterative approach to identifying value in the data that is being collected. The focus can quickly change initiatives to collect specific types of data that bring the most value to the product. At early stages of the cycle, diverse data equates to more value since it leads to more trial and experimentation with users of the product.</p><blockquote><p id="3638"><strong>Example:</strong></p><p id="04bd">A team deployed a single model that predicted when students were viewing explicit content on their school issued devices. This became a valuable tool for schools because it helped them identify bad content to block at a system level and also identify when students may be distracted. Because the schools found this valuable, the team was able to tie the unique data they were generating (i.e. an alert or label tied to a specific piece of content) to a numeric value (revenue, usage). The team quickly identified that the data they were collecting could be labeled or categorized in different ways to generate a similar alert to customers (i.e. an alert on viewing math content or viewing content on video games). The team quickly was able to issue out new models at a small scale and test with some customers to see if this type of alerting was valuable to them.</p></blockquote><p id="8489">At Remesh, we have been able to successfully develop a product powered by AI, which has had a huge part in achieving our business milestones. One of the unique aspects of Remesh is that it was founded on the idea of collecting, prioritizing, and understanding the spread of opinions across an audience in real-time, between back-and-forth conversations. So, how did we get here!?</p><p id="fab7">We can try to put things into a contextual framework. Take a look below.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*XNFXVZcwZzS2XAIm?q=20" width="847" height="177" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1694/0*XNFXVZcwZzS2XAIm" width="847" height="177" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*XNFXVZcwZzS2XAIm 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*XNFXVZcwZzS2XAIm 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*XNFXVZcwZzS2XAIm 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*XNFXVZcwZzS2XAIm 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="843f">The best software products (platforms) in the world have the most users. In commanding large user bases they effectively generate the most unique data. In generating high volumes of unique data they are able to iterate more on their products. From a business perspective, these products command the highest market values.</p><p id="b6b3">However, Remesh is in a stage that looks more like this:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*eB6aHmwQyfR_8uPi?q=20" width="690" height="158" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1380/0*eB6aHmwQyfR_8uPi" width="690" height="158" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*eB6aHmwQyfR_8uPi 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*eB6aHmwQyfR_8uPi 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*eB6aHmwQyfR_8uPi 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1380/0*eB6aHmwQyfR_8uPi 690w" sizes="690px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="099b">The above illustrates a product development framework that optimizes for more users and more data. What this also suggests is iterating on a current experience of the product to improve and diversify acquisition of users and data before making large changes to core systems.</p><p id="fefd">The main reason has to do with the learning factor of any AI based product. Over time it gets better and better. Without much testing, you end up never advancing past the data phase to the next critical milestone of your product; the evolution of the product. Another way to look at this is that you can always generate different ways to collect data. You end up with a data rich environment because you have tried different methods to collect different data. A piece you miss here by not evolving your AI strategy is data maturity (iterating and growing your understanding of the data). You effectively lose one of the most valuable factors of incorporating an AI strategy; the learning factor.</p><p id="7a9f">To continue building on the concept of data maturity, at times it is something hard to identify at a business level. You might have a lot of data but simply not know what to do with it. <strong>It is important that product teams take a comprehensive look at the data by being more specific about the business problems that need to be addressed.</strong></p><p id="e1d9">Business problems extend beyond the technical implementation or “performance” of a model. They dive into a realm of understanding customer’s perceptions and behaviors. As a supplement to iterating on an organization’s AI strategy, thinking about how users engage with an AI product is paramount to helping Science and Data teams understand the holistic view of their work.</p><p id="30cd">Remesh has had a Data Strategy from Day 1. Efforts have led to the collection of a target audiences’ responses, while also collecting additional information on how the language of those responses relate to each other in the context of their opinions. 2–3 years down the road, that strategy enabled the construction of a far superior model at capturing opinions that aren’t collected in real-time. Remesh has only realized a small amount of that potential through a small set of customer-facing data analysis tools. But that strategy of small units of data that inform how an audience’s’ opinion(s) maps to language is still going strong.</p><p id="eb8a">In summary, AI strategies can create massive experience gains for any users of the products that incorporate these strategies. It is important that organizations understand how this strategy evolves over time and threads within the fabrics of a product development cycle. Understanding data maturity by creating opportunities for users to inform the product directly can dramatically help a product organization improve their efforts and better align with customer expectations. It all starts with the data that is being collected, and the conscious effort to learn from that data, helping an organization avoid the trap of over-consuming data that might not lead to much value for the business or the businesses’ customers.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

            <h2>When do you stop designing?</h2>
            <p>30 June 2020</p>

        <div>
            <p>When you are designing a new feature, the first user interface design you create is rarely the best one. This causes tension. If the second user interface you design is better than the first, obviously it’s the design you want to implement. But what if the third is better than the second? It most likely <i>will</i> be better. When do you stop designing?</p>

            <p>This is true of many creative endeavours. Like software engineering. If a software engineer completes a task which fulfills the requirements, the quicker the better. But there are tradeoffs to rushing through something. Maybe the user interface wasn't aligned correctly. Or perhaps they wrote bad code that’ll hurt in the long run. In either case, they didn't anticipate problems ahead of time.</p>

            <p>As a designer it won’t be uncommon for you to design many versions of a feature before settling on “the one”. A common workflow amongst UI designers is working on a design, duplicating it, tweaking it, duplicating, tweaking, duplicating, tweaking and so on.</p>

            <p><img src="https://philip.design/blog/when-do-you-stop-designing/when-do-you-stop-designing.png">
                <small>One of my (many) Figma files showing this common workflow. Iteration is vital in user interface design.</small>
            </p>

            <p>Obviously you need to stop at some point. That point might be defined by your higher ups (“Only spend half a day on this”) which is a shame. Try to fight back against that and argue (rightly so) that a bit of extra time always pays off in the long run. Remember that in the long run, you are the user interface designer. If people complain about it, you are the one it looks bad on. At that point, it probably isn’t the right time to say “my boss only let me spend 2 hours on it”. At that point no-one will care. Your customers and users are complaining and you are the person who needs to fix the problem.</p>

            <p>The question of "when to stop designing" is a hidden aspect of user interface design and it’s something that can make or break the early stages of your design career. If you don't spend enough time, you won't create lasting user interfaces that resonate with all stakeholders. If you spend too much time without creating long term value, your manager and teamates won't be happy. You should try to identify this as you are working, it's a bit meta but it's important.</p>

            <p>As a junior designer, you’ll be happy with something much quicker than a senior designer. And that’s OK, you still have to go through the lesson of shipping interfaces that aren’t great. You might not have recognised the need to explore this concept and stretch the amount of iterations.</p>

            <p>When do you decide to stop designing?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
        <div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    
                    <p>Secure, easy to use, cheap: Pick three</p><p>I recently installed Ubuntu Wacky Whatever, the latest version, and I’m very excited about it shipping with SSH 8.2, which means that I can finally use hardware USB keys for secure, easy to use authentication.
If securing your devices has been something you’ve wanted to easily do yourself, read on, because it’s finally happening.</p>
<h2>FIDO2</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting security-related developments recently has been the development of <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a> and FIDO2, which are basically euphemisms for “nice security stuff”.
In summary, WebAuthn and FIDO2 aim to make it really easy to use security devices with stuff by standardizing the way the two talk to each other, and using better terms than “stuff”.</p>
<p>This is great news for us, because now we can have dirt-cheap USB keys that can be used to secure all our authentication very easily, without requiring any special security knowledge.
All you need to know to be completely immune to phishing, password theft, and a whole host of other ways of losing Bitcoin is to just plug your USB key in, press the little button/type your PIN/enter your fingerprint, and you’re logged in.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with SSH?
Very little, but<!-- break --> I like rambling, it is known.</p>
<h3>Using FIDO2 with SSH</h3>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/shoulder-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/OLzlXZm_mOw" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/OLzlXZm_mOw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>Deanna had heard of phishing, and was extremely suspicious of the sound of rubber boots.</span></p></div><p>As you may have suspected from the two seemingly unrelated points above, and the dead giveaway title of this section, it would be tremendous if we could use FIDO2 keys to authenticate over SSH, and the OpenSSH developers made it happen.
OpenSSH now supports FIDO (U2F) and FIDO2 for authentication, with FIDO2 with resident keys having a nicer UX.</p>
<p>At a high level, the USB device (FIDO2 devices don’t have to be USB, but they usually will be) will generate a <span data-expounder="secret-key">secret key</span>.
<span data-expounded="secret-key">
The device can then use this secret key to prove that you have the device in your possession, without the key ever leaving the device.
That means that, by extension, you can use the device to prove you are who you say you are to any server who asks.
</span>
The key is either stored on the device (called “resident key”), which requires the device to support storage, or it isn’t, and <span data-expounder="storage">you need to store the data somewhere else</span>.</p>
<p><span data-expounded="storage">
The way this works, in my understanding (which I’m not certain about and please correct me if I’m wrong), is the following:
Each device comes from the factory with one key pair/seed built in, but it can accept an additional seed to derive more pairs from, by combining its current seed with the one given.
This allows devices to generate keys without having any storage space, but it does require you to be giving them the seed every time.
Devices with “resident key” capabilities can store the whole seed on their memory, and don’t need you to do anything else.
</span></p>
<p>The benefit of using a device like this including eliminating phishing, password theft, authentication replay, and lots of other attacks.
Since the device authenticates to a specfic realm (server address/URL/etc), an attacker can’t reuse one site’s authentication on another site, which makes phishing impossible.
Nobody can steal your password or private key either, since it’s on the device itself and extracting it is impossible.
The only plausible attack is physical theft with the device, which is mitigated by making the device ask for a PIN or fingerprint and wiping itself after a few wrong attempts.</p>
<p>Another benefit with having this built into SSH is that you don’t specifically need a Yubikey, or to mess with extra software like Yubikey agent, PIV mode or anything else.
You just plug any FIDO2-compatible key in, and you can use it with SSH.
I tried the following on both my Yubikey 5C, Yubikey FIDO2 and Yubikey NEO, they worked like a charm on all of them, but “resident key” mode only works on the 5C and later versions of the FIDO2 key.</p>
<h2>Actual usage</h2>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/padlocks-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/bBavss4ZQcA" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/bBavss4ZQcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>With twelve padlocks, the city of Indianapolis was sure it had put a stop to miscreants stealing its favorite fence.</span></p></div><p>After all the needless detail about how devices work, we’re ready to actually use one for SSH.
Setting that up is really simple, basically one or two commands (depending on the method) with no extra software to install, though you will need to be running OpenSSH 8.2 on both client and server.</p>
<p>I will split the instructions into two parts, one for if your key supports (and you want to use) the resident key mode, and one for if it doesn’t.
There’s no harm in using either method, so if you don’t know if your device supports resident key mode, just try the first method and continue to the second one if it fails.</p>
<h3>Resident key mode</h3>
<p>Use the following command to generate a key and store it on the device:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>SSH will ask you to enter your PIN and touch your device, and then save the key pair where you told it.
If that command complains about ed25519 not being available, try this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -O resident -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>OpenSSH will save two files, one called <code>id_mykey_sk</code>, and one called <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code>.
You only really need the latter, it’s your public key, and you can now add it to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file of any server that runs OpenSSH 8.2 and above.</p>
<p>To add your private key to the SSH agent, you can either copy <code>id_mykey_sk</code> to your <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory, or (if you’re at a new computer and don’t have the key with you), run</p>

<p>with your device plugged in.
This will add the key to the SSH agent, and you will be able to connect to servers immediately.</p>
<h3>Non-resident key mode</h3>
<p>The non-resident key mode is the same as the previous mode, except you can’t load your key with <code>ssh-add -K</code> directly from the device.
As before, run:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>SSH will ask you to enter your PIN and touch your device, and then save the key pair where you told it.
If that command complains about ed25519 not being available, try this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>OpenSSH will save two files, one called <code>id_mykey_sk</code>, and one called <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code>.
You need both of these files, store <code>id_mykey_sk</code> in your <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory (where it got generated) and add the <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code> file to any server you want to log in to.</p>
<p>That’s it, when you try to log in, OpenSSH will ask you for your PIN and to touch the device.</p>
<h2>Security considerations</h2>
<p>You can pass the <code>no-touch-required</code> option to <code>ssh-keygen</code> to tell it that you don’t want it to require touching the device every time, but I haven’t had great results with enabling that.
If you try it, let me know how well it works in the comments, but it’s probably better for security if you leave it disabled.</p>
<p>Storing your key on the device means that nobody will be able to steal it (hopefully your device has a PIN or other authentication method set), but untrusted computers might still be able to send commands over the SSH session after you connect.
Don’t SSH from computers you don’t trust, and be extra careful when using SSH forwarding (the <code>-A</code> option), as the server can then ask your computer to authenticate to other servers on your behalf.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I’m very excited about FIDO2 in general, and for SSH authentication specifically, because we finally have a way to secure authentication that my parents can easily use, with a much smaller attack surface.
I’m particularly interested in seeing how WebAuthn takes off for authenticating on the web without usernames and passwords (see my <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/django-webauthin">django-webauthin</a> library for a demo), and hope it becomes widespread.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback, please <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=Stavros">Tweet</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.host/@stavros">toot</a> at me, or email me directly.
Also, check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StavrosKorokithakis/">YouTube channel</a> (because who <em>doesn’t</em> have a YouTube channel these days?), where I frequently livestream my late-night maker sessions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="banner"> <div> <div> <div>  <h4>29 Jun 2020</h4> <p> <i></i> Reading time ~14 minutes </p><!-- /.entry-reading-time --> </div> <p>In 2005, the .NET Framework had its 1.1 SP1 release and was relatively stable. Visual Studio .NET 2003 was a solid release. C# was being widely adopted throughout the industry. Selecting it for a project cost me my job, and nearly sunk my career as a software developer.</p> <!--more-->  <p>This was almost two decades ago, so I feel comfortable discussing it now. I was working as a software developer at Hewlett-Packard in Nashua, New Hampshire, USA. HP had recently merged with Compaq, and absorbed the office buildings and personnel that were once Compaq, and Digital Equipment Corp. before that. Our project was called ActiveAnswers, a Content Management System (CMS) that existed before the term was coined.</p> <p>When I joined Compaq in 2000, ActiveAnswers was a set of HTML templates and text files that were converted into a massive static web site every night. During the day, content editors would make changes by editing the text files. The site used dozens of Perl scripts to combine the content from the text files with the HTML templates.</p> <p>Over the next couple of years, my team of five people had completely rewritten the application into a mostly WYSIWYG UI that permitted our content editors to make changes directly in a web browser, seeing the results almost immediately. All of the content was stored in a SQL Server database. The front end code was written in VB 6, and was starting to feel a little overweight.</p> <p>We had adopted many of the practices of the newly-released eXtreme Programming methodology. The project had automated unit tests and daily (if not continuous) builds. We even built a pair-programming lab. I wish I still had pictures, because doing that in 1999 was a sight to behold. We had taken over a former QA lab. It was about 16 x 24 feet, with windows on the long walls, and it had a locking door. We set up stations around the perimeter of the room, each consisting of a laptop docking station, a 21” monitor, keyboard, mouse, and two chairs. Each station had plenty of room for two without crowding the adjacent station. In the center of the room was a conference table with room for all of us.</p>  <p>Not long after, Hewlett-Packard decided that they needed to be bigger than Dell. So instead of competing with Dell head-to-head, they decided to get bigger the new-fashioned way: they bought another company. The new company was indeed larger than Dell – for about six months.</p> <p>As soon as the deal closed, the new HP (NYSE: HPQ) was the #1 computer maker in the world. Within six months, however, Dell had regained its #1 position and dropped HP to a solid #2. HP was suddenly in trouble, being dragged down by a bloated Compaq organization. That was their story, at least.</p> <p>It was time to cut away some of the bloat. HP announced a 10% “reduction in workforce.” I suppose they call it that because it sounds better than a “lay off.” It also sounds better than “you’re fired!”</p> <p>Amazingly, most of the people with whom I worked did not seem to care. In fact, many were excited by the prospect of getting a great “layoff package.” In case you are not familiar with these, a layoff package is money given to the suddenly out-of-a-job employee. In my case, only having been an employee for two years, I was only eligible for six weeks of pay.</p>  <p>After the merger, the team and project experienced some significant growing pains. Executives at HP had seen ActiveAnswers and wanted to expand its reach. They wanted to ensure the team could handle the additional workload.</p> <p>All of the contractors on the team were made a similar offer: accept a full-time job with HP at a reduced pay rate, or be replaced. A few of us chose to remain. One colleague in particular, who was instrumental in designing and building the application’s UI, chose to leave. He was unceremoniously replaced with two junior contractors who combined were far less effective than he had been. Although we had more work to do, morale was low for those who remained.</p>  <p>Over the next few years, our team of five grew to 20. Four times the size does not equate to four times the productivity. In many ways, we seemed to be much less effective. We struggled to keep up with the ever-expanding business requirements. Feature after feature was requested. New users and new content were added, putting a strain on an architecture that had been built for fewer than a dozen users. Training demands increased. The venerable VB6 was showing its age. It was time for something new.</p> <p>The company provided all of its developers with an MSDN Subscription, and a few us were excited by the release of Visual Studio 2003. Windows XP was still fresh, and the two seemed to work flawlessly together. We decided to start experimenting with .NET and C# to see whether we could provide the users with the features and the performance they needed.</p>  <p>At first, the idea of switching to a newer technology was met with mild curiosity. The leadership authorized a proof of concept. “Go do something and then show the rest of the team.”</p> <p>We decided to hire a contractor with proven experience in .NET, though the fact that it was only a couple of years old made this difficult. We found a local consultant who had been using it since its introduction.</p> <p>One of the tasks we assigned to him was to review our new .NET code and let us know where and how it could be improved.</p> <h2 id="trycatch-as-flow-control">Try/Catch as Flow Control</h2> <p>One of the first things he uncovered was large blocks of nested try/catch statements used to implement complex flow control. One instance he found was a single function with six or seven nested try/catch blocks. When asked about it, the developer who had implemented the function said he had heard that if/then was inefficient, so he used try/catch instead. No amount of persuasion could convince him that he had it backwards.</p> <h2 id="for-every-rule-there-is-an-exception">For Every Rule There is an Exception</h2> <p>Speaking of try/catch, every time an exception was caught, it was swallowed, and a new exception was thrown in its place. The pattern in .NET is to catch only those exceptions you can handle. The rest should bubble up naturally to higher levels of your application. It is acceptable to catch and rethrow, but there are only a few specific ways to do that. Throwing a brand new exception is not usually one of them. Trying to explain that to the other developers resulted in repeated explanations that it was the consultant who did not understand. My favorite line from those meetings was, “Let me say it again so you’ll understand.”</p> <h2 id="isup">IsUp</h2> <p>One of the improvements that had been made was the implementation of a set of web services. Our consultant discovered that every web service call was preceded by a separate call to an endpoint called “IsUp” to ensure the web server was listening, before making the actual call.</p> <p>In 2005, bandwidth was not quite what it is in 2020, and each call was relatively expensive. Not only was this wasteful, it also did not accomplish its goal. On more than one occasion, IsUp would return true, and the next call would fail anyway due to the service being down.</p> <p>Upon learning about this revelation, our management decided it would probably not hurt anything to leave it in place.</p> <h2 id="everyone-into-the-pool">Everyone Into the Pool</h2> <p>One of the benefits .NET offered was robust database connection pooling. The pattern Microsoft suggested was to create an ADO.NET connection object every time you needed one, and release it immediately when you have finished using it. The system would maintain a pool of connections behind the scenes for you.</p> <p>Rather than using ADO.NET, however, one of our contractors decided that it would make more sense to roll his own connection pooling system. When our new consultant pointed this out, he was accused of not understanding the subtle advantages our own pooling system had over Microsoft’s.</p>  <p>After a few weeks of this, our new consultant was beyond frustrated. We sat down and had a heart-to-heart talk. He felt he was adding no value to the project or the team. His suggestions were ignored or belittled. In fact, my manager essentially told him that his services were no longer required, and that his contract would not be renewed. I asked him whether he would stick around until it ended. His reply was amusing. He said that although he could stay and continue to “turn the money crank,” he felt that doing so would compromise his professional integrity. Six weeks after he started, our consultant left.</p>  <p>Right about the time our .NET consultant left, the word came down from management that our .NET experiment was a failure, and that we were to go back to VB 6 for all new code.</p> <p>A few short weeks later, we were having a particularly difficult problem with one of our application components. VB simply did not have the language facilities to deal with this particular issue without massive brute-force coding. C#, on the other hand, had a very straightforward way to solve the problem.</p> <p>I finally made the decision to implement that particular component in C#. My plan was to show management that .NET was still a viable option for our project, and this small enhancement would be the proof. The solution was everything I had hoped it would be: short, elegant, and easy to understand.</p> <p>At this point in the story, I wish I still had the source code that I could share. However, <a href="https://walkingriver.com/perjury">I learned the hard way not to keep source code when leaving a company</a>.</p>  <p>We had a policy on our team that each new feature would be revealed on a team-wide NetMeeting conference, attended by anyone interested. The primary developer on the feature would explain it, show the passing unit tests, demonstrate the feature, and then answer questions from the rest of the team. We had these meetings a few times per week, as I recall.</p> <p>This call was my time to shine, or so I imagined. I went through all of the normal steps, and all was going well. There were four critical things about this particular call that will soon become apparent:</p> <ol> <li>Most of the team was on the call, about 25 in total.</li> <li>My manager was in attendance.</li> <li>HP’s enterprise …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><br><span>Date: Tue, Jun 30, 2020</span><br><span>Reading Time: 10 minutes</span></p><p>Here are some of my opinions about Mobile Device Management (MDM) related changes announced last week. SimpleMDM did a great job of <a href="https://simplemdm.com/mdm-ios-14-macos-11-big-sur/">summarizing</a> the announcements, so I won’t repeat the same list here. Instead, I’ll focus on a few things which are interesting to me. Before I get into that, I have to mention this isn’t a well-balanced editorial. It’s in my nature to skip over accomplishments and focus on things that still need attention. Which is what you’ll read below. But it’s important to also state that I enjoyed WWDC20 and I’m excited about many of the technology changes announced. I’ve also had the chance to meet and work with many Apple employees over the years. My grumpy opinions on software updates and technical debt are not a reflection of how I feel about any individual or even Apple as a whole.</p><p>Okay, let’s dive in.</p><h2 id="account-configuration-can-choose-the-mdm-managed-user">Account Configuration can choose the MDM managed user</h2><p>Apple claims MDM can <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/accountconfigurationcommand/command">create user accounts</a>, but it comes with all kinds of limitations. First, the account can <em>only</em> be created during the setup assistant stage, while the device is in AwaitingConfiguration state. This leaves users unable to implement a useful workflow since almost everyone has a mixed fleet of “company-owned” and legacy devices. You need a fully implemented fallback workflow in case the automated one fails. There’s a number of failure modes that need to be addressed:</p><ul><li>The device needs to be in <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/it/">Apple Business Manager</a> (ABM), an inventory system that tracks company-owned devices. ABM is still not available globally, and there is no 30 day grace period where you can add new purchases in yourself (available for iPhones ).</li><li>There’s no enforced activation check on the Mac like there is for phones. Not that I’m advocating for one, but losing controls because a Setup Assistant step fails open is a pain.</li><li>Since you can only rely on this in Setup Assistant, changes made in new releases are not possible to adopt. Even if AccountConfiguration was perfect in macOS 11 and we used it for all <em>new</em> devices, it would still take years before all our devices had consistent user creation.</li></ul><p>Since the recommended way has these failure modes, most organizations will keep using their own user creation flow. With the caveat that one day Apple will break it.</p><p>Despite the shortcomings, AccountConfiguration is tempting. Admin accounts configured with this command allow for MDM managed <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/setautoadminpasswordcommand/command">password changes</a>. The MDM could integrate with existing account services to set/change the Mac password by receiving a PBKDF2 derived hash. Neat! Especially for 1:1 environments without traditional directory service binding.</p><p>While I was testing the AccountConfiguration command last year I ended up filing feedback about another artificial limitation of the process. Apple was making a distinction between the “admin” account, and a “primary user”. The primary user would be created not by the MDM, but by the end-user typing their username/password into setup assistant, while the MDM was creating a hidden local administrator account for an IT user. There was no way for these two accounts to be the same, even though that’s what I wanted. A limitation of not being the <em>primary</em> account meant that while the MDM could rotate this admin account password, it could not send profiles or other user channel actions. Well, not any longer!</p><p>With the release of macOS 11, there’s a way for the MDM to <em>choose</em> the account that becomes managed. I <a href="https://twitter.com/wikiwalk/status/1275622118324162561">tested</a> this workflow and made some <a href="https://github.com/micromdm/micromdm/pull/679">code changes</a>. It works OK now.</p><p>Personally, I’m bewildered by much of how this works and why it exists in the first place. Last year Apple announced support for “Managed Apple IDs”, which can be federated with major identity providers. This year they also announced support for SCIM, a complementary protocol that federates changes to user accounts across different systems. But I can’t use my SSO account to log into my company-owned MacBook.</p><h2 id="local-profile-installation-is-gone">Local profile installation is gone</h2><p>It’s not possible to install configuration profiles using the <code>profiles</code> command any longer. Profiles now work like iOS; the only two options are MDM or manual installation through System Preferences.</p><p>Overall, this is a welcome security change. Malware had the potential to exploit this stuff easily, and this is another class of exploits that Apple eliminated. Apple has been so good at making a “secure by default” platform, that I hesitate to buy hardware from other vendors.</p><p>While the profiles change is welcome, it’s still a major disruption for many in IT. Similar to DevOps on the server-side, Mac administrators have relied on configuration management tools (<a href="https://docs.chef.io/resources/osx_profile/">Chef</a>, <a href="https://github.com/macadmins/puppet-mac_profiles_handler">Puppet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mosen/salt-osx/blob/master/mac-examples/profile.sls">Salt</a>) to generate and install the profiles with code. It’s convenient, reliable, and does something which is otherwise hard: being able to dynamically enforce values depending on local system variables. For example, instead of enforcing an immediate screen lock setting, letting the end user choose a value that is acceptable within the range of compliance. Or detecting network changes and only managing something depending on network state. The exact kind of things configuration management is good at.
In addition to the flexibility, organizations that rely on configuration management also tend to have good change management and testing processes. The policies are typically versioned in a system like Git, with linting, code review, and all the bits that come with treating infrastructure as code.</p><p>I started working on MicroMDM for two reasons. One was the general curiosity of how things like “zero-touch” provisioning worked. The other was a disappointment with commercial options. I wasn’t willing to give up my management workflows, which were driven by Puppet, for the privilege of logging into a web interface and clicking a checkbox or filling out a web form. Commercial vendors offered little as APIs that could support code review, auditing and idempotent management. And often the web forms they did offer missed settings organizations need. I’m sad to say that very little has changed on the commercial front. In open-source, we have examples like <a href="https://github.com/mdmdirector/mdmdirector">mdmdirector</a>👏 💯, but you can’t pay someone money to give you these features.</p><h2 id="custom-app-distribution-in-apple-business-manager">Custom app distribution in Apple Business Manager</h2><p>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10667/">announced that there’s a new way</a> we can distribute Apps this year. Enterprises can upload custom apps to Apple Business Manager, and these can be installed with MDM. These apps are still, of course, subject to app review by Apple. This new distribution channel is also open for vendors to sell apps to other enterprises.
My understanding of this announcement (which might not be what Apple intended?) is that B2B products, like endpoint security vendors, can now show up here. With a 30% cut for Apple?</p><p>It’s still too early to tell, as this is just an announcement. I’m excited to try and get an internal app added to this distribution channel. Will we see something like <a href="https://github.com/macadmins/nudge">Nudge</a> in the App Store one day?</p><p>At the same time, having yet another “official” way of distributing apps, makes it more likely that one day there will not be a distribution channel where Apple is not in the middle.</p><h2 id="managed-software-updates">Managed Software Updates</h2><p>I’ve <a href="https://micromdm.io/blog/os_update/">written</a> about software updates with MDM in the past. It’s been a disaster so far. Apple made one change to MDM this year, which allows the MDM to “force” an update. And while that’s a necessary <em>capability</em>, it’s still not something that can be realistically implemented. There is no UX on the user side of the equation. The Mac would restart because the MDM decided, without giving you a chance to quit, without care that a VP is giving a presentation to the board or a doctor is in the middle of a telemedicine call. Apple expects (I guess? There is never official guidance for how these things should be done) that the MDM product will devise an appropriate experience for the user. Having a third party client coordinate the exact moment an MDM server should send the <em>InstallForceRestart</em> command is subject to potential race conditions and coordination problems. And of course, nobody has an entitlement to ignore a user’s DND settings, while they’re about to reboot a device.</p><p>What the community has always asked for is for Apple to provide a declarative interface, where the MDM sets</p><ul><li>a minimum OS version/build.</li><li>a deadline when the version is enforced.</li></ul><p>In a hypothetical scenario where Apple offered declarative controls to enforce an update, the built-in client would be responsible to deliver the appropriate experience for the end-user. Notifying them well ahead of time about the pending deadline, and potentially offers a safety window when the user can cancel. Like Munki <a href="https://github.com/munki/munki/wiki/Pkginfo-Files#force-install-after-date">has done</a> for a decade and some vendors have implemented with their agents. For reasons I can only speculate about, Apple has refused to build OS update enforcement correctly.</p><p>The one big change in this area is that the way OS updates are done on the Mac is now completely new. Apple replaced the Mac implementation of OS update, with the iOS one. So, maybe I’m wrong, and OS updates are finally reasonably OK to do with MDM on macOS 11? There are no items in the catalogs yet that I can test with. I’ll continue testing and filing feedback in this area.</p><h2 id="apple-buys-fleetsmith">Apple buys Fleetsmith</h2><p>The most exciting and surprising bit of WWDC didn’t even happen at the conference. <a href="https://blog.fleetsmith.com/fleetsmith-acquired-by-apple/">Fleetsmith is now part of Apple</a>. I’ve had a chance to meet the Fleetsmith engineering team through various industry events, and they’ve always impressed me, not to mention how polished their product is. So I’m very happy for that team, and also enthusiastic about what this means for Mac in the enterprise. Mostly. Apple legal did <a href="https://twitter.com/wikiwalk/status/1276139303219970053">break existing users</a>.</p><p>Allow me to speculate a bit about what this change means:</p><p><em>The Good</em></p><p>As I already mentioned, Fleetsmith has the right engineering talent. They also have the industry experience to understand what companies need and <a href="https://blog.fleetsmith.com/macos-enterprise-security-roadmap/">push for the same kinds of changes I would</a>. So, at least my reaction was thinking I now have an ally on the inside and would see welcome changes in the …</p></div></div></div>

      <p><em>This is Part 4 in a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/">series on tacit knowledge</a>. Read <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/three-kinds-of-tacit-knowledge/">Part 3</a> here.</em></p><p>We can’t really talk about tacit knowledge today without talking about YouTube.</p><p>A couple months ago, Samo Burja wrote an essay on Medium titled <a href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/the-youtube-revolution-in-knowledge-transfer-cb701f82096a">The Youtube Revolution in Knowledge Transfer</a>, a piece that I loved and linked to in <a href="https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=843adfbaa3230c81aa0738b53&amp;id=0ced4f1a2c">issue 50</a> of the Commonplace newsletter. Burja observed the following things:</p><ul><li>First, YouTube is now a <em>thing</em>.</li><li>Second, quality digital cameras have become cheap enough for mass use. This in turn means that everyone can start producing YouTube-worthy content, and have those videos be discoverable, because — hey! — YouTube is now a thing.</li><li>Three, this <em>also</em> means that people with expertise is <em>thing X</em> can now film themselves doing <em>thing X</em>, and clued-in practitioners can watch these experts do <em>thing X</em> and become <em>really good themselves.</em></li><li>Burja then posits that we’ll see an explosion of tacit skill transfer over the next decade, correlated with the rise of YouTube use, because certain kinds of human expertise may only really be taught through emulation, not through instruction alone.</li></ul><p>Burja’s whole essay is great, and I urge you to read it in <a href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/the-youtube-revolution-in-knowledge-transfer-cb701f82096a">full</a>.</p><p>But there’s a twist here. I linked to Burja’s piece in Issue #50 of my newsletter, which went out on the 24th of September 2019. Burja’s piece was published on the 18th of September. And I’m writing this on the 29th of June the next year. So it’s basically taken me more than nine months before I realised that Burja’s observations may be <em>generalisable</em> — that is, once you realise that YouTube is a great place to learn tacit things, this fact applies to skills <em>far beyond</em> the set of skills Burja talks about in his essay.</p><p>In this piece, we’re going to walk through a number of ways you may use YouTube for tacit knowledge acquisition, on a domain-by-domain basis. I’m afraid the anecdotes here are necessarily domain-specific, but the purpose of this piece is to give you certain patterns that you may adapt to whatever skillset you want to acquire in whatever domain you’re interested in.</p><h2 id="youtube-use-in-judo">YouTube use in Judo</h2><p>Let’s start with Judo.</p><p>I'm biased here because I played Judo competitively as a teenager. But Judo is interesting for our purposes because it isn’t a particularly popular sport. In Malaysia, where I’m from, the number of people who play Judo can probably fit into a small football stadium. And the active players — the ones who do Judo regularly — can probably fit into half that. Contrast this population with a sport like badminton, say, or football, or tennis.</p><p>What this means is that it is difficult to get good as a judoka in most countries around the world. This fact isn’t limited to Malaysia; in the US, for instance, pretty much every Olympic Judo champion comes from a tiny family-run club called Pedro’s Judo Centre in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Judo isn’t particularly popular outside the club, either. If you find yourself anywhere else in the country: tough luck.</p><p>During the worst of the COVID-19 lockdowns earlier this year, Malaysian Judo coach Oon Yeoh began interviewing international Judo players from all over the world, in a series he named <em>Judo In The Time of COVID-19</em>. He <a href="https://kljudo.com/judo-concepts-lesson-22-how-to-analyze-a-video-clip/">wrote</a>, of that experience:</p><blockquote>One thing I noticed after interviewing many judo players is that those from very strong judo nations tend not to watch so many judo videos whereas those who come from countries where judo is not so strong, tend to watch a lot of judo videos.<p>The reason is obvious. If you're from a strong judo nation, there's a lot of institutional support and good coaching, as well as sufficient training partners, training opportunities and competitions. All these combined give you everything you need to develop your skills in judo. <strong>But if you live in a place where there's very little judo, you're pretty much left to your own devices. In such circumstances, video is the best resource for you to learn things. </strong><em>(emphasis mine)</em></p></blockquote><p>Oon first learnt Judo in the US, and was exposed to video-based training from the beginning of his career. (To my knowledge, he remains — to this day — the only Malaysian to have fought in the World Championships). When he says ‘video is the best resource for you to learn things’, we have to be very clear what he means by this.</p><p>If you go to YouTube right now and enter a Judo technique, for instance, ‘uchimata’ — you’ll get a results page like so:</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-29-at-8.17.46-PM-1.png"></figure><p>The top result is an instructional by US Judo coach Shintaro Higashi:</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnMoNfZ2WiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Higashi’s video on uchimata is particularly good, and instructionals are probably what you’re thinking of when you hear ‘YouTube’ and ‘learning’. But instructionals <em>aren’t</em> the only thing that Oon is talking about.</p><p>What Oon is more interested in is <em>analysis of competition footage</em>. I asked him to explain how he used video for this purpose, and he <a href="https://kljudo.com/judo-concepts-lesson-22-how-to-analyze-a-video-clip/">did</a>:</p><blockquote>Let's say you want to learn how a particular player does a particular technique. Here are some best practices:<p>a) Don't just watch just one or two examples of that player doing that technique. Watch multiple examples and try to identify trends or things that that player does in setting up the throw. Take for example, Takato's unique style of ouchi-gari. If you watch enough of them, you'll notice he only does this technique under very specific circumstances (against left-handers who are trying to push his head down). If you notice that, try to understand the reason why.</p><p>b) Pay particular attention to grips. How does he grip whenever he wants to do this technique. You will notice a familiar pattern to the gripping. Again, try to understand why.</p><p>c) There will be times when the technique fails. Watch those as well and try to understand what went wrong. What was different about this attempt that caused it to fail? Doing this will allow you to isolate the key success factors.</p><p>d) Try to look out for variations. Sometimes those differences are very subtle but they are significant. Understanding the variations (when they are used and why the variation are necessary) will give you a better grasp of the technique.</p><p>e) It is usually helpful to watch the technique in slow motion. If there is no slow motion replay of the clip available, you may have to download the clip and slow-mo it yourself using a simple video editing program. When I was a student there was no digital videos yet, only VHS cassettes, and I had to use two VCR machines to make slow motion loops of Koga's throws just so I could study them properly!</p></blockquote><p>In a separate interview with US Olympic silver medallist Travis Stevens, Oon asks about video, and Stevens <a href="http://kljudotraining.blogspot.com/2020/04/judo-in-time-of-covid-19-travis-stevens.html">answers</a>:</p><blockquote>There is a lot the cadets can do at home to prepare them for future success. Like <strong>learning how to break down a fight when watching videos, taking notes on training sessions</strong> <em>(emphasis mine)</em>, journaling, etc. Winning at judo isn’t just about hard work. There’s a lot more that goes into it than that, like analysis, mental training and so on.</blockquote><p>Why study competition footage, and not just instructionals? The answer falls out of everything we’ve explored in our previous posts on tacit knowledge. Expertise is difficult to explicate, and embodied knowledge can only loosely be captured through language. There usually isn't much of an overlap between the greatest practitioners and the greatest teachers in any given domain.</p><p>Plus: ask any serious Judo player, and they will tell you that there is <em>also</em> a gap between what is taught in the dojo, and what is used in competition. The charitable explanation here is that the best players can’t explain what they’re doing, because their somatic responses are tied to cues in implicit memory, which makes it impossible for them to notice. The slightly less charitable explanation is that there is a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/">metagame</a> that’s going on at the highest levels of Judo, and the shift in the current meta is kept opaque and available only to those who know how to watch out for it. The completely uncharitable explanation is that Judo is a sport with bad pedagogy, and most people don’t know how to teach it.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/bdf1b3347d045db83a9c988fb87c8629.jpg"><figcaption>Notice how world champion Maruyama Joshiro is using his leg to lift his opponent's.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-30-at-5.35.29-PM.png"><figcaption>And compare that to Higashi's instructional, which uses the hip to lift.</figcaption></figure><p>(I’m perhaps being a little extreme in that last assessment; but — well, let’s talk about uchimata, shall we? There’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZJcx2ppyB4">particularly good video</a> by YouTube user Judo Mat Lab that points out that the throw taught by Higashi, in its form above, is rarely seen in competition. Many top level athletes do something far simpler (they lift the opponent's leg and tilt, not lift their opponent with their hip) — in fact, the tilting form is what is most commonly seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd10gC4P310">MMA</a> and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-HW-6isyI">BJJ</a> as well. The funny thing is that when these judokas are asked to demonstrate uchimata, they execute <em>the classical, lifting version first.</em> This is an example of a piece of tacit knowledge that was successfully explicated into a wonderful, comprehensive explanation — but it took a talented YouTuber to do it, and in 2015, 133 years after Judo was first created.)</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZJcx2ppyB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>So the solution here is to do what Oon figured out all those years ago: <em>don’t</em> wait for someone to come along and explain what’s going on. Don’t rely on instructionals alone. <em>Look at actual experts doing the actual thing.</em> In the context of Judo, this means developing the meta-skill of watching competition video yourself, in order to break a competitor’s technique down into its constituent parts. You try to figure out why it’s so effective; later, in the dojo, you attempt to replicate it by copying.</p><p>In fact, as we’ll soon see: this principle is generalisable. When you want to learn a skill on YouTube, you should spend a little bit of time watching instructionals, but then spend the rest of it <em>watching experts doing the actual thing</em>. The former is by definition explicit; the latter allows you to capture what is tacit.</p><h2 id="programming">Programming</h2><p>Let’s move on to programming, which is probably more relevant to the topic of careers.</p><p>When I started programming in university in 2009, there was already a fair amount of programming content on the web. This period coincided with the rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MO…</a></p></section></div>

We would argue that it is feasible to do that on a productive system as well. A productive system with 50 000 users is expected to generate roughly 50 to 100 GB of logs per month. Log storage for a whole year would yield roughly 1TB of log data. Consider that also archiving can bring down the required disk space by a factor of  100.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Reading time: 4 minutes</p><p>A Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) subscription business is one where customers pay recurrent fees (pay-per-use or pay-per-performance) to access a product they can’t buy upfront. This type of subscription model continues growing in popularity because of its connection with the Circular Economy and the potential for businesses to receive recurring revenue from customers.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Promoting your PaaS business comes with some work for your company to convince and communicate to customers why to get your product as a subscription. The same happens if you have an established customer base, you need to make sure that your team helps your business achieve sustainable growth over time, otherwise referred to as customer success.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your Product-as-a-Service is not performing well, here are 7 marketing tips to grow it:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Set the right goals&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Improve your customer experience</strong></li><li><strong>Explain the benefits, not the features</strong></li><li><strong>Don't underestimate your marketing efforts</strong></li><li><strong>Ensure customers don't leave</strong></li><li><strong>Be transparent about what you offer</strong></li><li><strong>Free trials&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p><strong>1. Set the right goals&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you are heading towards promoting your Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) business better, you need to know what your goals are and what you are trying to achieve with your marketing efforts. Besides defining your goal(s), you also need to set some KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to evaluate success.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><em>Ask yourself or your team:</em></strong><br></p><ul role="list"><li>What is the goal we are trying to achieve? Do we want to generate more awareness? Or do we want more customer engagement? Or having less churn? Whatever your goal is, it needs to be defined from the beginning so you (and your team) can define better how to accomplish this.&nbsp;</li><li>When is the pilot successful and how do we measure what success is?</li><li>What resources do you really need to accomplish your goal?</li><li>How do you measure what success is?</li><li>How many customers do we need to have a sustainable business?</li><li>Which channels do we need to use to better engage with customers?&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Keeping your goal(s) in mind will be a good starting point to determine how to better market and scale your PaaS proposition.<br></p><p><strong>2. Improve your customer experience</strong></p><p><strong><em>Make every interaction with your customer count.</em></strong><br></p><p>Customer experience (CX) is about all the interactions that your customer has with your Product-as-a-Service business. CX has increased its importance in the past years because companies are looking for ways to improve their customer relationships. Now more than ever, customer experience will be a key differentiator point for many PaaS companies.<br></p><p>When improving your Customer Experience keep in mind to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Create your customer journey map and buyer personas for your products.</li><li>Connect with customers and improve your PaaS service.</li><li>Offer remarkable packaging that makes people experience your product at a different level.</li><li>Ask your customers for feedback.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Before growing your customer base, think of how you can make a better experience on your product and website, for the people that you already have. Understand their needs, customer journeys, what are they looking for in your product to pay it on a recurring basis, optimize processes, and recognize possible improvements that would benefit your customers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Explain the benefits, not the features</strong></p><p>Why would customers buy your product? What benefits are attached by paying a recurring payment instead of paying the full price?&nbsp;<br></p><p>One of the common mistakes when talking to customers is mentioning all the product features (when they don't understand half of them). Next time when talking to a customer, communicate your value, and explain the benefits of your Product-as-a-Service offering instead of showing features that they might not need to know. Keep your communication simple and concise without overwhelming customers with too much information.</p><p><a href="http://www.reflower.nl/">Reflower</a> is a great example of this. This Dutch startup clearly shows the benefits of buying their product with a subscription proposition, explaining clearly why to buy from them. Most exotic flowers are grown and harvested under really bad conditions. With Reflower, customers can access every month to fake flowers that are more sustainable with less CO2 emissions and that are insensitive to environmental conditions. Fake flowers last for at least 20 years instead of 2 weeks, contributing to a more sustainable planet.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Tip:</strong></p><p>Create a list of the benefits (not features) that your customer will receive by affiliating to your PaaS proposition. If you clarify your messaging by showing your benefits and value, customers will better understand what you have to offer them.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>4. Don't underestimate your marketing efforts</strong></p><p>After you have settled on some goals, and understand your customers better, you can start defining a marketing strategy. In the beginning, it might be challenging, or you might not see the results upfront, but that's why it is crucial to be consistent with your marketing efforts to either grow or maintain your customer base.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Keep your messaging consistent through your social media, website, and other channels you have. Beside this, it is crucial to track the data you have. Set some Google Analytics for your website, get a better idea of who is visiting your website so you can better re-target your ads, or re-focus your marketing efforts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Ensure customers don't leave (focus on retention)</strong></p><p><em>A reliable, satisfied customer base is essential for you to promote your business.&nbsp;</em><br></p><p>One of the challenges of PaaS is to make customers stick with you, to become loyal, on the long-haul so they keep buying from you. Losing customers is really bad, you'll most probably never recover them, and they will no longer refer you to anyone else.<br></p><p>Strong customer relationships are crucial for a good subscription model; without this, there's no space for sustainable growth. Your subscribers will become advocates of your PaaS business and will come back for more or to refer you with someone else. They will become a living promotion for your brand.<br></p><p>Monitor your customer usage and try to reduce any churn you might have. Collecting data is becoming so much easier right now, so make better usage of this data to strengthen your customer relationship with the users that you already have.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Be transparent about what you offer</strong></p><p>Make it very clear from the beginning. People have the misconception that if they subscribe to recurring payments, that they won't be able to change it or cancel their subscription.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Having your terms clear and understandable for your customers. Showing the terms of your membership up front is good for people to have the pace and flexibility to understand how your PaaS works. Firmhouse helps you with any operational challenges you might have and make the process smoother for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>7. Free trials</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Customers love free trials, but from a business perspective, this isn't a sustainable way to grow in the long term. What you can do is determine if you can offer one extra month of your product for free if they pay the annuity, or if they pay monthly, they can get a discount.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>It's harder to let go of something we have already experienced rather than haven't experienced it at all.&nbsp;</em>‍</p><p>Another good option is to offer just two weeks for free (first months for free or less price and after that time come back to basics. Remember that this should be aligned with your goals and marketing strategy. Educate your customers on how to use your product so they can get the most out of it.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When promoting your PaaS business it is important to start by defining your goal(s), then making sure to use the data you have to improve your customer experience. Don’t underestimate your marketing efforts and communicate clearly your product benefits while keeping a consistent and transparent messaging about your PaaS model from the beginning. Offer something extra (if you can) that brings value to your customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Product-as-a-Service subscription models are increasing in popularity. If you are offering PaaS, then you can follow some of the tips outlined above to better market your PaaS Business.&nbsp;</p><p>In Firmhouse, we help you to scale your Product-as-a-Service business.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>What is your story? How did you start writing your blog? Was it something that you decided to try since the start of covid? Over the months I’ve started to post some of the learning and technology I’ve came across at work. Over the months of writing, I found myself gaining so much more than what I started out to do. Everything starts with a single step. Before we take our first step, we often have a vision of how that finishing line may look like. We may also have some perspective of how the journey itself may look like. What do you know? As you take a step forward, and then another. You decide to take a pause and look back. You find your perspective of the world has changed just so much!</p>

<p>Today, I will be talking about two key parts of my journey:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>How did this whole venture start?</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone starts their journey with a goal in mind. Simple and straight forward objectives to achieve! (:</p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>What have i’ve I learnt thus far?</li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond the initial objectives, I found myself learning just so much as I share my learnings online. Not only does it help me to understand different topics better, it actually help me to change my perspective towards problems and better position me for my growth as a software engineer.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#1. How did this whole venture start?</h2>

<p>It started with just 3 simply purposes:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Being more detail oriented</li>
</ol>

<p>I wanted to delve deeper into each of the topics and technology i am learning at work. So much to cover, but never really understanding each of it. The last thing you want to do is to get the job done without properly learning the best practices and finding that growth in you.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a pause, and look a little closer</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>Hone my technical skills</li>
</ol>

<p>This platform was intended for me to explore the different web development tools and understand the nuts and bolts behind the delivery of a good website. You are worth the value you give. And if you want to create value for people, you got to put in the work to hone that technical skill and deliver that tip top quality work</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no free meals in the world, if you want to create value, you got to earn the craft</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Improve on my writing</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve always been a thrash writer. I even started out writing my posts in point forms as I was never able to articulate my thoughts coherently. But I realized the ability to articulate your point in a succinct and concise form is an art that needs to be developed. Over the months and numerous articles, I’ve started to learn how to put my thoughts into words and organize my thoughts for a meaningful sharing.</p>

<p>Here’s a reference to my first blog post to understand the drastic difference haha! <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-01-26-first-post-of-2020/">Joshua’s first post back in January 2020</a></p>

<p>What i’ve gotten from this pet project didn’t just stop here. Rather, I have taken away so much more than what i intended to learn from the start. As i reflect back, I realized i’ve learnt way more than what I’ve intended to when i first start out. I believe many readers can resonate with that as well.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#2. What have i’ve I learnt thus far?</h2>

<p>I’ve learnt so many lessons from my writing adventure thus far! In this list, we will go through the top 5 of them. Do leave a comment below if you can resonate with any of them.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Community is king</h3>

<p>To consistently be able to gather feedback on whatever you’ve written helps to create some discussions via the net. Especially if you know you’re touching an interesting topic that people has been talking about.</p>

<p>It is never to find the most glamorous topics to talk about just so you can be ‘part of the gang’. That sounds more like a FOMO to me. Don’t be a FOMO.</p>

<p>Find out because you genuinely want to learn. There isn’t time to be someone else, chasing other people’s attention.</p>

<p>In the space of technology, there has been so many topics and conversations about open-source. What is open-source?</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Open-source&nbsp;software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which&nbsp;source&nbsp;code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any&nbsp;purpose. - wiki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open-source have its benefits that interestingly seems to contrary to common business thinking.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to start my own solution, and I have to open source it for the world to see and replicate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open sources have many benefits, of the many, i’ll list out a few:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Ability to start small</li>
<li>Solid information security</li>
<li>Attract better talent</li>
<li>The power of crowd</li>
<li>better security</li>
<li>Faster to market</li>
</ul>

<p>References for open source advantages:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2015/1/top-advantages-open-source-offers-over-proprietary-solutions">top advantages for open-source</a></li>
<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://opensource.com/article/17/8/enterprise-open-source-advantages">enterprise open source advantages</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>2. Writing leaves a story to be told a thousand times</h3>

<p>It sounds no-brainer but as I was part of the process, i came to see how informative articles allows you share your understanding of a topic multiple times without having to repeat yourself. Have you encountered situations where you have shared your story with your group of friends, and suddenly another friend of yours joined the conversation and realized he has missed out on the entire story, asking you to repeat again. But the efforts to repeat seems futile and you don’t seem to be able to recall the story as well as the<br>
first time around? Frustrating and hair-pulling</p>

<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/955a6f2e7099ef24a2da8aba67b0bb8b/tenor.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>This is the situation writing helps to avoid. Write once, and the story lives on. Even for yourself. Sometimes we need a little self reminder of our own learning and sharing.</p>

<p>Even in the technology space, you find the need to do documentation. Technical documentation&nbsp;helps an intended audience&nbsp;use&nbsp;your product, understand your processes, and get unstuck. This audience can be end-users, administrators, colleagues or technicians. Whoever they are, documentation is intended to be clear, searchable and helpful for these people to understand and use your product or services as its intended for. A feature that is hidden and not shared with the audience is no feature at all (Unless it is intended to be hidden away of course).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing solidifies the conversation</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>3. Train of thought is coming through</h3>

<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/d977e88507428b258d89e27202450058/tenor.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Tackling a new topic can be overwhelming when you first start out. You will find yourself bombarded with a ton of new technological terms. There is need for you to organize your thoughts, make sense and piece them together like a puzzle.</p>

<p>Have you done a jigsaw puzzle before? You don’t just tackle the pieces in the middle outta no where. You tackle the easiest parts, the sides. You try to find the ‘starting’ point of the information you are reading about, and that usually starts with a <strong>“what”</strong> question. “What is Cache?”, “what is WebRTC”.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you dealing with? Find out with the <strong>“what”</strong> question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have a good understanding of the tool you are learning about - which is the ‘what’ question. The next thing you want to learn is “how”.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does cache work? - it generally works by storing in data in a fast access hardware such as RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an article about how does cache work by <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/caching/#:~:text=How%20does%20Caching%20work%3F,the%20underlying%20slower%20storage%20layer.">Amazon</a></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does WebRTC work? You can understand that by reading articles. One of which is written by me! Really bite size with good youtube video to solidify the learning. <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">How to make video call application</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>How does a car work? How does a tool work? Find out the mechanics of the tool using the <strong>“how”</strong> question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People usually just stop here. In technology, often times, by this point you are already swam with a ton of new terminologies and mental models that you can no longer follow the documentation. You will also start to feel your body heating up and a little uncomfortable sweating in your seat. (Speaking from experience from Singapore)</p>

<p>The next question you should strive to ask before you properly take a break is the <strong>“when”</strong> question. When do we use this tool?</p>

<p>When do we use cache? You use this tool when you have frequent database access, or high read requests such as a news article site. Fetch once, store at the front of the store, so people can accessible access it when information is requested.</p>
<br>
<div><p>When do we use WebRTC? When you want to utilize browser’s technology for media exchange which includes video and audio call use cases.</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Find out when you will need to use a tool? Ask the <strong>“when do you…”</strong> question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until this point you have probably figured out these 3 questions “What”, “How”, “When”, have 2 remaining buddies - “Who”, “Where”.</p>

<p>Given the examples and the train of thought, give it a try on the <strong>who</strong> and <strong>where</strong> questions! The end goal is to find the purpose of the tool, and when to use it. Following a simple guideline as such can aid you as you navigate around challenging or foreign technology that crosses your path.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Finding your own voice</h3>

<p>I have to admit my writing was pretty thrashy when i first started out. I was writing posts in point form because i wasn’t able to find the coherence needed to put my thoughts into words. Over the months, this ability starts to develop, and i find myself to be able to express different technical ideas as I understand them to be. I managed to find the words to string together to form the idea and flow I wish to convey to my readers.</p>

<p>Beyond the writing style, writing my articles has always been about sharing knowledge. Knowledge is one asset that is given to another and there are collectively more knowledge in the pool. It has always been sharing knowledge in ways that are comprehensive, bite size and relevant to the intended audience of your posts. I enjoy and find myself learning a ton more when I am required to present these information to the public. I wouldn’t want to mess up presenting inaccurate information. That would make me a fake new spreader. And that is the last thing I ever want to do.</p>

<p>All in all, such an initiative helps me to find the voice that feels “the most me”.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/janiceotremba.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/finding-your-voice-at-work.jpg?zoom=2.625&amp;resize=330%2C198&amp;ssl=1" alt=""></p>
<br>
<h3>5. Share because you never know who could learn from you</h3>

<p>You never know who might find your information useful! If it is organized and coherent, you will find that your knowledge could be the very information that someone else in the world is googling and trying to …</p></span></p></div></div>

<![CDATA[DDD: Carving Out Read Models from the Application]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Imagine designing a new part of the application for a business that is not well defined yet. After a few knowledge-crushing sessions, you see the first boundaries of the new model and start to know how the business is running. Together with the team, you are making proof of concept of the application, but you are also making a conscious decision to take a technical debt, just to speed up development. After a few sprints, it appears that precious PoC became a production-working application that nobody wants to work with because of tests complexity and deployment problems. You are facing a time when you need to pay off the debt you took.</p>







<p>We will walk through steps performed on real, production running application. Those steps allowed to separate Read Models into an independent application. As a result, data processing and deployment times will decrease, the coupling between modules will be reduced and development will become easier. This article will not explain what is Read Model or what is the difference between mentioned architecture styles.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.37.20-1024x411.png" alt="" srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.37.20-1024x411.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.37.20-300x120.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.37.20-768x308.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.37.20-1536x616.png 1536w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.37.20-2048x821.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>We will work on <strong>Usage</strong> module that is processing EV charging sessions.</figcaption></figure>







<p>As a team, we were well prepared to design our application. As it was business-critical, we decided to use hexagonal architecture, although we pushed it to a state, that it became hard to maintain.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-10-1024x368.png" alt="" srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-10-1024x368.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-10-300x108.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-10-768x276.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-10.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>First version of the application used framework-provided event&nbsp;handling</figcaption></figure>



<p>During development, we were mostly focused on the Core Domain, as it is important for the business to earn money. It was natural to pay more attention to cash flows processes through the company than generating reports — in the end, they can always be generated once more, but when you lost money due to invalid flow, your company is losing financial liquidity.</p>



<h2>How did we let our application degenerate?</h2>



<p>The Core Domain of application and Read Models were sharing the same codebase. They were separated with proper packaging and integrated with events. Clear split with events gives an opportunity for spending more time on understanding the business. To limit work related to infrastructure, we decided to use event handling provided by the framework that was used for development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its biggest drawback was synchronous processing, but we accepted that at this point. Later, it became a bottleneck, as total processing time of event received by the application was counted in seconds. Tests were getting tangled, making the whole solution hard to test.</p>



<p>After stabilizing the domain, we started to focus on the Read Models. The solution used to feed them with data has drawbacks, so we made a decision to switch it to Apache Kafka. Unfortunately, there was no time to change already existing solution for a new one, so we started to send events on both channels. Utilising both channels preserved the history of events stored on Kafka — it gives us a possibility for switching off framework broker in the future.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-11-1024x368.png" alt="" srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-11-1024x368.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-11-300x108.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-11-768x276.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram-11.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>New events are sent through Apache Kafka, but old ones were still sent with the framework</figcaption></figure>



<p>The final version of the domain is pretty lightweight, but reporting is not. They have to process data produced by the application, merge them with data from other services and provide it to customers. There was still one more thing — this whole domain, application, adapters and Read Models were a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">modular monolith</a>, deployed all together is single deployment package.</p>



<h2>What was&nbsp;wrong?</h2>



<p>Service was working, but it became heavy. Problems started to pile up, making development more and more difficult.</p>



<ul><li>Processing of single event by domain took seconds. We did not have a requirement on performance, but clearly it was not what we should aim for. The root problem, in this case, is synchronous processing of a few types of events emitted by domain.</li><li>Application startup was too long. It was so long that deployment pipelines had to use extended timeouts for application node startup. There were two reasons for this: read model database migration affecting the deployment time of application, and the amount of data pre-loaded by the Read Models.</li><li>Automated testing became harder and harder. Flow, potential ways of data processing and the number of cases increased since we wrote our first test. In addition, some use cases were still using synchronous processing, coupling code even more.</li></ul>







<p>To solve all problems that we had, we had to clearly define, what we want to achieve, and how we want to do it. After defining the responsibilities for specific modules, defined the desired state as following:</p>



<figure><img src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.42.00-1024x714.png" alt="" srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.42.00-1024x714.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.42.00-300x209.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.42.00-768x535.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.42.00-1536x1071.png 1536w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-14-at-22.42.00-2048x1428.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>We want to achieve fully asynchronous processing with messages sent through Apache&nbsp;Kafka.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whole processing has to be done asynchronously, with a separate deployment unit that will contain only Read Models. This required from us some planning, and we prepared the following plan.</p>



<h2>Step one: tests&nbsp;review</h2>



<p>The base for every refactoring should be a guarantee that the application provides the same functionality after it is changed. Having a Test Driven Development approach placed us already in a good starting position. While reviewing tests, you should pay more attention to the integration ones over unit tests. In this case, it is more important to keep usage scenarios the same from a user perspective than catch up on missing class-based tests.</p>



<p>Fortunately, in our case Core Domain tests were just fine — they covered all business cases. On the other hand, Read Models were missing the whole event processing part. Tests were assuming that data is already in the database, and just checked if they are served in a proper way.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram2-1024x758.png" alt="" srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram2-1024x758.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram2-300x222.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram2-768x569.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-Diagram2.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Event parsing and mapping were not checked with integration tests. We needed some black-box tests</figcaption></figure>



<p>It may look trivial, but actually, data conversion and applying events is crucial for Read Models. It is basically their responsibility — convert the actual state to the representation needed by consumers. As we were switching from framework-provided event handling to the Apache Kafka, we started to write missing tests that will allow us to easily change the message broker. This leads us to the next step, which is:</p>



<h2>Step two: if possible, process data asynchronously</h2>



<p>One of the biggest problems of service was data processing time. Still, it was sufficient to meet our performance needs, but with every added feature time increased. Scaling out the service would be a short-term solution in case of higher performance need, but it causes higher utilisation of infrastructure. That would lead to scaling it up, significantly increasing operating cost.</p>



<p>From the business perspective, it was totally fine to see processed data after a few seconds, so asynchronous processing was more than advised. Emitting events created by domain, expressing a fact that something already happened, is enforcing this approach. You should aim for event-based communication and allow other modules of application to take action on them.</p>



<p>If you are already emitting events, but you are doing it synchronously and you are unable to migrate fully into asynchronous processing, it is perfectly fine to have two message channels. One for legacy code, that cannot be changed right now, second, asynchronous, for migrated modules. In future, when you will migrate all synchronous modules, an old, unused message channel can be removed.</p>



<p>In our case, having an architecture that follows the event-driven approach simplified our work on asynchronous processing. After adjusting tests to expect that data was transferred through Apache Kafka, we only needed to add a code for publishing them and reconfigure event listeners.</p>



<h2>Step three: make code independent</h2>



<p>At this point, code should be well tested. Decent coverage of user scenarios allows changing code with the confidence of not breaking functionality. Making modules independent from each other will be probably the hardest part of splitting the codebase. We are using packages to organize code depending on its purpose. It is good to start with the creation of <code>readmodel</code> package in your code, and trying to move there all related code. Later, you will need to do one of the most boring work: find dependencies from other packages into <code>readmodel</code>. This is absolutely crucial, that domain and application to not be dependent on the form of data presentation. When you will finish it, you will need to do second most boring, but important task: find dependencies in another way around. <code>readmodel</code> itself should not have dependencies of outside its package.</p>



<p>The only thing, that could be shared by all packages, are domain events, as long as they are stored in a dedicated package. While reviewing your packages, you might get into the point, that some copying of code will be needed. Do not worry about breaking DRY principle, just think about <code>readmodel</code> like about an application that is totally separate from the rest — it is just sharing the code repository.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Step four: carve out the Read&nbsp;Models</h2>



<p>When you are deciding to carve out Read Models into microservices, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePrerequisites.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">you should be prepared</a> to do microservices first. If this is going to be your first microservice, you will need a lot of research and Ops work to make it happen. Hopefully, you already are familiar with pipelines and monitoring, so you can just walk through check points:</p>



<ul><li>prepare new source code repository for extracted part of the application and move code there</li><li>set up pipelines for new microservice</li><li>create the required infrastructure (databases, servers, namespaces, everything that your application may need)</li><li>attach monitoring of new service, and review rules for old one (e.g. check if there are rules that are using migrated read model API)</li><li>notify consumers about new API address</li><li>finally, remove old, unused Read Models from the Core</li></ul>



<p>Before deploying new applications, make a plan for data migration. Think about what you can read from existing events, and what you will need to …</p></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>his spring, a group of schoolboys in Delhi played an obscene guessing game. In a group chat on Instagram, one boy shared a photo of<strong> </strong>a girl with the group, challenging the others to guess her age. The prize for a correct guess: her social media handle. “Bad dressing sense,” one boy <a href="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1588744369584-bois-locker-room.jpeg?resize=1575:*">commented</a>. “ikr [I know right],” replied the original poster, “But good tits.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the alleged victims of the group, which became known as the Bois Locker Room chat, was Madhuri, a 17-year-old girl in Bangalore who asked to be identified by a pseudonym. She told <em>Rest of World</em> that, in April, she received an unsolicited message from one of the boys requesting nude photographs. “I refused, but he kept on insisting,” she said. She showed <em>Rest of World</em> a screenshot of his response: “You motherfucker. Send me pictures of your breasts. How dare you say no to me?” The boy then superimposed Madhuri’s face onto a pornographic picture and sent it to her. She blocked him. But a month later, she realized he also shared the picture on the Bois Locker Room chat. She soon learned she<strong> </strong>was not the only one. The group had targeted multiple underage girls with photo manipulation. “It was disgusting,” she said. “One boy replied that he preferred bigger breasts. Another said he’d like to rape me.” What Madhuri didn’t do is go to the police. “They don’t take [sexual-harassment cases] very seriously,” Madhuri told me. “Besides, my parents would have felt bad about me going public. You know what it’s like for girls. We’d be blamed first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet Madhuri and the other victims would soon attain some measure of justice via unconventional means. She sent the screenshots to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shubhamcybercop/">@shubhamsinghcybercop</a>, an Instagram user who had quietly begun investigating the case.<strong> </strong>After recording her statement, he asked if she wished to submit a legal complaint; she declined. </p>



<p>The operator of the account is Shubham Singh, a 25-year-old wunderkind digital detective of sorts in Mumbai, some 1,400 kilometers away. He regards himself as a private investigator, gathering information to verify claims of online harassment and encouraging victims to pursue legal action. His vigilantism — what he calls “ethical hacking” — resides somewhere on the spectrum between the formal justice of the courts and the informal justice of the social-media tribunal. Despite his unorthodox methods, he has quickly become one of India’s most popular cybercrime&nbsp;experts, assisting Mumbai’s police in cases ranging from petty fraud to kidnapping, and even occasionally lending a hand to anti-terrorism efforts.</p>



<p>Several weeks after Madhuri’s exchange with the boy, screenshots from the Bois Locker Room were leaked onto <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bois-locker-room-delhi-schoolboys-create-group-to-share-lewd-photos-chats-on-classmates-1674303-2020-05-04">social media</a> after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashnaaasharmaa/">@ashnaaasharmaa</a>, an Instagram influencer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17890085584516759/">shared</a> a list of the boys’ handles and requested that her followers expose “[t]hese cunts.” The story revealed that most of the boys attended several prominent private schools in Saket, an affluent South Delhi suburb. The details were shocking: In the chat — which included roughly 30 boys, some as young as 15 — the boys rated the attractiveness of underage girls’ bodies and exchanged their personal information. Some even shared lewd tales of alleged<strong> </strong>sexual encounters with the girls. National media outlets <a href="https://qz.com/india/1850737/delhi-boyslockerroom-chat-puts-spotlight-on-india-rape-culture/">swarmed</a> over the story, as Indian social media erupted in outrage. As <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXKrLUnUEAE3SAs.jpg">more screenshots</a> from the chat emerged, the group members threatened to rape or leak nude photographs of the whistleblowers. One said: “I am going to Fuck every single [girl] who posted on their story” — a threat newspapers interpreted as rape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the Bois’ plans for revenge would be foiled, thanks in part to Singh. Over a Skype <em>chai</em> in late May,<strong> </strong>he told <em>Rest of World</em> that an influencer had tipped him off about the case by tagging him in an Instagram story and asking for his assistance in finding the boys. He said that soon after the story appeared, his inbox was flooded with screenshots from alleged victims. “On an average day, I get 10 to 20 messages,” he said, “but this time, I must have gotten over 200.” He had only a few blurred screenshots from the Bois’ chat that had gone viral — fearing public retaliation, members had deleted their Instagram accounts, seemingly eliminating any evidence. How, then, did he track them down? “Us ethical hackers, we have our techniques,” he grinned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh explained that he first asked the girls who had approached him to send him screen recordings to confirm their stories. Next, he used a special tracking software to find their email addresses via their Instagram handles. After confirming those addresses, he searched Facebook for accounts registered under those emails and compared their Instagram pictures to those<strong> </strong>posted to<strong> </strong>their Facebook accounts.<strong> </strong>Once he confirmed the identities of the nine boys who were active participants in the leaked chats, Singh forwarded a WhatsApp message containing his findings<strong> </strong>to a police officer in New Delhi. He received no response. So he tracked down the boys’ parents and called them. “Since they were minors,” he said, “I wouldn’t speak to them directly. But their parents needed to know what their children were up to. I recommended that the boys seek counseling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh then shared the names of the nine boys on his own Instagram account. Their handles were also posted publicly by “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallofshamereal/?hl=en">Wall of Shame Real</a>,” an anonymous Instagram page that names and shames alleged sexual offenders. Its administrator invited the page’s 35,000-plus followers to bring forward more screenshots and stories of harassment that could be used as evidence against the boys. “Their parents have been informed. Now, for the real action, you need to step up and help sir [Singh] in the case,” the post read. (The administrator of the Wall of Shame Real page did not return<em> Rest of World</em>’s request for comment.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>On May 6, the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admin-of-instagram-group-bois-locker-room-arrested-devices-seized/story-9tQDaF32QglX2tnyGPP6wI.html"><em>Hindustan Times</em> reported</a> that the Delhi police had apprehended an administrator of the group chat — the result of a social media furor fomented, in large part, by Singh. With their elite private-school pedigrees and social-media savvy, these boys seemed to alert India to a generation of young people doing whatever they wanted to whomever they chose to — as much online as elsewhere in the world. It is still unclear what the consequences will be for the boys of Bois Locker Room, though many have been questioned by the police in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Singh’s decision to share the boys’ Instagram handles, some of which revealed their full names, seemed to skirt an ethical line. But he insisted that their handles had already been shared publicly before his involvement in the matter. “I don’t believe in trial by social media. Instagram is not a courtroom. I always verify my claims before I post them,” he said. At the same time, he acknowledged: “Sometimes, to get justice, you need to do unethical things.”</p>



<p>The Bois Locker Room<strong> </strong>case struck a chord with Indians still convulsed with anger over the treatment of women in their country. In 2012, a fatal gang rape on a bus in Delhi enraged the country and spurred legal and judicial reforms. Yet the horror remains. According to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rape-factbox/statistics-on-rape-in-india-and-some-well-known-cases-idUSKBN1YA0UV">latest statistics</a>, every day, 90 rapes are reported in India, but many more go unreported, due to fears and stigma.&nbsp;In the first three and a half months of 2018, more than five women were raped every day in the capital city. In February, a man <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51398295">allegedly raped a 5-year-old girl</a> within the grounds of the U.S. Embassy in Delhi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critics argue that the government has failed to address the heart of the problem: cultural notions of purity that lead third parties, particularly law enforcement, to blame the victim. A longtime police inspector with the<strong> </strong>Mumbai Crime Branch, who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> on condition of anonymity, said that victims of sex crimes directly approach private investigators such as Singh out of convenience, not frustration. “If you lodge a claim, you will have to be questioned, have a character certificate taken … these things take a few days. People think going to the police is a waste of time — if I advertised free private help on Facebook, why wouldn’t people come to me? It’s just easier.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inspector disagreed that police fail to adequately protect sexual-harassment victims. “There may have been cases where officers behaved badly, but the government has now made lots of changes to help girls feel more comfortable approaching the police,” he said. “There are dedicated lady officers and help lines for sexual-harassment cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The numbers would appear to back him up: Between 2012 and 2015, cases of rape reported to the police increased by 39%, perhaps suggesting victims have become more willing to come forward. But victims still claim law enforcement dissuades them from pressing charges. They often suffer humiliation at police stations and hospitals, according to a 2017 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/11/08/everyone-blames-me/barriers-justice-and-support-services-sexual-assault-survivors">paper</a> by Human Rights Watch. Even when police do cooperate with victims, the legal system often fails them. According to 2018 data from India’s National Crime Records Bureau, only <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/conviction-in-crimes-against-dalits-is-abysmally-low-mha-report/articleshow/63833473.cms">27.2%</a>&nbsp;of state prosecutions for rape in India led to a conviction. By contrast, the <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/annual-violence-against-women-and-girls-report-published-0">corresponding figure</a> for 2017 to 2018 in the United Kingdom stood at 58%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rukmini Sen, a sociologist with the Ambedkar University Delhi, said India’s male-dominated police force still stigmatizes victims of sexual violence. “Time and again, various initiatives are announced … and clearly all of these attempts have either not been properly carried forward or have not created enough confidence in women,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>AppsCode is relicening various components of the <a href="https://stash.run/">Stash</a> and <a href="https://kubedb.com/">KubeDB</a> products. We have decided to use simple, standardized, plain-language software source code licenses from the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/">PolyForm Project</a>. Please see the table below for the upcoming changes:</p><p><img src="https://blog.byte.builders/post/relicensing/appscode-license-overview.svg" alt="AppsCode License Overview"></p><h2 id="why-now">Why now?</h2><p>AppsCode started as a commercial entity to accelerate the adoption of Kubernetes and containers in the Enterprise. We launched a number of open source products like <a href="https://voyagermesh.com/">Voyager</a>, <a href="https://stash.run/">Stash</a>, <a href="https://kubedb.com/">KubeDB</a>, <a href="https://kubevault.com/">KubeVault</a>, <a href="https://kubeform.com/">Kubeform</a>, etc. Consequently, we began receiving many feature requests, bug reports and general support questions via our GitHub repositories and public slack account. We are very much thankful to the existing users of our open source projects. As a commercial entity, now we are focusing on building a sustainable business for the future. These development activities incur cost which I initially bootstrapped myself. Supporting open source projects is not sustainable without any kind of revenue stream. Last year we offered support packages for our various products; but that did not help. Often, we get queries in the meetings with prospective customers regarding the difference between the free open source version and the paid version. In the process we have learnt that support is not enough to convert those users into customers. <em>For businesses it is not rational to pay for something that they can get for free.</em> As a result, since the end of last year we started developing closed source features for the “Enterprise” version of our products.</p><h2 id="future-of-stash--kubedb">Future of Stash &amp; KubeDB</h2><p>Going forward, we will be offering two versions of our Stash and KubeDB operators. The open-sourced community version of the operators with limited features will serve the non-commercial users covered by the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/">PolyForm Noncommercial License</a>. The close-sourced, enterprise version of the operators with full features will serve the licensed users. If the licensed users request the source code of the enterprise operators in some circumstances, then it will be available to them under NDA. For our other products, we will make announcements on a case by case basis in the future.</p><h2 id="whats-included-in-the-kubedb-enterprise">What’s included in the KubeDB Enterprise</h2><p>KubeDB Enterprise edition includes all the features (clustering, etc.) of KubeDB Community Edition and extends it with focus on automating Day 2 operations, improving security and productivity. You can see some quick demos of upcoming MySQL Enterprise features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoiT1Gv2KR1imxr13HareDzWfUvsWWtVY">here</a>.</p><p><img src="https://blog.byte.builders/post/relicensing/kubedb-enterprise.svg" alt="KubeDB Enterprise"></p><p><img src="https://blog.byte.builders/post/relicensing/kubedb-roadmap.svg" alt="KubeDB Roadmap"></p><h2 id="whats-included-in-the-stash-enterprise">What’s included in the Stash Enterprise</h2><p>Please see the table below to understand the feature difference between Stash Community edition and Stash Enterprise edition.</p><p><img src="https://blog.byte.builders/post/relicensing/stash-feature-matrix.svg" alt="Stash Feature Matrix"></p><h2 id="what-does-it-mean-for-existing-users">What does it mean for existing users</h2><p>If you are a Noncommercial organization, such as, any charitable organization, educational institution, public research organization, public safety or health organization, environmental protection organization, or government institution, as defined by the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/">PolyForm Noncommercial License</a> or using AppsCode products for personal use, you should be able to continue to use our products as you are doing today. For commercial organizations, we are offering a 14 day trial license. This should allow you to use AppsCode Enterprise products for free in CI environments.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>If you are interested in licensing either Stash or KubeDB, please contact us via <a href="mailto:sales@appscode.com">sales@appscode.com</a> for further discussion. You can also set up a meeting via our <a href="https://calendly.com/appscode/30min">calendly link</a>.</p><p>We are also working on a hosted version of KubeDB products where customers will be able to BYOK(Bring Your Own Kubernetes). We hope to share more in later part of the year.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article id="post-127">
<div>

<div>
<p>As a founder, it always seems like everywhere I go, some new company has done something to experience some crazy, viral growth.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dollar Shave Clubs hilarious advertisements</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://tim.blog/2014/07/21/harrys-prelaunchr-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Harry’s Explosive Pre-Launch Referral Program</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QmCUDHpNzE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dropbox’s Original MVP Explainer Video</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And a little over a year ago… I was hooked on this idea.</strong></p>
<p>I was going to create a viral video that exponentially grows my user numbers!</p>
<p>The Infamous quote “<em><strong>If you build it, they will come</strong></em>” started ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>… But Boy was I wrong.</p>
<p><strong>And I still cringe and apologetic about it to this day!</strong></p>







<p>Almost 2 years ago, I founded a side-project called The Crypt. This was a newsletter that focused on Tech &amp; Finance News.</p>
<p>Similar to what <a href="https://thetechonomics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Techonomics</a> is today, however, we use a lot more Artificial Intelligence and an entirely different tech stack.</p>
<p>I am a fan of both tech and finance media, I spent years working and studying these industries so working on this project was a great way to bridge my interests and work on something interesting.</p>
<p>I have had previous successes with online-based businesses before. I have bought, created, and sold multiple blogs in the past, but this was my first newsletter-based business and this one was a bit tech-heavy.</p>
<p>So initially I thought, no worries… this shouldn’t be too hard to grow… Ha</p>
<p>The Crypt was HELL to grow. Months and months of various content marketing strategies just to get mere hundreds of subscribers.</p>
<p>So I had the brilliant idea that it was time to GO VIRAL!</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I was going to make a video of&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jesus Christ… giving financial advice… on Easter</span></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9DPJVjlYHwWsZRxm/giphy.gif" width="500" height="281" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><strong><span>I still cringe thinking about it!</span></strong></p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aRFku00dQg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Honestly, At the time, I was 100% sure I was doing it right.</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I read multiple articles at the time giving me the secret formula to making a viral video. (In hindsight this was ridiculous)</span></p>
<h2><strong>Steps To Creating Viral Video:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>✅ Focus on a single message</strong></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">✅<strong> Provide value</strong></span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">✅ <strong>Use the right format</strong></span></li>
<li><strong>✅ Create a catchy, branded thumbnail</strong></li>
<li><strong>Etc…</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And to time it right on easter?</strong></p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This was brilliant! (sarcastic)</span></em></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/socalchrist">actor</a> I worked with was viral at the time for his work with Pewdiepie and other YouTubers. So I knew the production quality would be great.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a raised Christian myself, with a poor sense of humor. I assumed people would get the joke and ask themselves.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Lol. Why is Jesus giving me financial advice?… Welp, time to sign up for this newsletter”</span></em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://media.makeameme.org/created/really-seriously-my.jpg" width="409" height="411" data-src="https://media.makeameme.org/created/really-seriously-my.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>Well, that is not what happened… </span></p>

<p><span>Like you may have expected, the results were poor.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span><strong>❌ Shared on HackerNews</strong> – Fail</span></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><span><strong>❌ Shared on Reddit</strong> – Fail</span></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><span><strong>❌ Facebook Ads</strong> – Fail&nbsp;</span></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<h3><span><span>Not even a single click on the video</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>My close friends told me this wouldn’t work and 1 year later… I still cringe at the fact I thought this was a good idea!</span></p>

<p><span>Would I do this again? </span></p>
<p><span>Make a video using the signifying figure of a large organized religion to push my product? <strong>No… and you shouldn’t either.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>However, will I try to make another viral video again? Of Course</span></p>
<p><span>You have to shoot your shot if you ever plan on succeeding.</span></p>

          <p><span>June 29 2020 by
           <a href="https://genodians.org/skalk/index">Stefan Kalkowski</a></span></p>
 <p>
  Recently, I was honored for receiving the first beta
  <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform">MNT Reform 2.0</a>
  shipped by <a href="https://mntre.com/">MNT Research GmbH</a>. This is an interesting
  laptop project produced by a team of three people: Lukas Hartmann
  (electronics / software design), Ana Beatriz Albertini Dantas (product /
  industrial design), and Greta Melnik (sleeve design / SMD assembly).
 </p>
 <p>
  The curiosity about it is that such a small team has designed a customizable,
  completely-open, robust-and-sustainable, and last but not least fancy device for
  privacy-aware and hacker-minded people. It contains a self-designed motherboard
  accomodating a Nitrogen8M System-on-Module with an i.MX8MQ System-on-Chip
  inside, its own mechanical keyboard, as well as either a trackball or trackpad.
  Everything inside is open hardware. You can download all PCB schematics. Moreover,
  the MNT Reform arrived in a box containing colored printings of the schematics
  as well. If you are interested you can enjoy a series of
  <a href="https://twitter.com/Skalk12/status/1270443745654321152">unboxing pictures</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only limitation regarding the openness is naturally the Integrated-Circuits
  including the SoC. But here the technical lead Lukas Hartmann has chosen to use
  the NXP's i.MX8MQ as a good choice regarding open documentation, unlocked
  boot-chain and most absence of firmware blobs. Due to this choice I got aware of
  this highly interesting project. For the very same reasons, we made use of the
  i.MX SoC series at Genode Labs in the past. And after looking deeper at MNT
  Reform, it became obvious to me that we share a common mindset at MNT Research
  and Genode Labs: giving back control to the users.
 </p>
 <p>
  To cut a long story short: I was really excited when the MNT Reform arrived. And
  all my expectations were surpassed when opening the package. First of all,
  the transparent, professional communication policy by MNT Research GmbH is a
  pleasure.
  The box not only included the laptop and schematics, but a detailed letter with
  all starting information and further references. It felt like doing a time
  travel. When my father handed his old (1980) HiFi system to me, it included a thick
  handbook with all schematics back then as well. Devices as such are constructed
  to survive decades.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obviously planned for the near future is the Reform Operator's Handbook. But for
  the time-being I was lucky to scroll and click through the
  <a href="https://mntre.com/reform2-handbook/system.html">interactive system diagram</a>
  with links to the relevant Linux drivers and datasheets. I've already
  experienced how frustrating it can be to figure out what innards boards and SoCs
  might contain during the last years. The MNT Reform 2 is a nice contrast here.
 </p>
 <p>
  First I failed to turn-on the device, but after reading the annexed letter more
  carefully, I realized that it's simply the Circle-key in combination with <tt>1</tt> or <tt>0</tt>
  to turn the device on and off. Actually quite plausible. It is easy to recap
  that interactions with the system controller's firmware are always done via the
  Circle key, whereas the MNT Reform key is used to interact with the OS (or
  better the window-manager). When playing a bit with the Linux distro preinstalled on
  the SD-card, I really enjoyed to use the keyboard! The trackball is still a
  bit harsh when used, but I assume it will run more smoothly when enwrapped with
  my hands patina.
 </p>
 <p>
  But being a Genodian my goal was not only to consume the device as it is, but
  making it my primary Genode platform. So it was time to unscrew the acrylic
  glass bottom side, and connect a serial to USB converter in between the serial
  pins of the Reform and my current development machine.
 </p>
 <p>
   <img src="https://genodians.org/skalk/reform-01.png">
 </p>
 <p>
  By interacting with the pre-installed u-boot, I could successfully load a first
  very simple "Hello World" alike Genode system image into the Reform's memory via
  network. Therefore, I simply used an image built originally for the i.MX 8MQ
  Evaluation Kit, which uses the very same SoC. Typically, at Genode Labs we use
  the uImage format and u-boot's <tt>bootm</tt> command to load our system images. The
  first attempt to boot that image failed, because the preinstalled u-boot
  insisted on a device-tree blob to be provided as well. But then it successfully
  booted and showed Genode's hw kernel/core, init and test-log component running
  on the Reform.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next step was changing the frequency of the CPUs when starting the kernel.
  When booted, the CPU runs with 1 GHz frequency, but it is actually capable to
  run with 1.5 GHz. I first figured out how to do this with the i.MX 8MQ EVK,
  because it is already integrated well into our testing infrastructure. It took
  quite some time to figure out how the actual protocol of bit-twiddling in the
  PLLs looks like, but finally it run reasonable faster, and I could one-by-one
  adapt the changes to the MNT Reform.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first midterm goal is to run an interactive Sculpt OS on the Reform, similar
  to the one already presented on the i.MX 8MQ EVK at
  <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/uk_genode_armv8/">FOSDEM</a> earlier this
  year. Therefore, a bunch of drivers for networking, persistence storage, and
  human interaction are needed in the first place. The hope was that most drivers
  used already with the i.MX 8MQ EVK could be used unmodified to achieve this.
  Indeed, the drivers for SD-Card and Ethernet went out-of-the box. The USB host
  controller driver was functional too. But in contrast to the EVK, which uses
  only one USB host controller of the i.MX 8MQ SoC, the Reform 2 uses both
  available ones. An USB hub connected to the second one attaches the trackball
  and keyboard USB HID devices. After tweaking the driver a bit, which still uses
  hard-coded I/O resources instead of the new platform driver for ARM, I could
  successfully see input events from trackball, keyboard, and an attached mouse,
  as you can see in the below picture.
 </p>
 <p>
   <img src="https://genodians.org/skalk/reform-05.png">
 </p>
 <p>
  The last missing point is the display panel. There is already a Linux
  driver port for the Display Controller Subsystem (DCSS) - the display engine of
  the SoC - available in Genode. However, until now we only used and enabled the
  HDMI connectivity for it. But the display panel of the Reform is connected
  via a Mobile Industry Processor Interface (MIPI) Display Serial Interface (DSI).
  So it won't work without additional device driver integration. Fortunately, my
  colleague Sebastian Sumpf already begun to port the missing MIPI-DSI piece to
  run an OLED diplay connected to the EVK board. As soon as he finished his work,
  I'll gladly integrate it into my MNT Reform 2
  <a href="https://github.com/skalk/genode/commits/mnt_reform2">topic branch</a>. Then a
  first Sculpt OS version should be available.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next bigger issue I currently focus on is writing an i.MX 8MQ specific
  platform driver comprising clock &amp; power management and to turn the drivers into
  using it. Moreover, it shall manage the PCI-x bus available, which is quite
  important to enable NVMe, or Wifi on the MNT Reform 2.

<p>You probably heard of Vim, the almighty text-editor that is everywhere and
a place where <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor">people get trapped from time to time</a>.
If you are hearing from your local DevOps engineer how Vim is excellent and
fast, you probably thought about giving it a try. But how did it come
to this? How did Vim-craze take over the world at some point?</p>
<p>If we look at the
<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments">StackOverflow survey for 2019</a>
about the most popular development environments, Vim is still there on the 5th
place, with around 25% of Web Developers using it. Fifth place is pretty neat
considering the first Vim release happened almost 30 years ago (yeah, you read
that right, Vim got first released in 1991).</p>
<p>To better understand why and how Vim got (and is) so popular, it is best to
look into the roots of how it all started. Before <code>vim</code>, there was <code>vi</code>, before
<code>vi</code> there was <code>ed</code>. What are all these two or three letter words, and
what is the story behind it? Let us dive in and figure out.</p>
<h2 id="punch-cards-and-line-editors"><a href="#punch-cards-and-line-editors" aria-label="punch cards and line editors permalink"></a>Punch cards and line editors</h2>
<p>It might be apparent today why we have text editors and fully-fledged IDE
(Integrated Development Environment), but what did we have before that?
As you may know, early forms of programming involved putting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">papers with
holes (punch cards)</a> inside a
computer. The order in which you placed these in was very essential. For example, this
is a picture of 4.5 megabytes data, stacked in 62500 punch cards. Imagine
dropping that and having to sort it again.</p>

<p>
  OK, mom, I'll come down, just need to re-stack my new blog post
</p>
<p>Punch cards proved a bit inefficient as computer power and storage grew, and
programming evolved. Eventually, people moved away from punch cards, and then
there came the era of “line editors.” One great example of this is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)"><code>ed</code> editor</a>. Let’s not forget to
mention <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qedman.html">QED editor</a>,
<code>ed</code>’s predecessor.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-line-editor"><a href="#using-a-line-editor" aria-label="using a line editor permalink"></a>Using a line editor</h2>
<p>If you are on Linux or Mac OS, open your terminal and type <code>ed</code>. You
will get a simple line editor, which will greet you with silence.
If you are amazed by this finding (as I was), you can try playing with it for a while. To write
a file, start typing <code>a</code> and press enter, then write your text. Typing <code>.</code>
following an enter will exit the append (insert) mode. Then, to write a file, you can
type <code>w myfile.txt</code> and press enter and lastly write <code>q</code> and enter to exit.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># ed
a
Hey there!
I am using ed right now, how cool.
OK, that's enough.
.
w myfile.txt
64
q</code></pre></div>
<p>As you may notice, there are similarities between working with <code>ed</code> and with
today’s <code>vim</code>. If you use Vim, you can say you would get the hang of <code>ed</code> pretty
quickly.</p>
<h2 id="vims-dad---the-vi"><a href="#vims-dad---the-vi" aria-label="vims dad   the vi permalink"></a>Vim’s dad - The Vi</h2>
<p>After <code>ed</code>, then came the <code>em</code> - <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gc/history/">the “editor for mortals”</a>.
It could do similar things as <code>ed</code>, but it is ‘less cryptic’ and built for
regular people. Based on <code>em</code>’s code, Bill Joy developed <code>ex</code>, which
stands for “extended ed”! It was significant because <code>ex</code> had, besides the previous
modes, the <code>visual</code> mode, which will show the whole file on your screen. You
must be thinking - duh, how didn’t they <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">think of that earlier</a>?
Having that thing show up on computers in those days was pretty tricky,
and some considered it a resource hog. But, at that point, the benefits had
outweighed objections, and having a file opened on your screen as you edit it
became today’s standard.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Vi editor" title="Vi editor" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/dd4157ecc91779d4e893edf95e85f3f5/fcda8/vi.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/dd4157ecc91779d4e893edf95e85f3f5/12f09/vi.png 148w,

<p>And like that, the <strong>vi</strong>sual mode was born. Later, the executable <code>vi</code> got
introduced in operating systems, but you can still access <code>ex</code> commands by
typing <code>:</code> in <code>vi</code>/<code>vim</code>. The <code>ex</code> got released in 1976, and the <code>vi</code>
executable got released in 1979. 40-something years ago! But, how did <code>vim</code> came to life?</p>
<h2 id="the-imitation-game"><a href="#the-imitation-game" aria-label="the imitation game permalink"></a>The Imitation Game</h2>
<p>A couple of years later, many <code>vi</code> clones emerged (my favorite one is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(text_editor)">Elvis</a>). One of them was “Vi
Improved” which was created by Bram Moolenaar - the name you now see when you
try to open <code>vim</code> in your terminal. In the large pool of different <code>vi</code> clones,
<code>vim</code> managed to stand out. Bram used a clone of <code>vi</code> called <code>STEVIE</code> (nice
name, BTW), and noticed that it lacks many of <code>vi</code>’s commands. He added
some new features and made it compatible with <code>vi</code> and released it under
the name “Vi Imitation” (this later changed to “Vi Improved”). The name <code>vim</code> came in version 2.0 in 1993 and
stayed like that until the present day. But how did <code>vim</code> achieve fame? It had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Features_and_improvements_over_vi">bunch of excellent features</a>
at that time, and it was compatible with <code>vi</code>. Features and compatibility attracted a lot of folks to use it.</p>
<h2 id="half-a-century-of-contributions"><a href="#half-a-century-of-contributions" aria-label="half a century of contributions permalink"></a>Half a century of contributions</h2>
<p>If you take a look at the essential commands to move around in Vim: <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>,
<code>k</code>, and <code>l</code>, these all pull roots from the old <code>vi</code> days. Bill Joy’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A">keyboard at that time</a>
didn’t have cursors to move around. Also, the <code>ESC</code> key was in the place
of today’s <code>TAB</code> key. Take a look at how it was back in the day:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p>
<p>Commands to replace text like <code>:%s/text_to_replace/text_to_replace_it_with/</code> is
also something from that era. Having to type <code>:</code> to perform a command
was an answer to <code>ed</code>’s complete silence when you first enter the editor.</p>
<p>What I am trying to say that <code>vim</code> is an effort of over half a century of
good idea accumulation, putting lots of effort into being backward compatible.
Yes, useful features probably made Vim famous. But what kept Vim in the loop is
the compatibility with almost everything you can think about. Wherever you SSH
today, you can start the Vim session, or at least Vi session. That is a strong
(if not the strongest) point to learn it nowadays.</p>
<p>If you’re not someone who jumps from server to server and navigates files on
there, the point of having Vim everywhere doesn’t bother you. But
still, there are a couple of reasons why it might be valuable to you. I am forming
a new blog post explaining why you should learn Vim in 2020. If you are interested
in this, consider subscribing to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><a href="#final-thoughts" aria-label="final thoughts permalink"></a>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading this far, I appreciate it. I hope this blog post shed some
light on how Vim became what it is today. I also hope the post inspired you to
try it out. You never know when you might need it, or you like it so much that
you decide to switch to using Vim fully.</p>
<p>Maybe you get a Vim mode inside your IDE or VSCode, who knows. I am not saying
that Vim should replace what you are using now, but trying to learn and
configure it will improve your skills and abilities. On the other hand, it doesn’t really
matter what editor you use, it is what you do with it!</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s the matter of finding the proper editor
(tool) that makes you do what you do even better.</p>

Scrum Master</h4><p>The scrum master is responsible for making sure the entire team has everything they need to build and ship a task or user story on time.

The complete Sprint Cycle explained</h2><p>According to the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf">scrum guide</a>, scrum is lightweight, simple to understand, but difficult to master.</p><p>That’s because to run an effective scrum sprint, you need to get multiple aspects right, collaborate cross-functionally, and make sure the tools you use also enable everyone across functions to do their work efficiently.<br></p><p>That means, you’ll have to follow specific principles and steps before, during, and after the sprint, for you to get maximum value from it.</p><h3 id="a-before-the-sprint-begins">A. Before the sprint begins</h3><p>To run an effective scrum sprint, it isn’t enough to get your team together and start checking off <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/">user stories</a> and tasks. You need to lay the ground-work and set the stage. That way, when your team begins executing them, they’ll have all the context they need to deliver quality software on time.</p><p>Let’s look at each step separately.</p><h4 id="1-refine-the-product-backlog">1. Refine the product backlog</h4><p>As a product owner, you have a certain level of context that others in the team don’t. And product backlog refinement is your chance to fill in those gaps, so when it comes down to executing them, your team will have all the context they need.<br>Product backlog refinement is all about making sure the items at the top of the backlog are ready for the next sprint. This includes, making sure the user stories are up-to-date, adding <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/acceptance-criteria-for-user-stories/">acceptance criteria</a> as descriptions to user stories, removing duplicate items, and adjusting priorities based on customer needs.</p><p>That’s a lot, right? </p><p>Which is why the product owner and the scrum master collaborates to refine and make sure everything is updated. As a rule of thumb, the scrum master and the product owner have enough items updated to plan two sprints. That way, they get the context of what the sprint is building towards — ideally, towards hitting your roadmap goals.</p><h4 id="2-come-up-with-sprint-objective-based-on-the-product-roadmap">2. Come up with sprint objective based on the product roadmap</h4><p>With the context of the product roadmap and the user stories updated, the product owner now comes up with the objective the team should aim towards during the sprint.</p><blockquote>Your objective should be a conscious decision birthed by the problems your customers have with product goals in mind.</blockquote><p>A lot of teams confuse this step with the sprint goal. However, the sprint goal is determined collaboratively by the scrum team during the sprint planning meeting.</p><h4 id="3-run-the-sprint-planning-meeting"><br>3. Run the sprint planning meeting</h4><p>A sprint planning meeting is where the entire scrum team comes together to discuss and agree on what they’ll deliver in the upcoming sprint.</p><p>At the end of the <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/sprint-planning/">sprint planning meeting</a>, the team should walk away with two things: a sprint goal and a sprint backlog, both of which are decided collaboratively by the entire team.</p><p>During the meeting, the product owner brings their perspective and shares with the team the objective for the sprint, why they came up with it, and explains the user stories. This, along with the description inside each user story that the product owner added during refinement gives the development team context to ask questions and estimate them. </p><p>Estimation has always been a tricky affair. Estimate too high, you risk getting lethargic in your efforts. Estimate too low, you risk shipping a buggy software in an attempt to ship on time. Finding the sweet spot has been one of the oft-discussed topics in the realm of software development. And anyone who has spent even a few months building software will recommend you break down each user story into smaller chunks of work. Just like we did.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/06/estimation.png" alt="categorize tasks into three during estimation"><figcaption>Work towards moving all tasks to "Known Tasks" category</figcaption></figure><p>Once your development team has estimated and added <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/story-points/">story points</a> to all the stories, it’s time to come up with a sprint goal and a sprint backlog that your team will work towards achieving. This depends on the sprint duration and the estimates your team added to each of the user stories. Ideally, a sprint duration is a month or less. However, most teams decide to run a two-week sprint to stay nimble.</p><p>And since meetings can go on and on and on, it’s important to time box your sprint planning meeting to no more than 8 hours for a one month sprint. That means, <strong>if you decide to have a 2-week sprint, your sprint planning meeting shouldn’t take more than 4 hours.</strong></p><hr><h3 id="b-during-the-sprint">B. During the sprint</h3><p>The stage is set. You prioritized user stories, defined the sprint goal, and came up with the sprint backlog.

<article>
    
    <p>Single hose air conditioners (AC) should be banned. By design, they are
inefficient; they can blast cold air at a person sitting directly in front,
but will never be able to cool the rest of the room. Single hose ACs are bad
news for the environment, energy bills and your heatwave comfort!</p>

<p>The problem for UK residents is that single hose ACs are the only type of
portable model available to buy. Dual hose models or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning#Window_unit_and_packaged_terminal">window
units</a>
are not available, despite their drastically better cooling performance. But
what makes single hose ACs so bad?</p>

<h2 id="background-air-conditioners-are-just-refrigerators-with-fans">Background: Air conditioners are just refrigerators with fans</h2>
<p>Most air conditioning systems work by exchanging heat from the inside air to
the outside air, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor-compression_refrigeration">vapor-compression
refrigeration</a>.
All efficient designs (anything that’s not a single hose) do this without ever
mixing the separate air masses or causing any pressure differential between the
outside and inside. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a split AC unit in a
commercial property, the AC in your car, or your kitchen refrigerator, they
follow this operating model:</p>

<div>
<figure><img src="https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/convert-ac-from-single-hose-to-dual-hose/air-conditioning-system-type-split.svg" alt="Diagram showing operation of split type air conditioning system."><figcaption>Split inside/outside unit air conditioning system</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>Dual hose portable air conditioners follow the same principle, but incorporate
the outside unit into a single inside unit; instead using ducting hoses to draw
outside air over the condenser coils and back to the outside again. They are
more convenient as no permanent installation is required, but are marginally
less efficient due to heat loss through the hoses and the additional heat
generated from the compressor which is now inside the room that needs to be
cooled.</p>

<div>
<figure><img src="https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/convert-ac-from-single-hose-to-dual-hose/air-conditioning-system-type-portable-dual-hose.svg" alt="Diagram showing operation of portable dual hose type air conditioning system."><figcaption>Portable dual hose air conditioning system</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<h2 id="what-makes-single-hose-acs-so-bad">What makes single hose ACs so bad?</h2>
<p>Single hose models are the only type that violate this principle, which is why
they are so inefficient. Instead of using two hoses to keep the air masses
separate and drawing outside air to pass over the condenser coils, they ditch the
intake hose and just draw the <em>inside</em> air instead. Why? Probably because they’re
cheaper to manufacture and easier for customers to install.</p>

<div>
<figure><img src="https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/convert-ac-from-single-hose-to-dual-hose/air-conditioning-system-type-portable-single-hose.svg" alt="Diagram showing operation of portable single hose type air conditioning system."><figcaption>Portable single hose air conditioning system</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>But this design has a huge performance cost. With the inside air now being
forced to the outside through the exhaust hose, the inside is now always at a
lower pressure.  No room is perfectly sealed, so to equalise the pressure, hot
air from outside is continuously drawn through door frames and a multitude of
other tiny gaps in the room. This is why single hose units will never cool an
entire room, they are constantly fighting against hot air rushing back into the
room due to the negative pressure.</p>

<p>Don’t believe me? Turn the AC on in a small room, use a good seal between the
exhaust hose and the window, then close all doors and feel around the gaps
between the door and the frame. You’ll be able to feel the air rushing in to
the equalise the negative pressure in the room you’re trying to cool.</p>

<h2 id="solution-convert-the-single-hose-ac-to-dual-hose">Solution: Convert the single hose AC to dual hose</h2>
<p>Thankfully, many single hose ACs can easily be converted to dual hose systems.
Single hose systems are often designed with two separate intake ports just like
dual hose units, despite only needing one; presumably to reduce design and
manufacturing costs. By fashioning an adapter to duct the condenser intake port
so that it draws from the outside air, it will perform with the same efficiency
as a dual hose unit.</p>

<p>There are two requirements that a single hose air conditioning unit must meet
to make conversion possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>There must be two separate air intake ports for the evaporator and
condenser sides</strong>.
    <ol>
      <li>The unit likely meets this requirement if it has three separate air
grilles in addition to the exhaust hose.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>There must be an internal separation between the evaporator and condenser
side air flows</strong>. There are two ways to find this out:
    <ol>
      <li>Find photos or designs from others that have explored the internals of
your model.</li>
      <li>Open the unit up and investigate yourself. Do not do this unless you are
confident about electrical and refridgerant safety and are prepared to
invalidate the warranty of your machine.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To convert the unit from single host to dual hose:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Source an additional air conditioning hose or equivalent.</li>
  <li>Identify which air grille on the unit is the condenser (hot coil) air
intake.</li>
  <li>Create an adapter to duct this air grille into the additional air
conditioning hose, so that it can be made to draw air from the outside.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-conversion-example">My conversion example</h2>
<p>I purchased a “Challenge 5K Air Conditioning Unit” in 2019 for £289.99 from
Argos. Despite only being 5000 BTU, after conversion to dual hose it was able
to cool a medium sized room from 34 C outside temperatures down to 22 C in only
a couple of hours.</p>

<p>The conversion was performed in minutes, using items easily purchased at a
hardware shop or found around the house:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A tumble drier hose.</li>
  <li>Discarded polystyrene packaging foam and cardboard.</li>
  <li>Spare foam strips that came along with the air conditioner to provide a
better seal between the polystyrene and the unit.</li>
  <li>Plenty of duck tape.</li>
</ol>

<p>This isn’t an ideal set of materials, but works well enough to tide over for
the summer.</p>

<p>On the Challenge unit, the condenser air intake is the lower grille underneath
the exhaust hose port. After ducting this grille into the tumble drier hose,
this is the result. Not aesthetically pleasing, but very effective for the
three days of summer that the UK gets every year:</p>



<h2 id="further-tips-for-optimum-efficiency">Further tips for optimum efficiency</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Purchase a window sealing unit designed for your type of window.</li>
  <li>Keep the intake and exhaust hoses away from each other when outside of the
window. Having them close to each other increases the change that the intake
hose is drawing in freshly exhausted hot air. If stacking vertically, I like
to keep the intake hose below the exhaust hose for this reason too, as hot
air rises slightly.</li>
  <li>Keep the length of the hoses short, to minimise losses back into the room.
Move the unit as close to the window as possible.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				<p><span>Empowering customers to set up their own products and complete basic functions independently ensures that they have a smoother customer experience. </span></p>
<p><span>Picking up the phone or setting up a chat with a customer service expert may sound simple enough, but for a user to decide they need help with the installation process means that the quick start guide has failed in its objective.</span></p>
<p><span>After receiving their purchase, your customer wants to set up their product as quickly as possible and contacting customer service is ideally a last resort.</span></p>
<h4><strong>How does a quick start guide empower a customer?</strong></h4>
<p><span>A quick start guide (QSG) is intended to enable the customer to be self-sufficient in their product set up, therefore reducing their reliance on customer services. </span></p>
<p><span>They can set it up how and when they want, giving them freedom and independence. </span><span>By empowering a customer with your QSG, the customer can get set up in as little time as possible and at their own convenience.</span></p>
<p><span>The customer gets to feel a sense of achievement when the task is complete and doesn’t have to deal with the intrusion of engineers or others traipsing in and out of their house to set equipment up.</span></p>
<p><span>There are two main principles that our QSG designs follow in order to empower the customer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Simplify the written content&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>Making the quick start guide content easily digestible makes a customer’s life simpler. Less to read means less time spent; and the less time spent on set up, the smoother the experience. Simple steps help by giving clear, concise instructions or information needed to complete the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Images or illustrations are an essential part of the instructions to provide a ‘show don’t tell’ approach, as are clearly decipherable headings, numbers and visuals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Explanations, descriptions and any other content are still hugely important as they contribute to easing a customer’s experience when they do encounter an issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After reducing and simplifying your written content (your customers don’t want to be an expert on setting up, but simply to complete the process), you should consider how you signpost the content for your customer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Signpost your steps&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The smooth experience of your product’s quick start guide is dependent on a few features, but none of them more important than signposting. Directing the customer to where you want them to look, a quick start guide’s signposts should highlight and promote the key information they need to carry out the necessary steps and get started.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Signposting can take many forms –</span><span>&nbsp;utilising font, format and colour to draw the eye to the relevant stage in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Titles and numbers are the most recognisable methods of signposting, as customers respond instinctively and are led through the process naturally. Numbers also outline the order in which the user should complete the steps. Making all this information clear enables the user to follow the process quickly, empowering them to get set up without external help.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You’ll want your signposting to be as subtle as it possibly can be. Titles that use action words or phrases, such as ‘Plug in USB’ or ‘Set up connection’, clearly communicate to the customer what should be happening at that stage.</span></p>
<p><span>Colours that highlight additional information or something to be aware of draw the user in visually so that they are more likely to read that information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Progress signposts show customers how many steps there are in total and what step they are on. This is useful in a multi-step process because it gives an overview of the number of tasks and indicates progress.</span></p>

<h4><b>Find out more about quick start guides&nbsp;</b></h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Imagine this: You have a large multi-module ClojureScript project, and you are planning to make a new deployment in the
production.
Your project is using CLJS Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations mode.
Everything seems to be working smoothly. You are performing some last E2E tests before making a release.<br>
Then, a faulty module loads.<br>
<strong>BAM!</strong> You are slapped in the face with an error something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Uncaught Error: No protocol method IMultiFn.-add-method defined for type function: function XR() { [native code] }
    at Nb ((index):964)
    at yh ((index):443)
    at (index):236
(index):143 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'j' of undefined
    at NU ((index):143)
    at login-a5a67c0fffdfa158b7220c8c2553253b645e4e2e.js:169
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You did not expect this. There were no significant new changes since the last build, and the unit tests were all
hunky-dory.<br>
Additionally, everything worked fine when using Firefox, but now the compiled code crashes on Google Chrome. 
What is going on? The release deadline is looming and you have to fix this ASAP.</p>

<p><img src="https://dev.solita.fi/img/taming-cljs-advanced-compilation/slap.png" alt="Holy Stack Trace, Batman!"><br>
<em>Holy Stack Trace, Batman!</em></p>

<p>When you build your code with the CLJS compiler, it emits JavaScript code that is compatible with the 
advanced_optimizations level of the Google Closure compiler. Then, if <code>":optimizations :advanced"</code> compiler option is
enabled, the CLJS compiler will minify the result with Closure Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations.</p>

<p>Closure Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations mode can cause some errors in your build that can be uncomfortable to
track down if you are new to Closure Compiler.
On top of that, help might be hard to find if you are trying to search the web with the error message because the function
names are all mangled up.</p>

<p>It is better to avoid these errors by keeping the Advanced Compilation mode in mind from the start of the project. 
I’ll describe some common methods to help you to avoid and resolve advanced compilation issues, and 
show how to resolve the more uncommon issue that was described in the beginning and what is the reason behind it.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-issues-with-advanced-compilation">Avoiding issues with Advanced Compilation</h2>

<p>It is recommended to use <code>":optimizations :advanced"</code> CLJS compiler option for your production builds.
You will greatly reduce your final build size by using more aggressive advanced transformations such as dead code 
removal and aggressive renaming.<br>
Read more about the advanced transformations at here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilation_levels#advanced_optimizations">Closure Compiler compilation levels</a></p>

<p>Different build tools such as lein-cljsbuild and shadow-cljs might pass different default options to Closure Compiler.
I won’t cover the differences in this blog post, but instead, I will provide some general guidelines on how to avoid
issues with advanced compilation in your project.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-externs-in-a-good-shape">Keep your externs in a good shape</h3>
<p><a href="https://clojurescript.org/guides/externs">Extern</a> is a mechanism for declaring names that should not be munged (renamed) by Closure Compiler.
When you are using external libraries, make sure that they come <a href="http://cljsjs.github.io/">bundled</a>
with externs if you are using a build tool like lein-cljsbuild. Or, provide externs files of your own if needed. 
Otherwise, Closure Compiler will munge references to externally defined symbols unintentionally during advanced 
compilation causing errors found only later when running the compiled code.</p>

<p>To add externs of your own, use a compiler option for example: <code>":externs ["externs.js"]"</code> and provide an
externs.js file in your working directory.</p>

<p>Also, It is good to use <code>":infer-externs true"</code> compiler option. This option will enable generating externs automatically
for JavaScript interop calls.</p>

<p>It is worth to know, that Closure Compiler includes externs for stable JavaScript APIs, but newer features that have an
experimental status might not be included yet. The experimental APIs change very quickly, so it makes no sense to include
them in the Closure Compiler tool. So, if you are planning to use some experimental features, make sure 
you add them to your own externs file.</p>

<p>Read more about using external JavaScript libraries from <a href="http://lukevanderhart.com/2011/09/30/using-javascript-and-clojurescript.html">here</a></p>

<h3 id="splitting-code-might-cause-name-collisions">Splitting code might cause name collisions</h3>
<p>If you are <a href="https://clojurescript.org/guides/code-splitting">splitting</a> your CLJS code into <code>:modules</code>, you might want
to use <code>:rename-prefix "..."</code> compiler option.<br>
Split modules are running in the global JavaScript scope, so they might interfere with other code loaded on the same page 
(e.g. Google Analytics) and cause unpredictable errors if name collisions occur.
When using <code>":rename-prefix"</code>, it is best to use a very short string as a prefix, for example: <code>:rename-prefix "r_"</code></p>

<p>This will increase the final (gzipped) build size slightly because now each munged global variable will be prefixed with “r_”.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-cljs-output-to-prevent-global-scope-pollution">Wrap CLJS output to prevent global scope pollution</h3>
<p>Closure Compiler will generate a lot of global variables during advanced compilation that can cause name collisions
with other code running on the same page.
If you are loading other code on the same page, and you are not splitting code into multiple modules you can utilize
 the <code>":output-wrapper true"</code> compiler option. The compiler will wrap the outputted JavaScript code with the default 
<code>"(function(){…​};)()"</code>. This will prevent polluting the global JavaScript scope and thus will prevent conflicts
with other external code.</p>

<p>However, if you have multiple modules in your project you must add a compiler option <code>:rename-prefix-namespace "..."</code>.
This enables each module to access the variables defined in the other modules it depends on.
This works similarly to the <code>":rename-prefix"</code> option. The difference is that every global variable will be now
scoped under one global variable instead of many. For example, if you use a prefix-namespace like this:
<code>:rename-prefix-namespace "P"</code>, the compiled code will refer to variable <code>"foo"</code> like <code>"p.foo"</code>. 
This option will also increase the final build size like the <code>":rename-prefix"</code> option, so think before using it.</p>

<p>There are other interesting compiler options not directly related to advanced optimizations, such as <code>":fn-invoke-direct"</code> 
which can be useful for optimizing performance-critical code. You can read more about them in CLJS 
<a href="https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-advanced-compilation-bugs">Debugging Advanced Compilation bugs</h2>

<p>If you suspect you might have a problem with advanced compilation, often hinted by errors in the browser 
console that might make no sense, it is best to approach the problem in the following way.</p>

<p>Add two additional compiler options <code>":pseudo-names true"</code> and <code>":pretty-print true"</code> for your Advanced Compilation build.
Your error will now show a readable name that corresponds to the name in the source code. 
This will help you to deduce if an extern definition is missing.</p>

<p>Additionally, if your error goes away after enabling the above-mentioned compiler options, it gives you a hint
of a possible name collision problem. When there is a problem with a munged variable name colliding with an external 
variable name, the problem disappears when the munged variable name changes, like what happens when enabling the :pseudo-names option.<br>
Often, if not fixed properly, the name collision issues can arise and then be magically “fixed” when one adds new 
changes, which in turn causes changes in munged variable names in the build output. It is best to eliminate these problems for good.</p>

<h3 id="sometimes-something-funky-can-happen">Sometimes, something funky can happen</h3>
<p>In some rare cases, there might be some advanced compilation issues that are not so easy to avoid.
Let’s go back to the beginning. 
We had an error when running our built web app in Chrome. Firefox had no issues.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Uncaught Error: No protocol method IMultiFn.-add-method defined 
                for type function: function XR() { [native code] }
    at Nb ((index):964)
    at yh ((index):443)
    at (index):236
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Stack Trace was pointing to a certain multimethod in the CLJS source code. 
At the first glance, the error might make no sense. The compiled code is trying to invoke -add-method IMultiFn protocol method 
for a function named XR. When searching for the munged <code>XR</code> in the build output, everything seems to be fine.
<code>XR</code> looks good and should work, right?
The key thing to notice in the error message is the <code>"[native code]"</code> part of <code>"function XR() { [native code] }"</code>.
This tells us, that the compiled code is trying to invoke a native browser function <code>XR</code> instead of our munged <code>XR</code>. 
By chance, the Closure Compiler named our multimethod to <code>XR</code> which happens to collide with the browser provided
<code>XR</code> function.</p>

<p>Occasionally you can encounter errors like this when using an older version of Closure Compiler.
Developers add new features to web browsers all the time. When a user upgrades his/her web browser there is a chance 
a new reserved word was added that collides with a munged variable.</p>

<p>It turns out, XR is a reserved word added by the WebXR platform API. When the error occurred “XR” was added in the newest 
version of Google Chrome, but not yet in Firefox. Newer Closure Compiler versions take this into account by providing
an extern for it. It is not always easy to upgrade the ClojureScript version and thus the Closure Compiler used in a project.<br>
In that case, you can fix the problem fast by adding a custom extern of your own:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// externs.js</span>

<span>var</span> <span>XR</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Many times, Advanced Compilation issues with CLJS are easy to avoid with proper preparation. On rare occasions, some
stranger errors can happen. Thus, test your builds with the current browser versions and learn to debug advanced 
compilation issues swiftly to prevent wasting precious time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>QUIC is a new protocol designed by Google to make the web faster and more efficient. It’s on by default in Google Chrome and used by a growing list of websites. Unfortunately, most, if not all, firewalls do not currently recognize QUIC traffic as ‘web’ traffic, therefore it is not inspected, logged or reported on, leaving a gaping hole in your network’s security.</p><p>This article describes how QUIC works, its current consequences on network security and reporting, and how you can resolve the issues associated with QUIC.</p><p>Google has always been obsessed with speed and over the years they&nbsp;have made numerous efforts to make the web more efficient and more performant. The new kid on the block for performance improvement is a protocol named <a href="https://www.chromium.org/quic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QUIC</a>. Where <a href="https://www.chromium.org/spdy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPDY</a> and <a href="https://http2.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP/2 </a>were iterative improvements on HTTP over TCP, QUIC is a different approach using <em>UDP</em> as the transport protocol.</p><p>QUIC is essentially HTTP/2 over UDP which is a new layer4 protocol.</p><p>At the time of writing this article, QUIC is still ‘experimental’, but is enabled by default in Google Chrome, and can be enabled in Opera 16. Other browsers will surely follow once the protocol is finalized. It is implemented on all Google web properties such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Drive etc, and is being adopted by a <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-quic/all/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing list of other websites</a>.</p><p>The issue is not with the protocol or the technology itself.&nbsp;The supposed upside of QUIC is that it makes web communications more efficient and faster.&nbsp;The problem is that it is not supported by security appliances such as firewalls yet, and has therefore inadvertently created a security hole for many organizations.</p><p>Most firewalls have extensive functionality when dealing with HTTP and HTTPS traffic. In most architectures, when HTTP traffic is detected, it is passed on to a web protection module that performs web filtering, deep packet inspection etc. HTTP traffic&nbsp;gets special treatment because the firewalls can interpret the traffic from Layer4 up to layer 7. This special treatment&nbsp;includes malware scanning and in most cases, enhanced reporting.</p><p>QUIC uses the traditional HTTP ports of 80 and 443 but that is where the similarities end. The supporting browsers and servers support this new protocol and are able to process it&nbsp;as web traffic, but the network device in between cannot determine the application protocol and switches to treating it like any generic layer 4 UDP traffic.</p><p>QUIC traffic is therefore not scrutinized as it should be and it is not forwarded to the firewall’s web protection features.</p><p>The images below compare the Wireshark capture of traditional HTTPS TLS traffic with QUIC.</p></div>]]>

At least eight million companies advertise on the social media platform.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&nbsp;has said the company will change its policies to prohibit hate speech in its advertisements. Under the company's new policies, Facebook will ban ads that claim people from a specific race, ethnicity, nationality, caste, gender, sexual orientation or immigration origin are a threat to the physical safety or health of anyone else.</p>  <p>Still, the boycott doesn't seem to be letting up. Facebook's stock slid by more than&nbsp;eight per cent on Friday, erasing&nbsp;$56 billion US from its&nbsp;market value. Zuckerberg is estimated to have&nbsp;lost more than $7 billion of his personal net worth, and was also knocked down from third&nbsp;place to fourth on the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>.&nbsp;</p>    <p>But those that have joined the boycott represent just a&nbsp;small fraction of Facebook's advertisers and&nbsp;revenue.</p>  <p>"To&nbsp;affect real, significant change with Facebook's content moderating rules and all related issues, probably thousands of major brands would have to pull their ad budget for a month or more. Most likely, major brands are just not going to do that when it impacts their own bottom line," Smith said.</p>  <p>The top 100&nbsp;advertisers on Facebook platform represent only six per cent of their total ad revenue,&nbsp;said Beth Ellen Egan, an&nbsp;associate professor of advertising at Syracuse University.</p>  <h2>Biggest advertisers haven't joined boycott</h2>  <p>Roughly eight million companies of all sizes advertise on the social media platform, and some of the biggest advertisers, including Walmart, Disney and Procter &amp; Gamble, have not joined the boycott.</p>  <p>"They're not taking that big of a hit overall," Egan said.</p>  <p>Indeed, Dennis Yu, co-author of <em>Facebook Nation</em> and CTO of the digital marketing company&nbsp;BlitzMetrics, said in the last five to six years, despite all the controversies, Facebook has&nbsp;been on a steady upward&nbsp;trajectory&nbsp;—&nbsp;not just in its stock price&nbsp;but in its total revenue.</p>  <p>"Every year, there's something like this that happens. And people predict the gloom and doom and death of Facebook," he said. "I think [this boycott] is no different."</p>  <p><span><blockquote lang="en"><p>We stand in solidarity with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NAACP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NAACP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ADL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ADL&lt;/a&gt; and others in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopHateForProfit?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StopHateForProfit&lt;/a&gt; campaign. We believe we all have a responsibility to create a truly inclusive society and are actively engaging with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to seek meaningful change.

And according to market research, that's dropped dramatically over the last year, he said.</p>  <p>"So the risk is that bit by bit, the people will say, 'Am I going to go on Facebook?&nbsp;No, I'm going to go on the next new one coming along.'"</p>  <p>Meanwhile, some of those companies boycotting the social media platform will likely also take a hit, particularly smaller companies.</p>  <h2>Smaller companies benefit from ROI</h2>  <p>The reason so much revenue comes to Facebook through smaller advertisers is that those advertisers see a swift return on investment, Egan said.</p>  <p>"They start advertising, and there's an immediate impact on their sales," she&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Facebook — as well as Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012 — are essential for millions of small and medium-sized businesses that advertise on the platforms, said Smith. And with the inordinate amount of data Facebook collects on users, advertising on its family of apps is the most targeted traffic ad dollars can buy.</p>    <p>According&nbsp;to Statista, a statistics portal for market data, there were 2.6 billion monthly active users on Facebook&nbsp;as of the first quarter of 2020, making it the biggest social network worldwide.</p>  <p><em>"</em>That's where the consumers are.&nbsp;You have to be where consumers are," said Yu. He&nbsp;said he believes Facebook can have a "tremendous" impact on sales for some companies, but that can be difficult to measure, when consumers are being exposed to other forms of messaging for a product.</p>  <p>But the impact on the more well-known brands who withdraw their ads&nbsp;from Facebook will likely be minor as they rely upon word of mouth, he said.</p>  <p>Smith said major companies like Coca-Cola are unlikely to see a revenue hit, since their ads on Facebook are focused more on brand awareness.</p>  <p>"It's not like people click on an ad and immediately buy a Coca-Cola," she said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>I noticed an interesting thing with a certain visitor after posting a blog post to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/LearnSoftwareEngineeringAO/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>The IP address that the Facebook crawler uses to visit the site on callback to get meta-data has a custom IPv6 sub-range.</p>
<pre title="">IPv6: 2a03:2880:ff:1a::face:b00c
Host: fwdproxy-prn-026.fbsv.net
</pre>
<p>Notice <code>2a03:2880:ff:1a::<strong>face:b00c</strong></code></p>
<h2>How this is done</h2>
<p>The IPv4 addresses could only use regular integers (decimal); numbers between 0 and 9.</p>
<p>However, IPv6 can use any and all hexadecimal; 0-9 and a-f.</p>
<p>This means that when allocating a sub-range, they chose the <code>face</code> and <code>b00c</code> as they are all greater or equal to <code>a</code> and less than or equal to <code>f</code>.</p>
<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>If you know about, or see other companies that are doing something similar, please tell me about it!</p>

				<h2 id="an-insight-into-the-working-of-ml-based-resume-parsing-technology"><strong><em>An Insight into the working of ML-based Resume Parsing Technology</em></strong></h2><figure><img src="https://skillate.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Cover--1-.svg"></figure><p>Recruiters have been screening resumes manually for a long time now. They read through every candidate resume and evaluate them on the basis of skills, knowledge, abilities and other desired factors. However, it would take a long time for the recruiter to go through each resume in detail. So, in practical world recruiters are forced into doing one of the two things They go through limited resumes, scan them thoroughly and take a pick out of them. They go through all (or most) of them, take a minimal amount of time to review them (some claim as low as 6 seconds), and pick whichever resumes can hook them. In both the cases, organizations lose out on quality candidates and recruiters waste their time and effort. So, How can one avoid it? This is where Resume Parsers come into the picture.</p><h2 id="what-is-resume-parsing">What is Resume Parsing?</h2><p>Resume Parsing, formally speaking, is the conversion of a free-form CV/resume document into structured information — suitable for storage, reporting, and manipulation by a computer.</p><p>Resume parsers analyze a resume, extract the desired information, and insert the information into a database with a unique entry for each candidate. Once the resume has been analyzed, a recruiter can search the database for keywords and phrases and get a list of relevant candidates.</p><h2 id="so-why-is-resume-parsing-difficult"><strong>So</strong>, Why is Resume Parsing Difficult?</h2><p>Almost everyone tries to use a unique template to put information on their CV, in order to stand out. For a human, reading these CVs or a job ad is an easy task. These semi-structured documents are usually separated into sections and have layouts that make it easy to quickly identify important information.<br></p><p>In contrast, for a computer, the task of extracting information becomes difficult with every change of format. Generally speaking here are the few kinds of resume parser available in the market:</p><ol><li><strong>Key-word based resume parser:</strong> A keyword-based resume parser works by identifying words, phrases, and simple patterns in the text of the CV/Resume and then applying simple heuristic algorithms to the text they find around these words.</li><li><strong>Grammar-based resume parser:</strong> The Grammar-based resume parsers contain an enormous number of grammatical rules that seek to understand the context of every word in the CV/resume. These same grammars also combine words and phrases together to make complex structures that capture the meaning of every sentence in the resume.</li><li><strong>Statistical Parsers:</strong> This type of parser attempts to apply numerical models of text to identify structure in a CV/Resume. Like grammar-based parsers, they can distinguish between different contexts of the same word or phrase and can also capture a wide variety of structures such as addresses, timelines, etc.<br></li></ol><p>Without delving deep into the benefits and limitations of each of them, let us talk about the bottom line- accuracy. Most resume parsers use any of the above technologies to provide close to 60% accurate results in real-world scenarios. However, when compared with human accuracy of 96%, they are definitely lagging behind. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--> <img src="https://skillate.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Accuracy-stat-1.svg" alt="remove hiring bias" width="800px">  
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>There are many ways to write dates and numerous job titles and skills appear every month. Someone’s name can be a company name (e.g. Harvey Nash) or even an IT skill (e.g. Cassandra). The only way a CV parser can deal with this is to “understand” the context in which words occur and the relationship between them. That is why a rule-based parser will quickly run into two big limitations:</p><p> 1) the rules will get quite complex to account for exceptions and ambiguity and, </p><p>2) the coverage will be limited.</p><h3 id="so-how-to-solve-the-problems-with-resume-parsing">So, how to solve the problems with Resume Parsing?</h3><h2 id="ml-based-resume-parsing">ML-based Resume Parsing</h2><p>The problem of Resume Parsing can be broken into two major subproblems — 1. Text Extraction, and 2. Information Extraction. A state of the art resume parser needs to solve both these problems with the highest possible accuracy.</p><h3 id="how-does-ml-based-resume-parsing-works">How does ML-based Resume Parsing Works?</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img src="https://skillate.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Solution-textExtraction.svg" alt="text extraction solution" width="200px"> 
<br>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Almost everyone tries to use a unique template to put information on their CV. Even the templates that might seem indistinguishable to the human eye, are processed differently by the computer. This creates the possibility of hundreds of thousands of templates in which resumes are written worldwide. Not all templates are straightforward to read. For eg. One can find tables, graphics, columns in a resume, and every such entity needs to be read in a different manner. Therefore it is easy to conclude that rule-based parsers do not stand a chance and an intelligent algorithm is required to extract text in a meaningful manner from raw documents (pdf, doc, docx, etc).</p><p><strong><strong>Solution</strong></strong></p><p>Any parser that aims to become a state-of-the-art technology in its niche needs to explore several libraries- pdf, doc, docx, etc. However, a single type of algorithm is not good enough to extract all these document formats. <br></p><p>A new classification system that segregates the resumes into different types, based on their template, and tackles each type differently, is the way forward. Some of the types are straightforward, but most of them (like the ones that contain tables, partitions, etc) require higher-order intelligence from the software. For such complex types, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) along with Deep NLP algorithms on top can help in extracting the required text.<br></p><p>For every problem, there is a hard way and a smart way. OCR is a very generic problem which has been researched upon and solved by the biggest tech companies in the world. Most of the technology is open source as well! Therefore, rather than building a deep learning model from scratch for OCR and NLP, the smart way was to use the power of open source and deploy an off the shelf model for the task.<br></p><p>With the help of classification algorithms to segregate the resumes, some modern players have been able to amalgamate different technologies and obtain the best of all, to build highly accurate and fast text extraction methods.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img src="https://skillate.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Solution-InfoExtraction.svg" alt="info exchange solution" width="200px"> 
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>A typical resume can be considered as a collection of information related to — Experience, Educational Background, Skills, and Personal Details of a person. These details can be present in various ways, or not present at all.<br></p><p>Keeping up with the vocabulary used in resumes is a big challenge. A resume consists of company names, institutions, degrees, etc. which can be written in several ways. For eg. Skillate:: Skillate.com — Both these words refer to the same company but will be treated as different words by a machine. Moreover, every day new companies and institute names come up, and thus it is almost impossible to keep the software’s vocabulary updated.</p><p>Consider the following two statements:</p><p><em>'Currently working as a Data Scientist at &lt;Amazon&gt;’ a</em>nd, <br><em>‘Worked in a project for the client Amazon ’</em></p><p>In the first statement, “Amazon” will be tagged as a company as the statement is about working in the organization. <br>But the latter “Amazon” should be considered as a normal word and not as a company. It is evident that the same word can have different meanings, based on its usage.</p><p><strong> <strong>Solution</strong></strong><br>The above challenges make it clear that statistical methods like Naive Bayes are bound to fail here, as they are severely handicapped by their vocabulary and fail to account for different meanings of words. So can this seemingly hard problem be cracked? Deep Learning can do all the hard work for us! This approach is called Deep Information Extraction.</p><p>A thorough analysis of the challenges posed makes it evident that the root of the problem here is understanding the context of a word.</p><p>Consider the following statement<br>‘2000–2008: Professor at Universitatea de Stat din Moldova’</p><p>It is quite likely that you wouldn’t have understood the meaning of all the words in the above statement, but even if you don’t understand the exact meaning of these words, you can probably guess that since “professor” is a job title, “Universitatea de Stat din Moldova” is most likely the name of an organization.</p><p>Now consider one more example, with two statements:<br>‘2000–2008: Professor at IIT Kanpur’</p><p>‘B.Tech in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur’</p><p>Here, IIT Kanpur should be treated as an Employer Organisation in the former statement and as an Educational Institution in the later. We can differentiate between the two meanings of ‘IIT Kanpur’ here by observing the context. The first statement has ‘Professor’ which is a Job Title, indicating that IIT Kanpur be treated as a Professional Organisation. The second one has a degree and major mentioned, which point towards IIT Kanpur being tagged as an Educational Organisation.<br>Applying Deep Learning to solve Information Extraction greatly helped us to effectively model the context of every word in a resume.</p><p>To be specific, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the algorithm that deep learning can be applied to, for information extraction in resumes.</p><p>“NER is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into predefined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, etc, based on context.”</p><p>Through the examples mentioned above, it should be clear that NER is a very domain-specific problem, and thus it is required to build a deep learning model from scratch.</p><h3 id="building-the-deep-learning-model">Building the Deep learning model</h3><p>For building a model from scratch, the first step is to decide the model architecture. Research papers and other literature on NLP indicate using &nbsp;LSTMs (a type of Neural Network) in the model, as it takes into account the context of a word in a statement. Once the entire architecture is agreed upon, one needs to start working on curating a dataset for model training and evaluation. This step is the most cumbersome process and needs to be thought out from a very early stage.</p><p>One of the most important things to consider is the data on which the system is being trained. The data needs to be unlabelled and should not cause more ambiguity. Online tools that can help in collaborating the manual annotation efforts within the team are also of big help.</p><p>Small POCs on shorter …</p></section></div>

            <p>“Our results indicate that public immunity to COVID-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested,” says Professor <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/hanlju">Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren</a> at the Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, and co-senior author. “If this is the case, it is of course very good news from a public health perspective.”</p>

<p>T-cell analyses are more complicated to perform than antibody tests and at present are therefore only done in specialised laboratories, such as that at the Center for Infectious Medicine at Karolinska Institutet.</p>

<p>“Larger and more longitudinal studies must now be done on both T cells and antibodies to understand how long-lasting the immunity is and how these different components of COVID-19 immunity are related,” says Marcus Buggert.</p>

<p>The results are so new that they have not yet undergone peer review ahead of publication in a scientific journal. Pending such review, the article has been published on a preprint server, bioRxiv (see box).</p>

<p>The study was financed by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Nordstjernan AB, the Swedish Research Council, Karolinska Institutet, the Swedish Society for Medical Research, the Jeansson Foundations, the Åke Wiberg Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Magnus Bergvall Foundation, the Hedlund Foundation, the Lars Hierta Foundation, the Swedish Physicians against AIDS foundation, the Jonas Söderquist Foundation, the Clas Groschinsky Memorial Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust.&nbsp;The authors report no conflicts of interest or patents associated with the results of the study.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Every year a few thousand startups are incubated in Silicon Valley. Few of them will succeed; the rest will decay or outright fail. Yet there always seems to be room for one more billion-dollar company. Besides appearing seemingly out of nowhere, the most radically successful startups are also the most unpredictable ones. What force seems to create these massive sources of wealth that initially look like “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bad ideas</a>”&nbsp;to everybody beside their founders?</p>
<p>You may be tempted to say “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Swan</a>,” and you would be correct; however, beside simple acceptance of extraordinarily rare random events, there is deeper mathematical influence over a process that constantly spawns new opportunities. Understanding that influence will help any startup founder or investor to improve his business insights. To understand these concepts better we will make a long journey that will touch upon very foundations of logic and mathematics .</p>

<p>I usually find time to look at about two hundred startups every year. Referrals arrive from other investors, startup founders I mentor or via the massive firehose of demo days at YCombinator &amp; 500 Startups. As you can imagine, this creates an overwhelming supply of startups and innovative ideas to look into. Every startup presents the ultimate question: Is it worth it to invest your time and money? Or is it a waste of both? There is never enough time to dig deep enough into any single startup to understand it fully. Making an investment is not an easy or obvious decision. Yet, over the years, I started to notice certain meta-patterns common to all startups, the patterns that give a tantalizing premonitions on their chances of success or failure. The specifics of an industry or investment cycle might change, yet these patterns remain the same in every decade. I see them as two big groups of patterns: <strong><em>human</em></strong> patterns and <strong><em>mathematical</em></strong> patterns.</p>
<p><img src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math.png" alt="" width="150" srcset="https://skibinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math.png 263w, https://skibinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px">Human patterns emerge from our personal traits. Weather a startup will overcome its human-related challenge is determined by what a person or a team can succeed or fail at. The telltale sign is when the outcome will be determined by quality or quantity of personal efforts. What you typically read in Silicon Valley startup blogs would be all about such human patterns. It will be hundreds of topics covering which software language to use, how to pick founders, how to operate the company, how to build a product, how to build software, what is company culture etc. It’s all good content, yet it only addresses patterns driven by human traits, and thus is only half of the equation.</p>
<p>What you rarely hear about is “mathematical” patterns. These patterns emerge from objective nature of the reality where a startup must operate. The market dynamics, the ecosystem of industries they find themselves in, the governing trends of technological progress. As soon as a startup starts operating in the real world, the vast majority of factors will be outside of a startup direct control or even influence, while having absolutely dominating impact on that startup eventual outcome. Beside now legendary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Swan</a><a href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>1</sup></a> making big waves since 2006, there is almost no information on the mathematical fundamentals of startup formation and investing. Usually all you get is a non-actionable statement like “<i>90% of all startups fail</i>” after which the author promptly moves back to human factors, which are much easier to understand and analyze.</p>
<p>To help develop our mathematical intuition we will turn to one of the most profound mathematical results, provided by the legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a>: <b>The First Incompleteness Theorem</b>. To most it is a seemingly dry statement on the <i>completeness</i> and <i>consistency</i> of <i>formal systems</i>. On a deeper level, however, there is an interesting commonality between the mathematics of incompleteness and startup disruption. It’s critical to understanding the dynamics how startups get born, get big or fail, and finally how the few survivors become legacy companies. Showing this deep connection between mathematics of incompleteness of formal systems and startups will be the purpose of this essay.</p>

<blockquote><p>“[My] own work no longer means much, I came to the Institute merely…to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel.”</p>
<p><em>Albert Einstein</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div id="attachment_839"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-839" src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gande-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></p><p id="caption-attachment-839">Albert Einstein and Kurt Godel taking a walk.</p></div>
<p>It is surprising that Gödel’s famous theorem is all but unknown in the startup world. Thinking&nbsp; of all the mathematical knowledge that has direct impact on computer science, software and startups I would be hard pressed to come up with anything more powerful than Gödel’s <i>Incompleteness Theorem</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Y Combinator</a> is famously named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Y Combinator</a>, one of the best-known fixed-point combinators used to construct certain recursive functions. Yet who was the first to define and use a recursive functions? Gödel. Further, the proof that fixed points exist at all is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">side effect</a> implicit of his work. Y Combinator is direct descendant<a href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Gödel’s proof.</p>
<p><img src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/turing-150x150.png" width="150" height="150"></p>
<p>Consider another cornerstone of computer science, such as Alan Turing’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halting Problem</a>. He created that theorem when working at Princeton, right at the time when discussions about Gödel recent results dominated the institute mathematical debates. Turing’s proof is a continuation of Gödel’s work<a href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Kleene, Turing and Shannon were all standing on the shoulders of the giant – gnome sized Gödel – when they were following his groundbreaking proof and inventing modern computer science. We will review Halting Problem in more details later in this essay.</p>
<p>When you truly grasp the implications of what Gödel actually proved, it will be like opening a Pandora’s box&nbsp; of wonderful insights. The implications of the theorem go far beyond just logic and math. Answers to the most sought after questions such as: <em>Why can everything be made better? Why are so many startups possible and will always be possible? Why things we build tend to get more complex over time? Why does civilization always has room to improve?</em></p>
<p>To answers these questions, and &nbsp;see how all these things are connected mathematically you need to understand Gödel incompleteness.</p>
<h2>A taste of things to come</h2>
<p>Naturally, there is a reason why Gödel theorem is still relatively unknown outside of mathematical circles. There are few big problems. First of all, <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf#page=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gödel’s proof</a> is <b>hard</b>. Not “<i>learn new computer language</i>” hard, not “<i>make an iPhone game</i>” hard, really, really, <b>really hard</b>. Gödel did not make the task of understanding his theorems easy. Being famously introverted, he preferred the logic of his proofs to do all his speaking for him. Even mathematical education is not much help here. For example, Gödel offers the following preview, a “sketch proof”, what he called an “<i>an intuition</i>” for the real proof to follow.</p>
<blockquote><p>We will define a class <b>K</b> of natural numbers as follows: <b>K</b> = { <i>n</i> ∈ IN | ¬ <i>provable(R<b><sub>n</sub></b>(n)) </i>}&nbsp;(where <i>provable(x)</i> means x is a provable formula). K is the set of numbers <i>n</i> where the formula <i>R<b><sub>n</sub></b>(n) </i>that you get when you insert <i>n</i> into its own formula <i>R<b><sub>n</sub></b></i> is improvable. Since all the concepts used for this definition are themselves definable in PM, so is the compound concept <b>K</b>, i.e. there is a class-sign S such that the formula S(n) states that n∈<b>K</b>. As a class-sign, S is identical with a specific <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b></i>, i.e. we have S ⇔ <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b></i>&nbsp;for a specific natural number <strong>q</strong>. We will now prove that the theorem <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> is undecidable within PM. We can understand this by simply plugging in the&nbsp;definitions:&nbsp;<i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> ⇔ <i>S(q)</i> ⇔q ∈ K⇔<b> ¬</b><i>(R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q))</i>, in other words, <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> states “<i>I am improvable.</i>“</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless you are an active mathematician, reading and intuitively understanding his proof would be next to impossible. Just in case here is the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof again</a> in case you enjoy sharpening your mathematical teeth against this amazing whetstone of logic<a href="#footnote-4" id="refmark-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The second, even bigger problem is that understanding the proof will not help you much. Gödel’s logic is so alien, so strange that even understanding the formal deductions won’t help you understand all the implications of that phenomenon. Gödel’s proof is like a map with “<i>X marks the spot</i>”, yet on that map every border connecting it with our reality is torn away. You have no idea what particular area that map refers to. X is there, treasure is certainly there, but how the heck do you <b>practically </b>use it? In ironic self-referential self-validation Gödel’s formal proof cannot be understood formally. It requires an intuition leap that will unlock its secrets. And after you make that leap your perspective on everything related to startups and innovations will change. That is the insight we will try to develop<a href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<h2>The Theorem</h2>
<blockquote><p>Gödel’s theorem is rapidly becoming accepted as being the fundamental contribution to the foundation of&nbsp; mathematics – probably the <b>most fundamental</b> ever to be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Penrose</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly has Gödel proving? In modern language, simplified statement will be the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any … <strong><em>formal system</em></strong> capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both <strong><em>consistent</em></strong> and <strong><em>complete</em></strong>. In particular, for any consistent, … formal system that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is <strong><em>true, but not provable</em></strong> in theory</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s work our way through that, since most of the concepts here are actually fairly easy to understand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Formal systems</em></strong> are simple things. They are just collections of <b>axioms</b> and <b>rules</b> on how to manipulate them. For example, lets make a few axioms about numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number 0 exists</li>
<li>Each number has a successor that is a number. One follows zero, two follows one, etc.</li>
<li>Two different numbers can not have the same successor</li>
<li>… more axioms if you wish …</li>
</ul>

<p>If we continue writing down such “self evident” axioms, we can arrive at certain set of axioms, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peano axioms</a>. These axioms and few rules of manipulations would constitute the simple arithmetic you learned in kindergarten if not earlier.</p>
<p>Axioms and rules about how axioms can be manipulated to produce derived statements is what constitute a <i>formal system</i>. Systems can be very different from each other. You …</p></div></div>

  <article>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Updated on <time datetime="2020-06-30T00:00:00+00:00">30 June 2020</time>.</strong>
      </p>
    

    <p>Google Analytics is perhaps <em>the</em> analytics platform of our time. But should it be? It’s many features and the free plan is what made it popular, but its invasion of user privacy should not be overlooked. Here are some good alternatives for 2020.</p>

<p>First, I want to mention privacy-oriented self-hosted solutions. Their Open Source nature provides you an option to host them yourself instead of sending the data to someone else. Second, we look at some of the viable closed-source alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>

<h3 id="plausible">Plausible</h3>

<p>I learned about <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a> just recently, but they deserve to be on top of this list for me. Their platform is completely Open Source on GitHub under the MIT license. I personally also like that it’s written in <a href="https://nts.strzibny.name/tag/elixir">Elixir</a>.</p>

<p>As they say themselves:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Analytics collects a lot of personal data and it is a potential liability for your site. Many website owners fail to do this, but you should and must disclose to your visitors your use of Google Analytics to track them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plausible gets you cover if you need to comply with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR.</p>

<p>Their cheapest plan starts at $6 a month and for $12 a month you get 100k pageviews across unlimited sites. They also publish a <a href="https://plausible.nolt.io/roadmap">roadmap</a> to keep you up-to-date with what’s coming.</p>

<p>If I needed a JavaScript-based analytics today, Plausible would be my first choice.</p>

<h3 id="goatcounter">GoatCounter</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a> is another great option for privacy-oriented analytics not tracking users personal data. As Plausible is fully Open Source licensed under EUPL. The platform is written in Go.</p>

<p>A nice touch is a free plan with 100k pageviews/month for non-commercial use. A commercial plan with unlimited sites, custom domain, and 500k pageviews limit sets you back by $15.</p>

<h3 id="open-web-analytics">Open Web Analytics</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.openwebanalytics.com/">Open Web Analytics</a> is an Open Source PHP-based web analytics software licensed under GPL. OWA has one strong advantage that puts it ahead of the others. Apart from implementing simple analytics, it does give you heatmaps as well.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the author does not offer a hosted variant, so you are on your own. If you are serving your static sites from platforms such as GitHub Pages, you probably won’t be setting up a separate server just to run OWA.</p>

<h3 id="offen">Offen</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.offen.dev/">Offen</a> brands themselves as “fair web analytics” and unlike the rest of the services on this list users themselves are in complete control of their data with their “opt-in only data collection”.</p>

<p>With Offen your users can see all the data that you have about them. All user data is also only stored for 6 months and then automatically deleted. This design probably led to no option for exporting any of this data.</p>

<p>Offen is only available as self-hosted with code on <a href="https://github.com/offen/offen">GitHub</a>. Written in Go.</p>

<h3 id="matomo">Matomo</h3>

<p><a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, known to many as Piwik (original project name), is probably the closest self-hosted Google Analytics alternative. Unlike the alternatives mentioned above Matomo comes packed with features like heatmaps, session recordings, A/B testing, visitor profiles, and more. If you cannot live without these advanced features, Matomo is a good choice.</p>

<p>Matomo is a PHP-based analytics platform with a hosted cloud offering starting at €19 a month for 50k pageviews and 3 websites. Some advanced features such as search engine keywords performance are available for self-hosted variant at additional cost. WordPress integration will be plus for many.</p>

<h3 id="kindmetrics">Kindmetrics</h3>

<p><a href="https://kindmetrics.io/open-source-analytics">Kindmetrics</a> is another new addition on the self-hosted analytics list, currenctly in beta and bit off radar. Interestingly enough <a href="https://github.com/kindmetrics/kindmetrics">written in</a> <a href="https://nts.strzibny.name/tag/crystal">Crystal</a> language on the backend and with <a href="https://nts.strzibny.name/tag/stimulus-js">Stimulus.js</a> framework on the front-end.</p>

<p>Kindmetrics is free during beta but will later offer a 14-day free trial and plans starting at €6 a month for 50k pageviews.</p>

<h2 id="hosted">Hosted</h2>

<h3 id="fathom-analytics">Fathom Analytics</h3>

<p><a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a> started as an Open Source project and the original v1 version is still available on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom">Fathom Lite</a>.  The main issue of the Fathom lite is the use of cookies <del>which requires a user consent under GDPR</del> <ins>Fathom Lite is actually GDPR compliant.</ins> This most likely leaves you to look into hosted Fathom v2.</p>

<p>With starting price of $14 a month you not only get web analytics for 100k pageviews but also recently added uptime monitoring with SMS, email, Telegram and Slack notifications. All plans include unlimited websites.</p>

<p>Another specialty of Fathom is a very generous affiliate program. You’ll get a 25% lifetime commission of all payments of the customers you bring. This very blog is currently using Fathom. And no, no affiliate links were inserted in the links above :).</p>

<h3 id="simple-analytics">Simple Analytics</h3>

<p><a href="http://simpleanalytics.io/">Simple Analytics</a> was my original second contender for the analytics of this blog. The $19 a month starting plan with 100k pageviews is on the more expensive side, but their yearly deal gets you a better price than Fathom at just $9 a month.</p>

<p>What I also really liked about Simple Analytics is the non-aggressive “fair use” policy. They would only upgrade your plan if you overreach your monthly limit for 2 months in the row.</p>

<h3 id="metrical">Metrical</h3>

<p><a href="https://metrical.xyz/">Metrical</a> is a new kid in the space of simple privacy-oriented analytics.</p>

<p>Metrical is currently free and in beta at the time of writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are currently in Beta testing, and you can register for free and have up to 2 websites and 50.000 visits every month.
If you want more, you can upgrade to 7$/Month or 50$/Year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their paid plan will give you 50k pageviews for $7 a month which is an awesome deal for people starting up and trying to get their projects up and running as 50k gets you far enough.</p>

        <p>We can divide communication into two channels:<br>
<strong>Synchronous</strong> (Sync) - all parties are actively taking part in the conversation right now. For example, physical meetings or a video call<br>
<strong>Asynchronous</strong> (Async) - one party writes or records a message and has to wait for responses for an indefinite amount of time. For example, sending an email or posting on a discussion board.<br>
Conversations on sync channels are usually recorded only in the heads of the participants where async channels are a more permanent medium.<br>
Chat applications are a bit of a grey area; they allow for synchronous communication, but often you have to wait for a response. Because of the inherently fleeting nature of real-time chats, I consider them to be synchronous.</p>
<p>In the workplace, often conversations will revolve around making a decision - for instance, choosing between various options. These conversations, ideally, can be divided into three stages.<br>
Each stage will involve the usage of both synchronous and asynchronous channels. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialisation</li>
<li>Discussion</li>
<li>Decision</li>
</ol>

<p>This stage starts with someone writing down a proposal, an introduction to the subject, and it may also include some initial research done by the person writing it. It can be a detailed post, or it can be simply an email invitation with a short description of the subject. Follow up with brainstorming to gather opinions; it’s not a time for decisions yet - we are just stimulating the conversation and collecting ideas. After a brainstorming session, one person writes a follow-up post summarising what you have discussed and all the ideas mentioned, including rejected ideas as well for completeness. Someone good at taking notes will be very helpful here.<br>
We have here both synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>

<p>Now people have been familiarised with the subject. It is time to digest it. I’m sure everyone has experienced clarity after a night of sleep - that is why this stage may take a few days or even weeks, assuming there is no particular time pressure. At this stage, people should mostly use async channels to communicate with the whole group. Sync channels should be seen as supplementary to be used when you want to avoid spamming the async channel with the back and forth of short questions and answers. I recommend adding a summary of such conversations in the async channel later.<br>
Again, we employed both synchronous and asynchronous channels.</p>

<p>When enough time has passed - maybe because there is a deadline, or the discussion is slowing down, or agreement seems to have been reached - we head back to a meeting room to make the decision. Ideally, there should be no more new ideas introduced at this point. In terms of how you pick the winning idea that is another subject. It could be a democratic vote, a manager/leader decision, or dice roll. After the meeting, you write a summary.<br>
Once more, both synchronous and asynchronous communication is involved here.</p>

<p>Writing and speaking with clarity can both be difficult, but they are vital skills and need to be worked on, no excuses here. But if you are bad at either and finding it hard to improve by yourself, then try to find someone good at it and work together.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>If you are bad at writing, find someone who does it well. Write a draft with what you want to say, and ask them to review it, improve it based on their feedback. Rinse, repeat until it is ready to be shown to a broader audience.</p>
<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>
<p>If you are bad at speaking, then try to write down all the points you want to say first - remember it is ok to read notes in the meetings. You can practice speaking by finding someone who likes to have small debates and discuss opinions with them in a one-on-one setting, so you don’t stress because of group pressure.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>For me, the writing was always my weaker point of the two. In school and university, I always struggled with reaching the required word count. Today I know that they taught me writing the wrong way. It is not about the word count. If you know what you want to say the words will come by themselves. Write a draft first as if you were talking, then review and improve it. There are a lot of books, blogs, and courses that share tips on how to improve your writing. One point they all agree on is this: write something, anything, and improve later.<br>
My speaking skills improved thanks to a volunteering organisation I was involved with in high school. During my university years, I had a job in customer service that helped a lot as well. When I started working as a software engineer, my problem was lack of confidence and impostor syndrome. I was questioning myself in my mind all the time, which made it hard to take part in conversations. That one is hard to solve, and I don’t have any suggestions here. I overcame it at least partially thanks to my team members at <a href="https://twitter.com/fr_devs">Football Radar</a> showing recognition for my skills.</p>

<p>It is not a case of async versus sync communication. As with many things, it is not one or the other. Each approach has its use cases, and they complement each other. Use them together at the right time to derive the most benefit.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I have spent my last 3 months building&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pipfeed.com/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">PipFeed.com</a>. PipFeed is an A.I. powered curated reading app. Think of it as when Pocket met Medium. I am an ex-AWS engineer and my main language of choice is JAVA but I can code in PHP, python, js etc.</p><p>The backend for PipFeed is in JAVA with a few services in python, node.js &amp; PHP. In January 2020 I learned Flutter and built the mobile app for PipFeed using it. This is my first experience building a mobile app and here are some of the learnings that I would like to share with you all.</p><h2>1) Have a CI/CD</h2><p>For mobile apps, it is extremely important to have a CI/CD. We use <a href="http://codemagic.io/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">codemagic</a>, it ties up nicely with our Flutter ecosystem. Mobile apps need a lot more work to release like signing, bundle, etc etc.</p><p>P.S. I still don’t have a CI/CD for my backends and I deploy my AWS backend from my laptop using Cloudformation templates.</p><h2>2) Mobile apps crash a lot</h2><p>As compared to websites, backend code, and stand-alone software, mobile apps fail and throw exceptions a lot more. There are all sorts of errors like network errors, some image fails to load etc.</p><p>To make the app stable, we had to add a lot of exception handling, null checks, and mostly retries in almost all network calls.</p><h2>3) Distributed logs</h2><p>We use <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Sentry</a> &amp; Crashlytics to manage and catch all our exceptions &amp; logs. We really love the service and it has a nice pricing model. We have now integrated our backend in JAVA with Sentry.</p><h2>4) Analytics is everything</h2><p>We use a mix of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">firebase</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">mixpanel</a> &amp; AWS cloudwatch for our analytics. Analytics on mobile is a bit harder as everything you want to track requires a code change. Also, that would mean a lot of network calls for each event.</p><p>We found a way and moved the analytics to our backend system. So on an action like read, like, comment, etc when there is a database update, we trigger lambdas using AWS DDB stream and send metrics from there to other services. This helps us reduce the overall number of network requests and makes it easier to have the logic out of the mobile app.</p><h2>5) It’s so hard to A/B test</h2><p>As compared to any other software A/B testing is really hard on mobile. With websites you can have a version that people will see when they visit your URL with mobile your users will have a whole mix of versions, devices, screen-sizes and a lot more variables. So we are still figuring out how to do this.</p><p>Implementing A/B testing is harder in mobile as we need to create two separate code blocks and use firebase remote config or something similar to run once code block for some users and another for some other.</p><h2>6) Login/SignUp is the most important screen in your app</h2><p>The most important piece of code in your mobile app is your login/signup page. We learned this the hard way. We never paid much attention to our sigun/login page but when we analyzed the analytics we saw that from all the people who “installed” the app only 60% were actually signing up.</p><p>Hence we now do rigorous testing of our signup page. After so much work we still keep finding a lot of bugs/error in our login &amp; signup flow.</p><h2>7) Updates are harder because of backward compatibility</h2><p>With AWS, I am used to pushing to Production almost every other day. But with mobile, you need to take care of backward compatibility a lot more.</p><p>Like we have a bug in our app where a blog will show as being “unfollowed” even when the user is following it. This was caused by two bugs with one being in the mobile app and another in our backend. Now if I fix the backend bug the current mobile app will break. So what we do? We fixed the bug in the mobile app and after around 15 days or when 90% of users have updated to the latest app, we will push fix to the backend.</p><h2>8) Have a clear 2-way communication channel with users</h2><p>It is very important to have some way in which users can reach out to you. At first, we thought just asking our users to email us would be enough but I think around 5% of all users ever emailed us. That’s when we found <a href="https://instabug.com/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Instabug</a>. This is a really amazing tool and they provide a 2-minute installation. I think in all the tools mentioned here, this was the easiest to setup. We run all sorts of surveys including Net promoter Score surveys, survey to nudge users to upgrade etc. Also, Instabug lets users submit bugs reports and even vote on feature requests.</p><p>If you have a mobile app, it is very important to have a NPS survey. This is probably the one metrics VCs really care about.</p><hr><p>That’s all for now. These were the learning I have had from working on mobile apps for the last 3 months. I hope these were helpful.</p><p>Do checkout PipFeed. The app is both in the play store and app store and let me know what you guys think.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>You’ve probably heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>,
a cellular automaton which produces intriguingly chaotic patterns from simple rules. (Stephen Wolfram would
call it a <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p235--four-classes-of-behavior/">“class 4 CA”</a> as if that
meant something.) This blog post is on another intriguingly chaotic cellular automaton known as
“<a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA:Star_Wars">Star Wars</a>,”
which was discovered by Mirek Wójtowicz circa 1999.</p>

<p>It makes a pretty nice screensaver to stare at.</p>





<p>Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton">CAs in the general vicinity of Conway’s Life</a>
can be described via a compact notation pioneered by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirek%27s_Cellebration">Mirek Wójtowicz</a>. Life itself is “B3/S23”: a new cell
is <b>B</b>orn when a dead cell is surrounded by 3 live cells, and a living cell <b>S</b>urvives when it
is surrounded by 2 or 3 other living cells. (This assumes an eight-cell
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood">Moore neighborhood</a>.)</p>

<p>One way to extend the rules of Life-like automata is to give cells a “refractory period.” When a cell in
such a CA dies, it cannot immediately become alive again; instead, the dead cell enters a “countdown” of
a certain number of timesteps, after which it becomes eligible for life again. That is, in these CAs,
there are Life-like rules for transitioning from state 0 to state 1, and from state 1 to state 2, but then
any cell in state 2 unconditionally enters state 3, any cell in state 3 unconditionally enters state 4,
and so on, until finally any cell in state N enters state 0 and is once again subject to a Life-like rule.
The compact notation for this kind of automaton is its Life-like rules for states 0 and 1, followed by
the <em>total number of states</em> in the automaton (that is, the number of refractory states plus two).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain">Brian’s Brain</a> is the most famous refractory Life-like CA;
its rule happens to be B2/S/3. (The lone “S” indicates that live cells in Brian’s Brain never survive for
multiple turns; the “3” indicates that it has three states: dead, alive, and refractory.)</p>

<p>Star Wars is a refractory Life-like automaton with the rule “B2/S345/4” (that is, it has two refractory states).</p>

<p>For more specimens of refractory Life-like rules, see <a href="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/mcell/rullex_life.html">the old MCell home page</a>.</p>

<p>Refractory states tend to lead to tiny light-speed spaceships.
In the same way that the “head” and “tail” states in Brian Silverman’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld">Wireworld</a>
create “electrons” that move in the direction of their head, Brian’s Brain and Star Wars are full of
asymmetric constructs that birth living cells ahead of them as their “tail” enters the refractory state.
In Star Wars a single pair of cells, with refractory cells behind them, makes a glider.
If you curl up the ends of the glider into parentheses, you don’t even need the refractory cells.</p>



<p>One of the most common naturally occurring spaceships is a “fireball” that travels
at light speed. (I see that <a href="https://catagolue.appspot.com/census/g4b2s345/C1/xq4">Catagolue knows about this entity</a>,
but I don’t really have any idea what that means.) Here’s the fireball, plus another
slightly larger and rarer naturally occurring spaceship below it:</p>



<p>Here’s an extensible ship that paddles along like a centipede, and a ship that gallops along like a centaur:</p>




<p>Star Wars also has aesthetically pleasing still lifes and blinkers, in the form of “planets.”
A cross of five live cells makes a stable still life. But if a ship comes too close to the
planet, the planet may gain a satellite — destroying the ship in a cloud of flaming debris!</p>



<p>Planets may have up to three satellites at once; and a two-planet system may be
stabilized by four satellites.</p>



<hr>

<p>For the big “random exploration/screensaver” grid at the top of this post, I decided to add
some interest to the visual display by color-coding each living cell as part of a “faction.”
Recall that in Star Wars, the only way to birth a new cell is for the cell to have exactly
two living neighbors. So, I’ve assigned each new cell to the “fire” faction, the “water” faction,
or the neutral “magenta” faction, according to whether its two parent cells are themselves
majority-fire, majority-water, or neutral/tied. This produces a vivid display of strife
between the factions, even though the rules of the underlying CA have not changed at all.
(See ConwayLife’s wiki page on <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Colourised_Life">Colourised Life</a>,
which is the same kind of thing.)</p>

<p>Also, the north and south edges of the grid (about 10 cells off-screen in either direction) are
constantly seeded with random noise, producing a steady influx of “immigrants” to the
galaxy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA:Star_Wars">LifeWiki</a> quotes John M. G. Elliott as
observing that Star Wars is “active to a degree almost reminiscent of [Brian’s] Brain,
with the distinction that it likes to build fixed Lego-like skeletal structures.”
If you leave it running long enough, the galaxy will ossify — the Lego-like structures
will accumulate like plaque and stifle anything interesting that the spaceships
might try to do. But it does take quite a while to get to that point!</p>

<hr>

<p>Participants on the ConwayLife forum have invented some pretty cool Wireworld-esque
circuits and other gadgets in Star Wars; see <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=507">here</a>.
The “electron-to-glider” gadget depicted here is due to ConwayLife poster <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=507&amp;start=25#p3452">“calcyman”</a>
and the general design of the wires is due to poster <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=507#p3433">“ebcube”</a>.</p>



<p>ConwayLife poster “knightlife” found a very cool “bug” that crawls around the inside
of a slanted rectangular enclosure; see <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=507&amp;start=50#p3734">here</a>.</p>

<p>What sorts of things might <em>you</em> discover in Star Wars?</p>

	<p>(Note: This essay was written for my <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/class-descriptions/4690/SCS/LEADERS/481-0/27906.html">Foundations of Leadership</a> course.)</p>
<p>Software Engineering is the discipline of Computer Science concerned with “developing and maintaining software systems that behave reliably and efficiently, are affordable to develop and maintain, and satisfy all the requirements that customers have defined for them” [1]. Creating and maintaining such software systems is what programmers do on a daily basis. To those who know about the industry through the news or HBO’s Silicon Valley, the profession is pictured as a solitary endeavor where “rockstar developers” stay up all night writing code fueled by coffee and the dreams of an IPO.</p>
<p>This fictionalized portrayal is far removed from the process-based workflows of actual software development. As developers, we work on teams staffed by programmers, testers, product managers, and a project manager. Each time a feature is requested by a stakeholder (customer or management), we start iterating towards a solution using the following process: (1) explore problem space; (2) gather requirements; (3) mock and vett design; (4) implement solution via code; (5) test final product in production-like environment; and, (6) deliver product to stakeholder. Coordinating team activities is an exercise in patience and communication.</p>
<p>Let’s examine the number of links between teammates. We’ll formally define a link as a two-way communication pathway. On a team of two, there is only 1 communication pathway. Disseminating knowledge requires reaching out to the one other person on the team. As teams grow, we need to communicate with more individuals, therefore the number of communication pathways also grows: a team of five will have 10 communication pathways, 24 links on a team of seven, and 45 channels in a team of ten.</p>
<h5>Figure 1: Number of pathways between individuals increases combinatorially as the team grows. This is known as a combinatorial explosion.</h5>

<p>It is no surprise that the most frequently cited cause of project failure is “team politics” [2]. This catch-all bucket includes items such as “communication problems, staffing problems, disenchantment with boss or with client, and lack of motivation” [2]. Even though working in technology means that we have to make decisions and adapt in an ever-changing environment, the major problems we face “are not so much technological as sociological in nature” [2].</p>
<p>Understanding that software development is fundamentally a people problem paints it in a different light. On top of managing the technical nuts and bolts of our day-to-day, we have to tend to our workers and their human needs. Successful organizations require internal teams to function at above-average rates of efficiency so they need to start thinking about how they can foster a worker-focused culture. Leaders need to understand interpersonal dynamics so they can take on the role of manager, mentor, or facilitator as the situation requires. This is why Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams is considered a must-read for “every manager and every programmer who works under a manager” [5]. In the following pages I will outline a few of the thoughts I had as I read Peopleware.</p>
<h2>Engineer vs Engineering Manager</h2>
<p>There needs to be an industry-wide discussion about the career progression of a software engineer. People who are drawn to this profession love to solve problems, tinker endlessly, and create systems; this is a job for the technically-minded. Managers, in contrast, have to manage individuals and ensure that the end product is delivered on time; this job requires an empathy-minded individual. This is one of the reasons why the standard industry practice of promoting above average Senior Engineers to the position of Engineering Manager does not make too much sense. While there are definitely some Software Engineers who would make great Engineering Managers, the industry practice of a single-career track needs to change.</p>
<p>Once you become a Senior Engineer and start building a portfolio of successful projects, you hit the ceiling of your current position and pay band. The only way to get more money is to leave or to become a manager. Change is difficult and a promotion is a promotion, so you take the opportunity and become a manager. Even if it’s not in your best interests.</p>
<p>Fortunately, large organizations such as Google, Facebook, and Groupon have started to rethink this philosophy. These companies have created an engineering track which is separate from the standard management track. Engineers can progress through salary bands and not be forced to deal with aspects of the job that they are not suited for. This doesn’t mean that these individuals cannot be leaders within the organization. As highly competent specialists, they will be looked upon to “lead from the middle” and take on additional team-based roles such as system architect, knowledge expert, and mentor. This concept of “Team Leadership” (Northouse) lines up with Peopleware’s idea of jelled teams. Successful organizations needs to support internal teams by building a culture of member involvement. Said another way, we need to put people in situations where they can be successful.</p>
<h2>Smart and Gets Things Done</h2>
<p>Joel Spolsky, the co-founder of Fog Creek Software and CEO of StackOverflow, has a simple principle for building teams and organizations: hire people who are smart and get things done.</p>
<p>Smart and doesn’t get things done means that the person is always tinkering on whatever strikes their fancy: they can’t buckle down, get to work, and ship code to deliver the requested feature. People who are not smart, but get things done results in a project that is cobbled together without much thought, i.e. coding by the seat of your pants. Well designed software is modular and able to connect together like Lego blocks. Poorly architected software can be compared to the vision of an artist where the end product is a vague concept in their head; an artist will spend hours creating something and deem it complete based on gut instinct.</p>
<p>Peopleware takes this concept of smart and gets things done to another level entirely. Once you have a team full of your people, the organization needs to put them in an environment where they can be productive, motivated, and constantly challenged. The Peopleware authors spend a few chapters talking about a quiet office environment that is free of distractions. At my company, developers sit by high-traffic meeting rooms so there is constant noise from 9 till 4; in order to drown out noise, programmers listen to music the entire day. I have been known to step out of the office to work out of Starbucks or the Harold Washington Library when I have a complex task I need my entire brain to process. I recently set up an arrangement so that I can work from home one day a week. While this does not seem like leadership in the strictest sense of the word, it brings a bit of empathy to the workplace. These are the types of things that leaders in technology need to think about.</p>
<p>Tech companies that have made their offices into playgrounds don’t quite understand what employees are looking for. It’s more about having a place where you are valued versus a place you have fun. If leaders want to keep their technical employee turnover low, they should treat them well; happy people can be in flow states for longer periods of time. This does touch on the idea of “Authentic Leadership”, Joel Spolsky’s philosophy has been to lead by example and create an environment where smart people want to work. It has worked out as his company is behind some of the biggest products in the tech industry: Trello, FogBugz, and StackOverflow. It is easy to identify organizations that fake their culture; Glassdoor publishes employee reviews which can be used to get a sense of what things are really like versus how they are portrayed. An organization that succeeds in building a satisfying community tends to keep its people</p>
<h2>SkunkWorks</h2>
<p>The act of creation is a powerful drug. You can spend hours bashing your head against a wall trying to figure out why something isn’t working. I did it right, why isn’t it doing what I’m telling it to do? 😡But that feeling you get when the program runs and does what you tell it to do makes the entire process worthwhile. I am programmer, hear me ROAR! 🦁</p>
<p>Organizations are a conservative bunch. While they took risks to get to the top, their strategy changed once they had something to lose; this mindset is counterintuitive to what is required to sustain growth. Internal innovation should be encouraged so that the organization can be at the forefront of the next big market trend and not end up like the Xeroxes or Kodaks of the world. Companies should embrace their innovators and let them lead teams that are conducting R&amp;D for the sake innovation, i.e. skunkworks projects.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Bell Labs is the perfect example of this type of organizational mindset. A lot of the early innovations in the field of computing came from Bell Labs researchers being able to run free with an idea. Individuals such Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Brian Kernighan, and Bjarne Stroustrup became leaders in their field based on the work they did at Bell Labs [9]. This relates to the concept of Trait Leadership where organizations identify individuals who have the leadership traits that can be cultivated to enable individual and organizational success.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reading Peopleware was a catalyst in getting me to think about the dynamics of a successful software development organizations. Recall that most of the problems in software are not technological, but sociological. Therefore organizations need to be cognizant of the barriers that prevent teams from jelling: recognize that not all individuals are suited for manager roles; put people in an environment where it is easy for them to become successful; and give them the freedom the innovate.</p>

<h4 id="a-primer-on-the-cruel-tacit-laws-of-type-level-programming-in-haskell"><em>A primer on the cruel, tacit laws of type-level programming in Haskell</em></h4>

<p>Haskell programs are constructed at the junction of two worlds: one of types, and the other of values. Values are operational run-time entities that are denoted syntactically by <em>terms</em> in the code. To this end, types classify terms. They provide a powerful abstraction to organize data, determine how it should be stored in memory, passed through various operations, and more. On a superficial level, the difference between these worlds is simple: <em>types</em> refer to datatypes, which are either built-in (such as <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code>), or user-declared, for example:</p>

<pre><code>data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
</code></pre>

<p>By comparison, <em>values</em> are denoted by <em>terms</em> those types categorize (such as <code>1</code> and <code>"abc"</code> described by the standard library’s <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code> types, or <code>Cady</code> and <code>Regina</code> in the case of our user-declared type, <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>). Thus, the term <code>1</code> denotes a value that exists in memory only when the program is run.</p>

<p>In addition to these two worlds, a third, darker, and more elusive underworld of <em>kinds</em> also lurks in the shadows of Haskell programs. Haskell kinds can be as unpredictable and insidious as the soulless alpha-female of an elite high school clique. While daunting, understanding the coaction between these three worlds lays the foundation for type-level programming, a topic worth learning as it strengthens overall Haskell intuition.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/81239044-afe24580-8fd1-11ea-96b0-274cf839e834.png" alt="the haskell type system: a machine of constant, unforgiving judgement and rigid classification"></p>

<h3 id="kindness-is-a-virtue">Kindness is a virtue</h3>

<p>Much like counter-intuitive adolescent social dynamics, mastery of Haskell bears a steep learning curve because of its underlying complexity. It is difficult to wrap one’s head around the language’s typeclass hierarchies, category-theoretic roots, or the intricacies of compiler behavior. However, an intimate understanding of the type system lets programmers look beyond the chaos of code and apply a recognizable template by which to understand it.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-takes-patience">Kindness takes patience</h3>

<p>This topic is also difficult to master because it is both vast and subtle. Ideas underlying type-level programming are scattered across many disconnected resources focused on several corners of the Haskell ecosystem. Authoritative references on the topic (such as relevant library documentation) tend to assume familiarity with domain-specific terminology that may be unknown to non-experts. Due to the paucity of approachable materials on the subject, I’ve attempted to break down type-level programming into explanations of its constituent parts. While I don’t go into extensive depth on any individual section below, I hope to provide a valuable starting point with which readers can explore ideas in greater detail.</p>

<h3 id="types-vs-values">Types vs. Values</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, Haskell programs are divided into two worlds: the <em>type-level</em> and the <em>value-level</em>. The <em>type-level</em> refers to the part of a program analyzed by the static type-checking phase during compilation. Since every expression is assigned a type, code is checked against Haskell’s type system to ensure it fits <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>’s specified correctness criteria.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704534-fce9fd80-af27-11ea-9544-13961a56c444.png" alt="types classify terms, just like hostile teens with identity crises classify one another"></p>

<p>If the program is well-typed, the program will compile. However, this type-information evaporates once the compilation process terminates, leaving only <em>values</em> behind at run-time. In this way, types and values can be better distinguished by the phasing distinction, with types being compile-time entities and values being run-time entities.</p>

<p>For example, if a function takes a <code>String</code>, the type-checker doesn’t care if the <code>String</code> has a value denoted by <code>"abc"</code> or <code>"123"</code> or <code>"get in loser"</code>—so long as it’s a <code>String</code>. Type information gets discarded at run-time, leaving only the string’s value (ex.,<code>"get in loser"</code>). In some cases, however, we want the type system to care about what those values are and distinguish between them. The <code>DataKinds</code> extension, which we’ll explore below, lets us do that by allowing us to shove more information about our program into the type system. This lets us add meaning to the value of a <code>String</code> at the type-level, moving them from their usual, strictly run-time existence, into the compile-time phase. The technique allows us to use more information statically in the logical development and abstraction of the program’s behavior. We’re also able to add consequences that can halt compilation if the specific value of <code>String</code> doesn’t conform to the rules we’ve specified, or define classes over them.</p>

<h4 id="distinguishing-types-and-values-in-ghci">Distinguishing types and values in GHCi</h4>

<p>Let’s examine our aforementioned <code>SpringFlingQueen</code> datatype in GHCi. When we query the type of one of its constructors using <code>:t</code> (a handy shorthand for <code>:type</code>), we see that it is indeed of type <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
λ :t Cady
Cady :: SpringFlingQueen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider literals <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>. These are <em>values</em> of a type that parameterizes the <code>Num</code> class:</p>



<p>Typing <code>:t 1</code> into GHCi gives us <code>Num p =&gt; p</code>, indicating that a literal such as <code>1</code> can be of any polymorphic type <code>p</code> as long as the <code>Num</code> type class has instances for that type (for example, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code> both have <code>Num</code> instances and therefore are valid types that <code>p</code> could be instantiated with). This is possible due to <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_inference">type inference</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704346-ae3c6380-af27-11ea-8078-6f1ddfc7b238.png" alt="type inference can be used to deduce concrete types wherever they're obvious. If a type looks like a mouse, it's a mouse—duh!"></p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>Just like types classify terms, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1">kinds</a> classify types, and therefore are frequently described as “types of types”, or referred to be “one level up.” The “star” syntax (i.e., <code>*</code>) denotes kinds. It is defiantly used in this post despite <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0143-remove-star-kind.rst">recent syntactic changes</a>. A prerequisite for understanding the kind system necessitates comprehending the differences between three pairs of ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data constructors vs. type constructors:</strong> data constructors create values, whereas type constructors create types. Type constructors take one or more type arguments and produce a datatype when enough arguments are provided. This means that through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying">currying</a>, a type constructor can be <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially applied</a>. For example, the list type constructor <code>[]</code> may take a single type argument (ex. <code>String</code>) to denote the elements of the list (i.e., <code>[String]</code>). <code>[String]</code> is simply syntactic sugar for <code>[] String</code>, where the type <code>[]</code> is applied to <code>String</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full vs. partial application</strong> A partially-applied type, like a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially-applied function</a>, is one that is missing some of its data constructors. For instance, consider the list type <code>[]</code>. The kind of <code>[]</code> is <code>* -&gt; *</code>. A fully-applied list has data constructors, such as <code>[Int]</code>, and its kind is <code>*</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inhabited types vs. uninhabited types:</strong> An inhabitant of a type is precisely a value of that type. This means that <em>inhabited</em> types refer to the types that contain concrete values, such as the value denoted by the term <code>1 :: Int</code>. This suggests that the type <code>Int</code> is inhabited by value denoted by <code>1</code>. By contrast, <em>uninhabited</em> types refer to type constructors to which no values are abstracted. For instance, <code>Void</code> is uninhabited because it has no data constructors, and thus can not be used to construct a valid term. While <code>Void</code> may seem pointless at first, it can be a useful way to represent that a container is empty (ex., <code>[Void]</code>, which <em>is</em> inhabited by the term <code>[]</code> and the value this term denotes).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How do these ideas relate to the kind system? Well, all fully-applied runtime values are of kind <code>*</code> <em>and</em> they are inhabited. You can confirm this by typing <code>:k Int</code> and <code>:k String</code> in GHCi. However, this doesn’t work the other way around—just because a type is inhabited, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s fully-applied (ex., <code>[]</code> is not fully-applied but it <em>is</em> inhabited, and its kind signature is <code>* -&gt; *</code>). Conversely, all partially-applied types are uninhabited (since they don’t correspond to a value), but not all uninhabited types are partially applied. <code>Void</code> for instance is not partially-applied, but it is uninhabited.</p>

<p>To get the hang of this idea, consider the following examples:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Inhabited?</th>
      <th>Fully-applied?</th>
      <th>Kind</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Int</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>String</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[Int]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(,)</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Void</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either Void Void</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Kind signatures can be specified manually in GHCi using the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XKindSignatures"><code>XKindSignatures</code></a> extension. Try extending the above table by investigating the kind signatures of various types.</p>

<h3 id="higher-kinded-types">Higher-kinded types</h3>

<p>Just like there are higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), there are higher-kinded types (types constructors that take other type constructors as arguments). Type constructors such as <code>[]</code> are a first-class type, but also a higher-kinded type, given they take another type constructor to be reified:</p>



<p>Let’s consider <code>Functor</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :k Functor
Functor :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; Constraint
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> takes a type constructor <code>* -&gt; *</code> and returns a <code>Constraint</code>. Let’s use <code>:info</code> to examine <code>Functor</code> a bit more closely:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :info Functor
class Functor (f :: * -&gt; *) where
  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
  (&lt;$) :: a -&gt; f b -&gt; f a
  {-# MINIMAL fmap #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Functor ((,,,) a b c) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor ((,,) a b) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor Maybe -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> allows type constructors like <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> to have <code>Functor</code> instances, but not <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. This is because <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> are <code>* -&gt; *</code>, while <code>Int</code> has kind <code>*</code>. Similarly, <code>Either</code> has <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, which is why its instance above is parameterized with a type parameter denoting something of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>: <code>Either a</code>.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Given many game engines, such as Unity, have supported Linux systems, more and more games are now available for Linux on Steam. However, sometimes there are language display issues when we try to play games in Linux using non-English languages. In this blog post, I would like to discuss how to solve such language display problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-escapists-2-language-display-problem">The Escapists 2 Language Display Problem</h3>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/641990/The_Escapists_2/">“The Escapists 2”</a> is a popular game on Steam which supports multiple languages including Chinese. However, when I tried to play the game using Chinese in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, I got Chinese display problems. There is almost no Chinese characters displayed in the menu.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-28-Ubuntu-Game-Language-Display-Problems-Fix/fix-before.png">
    <figcaption>The Escapists 2 - No Chinese</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>It turns out that the game engine of “The Escapists 2”, Unity, uses the Chinese font <a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/fonts-wqy-microhei"><code>wqy-microhei</code></a> for this particular game. If this Chinese font was not installed in the system, the game will not complain and display no Chinese. To solve this problem, we would have to install the Chinese font accordingly. In our case,</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt update
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>fonts-wqy-microhei
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the Chinese font <code>wqy-microhei</code> installed, now the game would display Chinese correctly.</p>

<div>

    <figcaption>The Escapists 2 - Chinese Fixed</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>



<p>When there are non-English language display problems in Linux games, it is highly likely that the Linux system misses some fonts corresponding to the language. Unfortunately, I don’t know a way to determine which font the system misses. But usually finding out all the fonts that the game engine would probably use for the language and install all of them would work.</p>

	<div>

		<p>Last Friday <a href="https://www.instacart.com/">Instacart</a>, the grocery-delivery company, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6960309-Complaint-6-26-20.html">sued</a> the City of Seattle over the <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2020/06/14/bill-requiring-premium-pay-for-gig-workers-seems-poised-to-move-ahead-with-changes/">recently-enacted ordinance</a> that requires the company and its peers to give “premium pay” to its gig workers during the COVID emergency.</p>


<p>Instacart was joined in the suit by the <a href="https://www.wa-food-ind.org/">Washington Food Industry Association</a>, a trade association whose members include Instacart and other food and grocery delivery businesses as well as grocery stores.</p>

<p>The “premium pay” ordinance required restaurant, food and grocery delivery companies to pay their gig workers an extra $2.50 per trip to offset their time and expense required to clean their vehicle between trips.&nbsp; Originally the ordinance included Uber, Lyft and other “TNCs” as well, but in a nod to the labor organizations currently negotiating a separate minimum wage for those drivers they were removed from the legislation by amendment. Mayor Durkan signed the bill last Friday, which was passed as emergency legislation and so took effect immediately.</p>
<p>The case was filed in King County Superior Court and asserts that the ordinance violates both state and federal laws:</p>
<p>1. They argue that it violates <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Washington_Initiative_1634,_Prohibit_Local_Taxes_on_Groceries_Measure_(2018)">State Initiative 1634</a>, which was intended to stop local jurisdictions form passing taxes on groceries similar to Seattle’s soda tax. This is going to be an interesting exercise in parsing the initiative’s language: while on the surface it seems like it doesn’t apply because the “premium pay” is compensation to the workers and not a tax collected by the government, an examination of the precise language in the bill might lead to a different conclusion. The bill reads:</p>
<p><em>… a local governmental entity may not impose or collect any tax, fee, or other assessment on groceries.</em></p>
<p><em> “Tax, fee, or other assessment on groceries” includes, but is not limited to, a sales tax, gross receipts tax, business and occupation tax, business license tax, excise tax, privilege tax, or any other similar levy, charge, or exaction of any kind on groceries or the manufacture, distribution, sale, possession, ownership, transfer, transportation, container, use, or consumption thereof.</em></p>
<p>The plaintiffs argue that the premium pay requirement is a “charge or exaction” on the sale and transportation of groceries and is therefore prohibited. That’s not entirely implausible, but still a stretch since the city isn’t exacting it for itself — it’s much more akin to a minimum wage. But in reading the rest of I-1634, we also see that there is an important exemption:</p>
<p><em>Nothing in this section prohibits the imposition and collection of a tax, fee, or other assessment on groceries if:</em></p>
<p><em>(a) The tax, fee, or other assessment is generally applicable to a broad range of businesses and business activity; and</em></p>
<p><em>(b) The tax, fee, or other assessment does not establish or rely on a classification related to or involving groceries or a subset of groceries for purposes of establishing or otherwise resulting in a higher tax rate due to such classification.</em></p>
<p>The premium pay ordinance almost certainly meets this requirement. So in all, this asserted violation is fairly weak and the plaintiffs will have a difficult time succeeding with it.</p>
<p>2. The plaintiffs argue that the city exceeded its emergency police powers in passing the ordinance because it is not necessary to the public health, welfare of safety as the legislation claims. They argue that during the COVID emergency their business — and accordingly their workers’ business — has boomed, and those workers are now averaging around $30 per hour. In addition, they assert that the city’s singling out of food delivery companies but not other businesses to impose the premium pay was “arbitrary and irrational.” Finally, they argue that “Instacart and WFIA’s members will suffer economic injury as a direct result of the Ordinance’s intrusions on their rights to control and manage their business operations and contractual relationships.”</p>
<p>3. The plaintiffs assert that the ordinance is an illegal taking of private property without just compensation, because it interferes with the companies’ contract rights (a form of intangible property) by prohibiting them from modifying the areas of the city served or from passing through the charges to their customers. They argue that the city is forcing them to provide food-delivery services below their cost. This, they argue, is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as well as of the Washington State Constitution.</p>
<p>4. The plaintiffs argue that the ordinance violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: it singles out food delivery companies’ workers “because they allegedly confront special health hazards in their line of work; but because these workers have no passengers and are not near other people when driving, they face lower risks of infection than the grocery store workers who spend their entire day in the stores, or food workers in restaurants who deal with customers in person or who deliver food to customers, or transportation network drivers who transport passengers in the close confines of their vehicle for hire.” Thus, they argue, there is no rational basis for singling out these companies for a premium pay requirement.</p>
<p>Instacart and WFIA are asking the court for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a declaratory judgment that the “premium pay” ordinance is illegal, invalid and unenforceable, for each of the reasons stated above;</li>
<li>damages “for the financial and economic injuries it will suffer… including the marginal cost of premium pay that it is prohibited from recouping from its customers;</li>
<li>preliminary and permanent injunctions preventing the city from taking steps to implement and enforce the premium pay ordinance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plaintiffs are being represented by former state Attorney General Rob McKenna.</p>
<p>The City Attorney’s Office said that they are reviewing the suit, but offered no other comment.</p>

                    <p>Whilst searching for the best cloud hosting providers in Australia, you’ll find many reviews which mostly rate affiliates of US hosting giants.</p><p>And it might be applicable for sure if your projects are stable all the time, you do not require 24/7 local support as well as don’t plan to grow. But if your project grows, it will require more hosting resources, and providers offer to migrate to double-size VMs. For sure, it costs double as well.</p><p>So how to find a local cloud hosting provider, with its own highly performed infrastructure, local support, and all this for affordable pricing?</p><p>Today we’d like to introduce <a href="https://cloudlets.com.au/index.html">Cloudlets</a>, 100% Australian hosting provider powered by Jelastic, unique Cloud Platform, as it provides certified flexible auto scaling due to container-based infrastructure.</p><p><em><strong>“Now our customers can go to market faster with a proven PaaS platform on top of a resilient infrastructure. Our intention is to provide local developers and project owners with the efficient world-class cloud technology from a fully Australian owned and run company, giving more freedom of choice instead of lock-in to cloud giants,” said Will Kruss, CEO of Cloudlets.</strong></em></p><p>From now on developers can easily create, test and run their projects in production with an advanced and user-friendly cloud platform. This provides flexibility in terms of technology (Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Python, .NET, Go, Docker, Kubernetes), project types (cloud-native and legacy, microservices and monoliths), scaling (vertical and horizontal on container and infrastructure level), automation (built-in tools and open API for extra integrations), and pricing (pay per use model based on consumption).</p><h2 id="technical-details-">Technical details:</h2><p>Location of data center: Australia</p><p>Infrastructure: Supermicro</p><p>CPU type: Intel Xeon E5-2698 v3 CPUs</p><p>Channel speed:: Download 367.88 Mbit/s and Upload 89.67 Mbit/s</p><p>Backup: Included</p><p>Free resources: 10GB disk space</p><p>Pricing: dynamic and fixed</p><p>Cloudlets provides certified flexible auto scaling due to container-based infrastructure. The cloud platform actually measures resources in special units called cloudlets (funny, isn’t it - Cloudlets is a cloud hosting company name, and cloudlets are resources), which provide you with a superior granularity while scaling.

June 29, 2020 | https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities could allow running arbitrary code on an intranet server and gain root access on all the customers' routers</p>

<p>Telia is a Swedish multinational telecommunications company. It also operates in Lithuania and provides mobile service, FTTH internet, DSL internet and IPTV. Telia rents and sells custom routers and set-top tv boxes to customers which have limited or almost no administration access left to them.</p>

<p>Every Telia router or tv box has a backdoor or "management interface". It is an <code>SSH</code> server running on VLAN 5 and/or WAN. Usually, it is running on port <code>8022</code>. Older models, like <code>ADB</code>, have password login enabled. The recent newer models, like <code>Technicolor</code>, have password login disabled and only use ssh with public key authentication (spoiler: it is still vulnerable).</p>

<p>Savitarna (in Lithuanian "Self service") - is a web service <a href="https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso">https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso</a> that allows Telia customers to order and manage services, get invoices, pay bills etc. It uses password authentication or external authority logins such as Facebook, Google, banking, digital signature etc. One of the new features: changing your router's wifi password. Sounds interesting, right? An internet web service that is able to change your local router's wifi password.</p>
<p>Login page:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-login.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna web login page"></p>
<p>Change wifi settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-wifi-settings.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna WiFi setting change feature"></p>

<p>How that works. When a user wants to change the password, the web service calls the backend to initiate an SSH connection to the user's associated router. Depending on the router it will be either password authentication or RSA public key. After a successful login a PHP script on the backend will issue some commands in the router's shell, parse the result and output some of the data to the user in the web UI, like wireless network name. <strong>Telia knows your WIFI password in plain text</strong>, keep it in mind and do not reuse this password anywhere. Overall scheme:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor-scheme.jpg" alt="Overall scheme of Telia backdoor"></p>

<p>Let's take a look at how the SSH connection is established. Network capture shows an SSH client banner and the remote IP that initiated the connection:</p>
<p><code>SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.4.2 PHP 10.0.98.251</code></p>
<p>What is important here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable <code>libssh2</code> version <code>1.4.2</code> <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/security.html">https://www.libssh2.org/security.html</a></li>
<li>Weak and deprecated key exchange <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code></li>
<li>The client does not verify <code>remote SSH server public key</code> (see below)</li>
<li><code>PHP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And, yes, it turns out that Telia's client does not attempt to verify the remote server's public key. We were able to start a custom SSH server on the same port 8022 and Savitarna successfully established a connection without even trying to verify for a man-in-the-middle. This means that we can see the password used and could try to create a malicious SSH server that exploits public vulnerabilities on Telia's side.</p>

<p>That was an easy task. As soon as Telia's client connected to our malicious SSH server we got the universal router credentials:</p>
<pre>User: tadmin
Password: hqMV8Wps
</pre>

<p>Do you still own an ADB router? Just go ahead and login over the web interface with this user. You are now an admin. You can do some restricted stuff now, great! But what about the root shell? We were able to connect with those credentials locally and got a limited shell. That's nice too. This gave us a lot of additional information that was hidden inside the router, many more vulnerabilities. Using one of them we were able to escalate to root and got full access over the device. The newer models like Technicolor require some additional exploits chained to gain full root access, but all are publicly available and so - easily doable.</p>

<p>In order to exploit RCE we needed to build a virtual test environment that fully copies Telia's PHP client. Step by step we have gone through the sequence of Telia's commands sent over the SSH. And finally we got a malicious SSH server and a test libssh2 client running in our test lab. With this server we could fully control the protocol and start fuzzing.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the fuzzing we got some crashes and partially confirmed that RCE may be exploited. Here is a sample GIF video that demonstrates two kinds of the issues the fuzzer found for us. Same php file was executed twice, but the malicious SSH server sent different payloads which caused:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segfault (stack corruption)</li>
<li>Infinite loop with high CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-poc.gif" alt="GIF PoC video"></p>
<p>However, at the time of the report we couldn't find an easy way to exploit the stack corruption. It may require more time, longer and more sophisticated fuzzing and more knowledge about the server. As Lithuanian law prohibits exploit testing on the real server, we could only fingerprint the Windows OS, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The backend seems to run only 5 php processes, so it is fairly easy to perform DoS by keeping stalled ssh connections. When SSH connections stay active for too long filling all the 5 php processes (there seems to be no timeout reading the remote shell), the Savitarna will show a strange "Maintenance" message:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>An update is in progress
Too many of you are trying to access the new Telia webpage.
We are expanding the resources and will accept you all soon.
Apologies for any inconvenience
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-DoS.jpg" alt="Service unavailbale"></p>

<p>If we now get all together, an attacker could exploit RCE on the intranet server and use that server to move laterally (because <code>10.0.98.251</code> is whitelisted everywhere) across all the customer routers with the same credentials creating the most powerful, persistent and undetectable botnet of Lithuania. Who knows, maybe someone already exploited that? (spoiler: see bonus section)</p>

<p>The report was responsibly disclosed to Telia and a copy sent to <code>CERT LT</code> (<a href="https://www.nksc.lt/">NKSC</a>). What happened next was a little bit of a surprise to the team. There were rumours previously about Telia's poor tech level, but we have experienced this in a real case.</p>
<p>First, Telia did not have a PGP key and did not know how to use it, so instead they asked us to ZIP the report with password and send the password over a separate email (private GMail). I hope Telia's engineers will be reading this article, so I would like to explain why the report should be encrypted. This is to protect you as the affected vendor. If there is a man in the middle who can intercept all the researcher's traffic, it will be very easy to get the ZIP file in the first email and then the password in the second email. Instead, PKI like PGP only allows to decrypt the report by the private key owner, ensuring that nobody else can intercept the report and exploit the vulnerabilities before you fix them all. </p>
<p>Second, Telia tried to threaten the reporter for the vulnerability discovery:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information
Are you sure you did not violate the electronic data protection law?
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame už informaciją.
Ar tikrai tyrimą atlikote ir neviešus elektroninius duomenis rinkote

<p>And then they once again mentioned that they will check if this report wasn't a hacking attempt and that they will persecute any reporter that discloses any information about Telia vulnerabilities:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information. We will continue to check whether you made your report
legally without violating any law. And we will ensure that no fake information will be
published that could do any harm to the company's reputation and to the critical part
of Lithuanian network infrastructure.
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame Jums už pasidalintą informaciją, kurios surinkimo teisėtumo vertinimą toliau
atliekame ir tikimės, kad į viešumą nebus paskleista tikrovės neatitinkanti ar neteisėtai

<p>We will not comment on this and let the IT community to judge. At the same time we will no longer provide any reports in any form to Telia company.</p>

<p>* Note: partial fix for KEX means the new KEX is not considered to be weak, however it is now possible to exploit libssh2 vulnerabilities after 1.8.0 with this particular KEX and a publicly known exploit for <a href="https://github.com/Semmle/SecurityExploits/blob/446048470633bf0f8da9570d008d056dbaa28ea9/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_kex_CVE-2019-13115/server/home/diff.txt">KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</a></p>

<p>After getting the root access and analyzing the Telia's routers' firmwares, we found several more users, like <code>ladmin</code> and <code>technician</code>. We will not disclose those passwords (yet), as it is not clear yet how both are used. But we were surprised that Telia's passwords appeared to be leaked many years ago. You can try to search for the tadmin password's hash on the web and you will be surprised - there was an attempt to crack the hash back in 2014!</p>

<p>And finally, we found that the hash was cracked and was available in the old "weakpass" database. You can search for the "old" weakpass database (sometimes named "First version of weakpass") and grep it - password is there. This means that most probably we are not the first who were able to penetrate Telia.</p>

								<p>On April 28, 2020, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published two final rules that will eliminate the license exception for civil end users (CIV) in the People’s Republic of China, Russia, and Venezuela and expand military end use and end user restrictions on these countries. These rules confront the national security risks presented by the increasing integration of civilian and military technology development, particularly in China, by requiring U.S. Government review of a broader range of exports including electronics and telecommunications items only controlled for antiterrorism (AT) reasons (with licenses subject to a presumption of denial) when shipped for military end uses or to military end users. These final rules will go into effect on June 29, 2020.</p>
<p>BIS also published a proposed rule that would modify License Exception Additional Permissive Reexports (APR) by restricting the destinations that will be eligible for the license exception. Comments on the proposed rule are also due June 29, 2020.<span id="more-1180"></span></p>
<p><strong>Expansion of Controls Related to Military End Use or Military End Users in China, Russia, or Venezuela</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-28/pdf/2020-07241.pdf">first final rule</a> expands license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items intended for military end uses and military end users in China, Russia, and Venezuela, pursuant to § 744.21 of the EAR. Effective June 29, 2020, the final rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imposes a restriction on exports to <u>military end users</u> in China, similar to current requirements for Venezuela and Russia.</strong> Currently, for specified items, EAR Section 744.21 requires a license where the exporter has knowledge that (i) an item destined for China, Russia, or Venezuela will be used for a <u>military end use</u>, or (ii) an item destined for Russia or Venezuela (but not China) will be for a <u>military end user</u>.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The term “military end user,” includes not only “the national armed services (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), as well as the national guard and national police, government intelligence or reconnaissance organizations,” but also “<u>any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support ‘military end uses</u>.’”</li>
<li>Many large commercial manufacturers and other companies, particularly in China (as well as Russia and to a lesser extent Venezuela) may conduct some activities in support of a military end use. Under the new rule, it appears that a license may be required to export the covered categories of items (e.g., 3A991 integrated circuits) to such companies, even if the item itself will be used exclusively in connection with commercial applications. If interpreted in this way, the rule could have a broad impact; it will be important to monitor further guidance from BIS. Under any interpretation, exporters will need to focus their due diligence on whether any aspect of their counterparties’ business supports military end uses particularly in China, given what BIS refers to in the rule as “China’s widespread civil-military integration.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Significantly expands the list of items subject to the military end use and end user license requirements in Supplement No. 2 to Part 744 of the EAR</strong> for exports to China, Russia, and Venezuela. The list will now also include certain materials processing, electronics, telecommunications, mass market encryption items, sensors and lasers, propulsion, electronics, maritime equipment, and aircraft items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). For example, sending a 3A991 chip, a 5A992 iPhone, or a copy of 5D992 Microsoft Windows to a military end user in China would be subject to this restriction.</li>
<li><strong>Broadens the “military end use” definition. </strong> “Military end use” currently is defined as:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Incorporation into a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML);</li>
<li>Incorporation into a military item described on the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement Web site at <a href="http://www.wassenaar.org/">http://www.wassenaar.org</a>);</li>
<li>Incorporation into items classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs; or</li>
<li>For the “use,” “development,” or “production” of military items described above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Use” normally has a conjunctive definition with six elements – meaning all the elements need to be satisfied to constitute “use.” In this case, the final rule expands the “military end use” definition to also include<u> any item that supports or contributes to any one of the elements of “use,” i.e., the operation, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul, refurbishing, “development,” <strong>or</strong> “production,” of military items.</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adopts a policy of presumption of denial of licenses </strong>for exports to China, Russia, and Venezuela for military end uses and end users, rather than the existing case-by-case license review standard. Accordingly, license applications pursuant to EAR § 744.21 will be denied in most cases.</li>
<li><strong>Expands Electronic Export Information (EEI) requirements for all items listed on the CCL that are destined for China, Russia, and Venezuela – independent of end use or value. </strong>Per the Foreign Trade Regulations, many less sensitive AT-controlled items generally do not require EEI reporting at all if their value is less than $2,500, and even if reported, the EEI would generally not need to specify an ECCN. The final rule requires EEI reporting to identify specific ECCNs for tangible exports of all items listed on the CCL to China, Russia, and Venezuela, with very few exceptions. As a result, even if a company does business with these countries entirely in the commercial realm, its export reporting obligations may change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Elimination of License Exception Civil End Users (CIV) </strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-28/pdf/2020-07240.pdf">second final rule</a> eliminates License Exception CIV. License Exception CIV currently authorizes the export of certain items that are controlled for national security (NS) reasons provided that the items are destined to civil end users for civil uses in Country Group D:1, which includes, among others, China, Russia, Venezuela, Ukraine, and Iraq. A number of items currently may be exported under License Exception CIV, including certain telecommunication equipment and computers. Accordingly, as of June 29, 2020 companies will no longer be able to utilize License Exception CIV.</p>
<p><strong>Modification of License Exception Additional Permissive Reexports (APR)</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/28/2020-07239/modification-of-license-exception-additional-permissive-reexports-apr">third rule</a> is a proposed rule that would modify License Exception APR, which currently authorizes the reexport of certain items from Country Group A:1 or Hong Kong to destinations in Country Group B (so long as the destination is not also in Country Groups D:2, D:3, or D:4) and Country Group D:1. The rule proposes removing destinations in Country Group D:1, including China, as eligible recipients of national security-controlled items reexported under License Exception APR.</p>

			  <p><span>Mon, Jun 29, 2020</span></p><p>At the beginning of this year the data analysts and engineers at my company undertook two large migration feats. They moved our data warehouse into Snowflake and secondly, they moved our analytics tooling away from Periscope and into Looker.</p>

<p>Looker is heralded as a way for non-SQL savvy users to self serve and build their own data reports and tables without leaning on a Data Analyst who knows SQL to do it for them.</p>

<p>On one hand Looker has delivered on that promise; people in the business are increasingly getting used to building their own Dashboards. On the other hand, I’ve noticed my Data Analysts are as busy as they’ve ever been, if not more. What gives?</p>

<h2 id="looker-creates-busywork-for-your-analysts">Looker creates busywork for your Analysts</h2>

<p>Looker is not a zero-config plug and play service. Its not the case that you can just hook it up to your data warehouse and your tables are auto discovered and configured automatically.</p>

<p>In fact, what I’ve noticed is that Data Analysts in Looker shops are spending a solid chunk of their time writing out LookML; a Domain-specific-language (read Vendor Lockin) that Looker requires Analysts to use to redefine the schema of the underlying data models in a format that Looker understands. These schemas are called views and you need at least one view for each table in your database (a huge task if you are an enterprise company with hundreds of tables). In addition to defining views, explores (another custom Looker concept) have to be defined by the Analyst before an end user can start building off the data.</p>

<h2 id="looker-hinders-rapidly-iterating-product-development">Looker hinders rapidly iterating product development</h2>

<p>Looker is not a great place for dashboards of experimental work or rapidly evolving datasets and isn’t great for getting insight into new features that were built and deployed within the past few days or weeks.</p>

<p>Looker is best for building dashboards on top of your more mature corners of the business. The idea is that your data analyst does an initial up front concerted effort to diligently sort, organize and label your data schema. For them to do this, it implies your data schema should be relatively stable. This might suit some of the more traditional, stable parts of your company like tracking User Sign Ups, or Orders.</p>

<p>My current team’s culture is to iterate fast, to try something, measure the results, adopt it and move on if necessary. Ideally we’d like to add a new production table, start amassing data in it, and then quickly build dashboards (that might not last longer than a week or two) to measure the result or inspect the contents. Every time we start collecting a new piece of data and want to report it in Looker for our business partners to play with, we have to do grunt work to get it to appear in Snowflake, and once in Snowflake we have to do grunt work to get it readily available in Looker. Admittedly this could be mitigated if we were flush with Data Analysts embedded in our team who could immediately start defining the LookML schema the moment each migration lands but the reality is that they are a shared resource and you have to get in line and wait your turn if you need something to appear in Looker.</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>

<p>Looker has value for sure, but it doesn’t mean you can hire fewer analysts or engineers, if anything you should hire more, and if you’re a fast moving business with an ever-evolving product, your team’s ability to make data driven decisions is still constrained by the capacity of your Data Analytics team and if you consider yourselves rapid iterators making data driven decisions you may find traditional SQL-based analytics tools are better suited for the job.</p>

<p>Kubernetes has become the de facto containers orchestration platform for companies of all sizes. Either with greenfield or brownfield applications, setting up a Kubernetes is just a foundation. As Kelsey Hightower tweeted, Kubernetes is a great foundation to build more platforms on top of it. </p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kubernetes is a great foundation to build a platform on top of. It's not the end all be all.</p>— Kelsey Hightower (@kelseyhightower) <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/935251954191679488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
</div></div>



<p>So you have Kubernetes cluster(s), what can be built on top of this? Stateless applications in web and API layers are great initial use cases that Kubernetes helped bridging the gaps in security, scalability, developer productivity.</p>



<p>Keeping the stateless workloads aside, let us see what can be built on top of the foundation.</p>



<h3>Service Mesh</h3>



<p>A web of microservices built on top of Kubernetes brings distributed computing concerns. While Kubernetes solves Service Discovery, Scalability concerns, the eco-system needs a solution for Layer 7 traffic networking. Service Meshes such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://istio.io/"><span>Istio</span></a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://linkerd.io/"><span>Linkerd</span></a> bring in advanced features for the microservices such as traffic control, security, and observability. Combined with a sidecar proxy such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/"><span>Envoy</span></a>, service mesh can provide a powerful security and networking abstraction for microservices. Also, developers and enterprises can benefit from the adaption of a common framework increasing efficiency and productivity.</p>



<h3>Stateful Workloads</h3>



<p>Running stateful workloads in Kubernetes is a rapidly evolving area. Kubernetes has inbuilt objects called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/" target="_blank"><span>StatefulSets</span> </a>providing network addressing and sequencing guarantees for pods. Combining StatefulSets and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/2/kubernetes-operators-plain-english" target="_blank"><span>application operators</span></a> could provide a powerful solution for running stateful workloads such as databases and legacy application that requires the state to be persisted.</p>



<h3>Developer Experience (DevEx)</h3>



<p>Kubernetes is hard for enterprise developers.&nbsp;It is for a reason that Kubernetes is hard. Kubernetes is designed to have bare minimal features providing just enough building blocks to have a customized Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) built on top of it. Depending on the maturity of an organization, a specialist team such as a platform, DevOps, or SRE team could customize Kubernetes and make it easy for application developers. As the cost and time of deploying a container are so less, the customizations could be a very powerful mechanism for product development teams providing a competitive edge. Enhanced developer experience could greatly attribute to faster time-to-market of product features as well as embedded security best practices. Tools such as <span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://skaffold.dev/">Skaffold</a></span> could be leveraged to make Kubernetes easy for developers. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-spaces/about"><span>Azure Dev Spaces</span> </a>provides an innovative rapid iteration model of enabling each developer with their instance of a pod in a large team setup.</p>



<h3>Serverless</h3>



<p>If you’re in a public cloud you don’t necessarily need a FaaS (Functions-as-a-Service) built on top of Kubernetes. You could simply leverage purpose-built serverless solutions such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank"><span>AWS Lambda</span></a>. Serverless has two main facets; The developer experience aspect of just simply uploading a piece of code without worrying about the infrastructure and then the cost efficiency piece of it. If you run your Kubernetes on-premise then you can still bring the developer experience feature of Serverless with PaaS tools. Developers could just simply provide their git repo to spin up the service. But that doesn’t bring the cost-efficiency aspect of serverless. In a true serverless model, the containers or processes cold boot only when the service is invocated. Frameworks such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/knative" target="_blank"><span>Knative</span></a> could potentially bring both developer experience and cost efficiency features of Serverless to on-premise Kubernetes deployments.</p>



<h3>Machine Learning Pipelines</h3>



<p>The efficient sharing of infrastructure resources is one of the key features of the Kubernetes platform. Hardware resources such as CPU are overcommitted for the workloads and also throttled when on demand. GPUs can be shared across multiple machine learning container workloads bringing in cost efficiencies for on-premise setup. Moreover, there are excellent opensource machine learning pipelines such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.kubeflow.org/" target="_blank"><span>Kubeflow</span></a> built on top of Kubernetes. Kubeflow enables data scientists to run their models efficiently in Kubernetes. Kubeflow bridges the gap on both sharing expensive GPUs as well as providing a powerful data pipeline orchestration mechanism.</p>



<h3>Cloud-Native CI/CD Pipelines</h3>



<p>CI/CD pipelines which typically include running a series of tests such as unit tests, integration tests, static code analysis, security scannings are largely orchestrated through Jenkins pipelines. Some teams are practicing running these Jenkins jobs as containers. Given the explosion in pods and containers, the Jenkins of today is trying hard to scale the deployment orchestration. There’s a completely new brilliant model of running the whole orchestration leveraging the power of Kubernetes scheduler. This is the cloud-native way of running the CI/CD orchestration. Projects such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jenkins-x.io/" target="_blank"><span>JenkinsX</span></a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tekton.dev/" target="_blank"><span>Tekton</span></a> will take your Jenkins pipelines to the next level by fully leveraging Kubernetes’s orchestration and scheduling prowess.</p>



<h3>Zero Trust Networking</h3>



<p>With the advent of <span><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43231.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Google’s BeyondCorp</span></a> case study</span> in 2014, many enterprises are striving today to evolve the perimeter-based network security model. If you’re using just a <span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plugin for </a></span><span><span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI)</a></span></span><span>,</span> then this is the time to evolve. Projects such as <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/calico-network-policy-comes-to-kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Calico</span></a> can implement <span>Kubernetes Network Policy</span> to isolate every workload providing fine-grained zoning trusting no workload.</p>



<p><em>This list keeps growing as more enterprise workloads are containerized and orchestrated through Kubernetes. Keep watching this space for exciting innovations for workloads and applications of all types. As the saying goes, Kubernetes is the new Linux kernel of the data center.</em></p>

<div id="post-body-257152373857446226">
<p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jjZrttaaRa0/XvqKucV7mSI/AAAAAAAABu8/tDK40hxHFzAFnzNNap3U9ftiJEFdYdhswCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/EbsThPjU8AY6CRO.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="732" data-original-width="1338" height="175" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jjZrttaaRa0/XvqKucV7mSI/AAAAAAAABu8/tDK40hxHFzAFnzNNap3U9ftiJEFdYdhswCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/EbsThPjU8AY6CRO.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>
Besides <a href="https://github.com/antonblanchard/microwatt">Microwatt</a>, another open core implementation is now available, <a href="https://github.com/openpower-cores/a2i">the PowerPC A2</a>. The chip name may not be familiar, but its most famous application should be: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Blue_Gene">the Blue Gene/Q supercomputer</a>, based on 45nm 18-core chips (16 active, one unused for yield purposes and one for interrupts, I/O and other on-chip services) at 1.6GHz with a TDP of 55W. In 2012, Blue Gene/Qs took top positions on all three major supercomputer benchmark ratings.
</p><p>
<a href="https://github.com/openpower-cores/a2i/tree/master/rel/src/vhdl/work">The A2I VHDL</a> on offer does in fact appear to be for the Blue Gene/Q variant. This is important, because A2 doesn't have an FPU or vector unit out of the box; it leaves these to be connected through the auxiliary execution unit (AXU). The A2I BG/Q version, however, does have an IEEE 754-compliant FPU connected to the AXU, and this appears to be provided in the VHDL. There is also apparently an MMU, but while the FPU offers SIMD instructions for up to 4 double-precision floats simultaneously it is not AltiVec, so no VMX/VSX. In addition, despite being SMT-4, it is only dual issue (one instruction to the ALU, one to the AXU), and execution is strictly in-order.
</p><p>
A2I isn't going to replace Microwatt. Microwatt is smaller and simpler, intended for small FPGAs and embedded projects, and is actively evolving by leaps and bounds to the point <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/331758">it can now boot Linux</a>. More to the point, it is intended to be fully OpenPOWER compliant. A2I, however, despite being a fully realized core, is only ISA 2.06 compliant, lacks the radix MMU, lacks AltiVec, and at least right now lacks active developers. But it's small enough that with some work and a process shrink this could be the start of a mobile OpenPOWER system: at 7nm IBM claims <a href="https://github.com/openpower-cores/a2i/blob/master/README.md">it got up to 3.9GHz</a> (their blurb at right claims even higher, to 4.2GHz). And it is indeed <a href="https://github.com/openpower-cores/a2i/blob/master/LICENSE">under the OpenPOWER license</a>.
</p><p>
The really interesting question is what <em>else</em> might show up under <a href="https://github.com/openpower-cores"><tt>@openpower-cores</tt></a>.

Since then, we’ve been trying out different product release cycle to improve the product features, fixes and performance optimization to build the best feature voting tool.</p><p>Here are some of them:</p><h2 id="the-six-weeks-release-cycle">The Six Weeks release cycle<a href="#the-six-weeks-release-cycle">#</a></h2><p>We tried <a href="https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/35-the-six-week-cycle">Basecamp’s Six Weeks release cycle</a> for about a year. While it worked out great for big releases, like our new iOS &amp; Android app, it never really worked out for our web version, since we had to constantly update the platform almost every week.</p><p>Though the feature releases worked out well, we had the big conversion problem. Users loved the product, but they wanted things that we didn’t necessarily have at that time.</p><h2 id="small-product-updates-everyday">Small product updates, everyday<a href="#small-product-updates-everyday">#</a></h2><p>I am a big fan of James Clear’s <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>. While I used to do things in small increments while working, it never really hit me to use that technique for our product development cycle.</p><p>During one of our internal meetings, the idea of releasing small fixes or improvements everyday came up, and it connected back to the core concept of Atomic Habits.</p><p>Back in March this year, we switched to daily releases. This means:</p><ol><li>Everyday, we will make a small yet noticeable update to our user interface and user experience;</li><li>Everyday, we will make a 5% performance improvement to the backend code;</li><li>Everyday, we will identify and fix at least one bug that could come in the way of the users using the platform;</li><li>Finally, at the end of the week, we will aggregate all these changes, and push out a release note to our users.</li></ol><p>We stuck to this method since March, and I am super thrilled to see the results after two months.</p><p>In May, we made 30% increase in our revenue (because of iframe embeds, and other customization options) 12% increase in user feedback submission (because of a UX change) 300ms faster response rate to our API calls from platforms like Intercom, which makes it faster for users to submit their feedback.</p><p>We are also tweeting the changes starting today, on <a href="https://twitter.com/hellonexthq">@hellonexthq</a>.</p><h2 id="what-did-we-learn-here">What did we learn here<a href="#what-did-we-learn-here">#</a></h2><p>One of the biggest learnings for me here was that small changes that we make everyday matters, which has directly impacted our users in a positive way, which is what matters to us as a business.</p><p>What development cycle/model are you following for your side project?

For me, at work, that means every day at 5:30 p.m. ET there's an update on COVID-19 from public health officials in Alberta and at 6 p.m. ET the same thing happens in BC. Over the past few weeks, it's more like every other day, but you get my drift.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Because those are the provincial updates that fall on my watch, I've listened to more than a hundred of them and I'm pretty sure the inside voice in my head is now either Dr. Deena Hinshaw or Dr. Bonnie Henry. And it's always telling me to stay calm and be kind.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Which is why last Thursday, accustomed to my normal show routine, I was jolted to hear Dr. Henry in tears. She wasn't talking about COVID-19 though, at least not directly. She was talking about overdoses.</p>  <p><em><strong>Watch Dr. Henry's comments on the opioid fatalities:</strong></em><br> <span><span><span></span><span>B.C.'s provincial health officer teared up as she shared her condolences with the loved ones of overdose victims.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:47</span></span></span></p>  <p>Last month in B.C. a record number of people died from an overdose; 170. It's also more than the total number of deaths due to Coronavirus in the province; 167. More than 400 people in B.C. have died from overdosing during the three months COVID-19 measures have been in place.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Dr. Henry's emotion was raw as she talked about those numbers. They were moms, dads, sons and daughters. She also noted the increased toxicity of street supply.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"COVID-19 is not our only health crisis," she told reporters. "I cannot express how difficult this news has been to hear, my thoughts and condolences go to those who have lost their loved ones and I share your grief."</p>    <p>I can't imagine the impact of isolation on someone who suffers from addiction. The decision to reach out and ask for help, or to talk to a friend, must already be tough — but the inability to do so must be crushing. Outreach workers say physical distancing measures also mean less people can access addiction services. It is a devastating combination.&nbsp;</p>  <p>According to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/drug-overdoses-covid19-1.5605563"><u>a report by CBC's Health unit,</u></a> early data from Ontario shows a 25% increase in the number of overdose-related deaths from March to May over the same period last year.</p>  <p>In Alberta, the number of opioid-related calls to EMS went from 257 in March to 550 this May.</p>  <p>A report from Toronto's medical officers of health shows paramedics there responded to 25 suspected opioid overdose deaths in April, the highest number since September 2017.</p>    <p>In an interview last week, Vancouver mayor Kennedy Stewart was also visibly shaken by the increase in deaths in his province.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This keeps me up every night and it has, really, since I started campaigning for mayor," he told me.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Stewart stressed the importance of finding a safe drug supply — essentially a prescription alternative to street drugs — and lauded the federal government's efforts on that front during the pandemic. He hopes the measures aren't temporary.</p>  <p>"We've got to make it permanent … otherwise these numbers are just going to continue, not just here, but right across the country."</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Outreach workers worry that easy access to CERB may be linked to a spike in opioid overdoses in Ontario and B.C.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:03</span></span></span></p>  <p>Public health officials in various parts of the country are pressing Ottawa for more funding for a safe supply of drugs in their provinces and cities. People I spoke to in the federal government say they expect to be able to provide a lot of that funding soon — but provinces have some jurisdiction here as well. On the question of whether to make safe supply funding permanent, everyone I spoke to said a decision hadn't been made, but the federal minister of health was open to the conversation.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Dr. Henry has gone a step further than making a call for a safe drug supply in the past; calling for decriminalization of all illicit drugs.&nbsp;</p>  <p>That's a controversial position and often a politically contentious one — we saw that in the last federal election. Unsurprisingly, the call to decriminalize was rejected by governments prior to COVID-19; but this pandemic has changed so much — given the heartbreaking volume of overdoses in the last three months I wonder if it will change that too.</p>  <hr>  <h2>Subscribe to the full newsletter</h2>  <p>This is just one part of the Minority Report newsletter.&nbsp; Read the latest on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic by&nbsp;<a href="http://newsletters.cbc.ca/q/119z4mlxXDye/wv" title="Read the full newsletter">clicking here</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/minorityreport" target="_blank">sign up for the newsletter here</a>&nbsp;and it will be delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

Funds tend to have long lockup periods, during which investors can’t get their money out, and charge high management fees as well as take a share of profits off the top.</p></blockquote><p>Since this new guidance was issued less than 30 days ago, the industry is ripe for disruption. Because it is so new, the business would be primarily focused on marketing the opportunity to prospective investors and educating them about the potential risks and rewards. Of course, since PE funds would be layered inside other funds, the business’ goal would be to become part of as many blended funds as possible: thus, another avenue of marketing would be to fund-makers to be included in their funds and receive 401k dollars.</p><p><strong>Monetization: </strong>Ultimately, the goal of the business would be to acquire as much capital as possible: <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/how-private-equity-firms-make-money">PE funds have a monetization</a> model of fees (about 2%) and carried interest (20%). This business would adopt that model.</p></div></div></div>]]>

June 29, 2020 | https://hacdias.com/articles/2019/08/decentralizing-my-website-with-ipfs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hacdias.com/articles/2019/08/decentralizing-my-website-with-ipfs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was about two years ago, in 2017, that I got to know IPFS through <a href="http://daviddias.me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Dias</a>. This is not the first time I talk about IPFS here, in my website, but here’s a brief description of what it is: IPFS stands for InterPlanetary File System and it is a peer-to-peer, content-addressed and decentralized protocol.</p><p>By decentralizing my website, I want you to fetch it from the nearest source you can. If your accessing this through HTTP, that might not be what’s really happening (<em>kinda</em>, will explain later). But if you already know IPFS and you’re using <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#install" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IPFS Companion</a>, changes might be that you’re loading this through a decentralized network.</p><p>First of all, I use a static website generator called <a href="https://gohugo.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hugo</a> which does its job immensely well and I give my props to its creator and maintainers. However, we’re not here to talk about static website generators, but about how does my website work and how you can do the same about yours.</p><p>Two simple commands are all that is required to update my website to the InterPlanetary network. Actually, I just need to push it to the git repository because I have <a href="https://github.com/hacdias/hacdias.com/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CircleCI setup</a> with the required commands. Anyways, here are the commands:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo --gc --minify
npx ipfs-deploy public -p pinata -d cloudflare
</code></pre></div><p>Simple, right? Let’s break it down a bit to see what’s going on here. The first command is the website generator, which outputs to a directory called <code>public</code>. Nothing much to say about that. Only that it contains all the files of my website. Then, we run <code>ipfs-deploy</code> and the magic happens!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ipfs-deploy</code></a> is a tool built by <a href="https://github.com/agentofuser" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@agentofuser</a> that does the following: takes a certain directory - in this case <code>public</code> - and adds it to as many pinning services as we want and updates the DNSLink on the DNS provider we defined.</p><p><strong>Wait, what? Pinning services?</strong></p><p>So, a pinning service is an online service that runs an IPFS daemon - and usually a gateway too - and that assures you that your content does not go away from the network. And now you tell me: doesn’t that invalidate the point of being decentralized and needing no computer to have the website online?</p><p>Well, you could run a local IPFS daemon - <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as you should be doing!</a> - and add your content through your own node on your own computer. But, if no one else has the contents of your website, then it just won’t work unless you have your computer connected to the Internet 24 hours.</p><p><strong>What about DNSLink?</strong></p><p>DNSLink is a TXT record on your domain that points to a certain IPFS hash. Let’s say your website is available at <code>example.com</code> and the hash of the content of your website is <code>QmHash</code>, then, you should’ve a TXT record at <code>_dnslink.example.com</code> with the value:</p><p>DNSLink allows IPFS to know what the content of your website is just by looking at its domain. Certainly, you wouldn’t to give people hashes to access your website.</p><p>Let’s now talk a bit about each service!</p><h2 id="pinata">Pinata</h2><p>Pinata is a freemium service that allows you to pin up until 1 GB of data for free. You need to sign up at <a href="https://pinata.cloud/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their website</a> and then you’ll be able to get your api key and secret api key. You’ll need to set <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-deploy#pinata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two environment variables</a> with those values in order for <code>ipfs-deploy</code> to work.</p><h2 id="a-tale-of-two-oranges">A tale of two oranges</h2><p>I’m using Cloudflare as my go-to DNS provider. Since this year, Cloudflare has had <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their own IPFS gateway</a> running. What you can do is: if your domain is <code>example.com</code>, set a CNAME record at the root to <code>cloudflare-ipfs.com</code>. That will mean that your website will be served by Cloudflare’s gateway.</p><p>Pinata and Cloudflare maintain a persistent connection so the content discovery will certainly be fast so there won’t be any problems when updating the website.</p><p><strong>Uh, I already used Cloudflare and now ‘Always on HTTPS’ is not working anymore… What did I do wrong?</strong></p><p>Nothing, you did nothing wrong. Right now, since your website is pointing to another Cloudflare website (their IPFS gateway), the rules applied at <code>cloudflare-ipfs.com</code> will ditacte how your website goes. And, for many different reasons, the IPFS gateway has ‘Always use HTTPS` disabled.</p><p>But this will be solved! Cloudflare is working on a solution called <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/continuing-to-improve-our-ipfs-gateway/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Orange to Orange, or O2O</a>, which will allow you to override settings even if your website DNS points at another website served by them!</p><p>As for <code>ipfs-deploy</code>, you’ll also need to set <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-deploy#cloudflare" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some environment variables</a> to get it configured in order to be able to automagically update your DNSLink at Cloudflare.</p><p>Then, just run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ipfs-deploy -p pinata -d cloudflare
</code></pre></div><p>And you’re website will be pinned to Pinata and your DNSLink at Cloudflare will be updated.</p><p><strong>But that’s a lot to make a website decentralized…</strong></p><p>It’s a one time process: you set it up and leave it running. As mentioned before, I’m using CircleCI to build my website, pin it and update the DNSLink every time I commit to the master branch. You can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/hacdias/hacdias.com/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">setup</a>.</p><p><strong>Is it really decentralized?</strong></p><p>Yes! DNS is decentralized, Cloudflare is a distributed CDN. Your website points at Cloudflare IPFS gateway, which is a cached IPFS gateway served by the distributed Cloudflare network. And Cloudflare also needs to get the content from Pinata - or your computer if you don’t want to pin it to an external service!</p><p><strong>What can you do to improve?</strong></p><p>Start by installing <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop#install" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IPFS Desktop</a>, which installs you an IPFS daemon and leaves it running all the time, giving your computer superpowers. Then, install <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IPFS Companion</a>, the browser extension that will power up your browser! If you do that, next time you open my website (and many others!), you’ll be redirected to your own gateway, provided by your own IPFS node, and it will fetch the website from wherever it finds the content!</p><p>Happy decentralization!</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>It’s crazy to think my startup is already over 6 months old. This post is some informal reflections on that period.</p>
<p>To set the context for people who are not me, this was my first foray into startups. The startup is pretty lean (it’s a saas security startup), only on the verge of profitability. Single digit customers.</p>
<p>A lot of this may sound complain-y, they’re definitely first world problems. But they are things I wish I had fully internalized.</p>
<h2 id="nobody-cares">Nobody cares</h2>
<p>It sounds very negative, and I don’t mean it in a bad way. But I think it applies to many aspects of building the startup.</p>
<p>People want a tool that solves the problem. No one cares about the effort involved in creating little features. No one cares about the story, no one cares how it works. They just want to be re-assured it will work, so they can focus on their 1000 other problems.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just important to remember.</p>
<p>The fact that no one cares also has positive aspects! I was worried about my two hours of planned downtime when I was doing a large migration. Literally no one cared. I think my startup could have been down for a few days, and no one would of cared that much. Unfortunately or fortunately I focused a lot on reliability (which was kind of wasted effort now that I realize it).</p>
<h2 id="careful-with-free-trials">Careful with free trials</h2>
<p>I thought it would be cool if I had a free sandbox plan. Let people kick the tires. When they see the amazing value they’ll upgrade!</p>
<p>Not so much.</p>
<p>The free sandbox offering attracted over 1000 businesses. Super neat! The only problem was… no one upgraded to paying plans. So I’m supporting 1000 customers on my platform. Goodbye life savings (kidding, but it does cost non-trivial money).</p>
<p>I don’t want to dive into the specifics of content-security-policy report-uri, but having a sandbox account created weird dynamics/incentives. My startup focuses on making this specific security tool easier. And I charge based on “usage” of the feature. But by making this security tool easier, there was less need for usage. So every feature I included made the Sandbox account a better solution, no need to upgrade for more usage.</p>
<p>So I had 1000+ people using the platform, and they had no incentive to upgrade. And every feature I released solidified that SANDBOX was all your need. I could of limited key features, but I hate it when other companies do that, and it wasn’t obvious to me what features to limit. It also feels dis-honest. Instead I’d rather focus on making the best product. So instead I went with a free trial period and made the choice to discontinue SANDBOX accounts. (If you were a sandbox user of Csper, against I apologize, but it had to be done).</p>
<p>There’s way less usage, but now people pay for the service. And I’m not fronting the bill for &gt;1000 customers (which I can not do for long since i’m self bootstrapped).</p>
<h2 id="seo--pipeline--ads">SEO / Pipeline / Ads</h2>
<p>It sounds so obvious now, but wasn’t fully fully internalized when I started.</p>
<p>People aren’t just going to “stumble” onto your product.</p>
<p>When Csper was released, I made sure it could handle a lot of load. I was worried that it would spread like wildfire. So I made sure everything could scale. Autoscaling k8s, autoscaling database. I setup observability on everything to debug issues, tracing, logging, monitoring dashboards, etc.</p>
<p>Long story short, almost no one showed up.</p>
<p>SEO / Marketing are the name of the game. (not an endorsement), but getting setup with SEM rush to track my SEO (specifically content marketing).</p>
<h2 id="people-like-open-source-a-lot">People like “open source”… a lot</h2>
<p>I built a similar open source product about 5-6 years ago. It’s crazy how fast people will refer an open source product compared to a paid product.</p>
<p>It’s a huge marketing advantage I never really considered. The product today is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the 5-6 year old product, yet people still share links to my old defunct product.</p>
<p>“open source” seems to trump reliability. I’m probably the same way, so I can’t complain too much. Just interesting to watch it happen.</p>
<p>I was very tempted to shift to “open source” and then have a paid plan. But, never did.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-plus-working-for-yourself-is-amazing">On the plus, working for yourself is… amazing</h2>
<p>I loved all my previous jobs. For better or worse, work is usually the center of my life.</p>
<p>But, there’s something about waking up in the morning, making yourself some coffee, and pouring your heart into something you own. For awhile I would shoot out of bed at 6am (without an alarm) because I was so excited to get to work. I’d work for 12 hours, and then do it all again, and I was excited about it.</p>
<p>And it’s so nice knowing where everything is. At some point I had to do a decent sized migration across 125 files. Knowing how everything works and where it is makes every project nice and fun. No hidden side effects.</p>
<h2 id="delayed-reward">Delayed reward</h2>
<p>More of a psychological thing. But it’s hard to remove the feeling of working hard and getting a reward.</p>
<p>I did two large migrations on Csper. One was a re-write of “projects” and “organizations” to consolidate billing and other stuff. It was like 4500 lines of code over 125 files. Then doing all the data base migrations and testing… It was a lot of work to make sure it all worked correctly. And it was a bit stressful.</p>
<p>After the release went smoothly, it was a hurah! But, it’s not like I would instantly get any new customers.</p>
<p>After the migration is done, I’m still just staring at my computer, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Being generous, let’s say the different of consolidated billings increased conversions by 5%, I’d have to wait awhile to see that impact. I don’t think I even got a new customer that week.</p>
<p>It can be dis-heartening when you work super hard, but then nothing happens. It was a mental barrier to separate that.</p>
<h2 id="its-a-bit-of-a-rollercoaster">It’s a bit of a rollercoaster</h2>
<p>It seems like when things go bad, a lot of things go bad at once. A customer will leave, the firefox extension store will remove my addon, some feature will be acting up, and your competitors just signed a big deal.</p>
<p>That emotional buffer is important. I should have remembered to leave some room in my emotional tank to take hits. Wearing thin and then taking a couple of hits is not fun.</p>
<p>In the movies/books/interwebs every startup is successful. When you see people working hard, it’s like “no duh, the payoff and reward will be huge!” But in real life you have to face that most likely it will fail. When do you cut your losses? When you take a number of hits at once, those questions go to the front of your mind.</p>
<h2 id="lonely">Lonely</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest downside to this adventure so far is not working on a team. I miss is celebrating wins. Giving yourself a high five when a customer signs up is cool, but experiences are better shared with someone.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I recently worked out a system where I get a twinkie when I get a new customer. Which is very nice. We celebrate the wins, but there’s something about a group working towards a goal and achieving that goal.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-are-meh">Bug Fixes are… meh</h2>
<p>Previously as an engineer I would hate publishing bugs in my code. Where’s the attention to craft!</p>
<p>But now being honest about my todo list, most bugs don’t matter <em>that</em> much. The chance of defering a customer from paying because of a bug here and there is pretty small. (I mean, it depends on the bug, and you should try super hard not to have bugs. It’s no excuse for being sloppy).</p>
<p>But, I have a bug tracker pretty full of little bugs here and there. But when I assign dollar values to them, SEO/marketing is almost always more important than fixing a bug.</p>
<p>If an article attracts two new customers, and a weird edge case defers one customer, by the numbers it’s better to focus on the article. When you’re a non-bootstrapped solo startup, you have to run towards the money. You also can’t make everyone happy.</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>Some things that I already knew, and thankful that I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staging/prod. Staging saved my butt a number of times. And made things way less stressful when doing big changes. Worth every penny.</li>
<li>k8s on gke was pretty nice. it took a day or two to get my infra setup, and then I never really thought about it. it just scales here and there.</li>
<li>Single command deploys, and lots of makefiles. Any command that could be useful later I store in a makefile. i never want to think about things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that were surprisingly frustrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser extension review processes!
<ul>
<li>Chrome takes weeks and weeks to review extensions</li>
<li>Firefox is super picky about making sure that they can compile your code and it exactly matches what’s in the app store</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SaaS trails/charges. You rely on a number of services for your startup, and they start to add up. Some companies are also very sneaky about not emailing you before they charge your credit card. There was one company that charged me for 6 months without sending a single email.
<ul>
<li>I should of been reviewing my credit card statements, but when you’re already working long days, it’s near the bottom of the chopping block. At the end of the day, writing another article for SEO is more important than checking a hypothetical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kind of weird point, but I tried advertising on linkedin/google/facebook/twitter. I left with a very negative view of all the platforms and try very hard not to read from them anymore. Everyone knows that those platforms are about advertising, but it wasn’t until I was trying to shove my agenda down other peoples throats did I realize how disgusting it was. Now I see all the other businesses doing what I was doing, pushing their own agenda. I want no part of anyone else’s agenda. I was probably doing ads wrong, but I saw no drop in signups after I stopped them. I’m going to fully focus on SEO instead. I feel good about that, when people have a problem, they’ll google for it, and my company will be there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, building Csper has been a interesting experience. Maybe …</p></div></div>

June 29, 2020 | http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.asp | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.asp">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>
	We sill start off by walking though the different parts of a GIF file.
	(The information on this page is primarily drawn from the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt">W3C GIF89a specification</a>.)
	A GIF file is made up of a bunch of different "blocks" of data. The following diagram
	shows all of the different types of blocks and where they belong in the file. The file starts
	at the left and works it's way right. At each branch you may go one way or the other. The
	large "middle" section can be repeated as many times as needed. (Technically, it may
	also be omitted completely but i can't imagine what good a GIF file with no image data
	would be.)
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/gif_file_stream.gif" alt="GIF file stream diagram" width="700" height="220"></p>
	<p>
	I'll show you what these blocks looks like by walking through a sample
	GIF file. You can see the sample file and its corresponding bytes below.
	</p>
	

	<p>
	Note that not all blocks are represented in this sample file. I will provide samples of missing
	blocks where appropriate.
	The different types of blocks include:
		<a href="#header_block">header</a>,
		<a href="#logical_screen_descriptor_block">logical screen descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#global_color_table_block">global color table</a>,
		<a href="#graphics_control_extension_block">graphics control extension</a>,
		<a href="#image_descriptor_block">image descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#local_color_table_block">local color table</a>,
		<a href="#image_data_block">image data</a>,
		<a href="#plain_text_extension_block">plain text extension</a>,
		<a href="#application_extension_block">application extension</a>,
		<a href="#comment_extension_block">comment extension</a>,
		and <a href="#trailer_block">trailer</a>.
	Let's get started with the first block!
	</p>

	<h2><a name="header_block">Header Block</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: </p>
	<p>
	All GIF files must start with a header block. The header takes up the first
	six bytes of the file. These bytes should all correspond to
	<a href="http://www.ascii.cl/">ASCII character codes</a>. We actually have two pieces
	of information here. The first three bytes are called the <strong>signature</strong>.
	These should always be "GIF" (ie 47="G", 49="I", 46="F"). The next three specify the
	<strong>version</strong> of the specification that was used to encode the image. We'll only be working
	with "89a" (ie 38="8", 39="9", 61="a"). The only other recognized version string
	is "87a" but i doubt most people will run into those anymore.

	<h2><a name="logical_screen_descriptor_block">Logical Screen Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 91 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	The logical screen descriptor always immediately follows the header. This block
	tells the decoder how much room this image will take up. It is exactly
	seven bytes long. It starts with the <strong>canvas width</strong>. This value
	can be found in the first two bytes. It's saved in a format called the spec
	simply calls <em>unsigned</em>. Basically we're looking at a 16-bit, nonnegative
	integer (0-65,535). As with all the other multi-byte values in the GIF format, the least
	significant byte is stored first (little-endian format). This means where we would read
	<span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span>
	from the byte stream, we would normally write it as <span>000A</span> which is
	the same as 10. Thus the width of our sample image is 10 pixels. As a further example
	255 would be stored as <span> FF </span><span> 00 </span> but 256 would be <span> 00 </span><span> 01 </span>.
	As you might expect, the <strong>canvas height</strong> follows. Again, in this sample we
	can see this value is <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span> which is 10.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next we have a <em>packed byte</em>. That means that this byte actually has multiple values
	stored in its bits. In this case, the byte <span> 91 </span> can be represented
	as the binary number <span>10010001</span>. (The built in Windows calculator
	is actually very useful when converting numbers into hexadecimal and binary formats. Be sure
	it's in "scientific" or "programmer" mode, depending on the version of
	windows you have.) The first (most-significant) bit is the <strong>global color
	table flag</strong>. If it's 0, then there is none. If it's 1, then a global color table will
	follow. In our sample image, we can see that we will have a global color table (as will usually
	be the case).  The next three bits represent the <strong>color resolution</strong>. The spec
	says this value " is the number of bits per primary color available to the original image,
	minus 1" and "...represents the size of the entire palette from which the colors in the
	graphic were selected." Because i don't much about what this one does, I'll point you to
	a more knowledgeable article on <a href="http://www.devx.com/projectcool/Article/19997/0/page/7">bit and color depth</a>.
	For now 1 seems to work. Note that <span>001</span> represents 2 bits/pixel;
	<span>111</span> would represent 8 bits/pixel.
	The next single bit is the <strong>sort flag</strong>. If the values is 1, then the
	colors in the global color table are sorted in order of "decreasing importance," which
	typically means "decreasing frequency" in the image. This can help the image decoder but
	is not required. Our value has been left at 0. The last three bits are the <strong>
	size of global color table</strong>. Well, that's a lie; it's not the actual size of the
	table. If this value is N, then the actual table size is 2^(N+1). From our sample
	file, we get the three bits <span>001</span> which is the binary version of 1.
	Our actual table size would be 2^(1+1) = 2^2 = 4. (We've mentioned the global color table
	several times with this byte, we will be talking about what it is in the next section.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The next byte gives us the <strong>background color index</strong>. This byte is only meaningful
	if the global color table flag is 1. It represents which color in the global color table
	(by specifying its index) should be used for pixels whose value is not specified in the
	image data. If, by some chance, there is no global color table, this byte should be 0.
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte of the logical screen descriptor is the <strong>pixel aspect ratio</strong>.
	I'm not exactly sure what this value does. Most of the images I've seen have this value
	set to 0. The spec says that if there was a value specified in this byte, N, the actual
	ratio used would be (N + 15) / 64 for all N&lt;&gt;0.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="global_color_table_block">Global Color Table</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	We've mentioned the <strong>global color table</strong> a few times already now lets talk
	about what it actually is. As you are probably already aware, each GIF has its own color
	palette. That is, it has a list of all the colors that can be in the image and cannot
	contain colors that are not in that list. The global color table is where that list
	of colors is stored. Each color is stored in three bytes. Each of the bytes represents
	an RGB color value. The first byte is the value for red (0-255), next green, then blue.
	The size of the global color table is determined by the value in the packed byte of the
	logical screen descriptor. As we mentioned before, if the value from that byte is N, then
	the actual number of colors stored is 2^(N+1). This means that the global color table will
	take up 3*2^(N+1) bytes in the stream.
	</p>

	<div>
	<table id="global_color_size">
	<tbody><tr><th>Size In Logical<br>Screen Desc</th><th>Number Of<br>Colors</th><th>Byte<br>Length</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>12</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>24</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>16</td><td>48</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>32</td><td>96</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>64</td><td>192</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>128</td><td>384</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>256</td><td>768</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>
	</div>

	<p>
	Or sample file has a global color table size of 1. This means it holds 2^(1+1)=2^2=4 colors.
	We can see that it takes up 12, (3*4), bytes as expected. We read the bytes three at a time to get
	each of the colors. The first color is #FFFFFF (white). This value is given an index of 0.
	The second color is #FF0000 (red). The color with an index value of 2 is #0000FF (blue).
	The last color is #000000 (black). The index numbers will be important when we decode
	the actual image data.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that this block is labeled as "optional." Not every GIF has to specify a global
	color table. However, if the global color table flag is set to 1 in the logical
	screen descriptor block, the color table is then required to immediately follow that
	block.

	<h2><a name="graphics_control_extension_block">Graphics Control Extension</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 21 </span><span> F9 </span><span> 04 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	Graphic control extension blocks are used frequently to
	specify transparency settings and control animations. They are completely optional.
	Since transparency and animations are bit complicated, I will hold off on many of
	the details of this block until a later section
	(see <a href="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/animation_and_transparency.asp">Transparency and Animation</a>).
	In the interest of this page being complete, I will at least tell you what
	the bytes represent.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>extension introducer</strong>. All <em>extension</em>
	blocks begin with <span>21</span>. Next is the <strong>graphic
	control label</strong>, <span>F9</span>, which is the value that
	says this is a graphic control extension. Third up is the total <strong>block
	size</strong> in bytes. Next is a packed field. Bits 1-3 are reserved for future
	use. Bits 4-6 indicate <strong>disposal method</strong>. The penult bit is
	the <strong>user input flag</strong> and the last is the <strong>transparent color
	flag</strong>. The <strong>delay time</strong> value follows in the next two bytes
	stored in the unsigned format. After that we have the <strong>transparent color
	index</strong> byte. Finally we have the <strong>block terminator</strong> which
	is always <span>00</span>.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/graphic_control_ext.gif" alt="GIF graphic control extension block layout"></p>




	<h2><a name="image_descriptor_block">Image Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 2C </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	A single GIF file may contain multiple images (useful when creating animated
	images). Each image begins with an image descriptor block. This block is exactly
	10 bytes long.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>image separator</strong>. Every image
	descriptor begins with the value <span>2C</span>. The next 8 bytes
	represent the location and size of the following image. An image in
	the stream may not necessarily take up the entire canvas size defined by
	the logical screen descriptor. Therefore, the image descriptor specifies
	the <strong>image left position</strong> and <strong>image top position</strong> of
	where the image should begin on the canvas. Next it specifies the
	<strong>image width</strong> and <strong>image height</strong>. Each of these
	values is in the two-byte, unsigned format. Our sample image indicates that
	the image starts at (0,0) and is 10 pixels wide by 10 pixels tall. (This image
	does take up the whole canvas size.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte is another packed field. In our sample file this byte is 0 so
	all of the sub-values will be zero. The first (most significant) bit in
	the byte is the <strong>local color table flag</strong>. Setting this flag
	to 1 allows you to specify that the image data that follows uses a different
	color table than the global color table. (More information on the local
	color table follows.) The second bit is the <strong>interlace flag</strong>.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="local_color_table_block">Local Color Table</a></h2>
	<p>
	The local color table looks identical to the global color table. The local
	color table would always immediately follow an image descriptor but will only
	be there if the local color table flag is set to 1. It is effective only for the
	block of image data that immediately follows it. If no local color table
	is specified, the global color table is …</p></div></div>

June 29, 2020 | https://news.itmo.ru/en/science/photonics/news/9515/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://news.itmo.ru/en/science/photonics/news/9515/">archive.org</a>

                            The modern photonics industry is constantly working on making its devices more compact, be it computing systems or sensors and lidars. For this, it is necessary to make lasers, transistors and other elements smaller. A team of scientists led by ITMO researchers proposed a quick and affordable method to create optical chips right in a Petri dish. The research was <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c01104" target="_blank">published</a> in <em>ACS Nano.</em>                        </p><div>
                            <p><img src="https://news.itmo.ru/images/news/big/p9515.jpg" alt=""></p><div>
                                    <p>Image provided by the article's authors</p>
                                </div>                        </div><div>
                            <p dir="ltr">Nowadays, devices that are based on microscopic lasers and optical chips are becoming more and more common. They are used in the production of lidars, in the development of new biosensors, and in the future, they can become the foundation for new optical computers that will use photons rather than electrons to transfer and process information.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Most of today’s optical chips operate in the infrared (IR) band, i.e. the lasers they use emit in the IR range that is invisible to the human eye.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“But to make the devices even more compact, we need to work in the visible range,” says <strong>Sergey Makarov</strong>, chief researcher at ITMO’s Department of Physics and Engineering, “as the size of a chip depends on the wavelength of the emission of its light source.”</p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
                                        <img src="https://news.itmo.ru/images/news/big/951500.jpg" alt="From left to right: Pavel Trofimov, Anatoly Pushkarev, Ivan Sinev and Sergey Makarov">
                                        <figcaption>From left to right: Pavel Trofimov, Anatoly Pushkarev, Ivan Sinev and Sergey Makarov</figcaption>
                                    </figure>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Silicon issue</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">An optical chip consists of such components as lasers and waveguides. While creating a source that would emit in the green or red spectra is quite easy, a proper waveguide for this spectral range can be an issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“A microlaser is a source of emission that you need to guide somewhere,” comments <strong>Ivan Sinev</strong>, senior researcher at ITMO’s Department of Physics and Engineering, “and this is what waveguides are for. But the standard silicon waveguides that are used in IR optics don’t work in the visible range. There, they transmit signal no further than several micrometers. For an optical chip, we need to transmit on tens of micrometers with a high localization, so that the waveguide would have a very small diameter and the light would travel sufficiently far through it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">Earlier, attempts were made to replace silicon waveguides with silver ones, but the transmission distance in such systems was also insufficient.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Optical chip in a Petri dish</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In the end, a team of scientists that included specialists from ITMO University, St. Petersburg Academic University, and Université de Lorraine decided to use gallium phosphide (GaP). This material has very small losses in the visible range as well as high refractive index. The microlaser itself was made of halide perovskite. But the most important thing is that the laser was grown directly on the waveguide in a common Petri dish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“The beauty of this approach is that we create perovskite microlasers with nano-waveguides embedded in them right from the start,” notes Sergey Makarov, “which is done by co-crystallizing GaP of the waveguide and the perovskite microlaser in a solution of perovskite ink. This means that rather than using expensive nanolithography methods, we use those of solution chemistry, which are a lot cheaper and easier. After that, the laser and the waveguide are planted on a substrate, thus forming the base for the optical chip.”</p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
                                        <img src="https://news.itmo.ru/images/news/big/951501.jpg" alt="Illustration from the article">
                                        <figcaption>Illustration from the article</figcaption>
                                    </figure>

<p dir="ltr">The resulting systems can transmit signals for a much greater distance than their counterparts with silicon or silver nano-waveguides. At the same time, the size of these chips is about three times less than that of its IR band analogues.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Color adjustment</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Another important feature of the chip is the ability to adjust the emission range of a laser from green to red spectral range. Moreover, you can change the emission color after the chip production, and this process is reversible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“This change is done via a chemistry method,” explains Anatoly Pushkarev, senior researcher at ITMO’s Department of Physics and Engineering. “We put the substrate with an optical chip into the vapors of hydriodic or hydrobromic acid for just a couple of minutes. This is quite enough time for the anionic exchange between the perovskite microlaser and the acid’s molecules to take place, which changes the chemical composition of the perovskite, and therefore the wavelength of its emission.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">This can be useful for the devices that have to transmit many optical signals at different wavelengths. For example, you can create several lasers for such a device, connect them to a single waveguide, and use it for transmitting several signals at different wavelengths at once.</p>

<figure>
                                        <img src="https://news.itmo.ru/images/news/big/951502.jpg" alt="Illustration from the article">

                                    </figure>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Antenna</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The scientists also equipped the newly created chip with an optical nanoantenna made of perovskite that receives the signal travelling along the waveguide and allows uniting two chips in a single system.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“We added a nanoantenna at the other end of our waveguide,” explains <strong>Pavel Trofimov</strong>, PhD student at ITMO’s Department of Physics and Engineering, “so we have a light source, a waveguide and a nanoantenna that emits light when pumped by the microlaser’s emission. Then we attached another waveguide to it: as a result, the emission from a single laser went into two waveguides. At the same time, the nanoantenna did not just unite the two waveguides into a single system, but also transformed part of the green light into the red spectrum. So we had one wavelength - and got two, a single channel - and then two of them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">The research was published in <em><strong>ACS Nano</strong></em>, one of the leading scientific journals.</p>

<p>We are back with another blog post on <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> vs. <a href="https://www.airsend.io/discover">AirSend</a>: Roles and Permissions Explained. We recently wrote about Discord vs. AirSend Design Edition, which you can read about by clicking <a href="https://www.airsend.io/blog/index.php/2020/05/18/discord-vs-airsend-design-edition/">here</a>. In this blog post, we will be discussing the user roles from each platform. User roles help make managing communities easier. The question then remains, what type of roles are needed to manage a community efficiently?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To answer this question we analyze how user roles are implemented in AirSend and Discord.</p>



<h2>AirSend’s Roles</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-13.png" alt="" width="448" height="562" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-13.png 597w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-13-239x300.png 239w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px"></figure>



<p>Typically when creating a community,&nbsp; user roles are established to help run the channel. Airsend takes the approach of fixed user roles to manage a community. Fixed user roles allow simplicity and have the same meaning across channels and servers. We created various roles with this in mind. Beginning with the first role: viewer.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Viewer</h3>



<p>Viewers have the permissions to view the community and download files. These are for first-time visitors who haven’t joined the community and want to browse before joining. The next role on our list is a collaborator.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Collaborator</h3>



<p>Collaborators have access to posting messages and uploading files. However, collaborators cannot edit the wiki (the about section).&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-14.png" alt="" width="355" height="650" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-14.png 473w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-14-164x300.png 164w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></figure>



<p>Collaborators are the basis of your community. Ideally, collaborators are what ensure conversation happens. For a little more responsibility, there is the role of a full collaborator.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Full Collaborators</h3>



<p>A full collaborator can do everything a collaborator does. The only difference is that a full collaborator can edit the wiki. By allowing a full collaborator to help monitor the channel and edit the wiki, managers and admins can focus more on community building and outreach. After the full collaborator role is the manager and admin.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Manager/Admin</h3>



<p>Like the full collaborator roles, managers and admins also can edit the wiki, upload files, and post messages. However, the difference between the full collaborator and the manager/admin is that managers and admins can manage other users.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Now, don’t get confused. Managers and Admins are two different roles, but they mostly carry the same functionality. The difference between a manager and an admin is that the <strong>manager</strong> <strong>can add and remove other users from the channel. Admins have access to adding and removing users and changing the roles of other members. </strong>Having these two roles ensures that your community stays clean from self-promoters, rule breakers, inappropriate messages, etc.</p><p>In general, we believe that having fixed roles helps communities prosper. Fixed roles allow simplicity. For Discord, the central idea behind their roles is customization. Through their customization, complexities arise. </p></div>



<h2>Discord Roles</h2>

<p>Discord takes the approach of dynamic user roles. It is good for communities that want customized user roles. The problem with having dynamic roles and customization is that it adds complexity. </p>



<p>For example, Server A has specified permissions for its members. Members have permission to: </p>



<ul><li>Post in channel</li><li>Share files</li><li><strong>Invite other members to the community</strong></li></ul>



<p>Now, let’s say we want to join another community, Server B. Because there is full-fledged customization, creators of the server can check off specified permissions for their roles that may be different from other servers. In Server B, members can have permission to:</p>



<ul><li>Post in Channel</li><li>Share files</li><li><strong>Add reactions</strong></li></ul>



<p>But they <strong>cannot</strong> invite other members to the community like Server A can. Members cannot view what permissions they have. Now, imagine this with higher roles. </p>



<p>Let’s say there are Moderators in Server A  and Server B. Server A has specific permissions to kick members out. In Server B, those same moderators from Server A do not have the permission to kick members out. This is not apparent to the moderators, thus confusion and complexities are formed. </p>



<h3>How to add a role to Discord</h3>



<p>To add roles, you will need to go to your servers’ settings at the top of the screen.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-16.png" alt="" width="226" height="485" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-16.png 301w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-16-140x300.png 140w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px"></figure>



<p>Next, click on the roles button. This button will let you see and add all of your roles.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled.png" alt="" width="649" height="394" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled.png 1027w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-300x182.png 300w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-1024x621.png 1024w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-768x466.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px"><figcaption><em>The red circle is the button you click to get to the current image. The blue circle is where you add roles to your community.</em> The green circle is where you will see all the functions a role member can have. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Click on the plus icon. Doing so will allow you to create a new role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below the role color section, are all the functionalities a role member can have. Essentially, each role has specific access but carries a customized name. These names can range from Admins, Community Manager, Mods, Helpers, Servers Guide, etc. And these names come with specific functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, specific access-only channels can be made for specific Discord roles as well. Servers can have a moderator-only chat, an admin-only chat, etc. Access-only channels are excellent use for privacy, carrying specific role meetings, organization, and maintaining order. Furthermore, bots are an excellent tool for role management. Servers can have bots for anything, but when it comes to managing servers, some bots take care of</p>



<ul><li>warning users that violate the rules</li><li>suspending users</li><li>putting users in a time out</li><li>automatically adding new users to the member roles and more.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In sum, Discord’s roles are good for communities who are looking for customized roles and bots. Bots ensure:</p>



<ul><li>The server runs smoothly with automated welcome messages to new members</li><li>Assign new users to the member role</li><li>Alert the community that the server creator put out new content</li><li>Ban or suspend members who do not follow the community rules, and much more.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Summation</h2>



<p>Both AirSend and Discord are great community platforms. Discord offers quite a bit for community building through dynamic user roles, bots, channel organizations, and more.  The downside to this approach is the complexities and confusion members will have with each community they join.  The common question will be asked, “What permissions do I have with this server that is different from another server?”</p>



<p>On the other hand, AirSend takes the approach of fixed user roles. Fixed user roles are easy to understand and avoid confusion. Fixed user roles have the same meaning across channels and makes it easy for the user onboarding. In the end, it all depends on what the user is comfortable with- having a simplistic role setting or a customized but complex setting. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>In 2008, Facebook was the hot new thing, and social media had <em>just</em> started rising. One of my high-school classes was about trying to understand that shift better.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> We read about past problems with mass media, and thought about how they might manifest in new media. To that end, we read a German novel called <em>The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum</em> by Heinrich Böll. In recent years, with social media-induced cancel culture becoming a hot issue, that novel has been on my mind frequently.</p> <p>A quick summary:</p> <blockquote> <div><p>Katharina is a 27-year old housekeeper. She’s frugal, earnest, and hard-working – a model citizen. One evening, she meets a man named Ludwig at a party, and sleeps with him. Next day, the police knocks on her door: he’s a known communist terrorist, and suspected for robbery and murder. Katharina is taken in for questioning, and released. </p><p>  This episode is observed by a reporter for the tabloid NEWS. The reporter inquires with neighbors, stretches any statements, and publishes a piece declaring Katharina to be a gold-digging communist criminal, the depraved bride of a murderous terrorist. Katharina is swiftly excluded from society and receives death threats. Under the onslaught of harassment, her hospitalized mother dies from stress. </p><p>  In the meantime, Ludwig is found to have committed no robbery or murder, but by then, the campaign against Katharina has become its own force. One sympathizer argues that the actual facts are good, and that other newspapers are reporting the facts, but – as Katharina points out through her sobs – it doesn’t matter, because <em>everyone</em> reads the NEWS. </p><p>  For no fault of her own, Katharina’s life is in shambles: her career is over, and her friends distance themselves for self-preservation. In desperation, she tries to meet with the reporter who has been hounding her. The reporter tries to extort her for sex, whereupon she shoots him. Remorseless, she turns herself in to the police for justice.</p></div> </blockquote> <p>The 70s were a heyday for tabloid newspapers. Printing any scandal, no matter how thin the facts, the tabloids were like the clickbait outrage mills of today. Their reach was wide and deep: the NEWS of the novel was a depiction in all but name of the leading tabloid in Germany, BILD, which printed six million copies every day, purchased by one in ten Germans. To be depicted unfavorably in BILD was social execution, and – as a paper dealing primarily in outrage and gossip – BILD executed plenty. Capricious and careless, their reporters had the power to ruin lives effectively at random.</p> <p>That sounds a lot like getting cancelled: for effectively no fault of your own, the outrage mob, whether online or offline, can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak#Vocabulary">unperson</a> you. While today’s media are global and more plentiful, it’s not clear that there’s been a net change in impact. Getting smeared by your local tabloid was just as radioactive as is getting smeared on Reddit, a career-ender all the same. Further, even though traditional, local media has a much smaller reach than global media, its local reach is what really matters to the person affected. Local media has a much deeper local reach, and a much greater capacity to “investigate” and report locally. While modern media operate at much greater scale, it also carries a dilutive effect. Net-net, people have always been getting disgraced, and I don’t think it’s much likelier now than it was in the past.</p> <p>In my view, cancel culture is an example of a pattern I like to call <em>there’s nothing new under the sun</em>: there are always scary changes between generations, but usually they are just new manifestations of issues as old as time. For example, many people today complain that the young spend less time on necessary schoolwork than the previous generation. But even Socrates said the exact same thing. In many domains, perceptions of progress have been pessimistic since antiquity – perhaps because memories of times past are always rose-colored by nostalgia – but reality works out.</p> <p>If today’s severity and randomness of cancel culture is not actually new, is it different in any important respects? Today’s cancel culture is one of escalating purity tests: born out of the more punitive contingents on the left, it’s not enough to not be a racist or a sexist, but one must take stronger, more condemnatory views, which function as powerful in-group signals.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Cancel culture is thus somewhat performative, and strongly ideologically motivated – some people are likening it to the witch hunts for communists in the 50s under Joseph McCarthy. The left is in a curious, self-damaging position, where lots of center-leaning moderates – who are genuine progressives – are not meeting the ideological standards of those further left, which functions to their exclusion, thereby weakening the left overall.</p> <p>Is that bad? Yes, probably. While I view the aims of social justice as largely correct and well-intentioned, cancel culture seems to produce unnecessary collateral damage that hurts its own cause. It both fragments the left – infighting over purity is a devastating waste in a time beset by serious problems requiring collective action – and it is unfair to the people it ultimately affects. But is any of this new? I don’t think it is. It’s the same old patterns and motivations under new cover. Thus, like everyone else, we acknowledge cancel culture as a trend, but unlike everyone else, we see it as a trend that is very <em>old</em> rather than <em>new</em>. In turn, the question we ask about is radically different: while everyone else asks “how has technology given rise to cancel culture”, we know that it hasn’t, and instead ask “how can we use technology to mitigate cancel culture?”</p> <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

    <p>This essay is a summary and exploration of Jimmy Song's <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/">Programming Bitcoin</a> in Clojure. The book's coding exercises are in Python, and as I am learning both Python and Clojure currently, I thought it would be fun to translate the exercises from Python to Clojure.</p><p>We start with finite fields. But why are they important to learning how to program Bitcoin? Well, Jimmy wants to teach us all the fundamentals so we know how Bitcoin's underlying components work. And guess what's at the heart of it all? That's right: finite fields.</p><p>Finite fields, along with elliptic curves (the topic covered in the next chapter), form the basis of the signing and verification algorithms that make Bitcoin transactions work, which are the atomic unit of value transfer of the network. So it's important to understand finite fields first before we learn the more advanced stuff built on top.</p><h2 id="finite-field-definition">Finite Field Definition</h2><p>A finite field is a set of finite numbers of length $$p$$ otherwise known as the order of the set, which satisfies the following properties:</p><p><strong>1. Closed property</strong></p><ul><li><p>If $$a$$ and $$b$$ are in the set then $$a * b$$ and $$a + b$$ are also in the set.</p></li><li><p>This means that we have to define addition and multiplication in a way that ensures the results stay within the set.</p></li><li><p>$${0, 1, 2}$$ is not closed under normal addition because $$1 + 2 = 3$$ and $$3$$ is not in the set.</p></li><li><p>$${-1, 0, 1}$$ is closed under normal addition and multiplication because no matter how you add or multiply the numbers, they will always be in the set.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Additive identity</strong></p><ul><li>$$0$$ exists and has the property that $$ a + 0 = a$$.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Multiplicative identity</strong></p><ul><li>$$1$$ exists and has the property that $$a * 1 = a$$. This is called the multiplicative identity.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Additive inverse</strong></p><ul><li>If $$a$$ is in the set then $$-a$$ is also in the set and is defined by the value that makes $$a + (-a) = 0$$.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Multiplicative inverse</strong></p><ul><li>If $$a$$ is in the set then $$a^{1}$$ is also in the set and is defined by the value that makes $$ a * a^{-1} = 1 $$.</li></ul><h2 id="defining-finite-sets">Defining Finite Sets</h2><p>Finite fields always have a prime order $$p$$ and the set will include integers between $$0$$ and $$p - 1$$, so:</p><p>$$F_p = {0, 1, 2, ... p-1}$$</p><p>And a finite field of prime order $$7$$ would look like this:</p><p>$$F_7 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$$</p><h2 id="constructing-a-finite-field-in-clojure">Constructing a Finite Field in Clojure</h2><p>We're interested in modelling finite field elements for later use with elliptic curves. So to do that in Clojure we will define a record called FieldElement. For those unfamiliar with Clojure records, they are like a map or Python dictionary or JavaScript object. While they look like a map, you define the fields upfront like so:</p><pre><code>(defrecord FieldElement [e p])
</code></pre><p>Here, <code>e</code> refers to the integer representing the field element and <code>p</code> is the prime order of the finite field for that element. But we need a way to construct a valid <code>FieldElement</code> such that the element is between <code>0</code> and <code>p - 1</code> and that the prime number supplied is, in fact, prime.</p><p>Checking if a number is within a certain interval is trivial, but checking if a number is prime is a bit more involved. While we could use trial and error to check if the prime shares any divisors other than 1, this method does not scale up as well as it could, since the size of the problem grows linearly as we keep testing the input iteratively.</p><p>Alternatively, we could use <em>Fermat's Primality Test</em>, which allows us to prove an integer as a composite with 100% accuracy or as a prime with a very high degree of accuracy. It is based on <em>Fermat's Little Theorem</em>, which will prove useful later as well. _Fermat's Little Theore_m gives us a known pattern that all primes and very few composites follow. It asserts that given some prime number $$p$$ and some other integer $$a$$:</p><p>$$a^{p} \mod p = a$$</p><p>It can also be written as:</p><p>$$a^{p-1} \mod p = 1$$</p><p>If you do $$a^{p} \mod p$$ and it returns anything other than $$a$$, you have what is called a composite witness—proof that the $$p$$ we chose cannot be prime. If you are not familiar with the modulo operator, we will be covering it soon, so don't worry. Anyways, the test works like this:</p><p>We take an integer $$p$$ whose primality we want to check as the input, then we generate a random integer $$a$$ in the range $$0 \leq a \leq p - 1$$. And then we can ask if $$a^p \mod p$$ returns $$a$$, if the answer is not $$a$$, then we know for sure it is a composite number and we can return that. If it does return $$a$$, we still do not know for sure that $$p$$ is prime. This is because of the fact that some composite numbers return $$a$$ for <em>Fermat's Primality Test</em>, and these are called Carmichael numbers, otherwise known as pseudoprimes. And the values for $$a$$ that show Carmichael numbers are primes are called fools because they fool us into thinking $$p$$ is prime when it is not.</p><p>To get over this hurdle, we can choose many different values for $$a$$, and this way we find many composite witnesses instead of values of $$a$$. It has been proven that the number of fools must divide the total size of the group we select from. What this means is that, at most, 50% of the elements in a finite field can be fools. And since $$a$$ is chosen randomly, the chance of finding a composite witness is at least 50%, and so after $$t$$ iterations, the probability no composite will be found with a composite number is at most $$\leq 1/2^t$$. So after $$50$$ iterations, the probability of mistakenly outputting a prime is $$1$$ in $$1125899906842624$$.</p><p>Fermat's test is much more efficient than simply checking greatest common divisors as the number of steps does not scale with the input. It is a logarithmic algorithm with a time complexity of $$O(log_2n)$$, meaning that the problem size splits in half each time the input size increases.</p><p>Here's how you would implement it in Clojure:</p><pre><code>(defn modpow [b e m] 
  (mod (reduce #(mod (* %1 %2) m) (repeat e b)) m))

(defn fermat-test
  "Integer -&gt; Boolean"
  [p]
  (let [a (inc (rand-int (dec p)))]
    (= (modpow a p p) a)))

(defn prime? 
  "Integer -&gt; Boolean"
  [p]
  (every? true? (take 50 (repeatedly #(fermat-test p)))))
  
(println (prime? 6))
(println (prime? 5))
</code></pre><p>We first define a modulo exponential function <code>modpow</code> to do modular exponentiation (we'll discuss this later), then the actual primality test <code>fermat-test</code>, and finally the <code>prime?</code> function, which runs <code>fermat-test</code> 50 times to be sure that our input is truly prime.</p><p>Now let's make a constructor function that creates a valid field element:</p><pre><code>(defn make-field-element 
  "Integer Integer -&gt; FieldElement"
  [e p]
  (if (and (&lt;= 0 e) (&lt; e p) (prime? p))
    (FieldElement. e p)
    (println "Invalid input")))

(println (make-field-element -1 19))
(println (make-field-element 3 18))
(println (make-field-element 12 19))
</code></pre><p>All we're doing here is making sure our element <code>e</code> is from <code>0</code> up to, but not including, <code>p</code> before creating the <code>FieldElement</code>, otherwise we notify our user that their input is invalid. Ideally, you'd want to raise errors with custom messages for each validation but we're going to keep it relatively simple in this demo.</p><h2 id="modulo-arithmetic">Modulo Arithmetic</h2><p>Modulo arithmetic is one of the tools to make finite field <strong>closed</strong> under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If you aren't familiar with the modulo operator, it just gives the remainder of a division:</p><p>$$27 \mod 7 = 6$$.</p><p>It can be useful to think of modulo as wrap-around mathematics or clock math. No matter how many hours you add to a time, the result will always be between 0h and 12h (inclusive). Similarly, the result of the modulo operation will always be between 0 and the divisor. Here are a couple exercises for you to try:</p><p><strong>a)</strong> What is 46 hours from 3 o clock?</p><p>$$(46 + 3) \mod 12$$</p><p><strong>b)</strong> What time was it 18 hours ago?</p><p>$$(9 - 18) \mod 12$$</p><p><strong>c)</strong> What time will it be 98 minutes from now?</p><p>$$(2 + 98) \mod 60$$</p><p>Modulo properties make it very useful for bringing very large numbers into a relatively small range. For example:</p><p>$$28634972342763428 \mod 18 = 8$$.</p><p>Modulo is used to define field arithmetic as most finite field operations use the modulo operator in some capacity. Now let's see how we use them to define new versions of addition and subtraction under a prime order.</p><h2 id="finite-field-addition-and-subtraction">Finite Field Addition and Subtraction</h2><p>To define finite field addition, we need to make sure that the result is still in the set—that it is <strong>closed</strong>. So we can use what we just learned, modulo arithmetic, to make addition closed:</p><p>$$a+_fb=(a+b) \mod p$$ where $$a, b \in F_p$$</p><p>We denote finite field operations like $$+_f$$ with $$_f$$ to avoid confusion with normal integer addition: $$+$$. And the symbol $$\in$$ just means "is an element of", so in this case the statement above is only valid when $$a$$ and $$b$$ are both in the field $$F$$ with a prime order of $$p$$.</p><p>By using modulo arithmetic, we guarantee that the result of this operation will always be in the field. So for $$F_19$$, we can define its addition operation as:</p><p>$$a+_fb=(a+b) \mod 19$$</p><p>And so, you can try these two examples:</p><p><strong>d)</strong> $$14+_f8=(14+8) \mod 19$$</p><p><strong>e)</strong> $$16+_f3=(16+3) \mod 19$$</p><p>If you did these exercises correctly, you could see that the results are both in the set, even though under normal addition, the results would be out of the bounds of the set. Now, with finite field addition, we can take any two numbers in the set, add them, and wrap around the end of the set to get the sum. We are creating our own addition operator so the results are do not submit easily to our intuitive sense of addition.</p><p>And if you remember the additive inverse, which we defined as $$a + (-a) = 0$$, because $$a \in F_p$$ implies that $$-_fa \in F_p$$, we can also define it as so:</p><p>$$-_fa = (-a) \mod p$$</p><p>And for $$F_{19}$$:</p><p>$$-_f9 = (-9) \mod 19 = 10$$</p><p>This means that:</p><p>$$9+_f10 = 0$$</p><p>Which turns out to be true.</p><p>So, similarly, we can define field subtraction, …</p></div></div>

are great, attendees are friendly, and it takes place right next to the beach in
Santa Monica. Not too shabby 😎</p>

<p>One problem I always have, though, is that there are some great talks on the
schedule that I end up missing.</p>

<p>So this year I decided to go back and watch <strong>all 44 talks</strong> from last
year’s con, AppSec Cali 2019, and <strong>write a detailed summary</strong> of their key points.</p>

<p>If I had realized how much time and effort this was going to be at the beginning
I probably wouldn’t have done it, but by the time I realized that this endeavor
would take hundreds of hours, I was already too deep into it to quit 😅</p>

<p><strong>Attending AppSec Cali 2020</strong><br>
If you’re attending AppSec Cali this year come say hi! I’m <a href="https://appseccalifornia2020.sched.com/event/XLvs/an-opinionated-guide-to-scaling-your-companys-security?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no">giving a talk</a> and would be happy to chat about all things security.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-this-post">What’s in this Post</h2>

<p>This post is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#stats">Stats</a>: Some high level stats and trends- which talk categories were most popular? Which companies gave the most talks?</li>
  <li><a href="#overview-of-talks">Overview of Talks</a>: A quick rundown of every talk in a few lines each, so you can quickly skim them and find the talks that are most directly relevant to you.</li>
  <li><em>Summaries</em>: detailed summaries of each talk, grouped by category.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the navigation bar on the left hand side, which will enable you to quickly
jump to any talk.</p>

<div><p><strong>Feedback Welcomed!</strong><br>
If you’re one of the speakers and I’ve left out something important, please let me know! I’m happy to update this. Also, feel free to let me know about any spelling or grammar errors or broken links.</p><p>
If you find DevSecOps / scaling really interesting, I’d love to chat about what
you do at your company / any tips and tricks you’ve found useful. Hit me up on
Twitter, LinkedIn, or email.</p></div>

<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>

<p>In total, AppSec Cali 2019 had <strong>44 talks</strong> that were a combined <strong>~31.5</strong> hours of video.</p>

<p>Here are the talks grouped by the category that I believed was most fitting:</p>

    <figcaption>
      Not too much of a surprise here: you’d expect defense (blue team) talks to be emphasized at an OWASP conference, as was web security.

    </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>We can also see that containers and Kubernetes were fairly popular topics
(3).</p>

<p>Some things I found surprising were how many talks there were on threat modeling
(4) and account security (4), and how there were only 3 primarily cloud
security-focused talks. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that there were 3 talks on securing
third-party code, with Slack discussing the steps they took to evaluate <a href="https://tldrsec.com/#slack-app-security-securing-your-workspaces-from-a-bot-uprising">Slack
bots</a> and
<a href="#securing-third-party-applications-at-scale">Salesforce</a> discussing the review
process on their AppExchange.</p>

<p>Here we see Netflix crushing it: they had presence on a panel, gave one of the
keynotes, and collectively had 3 <em>other</em> talks. And of these 5 talks, 3 made my
top 10 list. Not too shabby 👍</p>

<p>In second place, we see Segment coming in strong!</p>

<p>Netflix, Segment, and Dropbox were on at least one panel, while the rest of the
companies listed had separate talks.</p>

<p>For your ease of navigation, this section groups all of the talks by category, gives a high
description of what they’re about, and provides a link to jump right to their

<p>Note: the talks in each category are listed in alphabetical order, not in my
order of preference.</p>

<h3 id="my-top-10-talks">My Top 10 Talks</h3>
<p>This section lists my top 10 favorite talks from AppSec Cali 2019 ❤️</p>

<p>It was
incredibly difficult narrowing it down to just 10, as there were so many good
talks. All of these talks were selected because they are information-dense with
detailed, actionable insights. I guarantee you’ll learn something useful from
them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Code quality is incredibly important for the long term maintainability of any software project. This holds no matter the size of the project. It's just more obvious in bigger projects. </p><p>Usually, high code quality and readability standard are ensured by the process of peer code review. Of course, this is mainly applicable to bigger size project / companies. What about smaller / indie projects? Or even in bigger projects, why waste the valuable time of more experienced engineers for commenting on styling or trivial corrections?</p><p>This is where static analysis tools and linters come into play. Android Studio, and IntelliJ in general, provide some basic formatting / linting functionality. But using a couple more external tools could easily increase the code quality of your project without too much trouble. </p><p>In this post, I will focus on <a href="https://detekt.github.io/detekt/index.html#">Detekt</a> and <a href="https://ktlint.github.io/">Ktlin</a> which are some of the most popular tools for Kotlin.</p><h2 id="detekt">Detekt</h2><p>Detekt is a static analysis mainly for detecting "code smells" (i.e. code patterns that might lead to trouble in the future). I think of it as a an automated senior engineer that reviews my code: it warns me that this might work for now but it could lead to problems later. Up to me to decide if I will proceed or fix it now.</p><h3 id="setup">Setup</h3><p>If you are using Android Studio / IntelliJ there's a very convenient <a href="https://github.com/detekt/detekt-intellij-plugin">IntelliJ plugin</a> that I highly recommend. If not, it comes as a <a href="https://detekt.github.io/detekt/index.html#quick-start-with-gradle">Gradle plugin</a>, but the IDE integration will make the experience so much easier.</p><p>After installing, enable the IntelliJ Plugin by going to <code>Preferences -&gt; Tools -&gt; Detekt</code> and check all the options that suit your needs.</p><figure><img src="https://www.rockandnull.com/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-17.49.12.png"></figure><p>After enabling the plugin, whatever it detects will be highlighted like an error / warning in the IDE. The only downside is that it does not support auto-applying of fixes; you will manually have to fix the issues :)</p><h3 id="rule-sets">Rule sets</h3><p>Detekt comes with a big list of <a href="https://detekt.github.io/detekt/comments.html">rule sets</a>. These are the things that the tool will highlight. They are grouped into categories, such as styling, performance, etc. You can customize the rules or turn off some of them (or some categories). </p><p>By default, all of them are enabled. In my experience, it's almost certain that you will need some customization of these rules. For instance, I tend to use <code>// TODO</code> comments for future work (yes, I do them, most of the time). Dekekt by default considers this a code smell ... and I disagree :)</p><p>This is the <a href="https://github.com/detekt/detekt/blob/master/detekt-core/src/main/resources/default-detekt-config.yml">default config</a> of Detekt. When something is highlighted that you wish to customize, just go in the default config file and search for the rule id (to find the rule set it belongs, in this case <code>style</code>). Then create your <code>detekt-config.yml</code>, declare it in the IntelliJ plugin preferences (see above) and you are done (don't forget to have checked the <code>Build upon the default configuration</code> option, to inherit the default config).</p><p>Then turn off, or customize, your rules:</p><figure><pre><code>style:
  ForbiddenComment:
    active: false</code></pre><figcaption>detekt-config.yml</figcaption></figure><p>For <a href="https://detekt.github.io/detekt/suppressing-rules.html">one-of disabling of rules</a>, you can use the standard <code>@Suppress</code> annotation.</p><h2 id="ktlint">Ktlint</h2><p>Ktlint is a linter, meaning that it is mainly concentrated in finding (and fixing) styling errors. </p><p>I love that the philosophy of the tool is to have no configuration if possible. They aim to have <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint#standard-rules">sensible default rules</a>, and in my experience, they accomplish that. I didn't have to change the default rules and I didn't find an annoying one.</p><h3 id="set-up">Set up</h3><p>There are many ways of installing the tool. You can install the <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint#installation">command-line tool</a>, or choose integration with <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint#-with-maven">Maven</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint#-with-gradle">Gradle</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint#-with-intellij-idea">IntelliJ / Android Studio</a>.</p><p>For IntelliJ / Android Studio you change the coding style so the build-in IDE formating tool will produce Ktlint-compatible code.</p><figure><pre><code>ktlint applyToIDEAProject</code></pre><figcaption>Run in the root folder to change IntelliJ coding style of the <strong>current project</strong></figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>ktlint applyToIDEA
</code></pre><figcaption>For changing IntelliJ coding style of <strong>all projects</strong></figcaption></figure><h3 id="usage">Usage</h3><p>The most convenient way to use the tool is to ask it to check your code and autocorrect the issues, if possible. Since most of the rules are styling related, there's no way that this will break your code.</p><figure><pre><code>ktlint -F</code></pre><figcaption>Run in your root folder to lint <strong>and </strong>auto-fix all Kotlin files</figcaption></figure><p>For not forgetting to check your code, there's a Git pre-commit hook that runs before committing code and blocks you if there's an error. </p><figure><pre><code>ktlint installGitPreCommitHook</code></pre><figcaption>Run to install a pre-commit hook (<code>ktlint</code> will run before <code>git commit</code> automatically)</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, to <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint#how-do-i-suppress-an-error-for-a-lineblockfile">suppress the lint check</a>, just comment with this "magic" text.</p><pre><code>// ktlint-disable

- or -

/* ktlint-disable */
...
/* ktlint-disable */</code></pre><p>In short, I think that spending 5 minutes of your time installing these tools can lead to higher code quality for the rest of your project life (may that be long!). Healthy coding!</p>

		<p><em>This is a guest post from Adam Leventhal. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>I love software engineering. Even as excited as I was to start my first job, I didn’t imagine the deep and enduring joy it would bring. In my career, I’ve oscillated closer and farther from writing code, and while management and entrepreneurship are wonderful, there’s nothing like the pure joy of building software.</p>
<p>Building great products takes a team. Code is a critical piece, but that doesn’t mean you need to stick to your narrow lane. Yes, developers write code, product managers write specs, doc writers write docs, marketing writes slides, sales sells, support supports, etc. Focus is important, but it’s a myth that doing your job well requires focus at the expense of understanding the holistic view of how products are built. Understanding the full product lifecycle–from conception, to purchase, install, and support–will make you better at your job and lead to better products.</p>
<p>One of the first things I worked on professionally was a product called DTrace. It’s a tracing tool to help understand how systems operate. It’s used to find bugs, chase down performance problems, or explore how a code base operates. I was drawn to the project early on because of the extremely precise and creative engineering required to safely instrument running programs and kernels. It was all very cool, very satisfying. An extremely formative moment in my career came when I was demonstrating an early DTrace prototype to a customer. We used this new lens into their software to understand behaviors that had always been mysterious to them. Their ideas came one on top of the next as we exposed all kinds of crazy behaviors and pathologies on the fly. I had seen the power and utility of what I had built in my own use, and my team’s use. Seeing a customer–and engineers quite different from me–get so fired up was eye opening. I still wanted to build cool stuff and write hard code, but understanding the problems it solved and the people who used it informed my work from then on.</p>
<p>There were three engineers working on DTrace. We were our own product management. We built features we needed to solve urgent problems for ourselves and customers. We were our own marketing, giving talks and writing blog posts. We were our own doc writers, churning out a hefty users guide. Those activities weren’t downstream of development, they were an integral part of it. When building a feature, we talked about how to explain it to sales people, to users, to support engineers. Sometimes that meant changing what we had planned to build: if you can’t write the documentation for a feature you’re probably building the wrong feature.</p>
<p>Almost a decade later I joined a new team that could not have been more different. The development team was comfortable in their ignorance of the broader product. They didn’t just stick to the code, they were narrowly focused on just their own <strong>subsection</strong> of the code. In the Solaris Kernel team where we built DTrace, we would follow bugs up and down the stack, through multiple, enormous code bases, to determine the root cause of problems. Here, developers were content to chase a problem to the edge of the module they owned, and then reassign the bug to the developer who owned the next module. The team barely had a shared understanding of what they were building, much less of that true north of customer need. That gap was evident in the end product: modules were poorly integrated and features fell short of solving customer problems.</p>
<p>Whatever you’re working on, understand not just what’s needed, but why. Listen in on a sales call, talk to a customer, or do a ride-along with a support engineer working on an escalation. Some companies have great programs to involve engineers in the broader product lifecycle. If yours doesn’t it’s probably (hopefully!) because no one has asked. Empathy is an engineer’s greatest asset: empathy for the customer to understand their problems and priorities; empathy for the doc writer trying to explain a complex feature; empathy for the next engineer to pick up your code and make sense of it. Empathy starts from a curiosity to understand what and why.</p>
<p>Find true north for the products you work on. It will make your work better and bring you more satisfaction.</p>

        <p>A few years back doing front-end work, especially on the web, was rather simple compared to the back-end where all the app logic used to reside. Nowadays, that changed. Front-end development has evolved thanks to powerful frameworks and libraries,  supported by the evolution of the browsers and their respective APIs. In a modern web application, the front-end plays a crucial role, where not only front-end developers are dealing with the presentation, but also with logic, and algorithms implementations.</p>
<p>With all these new challenges into the picture, how do we, as front-end developers, can stay up to date with the latest, and learn more in deep the languages and frameworks that we use to build amazing app experiences?</p>
<p>Let me walk you through 5  things you should be doing to master the front-end development</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="learn-a-bit-about-back-end">Learn a bit about back-end</h2>
<p>With the increased focus on user experience and usability, the importance of front-end has been increasing, and problems that traditionally were handled in the back-end are now being shifted to the front-end. It is also true that while front-end is reducing the complexity of the back-end in some areas, back-end is also evolving and specializing, introducing a new set of challenges for back-end developers.</p>
<p>As some of these problems are shifted to the front-end, having experience in how back-end deal with them, can be of great help when implementing solutions in our code. It is also true, that traditionally it was more important for the back-end to have more concepts from algorithms and data structures, while front-end was all about CSS+HTML, but now having that kind of knowledge is crucial for any front-end developer. So learn back-end, to be a better front-end developer.</p>
<p>But that’s not the only reason why learning back-end development is important, maybe even more important is to do it for the team. Teams can achieve greater collaboration when both sides sort of “speak the same language” and understand each other points of view. And you can even tackle some work from back-end to help out.</p>
<p>Front-end or Back-end, we are all developers, and we can help each other out as part of the same team.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="practice-practice-and-practice-some-more">Practice, practice and practice some more</h2>
<p>To master any skill you need practice. Period. And this is particularly true for development. It is indeed true that we can acquire knowledge through books or posts like this, but if you want to master the art of development, you will have to code a lot.</p>
<p>Is it all practice good? Maybe not, practice new things, do coding challenges, sign up to hacker rank and smash it! Work on open source projects, re-write all projects, see what you can do better, etc.</p>
<p>Practice also by reading other people’s code, check out that amazing open source project you like so much, see how they do things, play with their code, it can introduce you to new points of view, patterns, designs, etc.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="let-others-review-your-code">Let others review your code</h2>
<p>If you truly want to master front-end development (or development in general) you need to find people who will review your code. When we write code for ourselves, or when no one questions our code, sure, we can get better as we learn and practice more, but it will be a slow process. By having someone with more experience, or maybe just a different point of view review your code, you can learn from their experience as well.</p>
<p>But for this strategy to be effective, you have to trust whoever is doing the review, and you need to be able to admit when you are wrong. Sometimes it is hard as development can be very opinionated and there could be more than one solution to a problem, but if we want to learn from others, we need to accept when our solution wasn’t the best.
I’m not saying you should accept any change mentioned by your reviewer, but start a dialog with him/her, expose each other’s points, and then decide if you incorporate the feedback or not. Both sides, the reviewer and the reviewed can learn from this interaction.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="learn-about-design">Learn about design</h2>
<p>Design, user experience, and technology work together to deliver great products. Designers are amazing at building the best screens, and interactions, and animations, in their own tools. And it’s your work as a front-end developer to transform that into products. Having a good understanding of design can help you bring the two worlds together, and increase the collaboration between designers and developers.</p>
<p>The product will be as good as its design and how its implemented, thus the communication between designers and front-end developers is crucial so that the code can reproduce the designer’s vision for the app.</p>
<p>And if in your team you have no designers, maybe you should consider getting one, but if that’s out of the question, knowing basic design concepts can help you build much better apps for your users.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hang-out-with-awesome-people">Hang out with awesome people</h2>
<p>We are social creatures after all, and learning or practicing a new skill can be easier and more fun when you have somebody who’s awesome at something, and who can point you at the right things and in the right direction.</p>
<p>Do your networking, include other developers in your circle, but also designers, bloggers, architects, product owners, etc… There’s something you can learn from everybody.</p>
<p>And finally, you can be a model for others as well. For me, it was crucial when I started to always have someone who was there to support me. From people I hang out with, to strangers in amazing communities, to bloggers and YouTubers who produced content for people like me. It’s amazing how many people are willing to help. And for me… writing for this blog, and all I do is my way to continue building the community that made me the developer I’m today.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mastering the front-end is not about knowing all the functions in a framework or language, nor about writing perfect code, but learning to listen to others, know how to look for solutions to the problems, and have a good amount of experience. Rely on your team, and other fellow developers to help you out.</p>
<p>Note to be made, I’m still mastering my front-end and back-end skills, it’s a never-ending game, but I enjoy it every day!</p>
<p>Is there any area I discussed that you like the most? Or perhaps you see another point I could have listed? Please let me know in the comments. I’d love to hear about it.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    </h2>
    <hr>
    <a href="http://stormrider.io/index.html">blog index</a><br>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Happy to report that <a href="https://discourse.maas.io/t/maas-2-8-released/1716">MAAS 2.8 dropped today</a>. It's a step up for <a href="https://maas.io/">Metal-as-a-Service (MAAS)</a>, since it allows MAAS to manage VM hosts created using <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/">LXD</a>. I like it because I prefer LXD to other container systems, but that's actually a personal choice.  Telling the truth is kind of a big deal at Canonical, which is part of the reason I work here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been working on MAAS since sometime in September last year, when I started getting interested in it.  Currently, I have a "kitchen-table datacenter" set up at home, which includes four laptops and a switch.  Here's a pic of part of my setup:
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/maas-ktdc.jpg">
    </center>
    <p>
      The front laptop is <code>wintermute</code>, my MAAS host, while the one behind is <code>neuromancer</code>, with a couple of the VMs loaded there running.  They're both 8GB RAM, 4 cores, so they can realiably run about 3-4 VMs each before they drown.  You can tell from the networking cables that, given my lack of space on this table, there are two other laptops to the right (<code>stormrider-yoga</code>) and left (<code>WA5149</code>, my SWL callsign -- the laptop that runs my shortwave listening station).  Yes, it's a mess of cables, but that's what you get when you're always shifting hardware around.
    </p>
    <h3>
      why i like this release
    </h3>
    <p>
      For me personally, the LXD-based VMs are nice because there's a much better API than the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/virtualization-libvirt">libvirt-based</a> KVMs we've been using.  We're still using KVMs, too, and for most people the choice will be moot (for right now, anyway). But I prefer the look and feel of LXD for most things, so I'm loading this update.
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, I should say "installing;" I don't ever get rid of old versions, so my only upgrades are done so that I can write about the process (I'm the doc guy, if you couldn't guess).  It's a pretty <a href="https://maas.io/docs/install-from-a-snap">straightforward installation</a> for an infrastructure product like this one.  For the last two releases, it's been installable by snap or debian package, and I prefer the snap.
    </p>
    <h3>loading up MAAS</h3>
    <p>
      My first mission is to find or create a new LXD container to run it in:
      </p><pre>stormrider@wintermute:~$ lxc list
      </pre>
      <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/lxc-list.jpg">
      <p>
	If you don't have lxc, you can <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/getting-started/">find it here</a>. But once you have it, it's just a matter of creating a new container, specifying the OS in the process:
      </p>
      <pre>stormrider@wintermute:~$ lxc launch ubuntu:18.04 maas-2-8-testcase
Creating maas-2-8-testcase
Starting maas-2-8-testcase
      </pre>
      <p>
	Then you'll find your new, running container ready to use:
      </p>
      <pre>stormrider@wintermute:~$ lxc list
      </pre>
      <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/testcase-running.jpg">
      <p>
	I need to enter the container to do the install, like this:
      </p>
      <pre>stormrider@wintermute:~$ lxc exec maas-2-8-testcase bash
root@maas-2-8-testcase:~# 
      </pre>
      Once I'm in, I can start the <a href="https://maas.io/docs/install-from-a-snap">install</a>:
    
    <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/maas-snap-install.jpg">
    <p>
      And once it's done, I can check my work like this:
    </p>
    <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/snap-list.jpg">
    <h3>
      configuring for production
    </h3>
    <p>
      This version of MAAS offers two configurations: one has a companion snap with a small database, for testing purposes; the other uses the PostgreSQL on localhost, so there's no scaling problems.  Since I have about 106 machines on four different computers scattered around the room, I'm going for production.  I won't repost every step of the procedure, since I've <a href="https://maas.io/docs/install-from-a-snap#heading--init-prod">already documented it</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one "gotcha" here (sort of) is when you have to enter:
      </p><pre>sudo maas init region+rack \
--database-uri \
"postgres://$MAAS_DBUSER:$MAAS_DBPASS@$HOSTNAME/$MAAS_DBNAME"
      </pre>
      because the $HOSTNAME really just needs to be "localhost" if you're installing everything on the same machine, like I am.  That part really isn't obvious.  Somebody ought to fix that.  Oh, wait, that's my job, sorry.
    
    <p>
      This step gives me a MAAS URL of:
      </p><pre>http://10.132.172.15:5240/MAAS
      </pre>
      which is the veth0 in my container.  I also sneaked in a bridge there (192.168.122.2/24) so I can communicate with VM hosts.  You'll forgive my sneaky workmanship, I'm sure.
    
    <p>
      Then I have to create a MAAS user, using <code>sudo maas createadmin</code>.  Actually, in the LXD container, I'm running as root, so the <code>sudo</code> is superfluous, but it's just good practice for me to keep it there all the time.  I'll call my MAAS user <code>admin</code>, with password <code>admin</code>, since that's what I put in the database call.  While I'm at it, I'm going to rename my LXD container to "maas-2-8" after wiping out the old one, because the "testcase" just makes it too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I'll run through the <a href="https://maas.io/docs/configuration-journey">configuration journey</a>, but again, not going to re-post what I've already documented elsewhere.  And I'll <a href="https://maas.io/docs/add-nodes#heading--add-a-node-manually">manually add a machine</a> for good measure.
    </p>
    <h3>
      firing it up
    </h3>
    <p>
      Okay, now I have a fresh MAAS 2.8 install on my laptop.  I'm running Ubuntu 20.04 on this laptop, but you can run MAAS on lots of different configurations.  Let me demonstrate a couple of simple steps, just to show that it works.  First, I'm going to <a href="https://maas.io/docs/commission-nodes">commission</a> my new machine, a process shown in the next few panels:
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      I can also <a href="https://maas.io/docs/deploy-nodes">deploy</a> the machine, once it's been commissioned (and aquired) -- which will lead me to have my own little running Ubuntu 18.04 console in a VM, like this:

    <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/running-vm.jpg">
    <p>
      It's not a giant datacenter yet, but this post is long enough.  Let me see what I can cook up for the next post.

      <p>Someone recently asked about how to deploy Racket web apps on the
Racket Slack.  The most common answers were</p>
<ol>
<li>install Racket on the target machine, then ship your code there or</li>
<li>use Docker (basically a “portable” variant of option 1).</li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to take a few minutes today and write about my preferred way
of deploying Racket apps: build an executable with the application
code, libraries and assets embedded into it and ship that around.  I
prefer this approach because it means I don’t have to worry about
installing a specific version of Racket on the target machine just to
run my code.  In fact, using this approach I can have different
versions of each application, each built with a different version of
Racket and easily switch between them.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe.html">raco exe</a> embeds Racket modules along with the runtime into native
executables for the platform it’s run on.  Take this program for
example:</p>

available on the current machine so it’s not quite ready for

It takes a stand-alone executable created by <code>raco exe</code> and generates
a package containing the executable, dynamic libraries referenced by
it and any run-time files referenced by the app (more on this in a
sec).  The resulting package can then be copied over to other machines
running the same operating system.</p>

running the same version of macOS as I am and it will run unmodified.
The same would be true if I built the code on a Linux machine and then
shipped it to other Linux machines to run on and that’s exactly what I
do when I distribute my web apps.  I have a CI job in every project
that builds and tests the code, then generates distributions that it
copies to the destination servers.</p>
<p>At this point you might be thinking “that’s nice, but what about files
needed by the app at run-time?”  Let’s modify the app so it reads a
file from disk then serves its contents on request:</p>

            Using multi-threading for FizzBuzz is totally over the top but, since C++11, it is really easy to use multiple threads using futures: #include &lt;future&gt; #include &lt;iomanip&gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt;…        </p><!-- .blog-entry-summary -->

As a result, the retina ages faster than other organs, with a 70% ATP reduction over life, causing a significant decline in photoreceptor function as they lack the energy to perform their normal role.</p><p>Researchers built on their previous findings in mice, bumblebees and fruit flies, which all found significant improvements in the function of the retina’s photoreceptors when their eyes were exposed to 670 nanometre (long wavelength) deep red light.</p><p>“Mitochondria have specific light absorbance characteristics influencing their performance: longer wavelengths spanning 650 to 1000nm are absorbed and improve mitochondrial performance to increase energy production,” said Professor Jeffery.</p><p>The retina’s photoreceptor population is formed of cones, which mediate colour vision and rods, which provide peripheral vision and adapt vision in low/dim light.</p><p>For the study, 24 people (12 male, 12 female), aged between 28 and 72, who had no ocular disease, were recruited. All participants’ eyes were tested for the sensitivity of their rods and cones at the start of the study. Rod sensitivity was measured in dark adapted eyes (with pupils dilated) by asking participants to detect dim light signals in the dark, and cone function was tested by subjects identifying coloured letters that had very low contrast and appeared increasingly blurred, a process called colour contrast.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1080"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfa0f5629384ca65ba39a6989cc09429/beb4db66c671a561-60/s1280x1920/51debf645da77092b6af1dd5c931a63ffe6d3947.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1080" width="1280" height="960"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;This is an example of hand held LED torch used in study.

They were then re-tested for their rod and cone sensitivity</p><h2><b>Results</b></h2><p>Researchers found the 670nm light had no impact in younger individuals, but in those around 40 years and over, significant improvements were obtained.</p><p>Cone colour contrast sensitivity (the ability to detect colours) improved by up to 20% in some people aged around 40 and over. Improvements were more significant in the blue part of the colour spectrum that is more vulnerable in ageing.</p><p>Rod sensitivity (the ability to see in low light) also improved significantly in those aged around 40 and over, though less than colour contrast.</p><p>Professor Jeffery said: “Our study shows that it is possible to significantly improve vision that has declined in aged individuals using simple brief exposures to light wavelengths that recharge the energy system that has declined in the retina cells, rather like re-charging a battery.</p><p>"The technology is simple and very safe, using a deep red light of a specific wavelength, that is absorbed by mitochondria in the retina that supply energy for cellular function.</p><p>"Our devices cost about £12 to make, so the technology is highly accessible to members of the public.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurekalert.org%2Fpub_releases%2F2020-06%2Fucl-dei062620.php&amp;t=ZGQwZWM2NTU0MjI5NmFmYmIyMmU5M2U2NTgyNjcwNjRkYTRjZThjNixxWUFGMmRTdA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F622287875646668801%2Fred-light-therapy-eyesight&amp;m=0">University College London</a></b></p><p><b>Full Study:&nbsp;</b>“Optically improved mitochondrial function redeems aged human visual decline”,&nbsp;<i>The Journals of Gerontology</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1093%2Fgerona%2Fglaa155&amp;t=MzM4MDE5NzZiOTE1NjA3YTRjNjA4MjQyMTg1Yjc2YmJjOWUyOWI1NSxxWUFGMmRTdA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F622287875646668801%2Fred-light-therapy-eyesight&amp;m=0">https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaa155</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/190287508747/blue-light-mbti">Blue light could help heal mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)</a></p><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/186713391337/future-of-sight">Stepping into the future of sight</a></p>

These skills are essential to passing a traditional whiteboard coding interview or simply to becoming a better programmer.</p><p>The best books on algorithms gives programmers a common language to talk and think about code. The best books on algorithms also teach us the most important algorithms to plug-and-play or understand algorithm design. With algorithms, we can measure what is effective or less-so. We can have metrics to optimize our code.</p><p>Why do code interviews test your knowledge of algorithms? It shows that you are a good programmer and a good thinker. As programmers, we are ultimately problem-solvers, and common algorithms give us the tools to design solutions to our coding problems.</p><p>As self-taught programmers or as programmers studying for a coding interview, books can help us reach our goals</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>What makes the best books on algorithms? Good algorithms books do several, but perhaps not all, of the following:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>They teach the most important algorithms.</p></li><li><p>They teach with precision and clarity.</p></li><li><p>They have good problems and questions for you to work on your own.</p></li><li><p>They allow you to not just think of algorithms as templates, but allow you to think of and design your own solution based on metrics such as clean code and code efficiency.</p></li><li><p>Friendly toward self-taught programmers. Not too heavy in mathematics. Does not have a high barrier to entry.</p></li><li><p>[Bonus] They have an engaging, conversational style and introduce novelty to keep you interested.</p></li></ul><p>If you know me and <a href="https://booksoncode.com/"><em>Books on Code</em></a>, I am a big advocate of bringing <em>joy</em> into the learning experience. With a heavy topic like algorithms, the texts themselves tend to be heavy and serious as well, easily clocking in at over 1000 pages of dense text. While texts that are dense and academic are in this list for their valuable content and breadth, I also include some titles to remind you that learning can also be fun.</p><h2>Best Books on Algorithms</h2><p>The following books are the best books on algorithms according to the criteria set out in the <em>Overview</em> section.</p><h3>Book 1: <em>Algorithms </em>by Robert Sedgewick</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592848121753_4728"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/032157351X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=032157351X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=ef103bc0f144bb443e11a6741f70ea04"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=032157351X&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=032157351X" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592849025353_14448"><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3eoKCs9" target="_blank"><em>Algorithms</em></a> is a book that delivers on exactly what you want from an <em>algorithms</em> book: clean, simple, straightforward explanations of the most important algorithms. With examples based in Java, the book is well-organized and thorough, reaching nearly 1000 pages.</p><p>For more information about what this book is about, look to the introduction of <em>Algorithms</em>:</p><blockquote><p>This book is intended to survey the most important computer algorithms to use today, and to teach fundamental techniques to the growing number of people in need of knowing them. […] Before developing our fundamental approach to studying algorithms, we develop data types for stacks, queues, and other low-level abstractions that we use throughout the book. Then we survey fundamental algorithms for sorting, searching, graphs, and strings. The last chapter is an overview placing the rest of the material in the book inn a larger context.</p></blockquote><p>I like this. Why? It puts you in the weeds <em>first</em> and saves the theory for later. This is how people learn best. Once we know how to use something, we become hungry for the ‘why,’ but if we get the ‘why’ first, it hardly sticks.</p><p>The book is divided into six of the following chapters:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Chapter 1 </strong>covers fundamentals such as primitive data types, loops, arrays, objects, APIs, linked lists, Tilde notation, and memory usage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 2</strong> covers sorting algorithms such as mergesort and quicksort.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 3</strong> covers searching algorithms and data types such as binary search and hash tables.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 4</strong> covers graph algorithms such as shortest-path algorithms and depth-first search.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 5</strong> covers algorithms related to streams such as string sort, tries, substring search, data compression, and regular expressions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 6</strong> covers topics around context-reliant algorithms such as B-trees, reductions, suffix arrays, and event-driven simulation.</p></li></ul><p>As you may gather from the chapter outline, the book covers “classic methods that have been taught since the 1960s and new methods that have been invented in recent years.” The goal is to reach the widest audience possible with the most important algorithms. To reach that goal, the information is well organized and explained.</p><p>If you are a self-taught programmer, I recommend this book if you are serious about supplementing a traditional computer science course curriculum.</p><h3>Book 2: <em>Introduction to Algorithms </em>(The MIT Press)</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592848121753_7890"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0262033844&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=56f51123fd5297f06c27992df65f4f67"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=0262033844&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0262033844" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592849485204_5238"><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2YoYdtW" target="_blank"><em>Introduction to Algorithms</em></a> is not light for an ‘introduction’. It begins with basics, like defining what ‘pseudocode’ is, but it gets deep. It is not just an algorithm cookbook; it teaches “techniques of algorithm design and analysis so that you can develop algorithms on your own.” This skill is valuable for writing great code — and of course, it’s great for the coding interview. </p><p>The book asks good questions and truly sets the intention to help you have a good and correct philosophy about algorithms. </p><p>The book is divided into only seven of the following chapters:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Chapter 1 covers foundational concepts such as the role of algorithms and some basic algorithms and thoughts of algorithm development like insertion sort, notations, the divide-and-conquer method and randomized algorithms.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 2 covers sorting and order statistics such a Quicksort.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 3 covers data structures such as hash tables and trees.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 4 covers advanced design and analysis techniques such as dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 5 covers advanced data structures such as B-trees, Fibonacci heaps, and disjoint sets.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 6 covers graph algorithms such as Dijkstra’s algorithm.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 7 covers “selected topics” such as multithreaded algorithms, matrix operations, and linear programming.</p></li></ul><p>As you can see from the book’s outline, an ‘introduction’ does not quite cover what this book offers. It goes into ‘advanced’ topics by chapter 4 and it <em>just keeps going</em>. As someone who feels comfortable and confident in the ‘data structures &amp; algorithms’ taught in the classroom, this book helped me see how I can vastly improve as a programmer. This book is recommended not just for beginners but for anyone who is serious about improving in this dimension of programming.</p><h3>Book 3: <em>The Algorithm Design Manual</em></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593459344972_11917"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1848000693/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1848000693&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=dc0c8be3237901ef61cd98e19b06d37d"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=1848000693&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1848000693" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593459344972_13997"><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2BRBBJu" target="_blank"><em>The Algorithms Design Manual</em></a><em> </em>is branded as a reader-friendly guide, which is great for self-taught programmers. The book is designed to take the mystery out of designing algorithms so that you can analyze their efficiency.</p><p>This book is about algorithm <em>design</em>, as the title says. For example, the introduction of the book states that there are three desirable properties for a good algorithm: <em>correct</em>, <em>efficient</em>, and <em>easy to implement</em>. Memorize this for a programming interview right now.</p><p>A book that focuses on design specifically is extremely valuable for a coding interview, since you can’t just memorize important algorithms, but you need to think and reason around them.</p><p>This book is great for its conversational writing style. Other books that focus on algorithms design use mathematical formulas to explain this concept. This book is friendly to self-taught programmers.</p><p>What content is in this book? Quite a lot. The book is around 700 pages and 19 chapters. The first part of the book, titled “Practical Algorithm Design, covers the following:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Introduction to algorithm design, which covers how to reason about correctness and modeling the problem.</p></li><li><p>Algorithm analysis</p></li><li><p>Data structures</p></li><li><p>Sorting and searching</p></li><li><p>Graph traversal</p></li><li><p>Weighted graph algorithms</p></li><li><p>Combinatorial search and Heuristic methods</p></li><li><p>Dynamic programming</p></li><li><p>Intractable problems and approximation algorithms</p></li></ul><p>The rest of the book focuses on a series of problems, grouped into types such as linear equations and combinatorial problems such as sorting and searching.</p><p>This book is practical, with lots of problems. Even though the book is more reader friendly than other algorithm design books, the text is still heavy. Be prepared to work.</p><h3>Book 4: <em>Grokking Algorithms</em></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592848121753_8864"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617292230/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1617292230&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=d398c85d5dc304028b0657b35d5730da"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=1617292230&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1617292230" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592849025353_15491"><div><p>With charming graphics, <a href="https://amzn.to/2YWMxgZ" target="_blank"><em>Grokking Algorithms</em></a> illustrates common algorithms and data structures that we might learn in a data structures &amp; algorithms class. Some of the concepts covered include Big-O notation, hash tables, trees, quicksort, and recursion — all extremely valuable concepts for writing efficient code and for code interviews.</p><p>I highly <a href="https://booksoncode.com/articles/data-structures-algorithms">recommend <em>Grokking Algorithms</em> for beginner programmers</a> because the guide is brain friendly. What do I mean by brain friendly? Learning is easier for us when books use techniques to engage us: conversational style, direct questions, breakpoints for reflection, and novelty. </p><p>Some of the topics covered in <em>Grokking Algorithms</em>:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Binary search </p></li><li><p>Big O notation </p></li><li><p>Arrays and linked lists </p></li><li><p>Selection sort </p></li><li><p>Recursion </p></li><li><p>Stacks </p></li><li><p>Quicksort </p></li><li><p>Hash tables </p></li><li><p>Breadth-first search</p></li></ul><p>This book does a fantastic job of explaining complex concepts to complete understanding using few pages but <em>extremely clear</em> visual explanations. If you have ever struggled with recursion, just five pages in this book will the concept real quick.</p><h3>Book 5: <em>Cracking the Code Interview</em></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592848121753_9804"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0984782850&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=6bd3a8b0c24bfd09827ae79603a7cba3"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=0984782850&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0984782850" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592849025353_8328"><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3do5LkR" target="_blank"><em>Cracking the Code Interview</em> </a>sets out to do exactly what the title says: crack the code interview.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Tapping and swiping are a very intuitive means for interaction with electronic devices, and as such, have become a very popular mechanism for capturing user input in recent years. Extending touch sensing beyond the confines of a touchscreen means additional instrumentation is required. Whether electrical, optical, or acoustic sensing is employed, it calls for additional setup effort and cost.</p><p><span>A group based at The University of Auckland, New Zealand have developed a method they call </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3397309" rel="nofollow">ActualTouch</a><span> that enables touch gestures to be collected from a large number of unmodified, everyday surfaces. The device itself is a tiny inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor attached to a fingertip. Specifically, they redesigned a SparkFun MPU9250 IMU breakout board to achieve a smaller (7mm x 9mm) form factor.</span></p><p>The basic theory of operation resulted from the observation that a finger held in the air exhibits microvibrations, and these microvibrations stop when the finger rests on a surface. Similarly, when a finger is moving through the air, it has a tendency to jitter around a bit. When moving across a surface, the finger is more restricted and movement is noticeably smoother. The researchers initially eyeballed some IMU data to confirm that these phenomena were detectable and that the signals appeared to be distinct from one another.</p><p>With signals that appeared to be distinct, it seemed like a task that would be well suited to classification via machine learning. The authors collected data from the IMU sensor with an Arduino Due while performing various gestures. This data was used to train a customized variant of a LeNet convolutional neural network model.  Training took place on a dedicated workstation with two NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPUs.  Testing of the model yielded a very respectable true-positive and true-negative gesture detection rate of 98.6% and 98.5%, respectively.</p><p>Perhaps some of the more obvious applications for ActualTouch are in creating virtual touch surfaces for mixed reality and using any surface in the area to act as a mouse for your laptop. The authors also demonstrated some additional very interesting uses — in one case, they used the back of their smartphone to control a cursor with the hand they were holding it with. The other very interesting use demonstrated was an extension of a smartwatch input surface to the hand and arm around it.  Check out the video below to see ActualTouch in action.</p><figure><figcaption>Demonstration</figcaption></figure></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Throughout the duration of my career, I’ve noticed that you can divide engineers into two groups, <strong>primitive engineers</strong> and <strong>product engineers</strong>. The primitive engineers enjoy building primitives that are used within various systems. A primitive<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> is a building block<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> of software that can be used by other pieces of software to build a larger part of a system. Examples of these primitives could be anything from an internal database<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>, a rate limiting service, or even something such as a job queuing service. The other group, product engineers, then use these primitives while building out systems and products for their end-users. These engineers are the ones who work more closely with product managers and designers in order to build a product for users.</p>

<p>In my career, I’ve always leaned towards product engineering, because I enjoy being close to the user. When I worked on the Networking Products team at DigitalOcean and helped build the Cloud Firewalls and Virtual Private Cloud products, people often assume that I helped build the firewall and VPC daemons that live on the hypervisors. In reality, other engineers created the primitives that talked to the hypervisors and handled the networking rules. Then my team used these primitives in order to create a product for our users. Our systems had the responsibility of storing and updating the state of things such as firewall rules and making sure they were applied correctly on the hypervisor, while also ensuring that they were correctly being shown back to the user. It’s a joint collaboration between the primitive engineers and the product engineers, everybody has a part.</p>

<p>There is an intersection of product and primitive engineering (often in the cloud computing space), in which a primitive is so valuable internally that it is open-sourced and/or developed into a product for customers. This is how various software and products were released to the public, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/">Google Cloud Spanner</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a><sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. What makes this intersection interesting is when a primitive is first created but then transforms into a full-fledged product offering, it indirectly causes the primitive engineer to assume a hybrid role as both a primitive and product engineer.</p>

<p>Expanding more on this thought of primitives as a product, a fair amount of SaaS<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> that is used within developer tooling can be thought of as a “primitive as a service”. When developing a product, you have the classic “build” vs. “buy” situation for a lot of functionality. Do you have the time to build your own transactional email service? Proably not. <a href="https://mailgun.com/">Mailgun</a>, <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a>, and <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> are primitives for sending transactional emails. Similarly, <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://braintree.com/">Braintree</a> are primitives for online payments and billing for products. Lastly, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/">Google Cloud Storage</a>, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/">Azure Storage</a> are primitives for object storage. Additionally, a lot of these services have been battle-tested and are known to scale<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>, so it allows engineers to spend more time focusing on building out the actual system and product. Knowing these primitives exist and how to use them is invaluable to all engineers.</p>

<p>While a lot of the focus of this article has been back-end systems focused, this distinction also applies to the front-end as well. From a front-end engineering perspective, this distinction can also be seen, especially when thinking about <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">design systems</a>. In various engineering organizations, there normally are entire teams dedicated to maintaining a design system for the user interfaces<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>. These front-end engineers responsible for building and maintaining the various components of a design system can be seen as primitive engineers. The front-end engineers who then use these components to build out the user interfaces for their products can be seen as product engineers. In some situations, an engineer may both build and maintain these design system components and build out products<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup>, thus becoming a hybrid, similar to what we discussed earlier.</p>

<p>As with a lot of things, product and primitive engineering are not mutually exclusive. A product engineer may build a new primitive for their system that does not yet exist, which can then be extracted and reused across an engineering organization. Or, like we discussed earlier, a primitive engineer may create something that evolves into a product. An engineer may be working on both products and primitives at the same time. In conclusion, while there are differences in what product and primitive engineers create, one is not smarter or better than the other. A healthy and successful engineering organization requires a mixture of both product and primitive engineers, who have a symbiotic relationship. What kind of engineer do you think you are: primitive or product?</p>

        <p><strong>You wouldn’t put together a band where all four musicians played the guitar. <em>Somebody</em> needs to drum and sing. Similarly, QA teams need specialists across a range of skill sets and experience. And that’s just one of the rock-and-roll lessons that creative teams can learn.</strong></p>
<p>Even if you’re a software developer or tester by trade, you might also play a mean guitar in your spare time. Certainly there is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265164952_A_History_of_Programming_and_Music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a long history of synergy between music-making and software</a>. What are the factors behind the synergies? How does one inform the other? And in particular: What can software teams learn from rock bands and other musical groups?</p>
<p>Veteran software pro Kevin Trowbridge played trumpet and guitar in a jazz band when he was in college. He sees connections among mathematics, software, and music. “Qualities shared by musicians and mathematicians are a love of abstraction, extreme attention to detail, and willingness to invest thousands of hours into learning very esoteric skills,” says Trowbridge, who worked on 15 different software teams in the San Francisco area before joining Qwoted as CTO.</p>
<p>Don Gregori, currently COO of First Factory, made similar observations during a company hackathon. “Late at night, I noticed a few developers taking a break, one playing the saxophone. Two others had brought guitars,” he says. “I was surprised at the number of co-workers who played instruments.”</p>
<p>“Music is mathematical with its time signatures, bar measures, scales, intervals and patterns,” Gregori adds. “Software is also mathematical with its reliance on fundamentals such as algorithms and computational science.”</p>
<p>Of course, parallels between musical and software creation hardly end there. Musicians and software pros work both collaboratively and independently. Musicians practice long hours on their own to perfect their craft; so do software developers and testers.</p>
<p>Plus, both musicians and software developers need to hold in their heads both the entire song and the individual notes that comprise it. That’s true of creating software – and the impact you have on the world. Sometimes, accomplishing that feat requires acknowledging contradictions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When I walk out onstage I’ve got to feel like it’s the most important thing in the world. Also I’ve got to feel like, well, it’s only rock and roll. Somehow you’ve got to believe both these things.”<br>
<span>– Bruce Springsteen</span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-qa-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/">Great teamwork matters</a>. One contributor might have an initial idea; then you work together to evolve it into something better. Developers, operations, and testers each bring knowledge to an endeavor – and see themselves as part of a single team.</p>
<p>“I call this the ‘Garcia effect,’” maintains Tom Mercaldo, president of Aquinas Consulting. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj8Q3o2J4A4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Grateful Dead </a>had a unique style of developing music. One band member would say, ‘I am going to do this on the drums,’ and the next would say, ‘I am going to do this on the guitar,’ and then the next would say, ‘Why don’t you try this on the bass?’ And the music they were playing would evolve until it sounded nothing like where they started,” says Mercaldo.</p>
<p>Here are four lessons you can learn from musical groups that might help you manage and inspire a development team.</p>
<h3>1. Aim for more than one ‘axis of diversity’</h3>
<p>A band probably wouldn’t have just four musicians all playing guitars and singing at the same time, right? You wouldn’t put together a rock band of four flute players, four keyboardists, one drummer, and zero guitarists, either. Michael Fritzius, president of Arch DevOps, suggests that understanding of roles and skills is a lesson for managers of software teams.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to have nothing but Java programmers or nothing but people who know Microsoft.NET,” Fritzius elaborates. All developers do programming, and although many testers don’t code, some of them do.</p>
<p>Diversity in tech extends beyond race, ethnicity, or gender, Fritzius notes. You need to bring in different viewpoints. Counterbalance the eager recent college graduates with older folks who’ve been around the block a lot more times. Teams should also strive for a range of skill sets and experience across technologies, industry sectors, and development methodologies.</p>
<p>That even extends to personality types, Fritzius says, such as cheerleader, leader, and followers. “You want multiple ‘axes of diversity.’ That way, you’re enhancing your gene pool.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, diversity creates friction. That can be healthy – and even <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/2373792/four-non-obvious-things-pink-floyd-can-teach-your-team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inspire team members to turn frustration into creativity</a>, as was the case for the members of Pink Floyd – as long as team members respect one another.</p>
<p>What if a project comes up requiring talent you lack? Hiring a consultant is a common approach. After all, bands bring in <a href="https://amzn.to/2YEhjLm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">session musicians</a> if a recording requires a phenomenal guitar lead, backup vocals, bongo drums, or a harmonica riff. Alternatively, you can forge partnerships with outside organizations. That’s sort of like what Aerosmith did when the band recruited hip-hop superstars Run-DMC to co-record a revamped version of <a href="about:blank">Walk This Way</a> – which became the first crossover rap/rock hit.</p>
<h3>2. Build a climate of respect</h3>
<p>Band members spend a considerable amount of time together; so do software teams. If rockers can’t figure out how to get along, you know what happens: They split up. <a href="https://www.nme.com/photos/30-mighty-bands-we-ve-lost-this-millennium-1432788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where did Oasis, The Verve</a>, and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLxpNiF0YKs%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> REM </a>go? How about Guns N Roses, The Clash, and Smashing Pumpkins? Even Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young quit after<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B_UYYPb-Gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 50 years of playing together</a>.</p>
<p>To maintain harmony in the software workplace, team leaders should encourage respect for one and all, Gregori advises. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-things-qa-testers-wish-programmers-understood/">Testers can sometimes get the proverbial short end of the stick</a> when it comes to respect, he acknowledges.</p>
<p>For example, says Gregori, development teams sometimes finish their rounds of scrums and sprints at the very last minute, suddenly delivering a project to testing. Developers need to keep in mind that testers have deadlines, too. As a result, Gregori makes sure that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/in-search-of-the-full-stack-testing-team/">all developers spend some time working in QA</a>, so they can familiarize themselves with the role.</p>
<h3>3. Allow for individuality</h3>
<p>Collaboration does not suggest that team members are clones. Software organizations need to take risks for the company to move forward with innovation, Fritzius says.</p>
<p>That’s another parallel for math, music, and software development. “Within the mathematical framework, composers can be creative with the notes they use and with the instructions as to how those notes should be played; emphasizing a staccato rhythm is one example. Musicians will play the same notes differently, once again being able to offer their own interpretation,” Gregori illustrates.</p>
<p>Similarly, every programming language offers more than one way to express an intent. “This is the art of programming: the creativity to use science as a framework to build something,” Gregori points out. “And in parallel to how musicians collaborate to create a song, developers generally do not work in isolation. Rather, they work on a piece of the product, merging their code into a repository with submissions of other developers.</p>
<h3>4. Keep your cool</h3>
<p>Life in a rock band can get– well, rocky. Life in a software organization isn’t always smooth, although certainly, it usually isn’t nearly as wild and wooly.</p>
<p>“There are constant obstacles: paying for things, making tradeoffs, team members arriving and departing. If you let it become drama, it will become drama, so you have to be patient and mature and constantly deescalate. For a lighthearted example, think of the band in <em>This is Spinal Tap,</em>” Trowbridge says.</p>
<p>To find true success in either field, says Trowbridge, you need to keep perspective and to learn how to “switch off” occasionally for an escape.</p>
<p>Human beings <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/3-lessons-from-big-software-failures/">learn from both successes and failures</a>, a fact to which many a rock band can attest. After all, even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPon7i1-T1U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Beatles </a>had a tough time <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-beatles-succeeded-through-talent-ambition-and-a-lot-of-arrogance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">landing their first record contract</a> – and hey, it didn’t stop them.</p>
<blockquote><p>One element in playing music well – and creating quality software – is recognizing when <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/todays-testing-getting-past-the-hype-of-machine-learning/">a hyped technology helps or hinders</a> the team’s efforts. Our white paper helps you make sense of the real value of machine learning – and when its advantages are overblown.</p></blockquote>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We’ll use the most recent release at the time of writing, 8.0.1:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git <span>-C</span> llvm checkout llvmorg-8.0.1
<span>$ </span>git <span>-C</span> llvm/test-suite checkout llvmorg-8.0.1
</code></pre></div></div> <p>To start with, let’s count commits:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>(</span>git <span>-C</span> llvm shortlog <span>-s</span> <span>-n</span><span>;</span> git <span>-C</span> llvm/test-suite shortlog <span>-s</span> <span>-n</span><span>)</span> <span>\</span>
    | q <span>'SELECT SUM(c1) FROM -'</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Which informs us there have been 312,036 commits across the two projects. The same git commands can tell us that there have been 1,210 unique contributors:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>(</span>git <span>-C</span> llvm shortlog <span>-s</span> <span>-n</span><span>;</span> git <span>-C</span> llvm/test-suite shortlog <span>-s</span> <span>-n</span><span>)</span> <span>\</span>
    | <span>awk</span> <span>'{$1=""}1'</span> | <span>sort</span> <span>-u</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>How many lines of addition and deletion is that?</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>(</span>git <span>-C</span> llvm log <span>--format</span><span>=</span>tformat: <span>--numstat</span><span>;</span> <span>\</span>
   git <span>-C</span> llvm/test-suite log <span>--format</span><span>=</span>tformat: <span>--numstat</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>)</span> | q <span>-t</span> <span>'SELECT SUM(c1), SUM(c2) FROM -'</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>LLVM 8.0.1 is the culmination of 81,033,801 line additions and 22,048,147 line deletions. That is nice, but it (a) doesn’t tell us how much <em>code</em> there is, and (b) doesn’t assign a dollar cost.</p> <p>Let’s turn to David A. Wheeler’s <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">sloccount</a> to get both <em>logical</em> source line counts, and a development cost estimate based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO">COCOMO</a> model. We’ll leave the parameters of the model as default, but we’ll update the 19-year old salary estimate using a contemporary US average from <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/us-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN1_KO3,20.htm?countryRedirect=true">glassdoor</a>:</p> <div><div><pre><code>$ sloccount --personcost 103035 llvm
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Which tells us that LLVM 8.0.1 comprises 6,887,489 lines of code, with an estimated development cost of <strong>$529,895,190</strong>. I suppose by most definitions that should qualify as expensive. At least, it is certainly more expensive than funding research to make compiler construction cheaper :-)</p> <p>Do you have any references for the dollar costs of building a compiler? Please get in touch!</p> <hr> <p>P.S: I used the same methodology to compute estimated costs for 10 popular compilers, which made its way into the introduction of <a href="https://github.com/ChrisCummins/phd/tree/master/docs/thesis">my thesis</a>:</p> <p><img src="https://chriscummins.cc/img/2019-07-26-compiler-costs.png"></p>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>A</span>s little as two centuries ago, the northern edge of the island of Borneo, home to Malaysiaâ€™s Sarawak state, was covered in a verdant canopy that stretched, uninterrupted, from shore to shore. It was a forest that had persisted for more than 100 million years, sheltering a dizzying abundance of plants, animals, and fungi that were found nowhere else on Earth. It survived the extinction of the dinosaurs and countless cycles of glaciation. It housed humans for 40,000 years while our species grew and grew around the world. 
  </p>

<p>Then, over the past few decades, the forests of Sarawak faced threats unlike any before. The canopy began to recoil, its edges assaulted by the expansion of hydroelectric power, logging, and, most impactful of all, palm oil plantations. To many people, these changes look like the necessary costs of progress. Development has consumed almost a third of the forest, but it has also lifted millions out of poverty. The first wave of palm oil plantations, from the 1970s to the 1990s, provided farmers with seven times the income of subsistence-food croppers in the same regions. Industry has brought paved roads, better schools, and modern information infrastructure. 
  </p>
<p>The oil palm (formally <em>Elaeis guineensis)</em> is a Shiva of the modern consumer economy, a great creator and a great destroyer. A startling amount of human happiness and wellbeing depends on our relationship with this one plant. Presently palm oil accounts for 60 percent of all cooking oil, more than 62 million tons in total. Itâ€™s found in half of supermarket goods, from instant noodles to ice cream, air fresheners to shampoos. You may not see it but you are eating it and washing your hair with it. Consumer-product manufacturers prefer palm oil because it blends well with other oils and is the ideal elixir to create various consistencies. Savvy food marketers love it because it contains low levels of artery-clogging trans fats. 
  </p>
<p>Youâ€™d have to look far and wide to find a major company that doesnâ€™t have palm oil on its hands. They include Walmart, Colgate-Palmolive, Kelloggâ€™s, Nestle, McDonalds, Ikea, Target, and Whole Foods. Palm oil is mixed into animal feed and <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/podcasts/base-pairs-episode-16-big-plans-for-a-tiny-plant/" target="_blank">biofuels</a>.
  </p>
<blockquote>The oil palm is a Shiva of the modern consumer economy, a great creator and a great destroyer.</blockquote>
<p>Malaysia accounts for 26 percent of the vast production of palm oil today, making it a great creator for the local economy as well. Almost half of oil palms in that country are grown by smallholders rather than large-scale agribusiness. The crop is so important that government insiders consider its development synonymous with the eradication of poverty in Malaysia. Between 1980 and 2010, palm oil cultivation doubled in Malaysia. Then, in just four years, it doubled again. 
  </p>
<p>Therein lies the seemingly intractable dilemma of humanityâ€™s intimate relationship with this tropical tree. Palm oil production is phenomenally important to local peoples and international economies. But it is also tremendously <a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/palm-oil-and-biodiversity">destructive to natural ecosystems</a> and to the global climate.</p>
<p>Tropical forests and peatlands are great storehouses of carbon dioxide, the main gas indicted in global warming. Malaysiaâ€™s forests are especially rich in carbon. They can hold up to 220 pounds of carbon per square mile. â€œThat's equivalent to the emissions from driving an average car from New York to San Francisco and back&nbsp;76 times,â€� the Union for Concerned Scientists tells us. Razing forests and peatlands unleashes carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in calamitous amounts. Deforestation for palm cultivation in Indonesia accounted for 2 to 9 percent of all tropical land use emissions from 2000 to 2010. Palm oil expansion is also robbing orangutans, tigers, rhinos, and elephants of their natural habitats. Global demand for palm oil is expected to increase from 76 million tons in 2019 to over 400 million tons in 2050.</p>

<p>Environmentalists are realists enough to know that&nbsp;palm oil is here to stay. Too much money and too many powerful government and community interests are tied up in its production. You donâ€™t overturn the world economy overnight. Plenty of nonprofits are pushing sustainable harvesting of palm oil and an international movement, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, is signing up companies to pledge to employ smart environmental practices. These grassroots efforts, though important, may amount to little more than a superficial solution, however.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s most needed is way to reboot our relationship with the oil palm—to find a way to produce more oil on less land. Here is where plant scientists must step in. And they have. They have crafted a novel genetic technique to induce each palm oil tree to produce more fruit, containing more of the precious oil. Itâ€™s a way to keep the ice-cream makers happy while saving the rainforest, and it can be scaled up now.</p>
<p><span>R</span>ob Martienssen, a plant biologist at <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/" target="_blank">Cold Spring Harbor Lab</a>, has been one&nbsp;of the worldâ€™s key researchers into the puzzles of palm oil production: why scientific methods have gone wrong in the past, and how to right those wrongs today. Launching a project to grow more palm oil on less land was the easy part, he knew. Scientists locked in on that goal some decades ago and set out to clone a single â€œeliteâ€� palm, one that produced a bounty of oil, into 50,000 palms just like it. They even succeeded, up to a point. â€œThey thought this was going to solve all problems,â€� Martienssen says, but cloning the elite palm in the lab turned out to offend the plantâ€™s natural growth processes. Once planted, the identical trees were â€œmantledâ€�: Instead of yielding the promised bounty, the plants produced gnarled fruit that gave no oil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took an international collaboration between <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/rob-martienssen/#news" target="_blank">Martienssenâ€™s group</a> at Cold Spring Harbor Lab and their colleagues at the Malaysian Palm Oil Board nearly 20 years to unravel the mystery of the mantled fruit. They started by assembling and analyzing the whole genome sequence of the <em>Elaeis guineensis </em>oil palm. That enormous effort only made the problem more puzzling, however, because they found no genetic differences between normal and mantled clones.</p>
<p>Rather than give up, the researchers dove even deeper, beyond the DNA of the oil palm and into the layer of biology that regulates how DNA is read and translated: the epigenome. To their astonishment, <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/what-s-behind-million-dollar-crop-failures-in-oil-palm-would-you-believe-bad-karma/" target="_blank">they found</a> that the huge difference in the mantled clones was the result of a single, tiny epigenetic change. Palms that produce mangled fruit have an altered molecular switch that interferes with expression levels of genes relevant to healthy fruit production. Previously that miscreant switch had been identified in rice plants and was named â€œkarma.â€� The palm clones literally suffered from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4857894/" target="_blank">bad karma</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/cshl_e0b979cd9ee928ce965e9001019fee92.png" alt="palm_oil_sec_2_final_resized850_500"><figcaption><span>Getting rid of palm oil would come with its own drawbacks, so researchers are focusing on making it more benign. </span><br><span>Credit:  International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>â€œIn terms of individual palms, if you have bad karma, then it's going to literally get no oil,â€� Martienssen says. With the mechanism behind mantling unmasked, a third partner—Orion Genomics, a private startup founded by Martienssen—was able to develop a simple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9Dj-MKgBkc" target="_blank">DNA test</a> that predicts whether a designer seedling will bear robust or withered fruit. Then only the genuine, high-yield clones will make their way into the field.</p>
<p>That epigenetic test could be making a difference in the oil-palm plantations very soon. â€œIt's currently being commercialized jointly by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board and Orion Genomics,â€� Martienssen says. He projects that reliable clonal stocks could increase yields by 30 to 50 percent, drastically reducing the pressure for illegal forest clearing. And thatâ€™s just the start. Other scientists are working on dwarf varieties of the oil palm that are easier to harvest, that come to maturity faster, and that stay in production for longer. The epigenetic test can be applied to <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/nobelist-sir-richard-roberts-talks-gmos-at-cshl/" target="_blank">genetically modified</a> palm varieties for a synergistic effect, but—important for many consumers and environmentalists—it provides major benefits on the non-GMO clones as well.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, the government is finally acting to protect whatâ€™s left of Sarawakâ€™s ancient forest canopy. New policies limit the expansion of palm plantations to 6.5 million hectares, which leaves just 1 million more hectares of land for cultivation. These moves create strong incentives to enact a better, smarter relationship between humans and the plants they rely on. â€œFrom a world production point of view, palm oil is not going away,â€� Martienssen says. â€œReducing its footprint is the best thing we can do to help the rainforest.â€�

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all know the default way to fetch and display images:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/image.jpg<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>It is used across frameworks and libraries throughout the industry. But what if you want to improve your UX and display loading indicators at the position of the image while the image is still loading? Or what if you want to output a message if there was an error while loading the image? Unfortunately this is not that easy with the default way of loading images.</p><p>But no worries, because there is a solution. You can just load the image in parallel <em>with a React hook</em>, which will also tell you when the image has finished loading and if there has been an error.</p><p>First of all I would like to introduce the hook:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> useState<span>,</span> useEffect <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>useImage</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>src<span>:</span> <span>string</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>hasLoaded<span>,</span> setHasLoaded<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>hasError<span>,</span> setHasError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>hasStartedInitialFetch<span>,</span> setHasStartedInitialFetch<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setHasStartedInitialFetch</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>setHasLoaded</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>setHasError</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>// Here's where the magic happens.</span>
        <span>const</span> image <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Image</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        image<span>.</span><span>src</span> <span>=</span> src<span>;</span>

        <span>const</span> <span>handleError</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>setHasError</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>;</span>

        <span>const</span> <span>handleLoad</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>setHasError</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>;</span>

        image<span>.</span><span>onerror</span> <span>=</span> handleError<span>;</span>
        image<span>.</span><span>onload</span> <span>=</span> handleLoad<span>;</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            image<span>.</span><span>removeEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"error"</span><span>,</span> handleError<span>)</span><span>;</span>
            image<span>.</span><span>removeEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"load"</span><span>,</span> handleLoad<span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>{</span> hasLoaded<span>,</span> hasError<span>,</span> hasStartedInitialFetch <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>What does this hook do? Well, it basically loads the image into the cache or retrieves it from the cache if it has already been loaded.</p><p>At the same time it provides useful information, such as whether the image has been loaded, whether an error occurred during loading or whether the initial fetch has started. You could then use this information to place a loading indicator in the place of the image as long as the image has not yet loaded. An example integration could look like the following:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span><span>Demo</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> imageUrl <span>=</span> <span>"/image.png"</span><span>;</span>

    <span>const</span> <span>{</span> hasLoaded<span>,</span> hasError <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useImage</span><span>(</span>imageUrl<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>hasError<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
        <span><span><span>&lt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
            ...
            </span><span>{</span><span>!</span>hasLoaded <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>LoadingIndicator</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span>
            </span><span>{</span>hasLoaded <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>imageUrl<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span>
        </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>No. One might expect this, since the source was entered in both the hook and the image element.
However, only one request is sent, no matter how often a source is referenced. Fortunately, this also leads to the result that the <em>hasLoaded</em> is always turning true, if somewhere (no matter where exactly) on the page this exact image was loaded.</p><p>If you want to load images in an easy way and at the same time know the exact loading state, I can highly recommend this hook. In fact, all article thumbnails on <a target="_blank" href="https://typesafe.blog/">typesafe.blog</a> are loaded with this hook. In case you have a slow internet connection, you will see a loading indicator instead of the image until the image has loaded.</p></div></div>]]>

Why does he risk his life climbing huge, cold, barren rocks? His reply:</p><blockquote><p>It’s fun.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s unwrap that for a moment. Mountaineering, at that level, entails the following things:</p><ul><li>Walking long distances in snow</li><li>Sleeping in a sleeping bag</li><li>Eating low amounts of food</li><li>Having difficulty breathing</li><li>Suffering frostbite</li></ul><p>Does this sound like fun?</p><p>Of course it doesn’t.

It’s the “fun” of being in a life-threatening situation, where all your decisions have real meaning, and any misstep can have dire consequences.</p><p>In other words, it’s not the same meaning of “fun” as when I say “this movie was fun”, or “it was fun talking to you”, or “let’s play a fun videogame”.</p><h3 id="funinprogramming">Fun in programming</h3><p>Software engineering doesn’t give you frostbite, thankfully. It’s not a life-threatening situation.</p><p>But the thing about software development: it’s incredibly frustrating.

Then, go back to problem-solving. That single thing can separate you from a lot of failing developers.</p><p>Just keep going, keep improving.</p><p>And at some point, someone will ask you why you’re doing what you’re doing. Why are you sitting in front of the computer for hours on end, biting your lip, staring at a screen full of gibberish?

<p>June 29<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p>The oil companies have a <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/managing-global-warming/letcher/978-0-12-814104-5">long history</a><span data-cites="lech">[1]</span> of successfully suppressing the market for renewable energy sources by spreading misinformation about solar and wind power, and of pressuring state and local regulators to interfere with its adoption.</p>
<p>Many of the fossil fuel industry’s deceitful talking points are reiterated in the new film<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Planet of the Humans”, produced by Michael Moore and directed and written by Jeff Gibbs.</p>
<p>The film has been condemned without qualification by a legion of climate scientists, including Michael Mann, the researcher responsible for the famous “hockey stick” graph of global temperatures. Dr.&nbsp;Mann, who has, with other scientists, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/03/once-again-michael-moore-stirs-the-environmental-pot-but-conservationists-turn-up-the-heat-on-him">signed a letter</a><span data-cites="OnceagainMichaelMoore">[2]</span> calling for the film’s retraction, has said that it contains “various distortions, half-truths and lies”, and that it peddles climate denialist tropes. These scientists are campaigning to correct the record, and undo the considerable damage done by this propaganda juggernaut, already viewed about <a href="https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/05/michael-moores-planet-of-the-humans-documentary-peddles-dangerous-climate-denial/">5 million times</a><span data-cites="yaleClimConnOnPOTH">[3]</span> on YouTube.</p>
<p>If fact, the film does have a point, buried within its anti-rational appeal: unfettered population increase and unending economic growth are a big part of our current crisis. But it is either dishonest or uninformed in trying to get us to think that the environmental movement is not acutely aware of this issue. The dangers of Homo Sapiens’ reckless dominance over the planet has been a persistent theme at the core of the environmental movement since Malthus. It is not the singular and profound insight of Jeff Gibbs, no matter how new these concepts may be to him personally.</p>
<p>Near the beginning of this film, its producers put someone in front of the camera to make their central point for them, scoffing at the very idea that there could be a technological component to the solution to our problems. The entirety of the remainder of the film seems determined to prove this one point, by any means necessary, truthful or otherwise: any new technology is doomed to fail, all renewable energy technologies are lies, and the people supporting them have some sinister agenda. Since green technology can not work, we might as well stop trying and continue to burn coal and oil, while we try to convince our fellow citizens that they can save the planet by having fewer children and ditching their cars and air conditioners. It’s a script that could have been written by Exxon’s public relations department.</p>
<p>It is not the sheer dishonesty of the film that is surprising. After all, although Michael Moore is not its listed author or director, he is its producer, and his reputation casts its shadow of low expectations upon it. Moore does not utter lies in his films; he arranges for others to appear in front of his camera to lie for him. He edits his footage to retain the statements that tell the story he wants to tell, even if he knows those statements to be untrue. Moore admitted as much in an interview<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> on the Howard Stern show on June 25th, 2004, in response to a challenge by a caller. Moore allowed a statement by a secret service agent about the guarding of embassies to stand unchallenged in his film “Fahrenheit 9/11”—a statement that Moore had to have known was false, but one that advanced the agenda of the film. His response to the caller, who correctly pointed out that this is simply an underhanded way to deceive an audience, was simply to shrug and say, “He said it.”</p>
<p>This is the central storytelling technique of “Planet of the Humans.” It is riddled with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/for-a-brighter-future-science-looks-to-re-energize-the-common-solar-cell/">outdated information</a><span data-cites="spus2Article">[4]</span>, emotional manipulation, scientifically unsound conclusions, a dizzying variety of misinformation, and outright lies. (The “documentary” does have enthusiastic supporters: a band of <a href="https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/05/michael-moores-planet-of-the-humans-documentary-peddles-dangerous-climate-denial/">prominent names</a><span data-cites="yaleClimConnOnPOTH">[3]</span> from the climate denialist community.) When Gibbs can’t find someone to say what he wants said, he says it himself in a voiceover, or has one Ozzie Zehner say it. Dr.&nbsp;Zehner is featured prominently in front of the camera as an independent expert. The viewer who squints through the credits might find it odd to discover that Zehner was also one of the movie’s cinematographers, but the credits do not reveal that he was a co-producer of the film as well—a curious omission.</p>
<p>All of this is as expected. What is more surprising is the clientele. Why on Earth are Michael Moore and his colleagues carrying water for the oil companies? It’s easy to speculate about unsavory motives, but I prefer not to traffic in unproven accusations, no matter how readily they come to mind. Unfortunately, this film’s creators are not so fastidious, freely maligning prominent environmentalists from Al Gore to Bill McKibben, strongly suggesting that their support of green technologies can only be explained by their personal, greedy pursuit of profit. I think this disaster of a documentary has a simpler, commonplace explanation: Moore and friends are simply gullible, undereducated, and ignorant of the science, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/solar-power-is-it-for-you/">economics</a><span data-cites="spusArticle">[5]</span>, and engineering surrounding the subjects that they are so strident about. And, as happens so often, in a time when the mere concept of “expertise” is looked upon with suspicion, it is, paradoxically, their very innocence that bolsters their confidence and gives them the tragically mistaken idea that they have the right to an opinion.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-0e74a9a2acebd70c05fe"><div><p>For the three years starting in April of 2017, I ran much of <a href="http://theprepared.org/newsletter" target="_blank">The Prepared’s</a> (and ultimately my family’s) income through Patreon. I started doing so as an experiment - one that by any measure has been a success. But while Patreon was instrumental in that process, I recommend that creators <strong>not</strong> structure their incomes and careers around Patreon. Here’s why.</p><p>Like many creators, I chose Patreon’s “pay by the creation” (rather than “pay by the month) mode. This directly incentivizes creators to continue doing the actual work, and keeps them accountable to the commitments they make. </p><p>But what Patreon doesn’t tell you is that fans can optionally set a monthly cap on their spending, and that cap can be arbitrarily low - even <strong>less than your per-creation commitment level.</strong> In other words, a reader of my weekly newsletter could pledge $5 per newsletter, but then set a $2 monthly cap. The worst part about this is that there’s literally nowhere in the Patreon backend that I can see this cap. I spoke to Patreon’s product team about this in late 2018, and they told me that the best thing I could do is to look at my creation-by-creation analytics at the end of the month and see which of my patrons paid for which creations; if a person doesn’t show up at the end of the month, then they must have set a cap.</p><p>This is a totally unscalable solution, and it makes the process of issuing patron rewards excruciatingly hard to manage. Creators need the ability to quickly and easily determine <strong>who</strong> is paying them for <strong>what</strong>; Patreon makes this impractically hard.</p><p>Further:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593267194369_49688"><div><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Patreon provides email alerts for when a new patron makes a pledge, but has <strong>no email or push notifications for when patrons delete pledges.</strong> </p></li><li><p>Patreon has no creator-side notification system for declined charges or charges that are flagged for fraud. Worse yet, their patron-side notification system appears to be totally ineffective; many long time patrons (and personal friends of mine) were genuinely shocked to hear, many months later, that their monthly charges had been declined - leading to their pledges being automatically canceled by Patreon. Even worse, Patreon’s “Declines” page, which shows the total declined amount on a month by month basis, has no way of showing which patrons’ pledges were declined - you instead need to go into the “Relationship Manager” and filter by “Declined” to see whose charges have gone through, and when.</p></li><li><p>If you, as a creator, go through all of the effort to find charges that<em> </em>have been declined or marked as fraud, it can then be really difficult to recoup that revenue. This is mostly a result of the fact that most Patreon creators charge a small amount of money (a couple dollars) per month. In theory you could email or message the patron when their charge doesn’t go through, but in practice it feels a bit weird to be hounding someone over (say) $4. If the pledge was billed on an annual basis, though, it might be a big enough sum to warrant the effort. </p></li><li><p>Patreon uses accounting terms with little regard for their generally accepted meaning. See the screenshot above, which is titled “Earnings Projections” but then actually lists <em>gross revenue.</em> In accounting, <em>earnings</em> is the same as <em>profit - </em>it’s what a company has left <strong>after every expense is paid, </strong>whereas <em>gross revenue</em> is the total amount that a company takes in and doesn’t take into account expenses at all. In other words, Patreon is suggesting that the numbers here are what will be deposited into my bank account - but once Patreon takes their platform fees, it’ll actually be significantly less. This kind of sloppy terminology is all over Patreon’s creator backend, and no matter how you slice it is either the result of gross incompetence or a deliberate desire to deceive creators.</p></li></ul><p>Between credit card processing fees (2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction) and Patreon’s cut (between 5% and a whopping 12%), your earnings will be <em>significantly</em> less than your top line pledged amount. In practice, I saw total fees of between 8-12%. (Note: I signed up for Patreon before they shifted to tiered pricing, and now have a “Founder” Pro plan at a 5% platform fee rate. If you signed up for a Pro or Premium account today, you’d pay Patreon 3% or 7% more than I do, respectively.)</p><p>If Patreon were actively bringing customers to me - if normal people were just out there browsing Patreon for awesome things to support - then that might make sense. <strong>But the reality is that success on Patreon is inextricably tied to having your own platform and community.</strong> All Patreon does is manage recurring payment processing - a commodity service that many companies do for a drastically lower fee structure. Sure, ostensibly you can also be having conversations with patrons, generating some kind of community there, etc - but every step you take to encourage users to interact with you on Patreon, the more you undermine your own platform. In other words, Patreon engages in rent seeking - but they ultimately do it on <strong>your</strong> platform, and don’t bring a built-in audience with which to raise you higher.</p><p>When I transitioned off of Patreon, I moved to a combination of Quickbooks Online ($645/year; note that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free" target="_blank">Intuit is a terrible company</a>) and Squarespace’s ($480/year) recurring products feature. The result is that my processing fees dropped dramatically. At my peak Patreon earnings, I was spending almost $300/month ($3600/year) on Patreon’s platform fees. My current revenue is roughly 3x what it was then, but I’m paying 68% less than I used to be.<strong> My current payments, web hosting, and accounting software outlay is $1,125 a year; if I had remained on Patreon my annual fees would be about $10,000.</strong></p><p>Okay, you’re saying - so Patreon isn’t the perfect all-in-one platform that will allow me to bill, chat with, and build my audience. But maybe it’s a piece of a larger puzzle?</p><p>It’s a great idea, but unfortunately Patreon does a terrible job integrating with the other services that I use to run my business.</p><p>The first thing I’d want from Patreon is an easy way to automatically share my content (which most creators distribute elsewhere - for me, it’s Mailchimp) to Patreon. But while Patreon does have a public API, it’s poorly developed (there is no sandbox/testing area, and the most recent updates to <a href="https://github.com/Patreon/patreon-python" target="_blank">their API libraries</a> are from January of 2019) and only allows browsing/looking up data on Patreon; you cannot post content to your Patreon account via the API. This lack of functionality also exists in Zapier’s implementation of the Patreon API: You can use Patreon as a trigger, but not as an action.</p><p>What this means is that creators are inherently tied to Patreon’s terrible, horrible, clicky clicky GUI. You are completely tied to the limitations that are built into Patreon’s web product, and don’t have the ability to build automations that’ll speed up your content and customer management.</p><p>Patreon also fails to integrate well with accounting software - something that flies in the face of their promise to give creators “the stability you need to build an independent creative&nbsp;career.” Their API (and Zapier’s implementation of it) only provides <em>pledge</em> activity, and is therefore inaccurate (caps, declines, and fraud aren’t factored in - it’s a guesstimate at what you might make in the future) in all of the ways described above.</p><p>I really can’t stress this enough: <strong>If your intention is to build a meaningful income, there are much better options out there than Patreon. </strong>What Patreon <em>does</em> offer is a quick way to see whether people on the internet will pay you a little money for something that you’re already doing for free. </p><p>This is a nontrivial thing, but it’s something that you should really think through before you start a Patreon page. If it’s a success, then it’ll likely make a lot of sense for you to transition <em>off</em> of Patreon at some point in the foreseeable future. That might be fine - especially if you’re really early on and success feels like a longshot - but The Prepared’s transition off of Patreon required a lot of management on my part and resulted in roughly 1/3 of my patrons dropping their pledges. </p><p>To be clear: I’m deeply appreciative of all of the people and companies who supported me through Patreon, and it really is true that those first couple of dollars made a big impact in the path of my career. But Patreon as a platform did remarkably little to support me along that journey, even after I became a moderately successful creator and took quite a bit of time to explain my frustrations to both their customer service &amp; user research teams.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<blockquote><p>To reason logically is so to link one’s propositions that each should contain the reason for the one succeeding it, and should itself be demonstrated by the one preceding it.</p><cite><em>Jean Piaget</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>The above quote is from the Swiss psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget">Jean Piaget</a>, a well-known figure in not just the psychological field, but also in the education field.</p>



<p>I want you, as you read through this post, to keep this quote in mind. </p>



<p>You will see why as you continue to read.</p>



<p>You might be asking yourself what the above quote might have to do with programming tutorials, and the answer is, well, a lot actually. </p>



<p>But before we can get to fleshing that out, we must first start with the core issue that I believe is the cause of hard to understand programming tutorials (and programming documentation for that matter).</p>



<p>That issue is one of <em>‘imposter syndrome’</em>.</p>



<p><strong>The Two Sides of the Imposter Syndrome Coin</strong></p>



<p>I have a theory about imposter syndrome. That is that it is simply a symptom of a more profound problem. </p>



<p>That is the problem of believing that everyone is at the same level of knowledge that you are, and that they understand that knowledge in the same <em>way</em> that you do. </p>



<p>In the same way that the self-consciousness that seems to be produced by a lack of ego in, say, a social situation, is actually the result of a preoccupation of the self. Imposter syndrome is likely caused by too much of a focus on one’s own level of knowledge and a mistaken projection of that level out into the social world.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget">Jean Piaget</a> also seemed to know this well:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Egocentrism is, in its essence, an inability to differentiate between the ego and the social environment. </p><cite>Jean Piaget, <a href="https://books.google.gm/books?id=otUViaRG7TMC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=Egocentrism+is,+in+its+essence,+an+inability+to+differentiate+between+the+ego+and+the+social+environment.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=58EO_Kvu7Y&amp;sig=ACfU3U1inhk9igakn4MY_bJrVKBmz4BMLQ&amp;hl=wo&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiQv_nlzMDoAhXHyYUKHU_LAYgQ6AEwAnoECAkQAQ">The Moral Judgement of the Child</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Egocentrism <em>sounds</em> like a bad thing, a character flaw almost. But it is in fact, simply a description of a very normal human trait. It is, at least according to psychologists like Piaget, how we began to think as children. </p>



<p>It is from this basis that, he believed, we began to gradually <em>differentiate</em>, or said another way, to ‘learn’ our environment, by a gradual process of both separating what was in front of us from ourselves, and then also, combining those things with other things and seeing how they would link and interact. </p>



<p>In this process, he believed, we would gradually ‘build’ knowledge structures from the ground up. These structures would be the representations of the things we were seeing as well as the links between those things, a schema of sorts, of all the things that we had, over time ‘learned’ and connected within the web of our knowledge structure. This with all <i>preceding</i> knowledge serving as the foundation for all the knowledge that would <em>succeed</em> it.</p>



<p>Sound familiar?</p>



<p>This method of learning proposed by Piaget is what became known as the <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/constructivism.html">constructivist</a> theory of knowledge.</p>



<p>Jean Piaget’s development of the constructivist theory of knowledge was probably a direct response/result of his discovery that we (including people who teach) have a natural inclination to believe that our own level of knowledge is also the level of other people. A form of ego-centrism that is inherent within all of us. The constructivist theory of knowledge says, in contrast to this, that we should be more empathetic. It encourages us to first endeavor to exercise empathy with our potential student, to try to know what the learner already knows, and then, and only then, from that foundation, begin to teach and further ‘build’ their knowledge base.</p>



<p>This is what most programmers who make tutorials fail to do. And it is not really their fault. With the mass proliferation of tutorials that we currently have, it is easy to forget that teaching is itself a skill. One that needs to be trained. </p>



<p>Without the fundamental empathy needed to meet the learner at his or her level, the teacher, in this case, the tutorial maker, will simply be making too many assumptions, based on his own level of knowledge and therefore be building a structure on a foundation that may not even be there.</p>



<p>This is very often the case with programming documentation in particular. </p>



<p>Ever had to Google most of the missing pieces in an installation process, simply because the author had assumed that you already knew certain parts of it? I know I have, on numerous occasions. </p>



<p>So how does one solve this? How do you go about 1. Gaining the empathy with the learner necessary to create a great tutorial. And then 2. Effectively teach and ‘build’ on the learners existing knowledge structure?</p>



<p>Let’s start with 1. </p>



<p><strong>How To Gain Empathy With Your Learner As A Tutorial Maker</strong></p>



<p>The sheer amount of ‘foundation’ or level of knowledge that is needed nowadays, means that the depth of the research process that you undertake as a teacher must strive to match it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, we live in an era where the level of depth in one’s research that can be achieved is relatively high.</p>



<p>By depth, I am referring to the amount you can know about your learner’s current level of knowledge.</p>



<p>The way in which you will do this will be two-fold. </p>



<ol><li><strong>Target a specific type of learner.</strong> Know who exactly it is that you are trying to teach.</li><li> <strong>Gain empathy for the learner’s level of Knowledge.</strong> By building a mental model of the current foundation that the learner has.</li></ol>



<p>To achieve one, you must simply try to visualize in your mind’s eye, a <em>specific</em> person that you would like to share knowledge with. In this, you must be very specific.</p>



<p>The best person to target in most cases is yourself, as you have an infinite amount of knowledge about this demographic. </p>



<p>Doing this well will reveal many of the traits as well as the likely habits of the target learner. This arms you appropriately to be able to do the next step.</p>



<p>Once you have gotten yourself a clear enough picture of <em>who</em> you would like to teach, the next step is to gain empathy with the target learner and then gradually build a mental model of their current level of knowledge. This is done by seeking out the places where your target learner hangs out. This can be on sites such as Reddit, but even YouTube videos and comments, as well as things like Amazon reviews, can serve as good sources. Anywhere your target learner is likely to be and has an impetus to be active in some way (such as by making a comment) can work well.</p>



<p>Once you’ve done this, simply observing them and over time, gradually building up your mental model, you will begin to slowly develop a clearer picture of your learner’s current knowledge structure. This can take as little as a day to a week, depending on your level of skill in this, as well as how much your mental model already matches that of the target learners. </p>



<p>Once you have gotten yourself this synchronicity with your learner. You are now able to move on to the next step. </p>



<p>You are now ready to teach.</p>



<p><strong>How To Teach Effectively, The Constructivist Way</strong></p>



<p>We learn best when our neurons get ‘switched on’, or activated. </p>



<p>This activation of neurons then helps to facilitate the ‘linking’ or ‘absorption’ of new information that occurs when we learn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neurons are best activated by novelty. Learning or experiencing something new. Like a new language or framework, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What this activation does is simply prime the brain for information storage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It gets it ready to build on the knowledge structure.</p>



<p>Once this happens, the brain then begins to store the new information by following a process of <em>searching</em> for pre-existing information within the brain and then <em>linking</em> or ‘associating/absorbing’ the new information with the MOST similar information to it it can find. Ultimately building a new knowledge structure or concept.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key words in the last paragraph are <em>‘searching’</em> and <em>‘most’</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You see, the more similar the associative link is that the brain uses, the faster, and more efficiently the brain can absorb that new information. Because the brain can now leverage the other related relationships that that link has, which are likely to be similar to the relationships inherent in the representation of the new information.</p>



<p><strong><em>For example:</em></strong> Let’s say that you just saw a spoon for the first time. </p>



<p>Your brain wouldn’t store that new information as simply a spoon just like that. It would have no basis upon which to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would instead first look for what it already had stored in there that was similar to a spoon, say, a fork, and would then store the spoon as a fork-like-thing, in relation to the fork. The representation of a spoon in the brain would then actually be attached to the representation of a fork. They would be linked – neuron to neuron. And in that process, the <em>learning</em> of a spoon as a concept represented in the mind would occur.</p>



<p>The brain then, would interpret a spoon to be something like a fork but with a rounded top and no gaps. The concept of a spoon could only be ‘learned’ or said another way, ‘absorbed’, and then subsequently exist in the brain, as an <em>extension</em> of the concept of a fork.</p>



<p>So using this example of the fork and the spoon. The only truly new information that needs to be stored is that of the top side of the spoon and its difference with the fork. The brain leverages the knowledge of the bottom side (the side you hold with your hand), and saves the energy of having to store that again. If you now, on top of priming the brain with novel information, like a new programming language or framework, present that new information with the best associations that the brain can leverage, such as the most similar languages and frameworks to the novel one, you effectively eliminate the <em>searching</em> process that the brain has to typically go through on its own. With the end result that you massively increase the speed of absorption and learning.</p>



<p>This is what we mean in practice when we talk about teaching with a constructivist approach. </p>

    <p><span><a href="https://www.coronawarn.app/en/">Germany’s Corona-Warn-App uses FMDB</a></span></p><blockquote>
<p>The Corona-Warn-App is an app that helps trace infection chains of SARS-CoV-2 (which can cause COVID-19) in Germany. The app is based on technologies with a decentralized approach and notifies users if they have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Transparency is key to both protect the app's end-users and to encourage adoption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found out a couple of days ago that the iOS version of the Corona-Warn-App is using <a href="https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb">FMDB</a>, which I find delightful. FMDB has been around a long time and it's still an Objective-C project, but it keeps on kicking and showing up in places I'd never imagined.</p>

                                                                            solution is to delegate the responsibility of removing the malicious participant to each

                                                                            Viewed as an isolated case it works, but repeated instances will risk causing an outsize burden on the
                                                                            participants.</p> <p>Traditional moderation systems grant a special privilege to the initiator of the

                                                                            moderation-less. Similarly, the initiator may be adept at starting new contexts, but lacking in skill concerning
                                                                            matters of moderation (e.g. assigning new moderators). Finally, issues may arise where previously good moderators

                                                                            also spreads out the invisible care-giving labour required to keep a community free from abuse.</p> <p>This work
                                                                            explores an approach to implementing a subjective, trust-based system.</p> <p>What if participants could
                                                                            automatically block the malicious peer, if they discover that the peer has been blocked by someone the participant

                                                                            context, if the administrator is misbehaving and a participant loses trust in them, their only options are to live

<p>PyCaret is a new ML framework. And since it is FOSS and has some potentials you can find it in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nocomplexity.com/foss-ml/" target="_blank">FOSS-ML Guide</a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Many machine learning products claim make using machine learning simple and easy. Recently the new <a href="https://pycaret.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PyCaret </a>machine learning hit our radar.  PyCaret is a promising product.  Attractive enough to  play a bit with this product. And to figure out whether this product really simplifies machine learning. </p>



<p>You can find my observations in this<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nocomplexity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SimplifyML_PyCaret.pdf" target="_blank"> simple overview</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Know you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake, but for the sake of having done right?</p><cite>Epictetus</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bill Shannon passed away a few days ago after a long, valiant battle with cancer. The reality is Bill had a very long standing, selfless and profound impact on the entire Java ecosystem if not IT at large. It is also reality that far too few people understand this truth. In this blog post, I am going to attempt to do my part in closing this gap and honor a very good man that will be missed greatly.</p>



<p>Bill started his storied career with DEC and UNIX. He was the 11th employee of Sun Microsystems, alongside luminaries like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill Joy</a>. When J2EE was being formed, Bill was recruited to help lead the effort and remained in that role through the technology’s transition to Java EE and now Jakarta EE under the Eclipse Foundation. Bill is listed as lead or co-lead on all of Java EE platform releases. He played an instrumental role in the historic transfer of the technology from the JCP to the Eclipse Foundation. Bill was also the principal developer for Java Mail, now Jakarta Mail.</p>



<p>The following excerpt from his farewell note to his colleagues represents his accomplishments well:</p>



<blockquote><p>I started at Sun (as employee #11) by bringing SunOS to life. Just as wild success was within reach, we stretched a little too far and signed a deal with AT&amp;T. That set us back almost 5 years, but at least I have the “black edition” of Solaris signed by Eric Schmidt – “I’m Sorry”. Next it was time to move on to learn about window systems, desktop applications, and industry consortiums in the form of CDE. CDE was moving much too slowly and in 1996 a new opportunity presented itself – Java. We tried a Java machine, a JavaOS, and a Java desktop environment – Hotjava Views. None of that really panned out until Java found its home as an application server environment, first named J2EE and then named Java EE. I was recruited as leader of this new effort, which has subsequently been given a new name and new leadership – Jakarta EE at the Eclipse Foundation.</p></blockquote>



<p>His contributions to Java, Java EE and Jakarta EE truly cannot be overstated. He left his mark on the technology set in a way few other people have. His interactions with me, while anecdotal, perhaps is a good reflection of who he really was, what he did and why he will be missed.</p>



<p>I first encountered Bill when I began contributing to Java EE 5 as an independent consultant, on my own time. Bill made sure I felt welcome, behind the scenes gave me background technical information that I needed and encouraged me to be outspoken. He valued my contributions and understood they came at the cost of significant personal sacrifices. I believe he also implicitly understood the challenges of being an immigrant, a person of color, someone with obvious Islamic heritage, at heart a non-conformist and a non-vendor in a forum and industry that lacked diversity and still does. Without that early support from Bill, I am not sure I would have continued on with Java EE. I still vividly remember what he once told me:</p>



<blockquote><p>Don’t underestimate your impact. I appreciate your passion. You can make a difference in a way I don’t think you understand. There will be resistance, but don’t give up. </p></blockquote>



<p>Bill was equally welcoming and supportive when I joined Oracle as Java EE evangelist. He made sure my ideas were voiced, heard and considered, even if we did not always agree. He was happy to empower me to fulfill my community facing role even at JavaOne while shunning the limelight himself. I now also know how many good fights he tirelessly fought behind the scenes so that the effort we both cared about kept moving forward.</p>



<p>Beyond Oracle, Bill was always quietly supportive of community efforts like the <a href="https://jakartaee-ambassadors.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Java EE Guardians and the Jakarta EE Ambassadors</a> after it. He remained supportive until the end of his days – taking the time to help draft the <a href="https://jakartaee-ambassadors.io/getting-involved/guide-for-helping-deliver-jakarta-ee-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guide to Helping Deliver Jakarta EE 9</a>.</p>

<p>Bill passed at home with his family and close friends. He is succeeded by his wife and two daughters. Rest in peace Bill. Bill and his family were private people. With the blessings of his family, I hope to hold a virtual tribute event to honor Bill together publicly as a community. If this materializes, I will keep folks posted.</p>

<p>I believe the best way to truly honor Bill is to carry forward his life’s work embodied in Jakarta EE. I hope you will take a moment to consider the long service of this good man on all our behalf and also consider being a part of the <a href="https://jakarta.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jakarta EE</a> journey.</p>

<p>To build and test new functionality for your customers you can create a POC (Proof Of Concept) or develop a MVP (Minimum Viable Product). But creating a MVP from scratch is often not simple, since quality aspects such as security and privacy can rise severe realisation challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no general accepted definition of what exactly a POC or MVP is. Definitions are a bit context dependent, depending on your specific project, product and organisation. But in general sense it is good to clearly separate a POC from a MVP. </p>



<p>In short:</p>



<ul><li>A MVP is a product that is usable for customers in production and is maintained. So a MVP is implemented in your business processes and IT landscape and can be used for real production usages.</li><li>A POC is a way to examine a solution or an aspect of a solution to gather information. E.g collect evidence if the idea is viable to create. Most of the time you perform a POC to minimize risks before creating a MVP. Developing a POC is the quickest way to validate or invalidate assumptions about a concept or idea.</li></ul>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">POC</th><th data-align="left">MVP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left">Examine viability of an idea or concept.</td><td data-align="left">Create a product that delivers value in the simplest way possible. It just needs to work.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Used to determine development and implementation time and cost.</td><td data-align="left">Used to learn how customers will use and respond to a new product.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Needs a clear focus and goal.</td><td data-align="left">Goal is clear. A working product in production.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">No need to be tested in a production environment.</td><td data-align="left">Involves more time than a POC since basic quality criteria (security/privacy/reliability etc) must be met.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Minimal investment</td><td data-align="left">Enables learning by collecting data when your MVP is implemented in production.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Gives better understanding of problem or solution</td><td data-align="left">Can be used to evolve towards an even more valuable product in future.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Can be real simple.</td><td data-align="left">Create a product that has value as simple as possible.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The outcome of a POC can be used to speed up creation of a MVP. But improving a software prototype until it is ready for production, so evolving a POC towards a MVP, is not recommended. But reusing the generating knowledge of a POC to create a MVP simplifies the creation of a MVP.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <h2>
            <a href="https://www.obsessivefacts.com/blog/2018-10-20-chrome-allows-enumeration-of-usb-devices.html">
                Chrome allows silent enumeration of USB devices
            </a>
        </h2>
        <h3>User consent is baked into the spec, but Google skips it.</h3>
        
        <p>Via the <a href="https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/">Web MIDI API</a>, Google Chrome
(up to at least version 70) allows silent monitoring of all connected USB MIDI
devices, such as MIDI keyboards and audio interfaces. While this enables
interesting web applications such as <a href="https://www.obsessivefacts.com/password">software synthesizers</a>, it also
provides a new vector for shady ad networks and malicious actors to do very
precise
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">device fingerprinting</a> and
tracking. The API is trivial to access; for example run this in a JavaScript
console:</p>
<pre><code>navigator.requestMIDIAccess({<span>sysex</span>: <span>false</span>})
    .then(
        <span><span>function</span>(<span>midiAccess</span>) </span>{
            <span>console</span>.log(midiAccess);
            <span>for</span> (<span>var</span> entry <span>of</span> midiAccess.inputs) {
                <span>var</span> input = entry[<span>1</span>];
                <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Found device: '</span>, input.manufacturer, input.name);
            }
        },
        <span><span>function</span>(<span></span>) </span>{ <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Error: no MIDI access'</span>); }
    );</code></pre>
<p>Assuming you have MIDI devices connected, this will output something like:</p>
<pre><code>MIDIAccess {inputs: MIDIInputMap, outputs: MIDIOutputMap, sysexEnabled: false, onstatechange: null}
Found device:  Microsoft Corporation 3- UA-25EX
Found device:  Midiman MIDIIN3 (Axiom Pro 61)
Found device:  Midiman MIDIIN4 (Axiom Pro 61)</code></pre>
<p>From here, it's possible to listen for inputs on all connected MIDI devices
(aka a MIDI keylogger!)</p>
<p>Again, while Google most likely had noble intentions in providing this API,
their implementation is half-assed. The Web MIDI Specification provides for a
user consent step, similar to the confirmation dialogs that pop up around webcam
access or push notifications, but Chrome skips over this and grants permission
as soon as a script asks for it.</p>
<h4 id="privacy-implications">Privacy implications</h4>
<p>On its face, the impact of allowing scripts to silently dump a list of
USB MIDI devices seems minor—only a very small percentage of users will have
MIDI keyboards or audio interfaces hooked up. But counterinuitively, this 
increases the privacy impact: because the number of users is small, Chrome's
implementation of the Web MIDI API provides a new vector for very precise
device fingerprinting.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has a great write-up and demonstration
of device fingerprinting techniques via their
<a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick Project</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you visit a website, you are allowing that site to access a lot of
  information about your computer's configuration. Combined, this information
  can create a kind of fingerprint — a signature that could be used to identify
  you and your computer. Some companies use this technology to try to identify
  individual computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my knowledge, I don't believe EFF or anyone else has researched the impact of
Web MIDI device leakage in the context of device fingerprinting. In practice, it
seems like this could enable precise tracking of creative individuals in a
manner that couldn't be blocked without disabling JavaScript entirely.</p>
<h4 id="google-can-easily-fix-this">Google can easily fix this!</h4>
<p>Again, the Web MIDI API provides a specification for user consent, and Google
Chrome already has generic UI components to display user confirmation dialog
prompts. It should be simple for them to implement a consent prompt and prevent
malicious scripts from scooping up peoples' connected MIDI devices. While Google
has a perverse incentive as the world's biggest advertiser to make it easier to
track their users, again I believe the Chrome team had good intentions in
setting up this API. They just did a bad job, and they should fix it.</p>

The marketing team at Ebsta realise that there is a new persona that could really like some of the new features they are building.</p><p>This persona is <strong>sales operations </strong>(the person who is responsible for making the sales team sell more).</p><p>So Ebsta decide to launch a podcast to educate and inspire this persona.</p><p>Ebsta have never podcasted before but fast forward twelve short months and they have:</p><ul><li>Released 46 episodes of the Sales Ops Demystified podcast</li><li>Built the most downloaded podcast in sales operations</li><li>Started to rank for some of the most competitive search terms in sales operations</li><li>Closed customer and partership deals with guests of the podcast</li><li>Have their guests advertising their business for them on their Linkedin profiles:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/2020/06/kevin-mulrane-linkedin-profile.jpg" alt="podcasting business guests" srcset="https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/kevin-mulrane-linkedin-profile.jpg 600w, https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/kevin-mulrane-linkedin-profile.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/2020/06/kevin-mulrane-linkedin-profile.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Podcasts guests advertising...</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/2020/06/jason-hanks-linkedin-profile.jpg" alt="podcasting for business guests" srcset="https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/jason-hanks-linkedin-profile.jpg 600w, https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/jason-hanks-linkedin-profile.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/jason-hanks-linkedin-profile.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/2020/06/jason-hanks-linkedin-profile.jpg 1606w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>And again...</figcaption></figure><p><em>But perhaps most important of all?</em></p><p>They have added a shedload of value to the sales operations niche whilst learning even about this type of person.</p><p>In short, that is why you start podcasting for your business: to learn and add value to your core persona. If you get these two right then you will win in the long term. </p><p>We will use the rest of this post to illuminate more about how, like Ebsta, you can use podcasting for your business to realise these benefits.</p><p>Let's get started.</p><hr><h2 id="what-is-podcasting">What is podcasting?</h2><p>In order for us to understand how a podcast can help grow your business we must first understand what podcasting is.</p><p>The term "podcast" is a little decieving, it originates from the times of the Apple iPod (remember those?!) and describes the process of continually updating a stream of audio content to a mobile device.</p><p>As the iPod became more popular, more and more peple started creating these audio feeds that you would submit into iTunes, to then be downloaded by the users of the iPod and iPhone, it wasn't long before device agnositc podcasting directories sprung up to cater for the non-Apple users.</p><p>This "streaming" strategy for distributing content is not new: blogs have been doing this for many years. It has another term: RSS. This stands for Really Simple Syndication.</p><p>An RSS feed is simply and stream of regular content whether that be written or audio.</p><p>So that is it...</p><p><em>A podcast is simply a stream of audio content distributed through an RSS feed.</em></p><h2 id="what-is-podcasting-for-business">What is podcasting for business?</h2><p>If a podcast is simply a stream of audio content distributed through an RSS feed, podcasting for a business is simply your business producing a stream of audio content distributed through an RSS feed.</p><p><em>Simple right?</em></p><p>Well, there is a little more to it than this.</p><p>Your audio content feed could be just for internal employees for example, or it could just be for customers or it could be for everyone. In this article we will focus on your business producing a podcast for anyone that would like to listen.</p><p>This could include:</p><ul><li>Prospects</li><li>Leads</li><li>Partners</li><li>Customers</li><li>Employees</li><li>Investors</li></ul><p>Though most podcasts run by businesse will focus on the first two: prospects and leads.</p><p>The question then becomes... how can your business produce a stream of audio content (e.g. a podcast) that will capture the attention of potential prospects and leads and then ultimately lead them down the path to doing business with you.</p><h2 id="why-podcasting-for-business">Why podcasting for business?</h2><p><em>Why bother?</em></p><p><em>What is the point in investing the time and resource of your business into creating a podcast?</em></p><p>Like any marketing campaign you embark upon, you must be strategic.</p><blockquote>How can we invest $1 into the podcast to generate $2, $3 or even $10 out?</blockquote><p>Let's first understand how it is possible to generate a profit through a podcast. For each example I will include an example for a business that is currently generating a profit from their podcast.</p><h3 id="1-listeners-into-leads">1. Listeners into leads</h3><p>The first and obvious way to monetise a podcast is to convert your listeners into leads.</p><p>Document360 (a knowledge software business) do this by offerring their listeners an eBook with insights from their episodes in exchange for their email address. These leads are then nurtured and ultimately offerred a free trial of their knowledge base software.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/2020/06/image-8.png" alt="generate leads from podcast" srcset="https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/image-8.png 600w, https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/image-8.png 1000w, https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/image-8.png 1600w, https://blog.bcast.fm/content/images/2020/06/image-8.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Knowledgebase Ninjas Podcast</figcaption></figure><p>Link: <a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/knowledgebase-ninjas">https://podcasts.bcast.fm/knowledgebase-ninjas</a></p><h3 id="2-relationships-with-guests">2.

Right now, businesses mainly do this through writing. And that's great, a podcast will not replace email or a blog post.</p><p>Though audio content adds an additional level of intimacy that cannot be generated through the written word. This is the reason that, as more customers want to know the story and the people behind the business... we believe podcasting will become a competitive advantage.</p><p>The business that is able to tell their story and introduce the characters of this story (e.g. the employees) will form longer and more loyal relationships with their customers. And therefore those businesses that are not sharing their story and introducing thesee characters will fall by the wayside.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-podcasting-for-a-business">What are the benefits of podcasting for a business?</h2><p>Let's move through the benefits of podcasting for businesses... I have personally experienced the benefit of business podcast for 13 difference businesses and have broken these down into five categories. Most of these were covered in the examples shared above but as this is crucial to understand, we will cover these again...</p><ul><li>Becoming an authority</li></ul><p>As you create content in a specific niche, over time your business will start to become viewed as an authority. This means that when people have a challenge or a question related to your business and the content you produce... they will come to your for advice or to learn more. This is a great place to start a sales conversation from!</p><ul><li>Building relationships</li></ul><p>When you bring guests onto your podcast you are collaborating together. You are working together towards a common goal: to create an awesome peice of audio content. This process will strengthen your relationship with the guest and can lead to sales or partnership conversations down the line.</p><ul><li>Adding value to the market</li></ul><p>When you invest time and resources into educating your market, this creates a feeling of goodwill towards your brand.</p><blockquote>As a customer would you prefer to buy from a business that you have learnt a large amount from over the past two years without paying a dime or a business you have never heard of?</blockquote><p>I know which one I would choose...</p><ul><li>Increased SEO and social presence</li></ul><p>When you podcast, we recommend hosting all the content on your own domain. You can embed a playeer for your episode into a blog post, write up key takeaways and include other assets. </p><p>You can then takes parts of your episode and distribute them to social platforms in text, image or video form. Over time, this will boost your rankings in search engines and will increase your audience on social platforms.</p><ul><li>Learning</li></ul><p>And finally, possibly the most powerful benefits of podcasting.</p><p>The process for finding a niche, finding guests, interviewing guests and releasing episodes is incredibly insightful. You will learn with each itnerview your record. This is one of the reasons we recommend that businesses include interviews with potential customers in their podcast as it allows them to speend time learning about them and their problems.</p><p>In short, you shouldn't start podcasting because <strong>you are</strong> an expert in your niche... you should start a podcast because <strong>you want to</strong> become an expert in your niche.</p><h2 id="how-to-start-a-podcast-for-your-business">How to start a podcast for your business?</h2><p>The very first thing you need to do to start a podcast for your business is commit.</p><p>You need to commit to atleast six months of production before you make any further decisions as to the future of your podcast. You need to give the people you are targeting enough time to find and fall in love with your audio content.</p><p>Once this decision has been made you now need to find the person within your business who will be responsible this project. This person may or may not be the host of the show, but they will be responsible for everything else:</p><ul><li>Finding guests</li><li>Finding an editor</li><li>Working with a designer</li><li>Promoting the podcast</li></ul><p>It's important to select a single person as this ensures …</p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last week I shipped an update to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metastream-remote/fakegmdomhmegokfomgmkbopjibonfcp">my Chrome extension</a> which added an additional required permission. Here’s what the permission requests access for:</p><blockquote><p>Change your settings that control websites’ access to features such as cookies, JavaScript, plugins, geolocation, microphone, camera etc.</p></blockquote><p>When the extension auto-updates with the newly required permissions, Chrome disables the extension and prompts the user to approve these new permissions.</p><p>Because of this, my extension lost 50,000 users over a few days. For comparison, around 700 users uninstall the extension on an average day.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/webstore-uninstalls.png" alt="Chrome Web Store uninstalls with a huge spike during recent days"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/discord-feedback.png" alt="Discord community members rightfully asking what’s up."><figcaption><p>Discord community members rightfully asking what’s up.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/webstore-feedback.png" alt="Chrome Web Store feedback."><figcaption><p>Chrome Web Store feedback.</p></figcaption></figure><p>These reactions are all justified, the permissions I asked for are broad and could cause harm if used maliciously.</p><p>I initially made these changes to workaround a problem in my webapp where two popups are needed and one gets blocked by Chrome’s popup blocker. Using the requested permissions (<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSettings">contentSettings API</a>), I can force allowing all popups to be opened from the companion website which requires the extension.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/metastream-popups.jpg" alt="Left: Netflix in a popup - synchronized in a session, Right: session chat and user management"><figcaption><p><strong>Left:</strong> Netflix in a popup - synchronized in a session, <strong>Right:</strong> session chat and user management</p></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, as the developer, I know my use case for this permission is harmless, but a lack of granular permissions and messaging to the end-user means they must accept more than they’d like. Or not, in this case.</p><p>I ended up deciding to revert this permission change and make it optional—asking only when needed in the right context. This causes a bit more friction for my app, but the needed permissions are just too much.</p><p>Sadly, because of review times, I had to incur further loss of users until Google approved of the changes 12 hours later (not that bad, relatively). In any case, it gave me time to reflect on not making such changes so hastily in the future… 🙃</p><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/webstore-pending.png" alt="Yes, that’s correct. I somehow ended up with “fake” in my extension ID."><figcaption><p>Yes, that’s correct. I somehow ended up with “fake” in my extension ID.</p></figcaption></figure><p>In reality, the users I lost because of this were likely those who haven’t used the extension in some time, but rather kept it installed until prompted for additional permissions. And while the effects were of my own doing, there’s more that bothers me about this situation.</p><p>The change I needed to make to the extension was to allow all popups to be opened on a website. However, the permissions I asked for had to include geolocation, microphone, and camera access among other things. Why do these permissions need to be so broad?</p><p>When a Chrome Web Store developer asks for permissions in their extension, they’re required to write a reason for each (this was added somewhat recently).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/webstore-permission-justification.png" alt="Chrome Web Store permission justifications listed for each API requested."></figure><p>It’d be great if these could also be displayed to the user when asked to allow an extension. Developers could always stretch the truth here, but it might be better than the permission description alone.</p><p>I suspect this particular case might not be as necessary in the future as the web <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permissions API</a> further develops (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/permissions/issues/210">please add popups to the list!</a> 🙇‍♂️).</p><p>In addition to my extension being on the Chrome Web Store, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/metastream-remote/">it’s also available as a Firefox Addon.</a></p><p>In the Firefox Addon store, it’s listed as part of their Recommended Addons program. This is a huge differentiator from the Chrome Web Store. It comes with benefits for both developers and end users.</p><p><em><strong>Real humans</strong></em> review addon updates and provide technical feedback when something isn’t quite right. Seeing firsthand the effort that goes into these reviews gives me much greater trust in their other recommended addons.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/firefox-addon-review.png" alt="An excerpt from a past review by the Firefox Addon team."><figcaption><p>An excerpt from a past review by the Firefox Addon team.</p></figcaption></figure><p>For the permission issue I ran into, the update I made was only needed for Chrome. Firefox allows me to open two popups without one being blocked. Had that not been the case though, I suspect their review team could have had helpful feedback for me.</p><p>Ultimately, the takeaway here is that if you need to ask for more permissions in an extension, maybe think more carefully on whether it’s really needed or if you can get by with an optional prompt—even if the friction added to the user experience is painful.</p><p><em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23679472" target="_blank">Discuss on Hacker News</a><br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/hi3tgf/i_lost_50000_chrome_extension_users_after_adding/" target="_blank">Discuss on Reddit</a><br><a href="https://github.com/samuelmaddock/blog.samuelmaddock.com/commits/master/content/posts/losing-50000-chrome-extension-users.md" target="_blank">View changelog</a></em></p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/tags/browser-extension">browser extension</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/tags/chrome-web-store">chrome web store</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/tags/firefox-addon">firefox addon</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/tags/metastream">metastream</a></li></ul></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://cdn.founderslist.com/assets/od/odrllkK38r8m8IagrsZk9FB8NFiyoQD2.png" data-filename="image.png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-size="2123681" data-caption=""><br></p><p>Each year, June marks a special time for LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly in the US and across parts of Europe, as early summer Gay Pride parades and celebrations have become part of the annual calendars of most major cities.</p><p>But looking back just 50 years to the first Pride Parade in New York, or “Christopher Street Liberation Day” as it was then known, should cause us to reflect not only on how far we’ve come, but possibly also on how limited this progress may be, particularly for certain groups within, and without, the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>I used to have this small tradition of bringing a few LGBTQ+ founders and entrepreneurs together this time each year, generally in San Francisco or New York. But given the new reality of 2020, I found myself like everyone else, stuck indoors and socially distanced. So instead for this year, I decided to speak with a few founders in the community, to learn about their experiences over the past few decades and how they view the progress and change we’ve achieved.</p><h3>The Shock Factor</h3><p>I recall one particular story from a friend of mine in NYC: as a black man, he says, he cannot recount how many times people look surprised when he tells them he went to Harvard Law School. “I don’t think they mean to be disrespectful, but that look and automatic reaction: ‘Harvard, really?!’ just gives it all away. And that’s because they can see I’m black. Imagine telling them I’m gay too.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s 2020, and like it or not, we’ve still got some deeply ingrained prejudice.</p><p>That said, being a gay founder or entrepreneur in 2020, particularly in major cities like San Francisco, LA, New York or London might have lost its shock factor. According to most of the founders I spoke with, that may generally be attributed to a few considerations: political progress (particularly since the US Supreme Court’s 2015 marriage equality decision and the 2020 ruling concerning employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity); cultural progress and depictions of gay characters in movies and mass media; and the emergence of LGBTQ+ role models in various spheres: Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Arlan Hamilton, Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, Ellen DeGeneres, Leo Varadkar or Pete Buttigieg, to name but a few.</p><p>However, as many also pointed out, there’s a certain “hetero-normalization” that still seems to be expected. Thus, being white, male and gay might be very easily accepted – for two possible reasons: the cultural shift, or the fact that hiding one’s sexual orientation is very doable: most gay, lesbian or bisexual individuals have probably hidden, or at least not disclosed, their sexual orientation on more than one occasion. But what about trans individuals, LGBTQ+ people of color, or straight and LGBTQ+ women?</p><p>A recent piece by McKinsey paints a rather disturbing picture of the current US workplace environment. Over 70% of straight women and LGTBQ+ employees reported facing microaggressions in the workplace. Straight and LGBTQ+ women also experienced sexual harassment or were subjected to inappropriate jokes and comments at much higher rates than straight and LGBTQ+ men.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.founderslist.com/assets/rQ/rQaEyUAb1X2OToQPICKsXkU4WBnGKhQT.png" data-width="1490" data-height="1074" data-size="130362" data-caption=""></p><p>Gender disparity clearly remains an issue. Add race into the mix, and the story gets even more complicated. Several studies have been published around unconscious biases in hiring for instance – seeing a foreign, ethnic or woman’s name on a resume triggers automatic (and usually unintentional) reactions. This same issue also carries over to founders and entrepreneurs, and their experiences with clients, investors, business networks and their early employees and teams.</p><p>Jason, a black LGBTQ+ founder and executive at Google, for example, said he can recall several occasions where people (consciously or unconsciously) flashed a look of surprise when he walked into college classes, and later investor meetings. In his words, “I could easily not talk about being gay; but being black is something people see immediately and often see first.”</p><p>Irma Mesa, a founder in Indianapolis, echoed similar sentiments: for her, being Latina, a woman and gay just makes it feel like she’s got three sets of prejudices to overcome. Finding like-minded individuals with whom she can share experiences, concerns and feel part of a community with similar goals and objectives is not that easy – partly due to the smaller network in Indianapolis, but also since most LGBTQ+ tech groups tend to be dominated by gay white or Asian men. In fact, Irma says groups like Lesbians Who Tech are opening up more opportunities for founders and entrepreneurs of different backgrounds, and with different experiences and helping to create a broader support system.</p><h3>Role Models&nbsp;</h3><p>As a gay founder myself, I never really considered my role within the team or my own company. In fact, for several years many of my colleagues were unaware of my sexual orientation – it just wasn’t something I felt I needed to discuss, so much so that some were surprised when I even mentioned it. Looking back now, I realize this was a missed opportunity to be a better and more authentic leader, and to allow others on my team the chance to feel more represented or welcome to speak out.</p><p>David, an Irish LGBTQ+ founder expressed how grateful he was for having been exposed to various LGBTQ+ role models (and groups) during his college years. Growing up in a small town outside Belfast, he did not often encounter LGBTQ+ people and culture growing up. But upon entering Cambridge, he was suddenly immersed in a culture that embraced LGBTQ+ diversity and allowed him to discover himself and flourish. That support is something he consciously brings to the table within his own startup.</p><p>On the other hand, Gordon, another LGBTQ+ founder, discovered he lacked the support and role models during college, making his coming out experience problematic. However, he’s now based in San Francisco and is first to admit that he feels privileged there, particularly since he fits a certain mold that the city and the investor and startup communities are now comfortable with.</p><p>Thus having role models, particularly ones we can connect with directly within our own networks, rather than simply see in the media, makes a huge difference. Those same role models may allow others to feel more comfortable at work or within their teams – rather than to feel isolated – and to express themselves more openly and freely.&nbsp;</p><p>Lorenzo Thione, one of the founders at StartOut, says this has always been a key goal for the organization – allowing LGBTQ+ individuals to connect, but to also stand out as role models for others and future generations of business leaders. StartOut has also been keen to engage members in diverse communities, whether through partnerships with other organizations or through events and programs focused around bringing under-represented groups together.</p><p>On the flip side, a number of individuals I spoke with mentioned the added responsibilities of being held up as a role model. Some half-seriously joked about being asked to vet products, statements or press-releases to ensure they were “inclusive”, especially in the current racially and politically charged environment in the USA.&nbsp; Others spoke about being held to higher standards, because they were (knowingly or unknowingly) representing generally under-represented groups. And while most of the founders and entrepreneurs I spoke with embraced these added responsibilities, they also admitted the added burden of potentially failing to fulfill these unwritten expectations.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Being Gay is Still Illegal</h3><p>One thing I was clearly reminded of while interviewing people for this article is that, despite the real need for further progress here in the US, in Europe, and around the world, there are nevertheless several places where even basic rights for LGBTQ+ individuals are still a pipe dream.</p><p>Eugene is a founder, originally from Kyrgyzstan, educated in Russia and now lives between San Francisco and London. He knows first-hand what it is like to live in a country where being gay might not be technically illegal, but could get you arrested, or worse.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m sure we’ve also all read news reports of the “anti-gay purges” in Chechnya, or the very recent story of Sarah Hegazi, a gay Egyptian who was arrested and tortured for waving a rainbow flag during a concert, and ended up committing suicide barely a few weeks ago.</p><blockquote> Today, in 2020, some 68 countries criminalize homosexuality, and almost a dozen carry the death penalty for same-sex activity.&nbsp; </blockquote> <h3>Our Responsibilities</h3><p>I will admit that when I started writing this piece, I was uncertain of where it would lead, particularly given the recent Black Lives Matters protests, and the current political climate in the US. However, speaking with these LGBTQ+ founders and business leaders, I realized there are a few conclusions to be drawn.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, while we cannot deny the progress that has been made over the past 50 years, not everyone has benefited equally from this progress. We therefore cannot become complacent and must remember that it took several communities to help us get here today. And unless we continue to support each other, not only will fail to progress any further, but we risk losing what we have gained.&nbsp; So whether it’s supporting women’s rights, Black, Asian, Native American, Latinx, Muslim groups, equality for all, Immigrant rights, and other under-represented minorites, we will not be able to move forward unless we do so together.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, as LGBTQ+ founders, and business leaders, we have an added responsibility, whether we like it or not. We can directly impact our teams, our companies, and ensure we are taking positive action to encourage diversity, make everyone in the team feel included, and proactively hire and support all groups within our organizations. We certainly aren’t going to change the world at once, but change starts from within. Investing in these goals is more than the right thing to do societally, it is good for business – there is a large body of research …</p></div></div>

                    <p>At Bearer, we are a polyglot engineering team. Both in spoken languages and programming languages. Our stack is made up of services written in Node.js, Ruby, Elixir, and a handful of others in addition to all the languages our agent library supports. Like most teams, we balance using the right tool for the job with using the right tool for the time. Recently, we reached a limitation in one of our services that led us to transition that service from Node.js to Rust. This post goes into some of the details that caused the need to change languages, as well as some of the decisions we made along the way.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-context"><strong>A bit of context</strong></h2><p>We are building a solution to help developers monitor their APIs. Every time a customer’s application calls an API, a log gets sent to us where we monitor and analyze it.</p><p>At the time of the issue, we were processing an average of 30k API calls per minute. That's a lot of API calls made across all our customers. We split the process into two key parts: Log ingestion and log processing.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg" alt="Original architecture with Node.js" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>We originally built the ingestion service in Node.js. It would receive the logs, communicate with an elixir service to check customer access rights, check rate limits using Redis, and then send the log to CloudWatch. There, it would trigger an event to tell our processing worker to take over.</p><p>We capture information about the API call, including the payloads (both the request and response) of every call sent from a user's application. These are currently limited to 1MB, but that is still a large amount of data to process. We send and process everything asynchronously and the goal is to make the information available to the end-user as fast as possible.</p><p>We hosted everything on AWS Fargate, a serverless management solution for Elastic Container Service (ECS), and set it to autoscale after 4000 req/min. Everything was great! Then, the invoice came 😱.</p><p>AWS invoices based on CloudWatch storage. The more you store, the more you pay.</p><p>Fortunately, we had a backup plan.</p><h2 id="kinesis-to-the-rescue"><strong>Kinesis to the rescue?</strong></h2><p>Instead of sending the logs to CloudWatch, we would use<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/"> Kinesis Firehose</a>. Kinesis Firehose is basically a Kafka equivalent provided by AWS. It allows us to deliver a data stream in a reliable way to several destinations. With very few updates to our log processing worker, we were able to ingest logs from both CloudWatch and Kinesis Firehose. With this change, daily costs would drop to about 0.6% of what they were before.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg" alt="Architecture after adding Kenesis" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>The updated service now passed the log data through Kinesis and into s3 which triggers the worker to take over with the processing task. We rolled the change out and everything was back to normal... or we thought. Soon after, we started to notice some anomalies on our monitoring dashboard.</p><p><strong>We were Garbage Collecting</strong>, a lot. Garbage collection (GC) is a way for some languages to automatically free up memory that is no longer in use. When that happens, the program pauses. This is known as a <em>GC pause</em>. The more writes you make to memory, the more garbage collection needs to happen and as a result, the pause time increases. For our service, these pauses were growing high enough that they caused the servers to restart and put stress on the CPU. When this happens, it can look like the server is down—because it temporarily is—and our customers started to see 5xx errors for roughly 6% of the logs our agent was trying to ingest.</p><p>Below we can see the pause time and pause frequency of the garbage collection:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg" alt="GC pause and frequency charts" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>In some instances, the pause time breached <strong>4 seconds</strong> (as shown on the left), with up to <strong>400 pauses per minute</strong> (as shown on the right) across our instances.</p><p>After some more research, we appeared to be another victim of a<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/329"> memory leak in the AWS Javascript SDK</a>. We tried increasing the resource allocations to extreme amounts, like autoscaling after 1000 req/min, but nothing worked.</p><h2 id="possible-solutions"><strong>Possible solutions</strong></h2><p>With our backup plan no longer an option, we moved on to new solutions. First, we looked at those with the easiest transition path.</p><h3 id="elixir"><strong>Elixir</strong></h3><p>As mentioned earlier, we are checking the customer access rights using an Elixir service. This service is private and only accessible from within our Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). We have never experienced any scalability issues with this service and most of the logic was already there. We could simply send the logs to Kinesis from within this service and skip over the Node.js service layer. We decided it was worth a try.</p><p>We developed the missing parts and tested it. It was better, but still not great. Our benchmarks showed that there were still high levels of Garbage Collecting, and we were still returning 5xx to our users when consuming the logs. At this point, the heavy load triggered a <a href="https://github.com/benoitc/hackney/issues/594">(now resolved) issue</a> with one of our elixir dependencies.</p><h3 id="go"><strong>Go</strong></h3><p>We considered Golang as well. It would have been a good candidate, but in the end, it is another Garbage Collected Language. While likely more efficient than our previous implementation, as we scale there is a high chance we'd run into similar problems. With these limitations in mind, we needed a better option.</p><h2 id="re-architecting-with-rust-at-the-core"><strong>Re-architecting with Rust at the core</strong></h2><p>In both our original implementation and our backup, the core issue remained the same: garbage collection. The solution was to move to a language with better memory management and no garbage collection. Enter Rust.</p><p>Rust isn't a garbage-collected language. Instead, it relies on a concept called <em>ownership</em>.</p><blockquote>Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector. <br>— <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">The Rust Book</a></blockquote><p>Ownership is the concept that often makes Rust difficult to learn and write, but also what makes it so well suited for situations like ours. Each value in Rust has a single owner variable and as a result a single point of allocation in memory. Once that variable goes out of scope the memory is immediately returned.</p><p>Since the code required to ingest the logs is quite small, we decided to give it a try. To test this we addressed the very thing that we had issues with—sending large amounts of data to Kinesis.</p><p>Our first benchmarks proved to be very successful.</p><p>From that point, we were pretty confident that Rust could be the answer and we decided to flesh out the prototype into a production-ready application.</p><p>Over the course of these experiments, rather than directly replacing the original Node.js service with Rust, we restructured much of the architecture surrounding log ingestion. The core of the new service is an <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a> proxy with the Rust application as a sidecar.</p><p>Now, when the Bearer Agent in a user's application sends log data to Bearer, it goes into the Envoy proxy. Envoy looks at the request and communicates with Redis to check things like rate limits, authorization details, and usage quotas. Next, the Rust application running alongside Envoy prepares the log data and passes it through Kinesis into an s3 bucket for storage. S3 then triggers our worker to fetch and process the data so Elastic Search can index it. At this point, our users can access the data in our dashboard.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg" alt="Diagram of new rust service" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>What we found was that with fewer—and smaller—servers, we are able to process even more data without any of the earlier issues.</p><p>If we look at the latency numbers for the Node.js service, we can see peaks with an average response time nearing 1700ms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/before-latency.png" alt="Latency with original Node.js service" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/before-latency.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/before-latency.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/before-latency.png 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/before-latency.png 2400w"></figure><p>With the Rust service implementation, the latency dropped to below 90ms, even at its highest peak, keeping the average response time below 40ms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/after-latency.png" alt="Latency after re-architecture" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/after-latency.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/after-latency.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/after-latency.png 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/after-latency.png 2400w"></figure><p>The original Node.js application used about 1.5GB of memory at any given time, while the CPUs ran at around 150% load. The new Rust service used about 100MB of memory and only 2.5% of CPU load.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>As with most startups, we move fast. Sometimes the best solution at the time isn't the best solution forever. This was the case with Node.js. It allowed us to move forward, but as we grew we also outgrew it. As we started to handle more and more requests, we needed to make our infrastructure evolve to address the new requirements. While this process started with a fix that merely replaced Node.js with Rust, it led to a rethinking of our log ingestion service as a whole.</p><p>We still use a variety of languages throughout our stack, including Node.js, but will now consider Rust for new services where it makes sense.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>In recent years, dark mode has grown in popularity as more and more devices and browsers are adding support for it.</p> <p>Those reasons make it a great little feature that we can add on our websites to improve the experience of the users who prefer to use dark mode.</p> <p>Let’s see how we can support this feature in 3 steps!</p> <p>First, we will take advantage of another great CSS feature: <a href="https://diamantidis.github.io/tips/2020/06/17/css-variables">CSS variables</a></p> <p>On the <code>:root</code> level, we will define two variables; one with the color of the background and one with the color of the text.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>--background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#FFF</span><span>;</span>
    <span>--text-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#000</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Then, we will define a <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query for the dark color theme. In this media query, we will override the values of the variables that we defined in the previous step.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>@media</span> <span>(</span><span>prefers-color-scheme</span><span>:</span> <span>dark</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>:root</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>--text-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#FFF</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Lastly, we will use those variables to assign their values to CSS properties. In our case, we will use the variable to set the background and the color of the body.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--background-color</span><span>);</span>
    <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--text-color</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now all you have to do is to find a color palette for the dark theme and apply it following those steps!</p> </div></div>]]>

    Whenever there is a  variance on the definition of something, a good method is to segment the market and see if patterns emerge. By the way, this is also one of the most common problems faced by Product Managers - "A feature seems critical to some, and useless to others". In this case, do not average out the value. Instead segment the market.

People use Product Roadmaps for 3 related, but pretty different things.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.lightcat.io/content/images/2020/06/3-Monkeys.svg"><figcaption>3 Different Purposes of Product Roadmaps</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><em><strong>PLANNING - Planning feature releases:</strong> </em>This is the simplest use case - you create a roadmap to only to organise your development plan. Here the creators of the roadmap are the same as the consumers of it. Typically these tend to be small product teams, startups and Apple (during Jobs), where the top executive team is directly involved with execution.</p><p><strong>ALIGNMENT - Aligning different teams on a version of the future</strong>: In this case, a Roadmap is used to ensure that Engineering, Support, Sales, Marketing etc are all in sync about a version of the future. Here the product roadmap is about internal communication. Everyone who consumes the roadmap executes something related to it. Sales and Support promise features which are in the roadmap, Marketing plans promotion according to the roadmap and so on.</p><p><strong><em>COMMUNICATION - Communicating to external stakeholders: </em></strong>In this scenario, a Roadmap is used to communicate product vision and direction to people who just want to stay in the loop. These tend to be customers, top executive team in a large company, investors, the board etc. Here the roadmap is mainly a communication tool.</p><blockquote>Depending upon your product stage, the purpose of a Roadmap changes. Therefore, so does the definition and it's attributes. They are all called Product Roadmaps, but they are different things.</blockquote><p>You may say that your team needs 2 or all 3 kinds at different times, and you'd be right. The point here is to mainly understand that the 3 are different things.</p><h2 id="attributes-of-a-product-roadmap">Attributes of a Product Roadmap</h2><p>The building block of product roadmaps are Features mapped to time. Depending upon what is the purpose of the roadmap, the following attributes get defined. Think about your own use case - what do you need the roadmap for, and decide what should be your choices from the following attributes.</p><h3 id="a-focus-which-business-objectives-are-being-met-">A. Focus - which business objectives are being met: </h3><p>Talked about the least, and probably the most important aspect of a Product Roadmap is Focus.<strong><em> </em></strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.lightcat.io/content/images/2020/06/focus-1.jpg" alt="(photo: thetattooedbuddha.com)"><figcaption>Lack of focus kills Products&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Focus basically defines which business objectives are being met in the Roadmap, and to what extent. A lot of times, the PM or the founders do not know the answer to this question. Consequently, the roadmaps, unknown to them, could be heavily biased, and even when executed very well, will lead the company nowhere. </p><p>For example, imagine if all items in the quarterly roadmap are "Experiments". 3 months of experiments, and NEVER doubling down on things that work. This is an extreme, but not very uncommon, example. In that quarter, the company will get a few small wins, but nothing will move the metrics, because nothing was done completely, beyond an experimentation phase.</p><h3 id="b-zoom-how-detailed-is-the-roadmap-">B. Zoom - How Detailed is the Roadmap: &nbsp;</h3><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.lightcat.io/content/images/2020/06/zoom.svg"><figcaption>Only a Zoomed Roadmap looks at bugs</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Product Roadmaps which are meant for external consumption give a 10000 foot view. The external stakeholder typically just want to know if the business objectives are being met in a roadmap. On the other hand, Product Roadmaps &nbsp;which are execution plans tend to be very deep. You should include every little detail, every ticket that has to be fixed, in this roadmap. A great place to execute this roadmap is Project Management (JIRA or Trello). </p><blockquote>We have learnt lately that many teams prefer to plan and execute in the same place. Many of LightCat customers like to execute inside LightCat itself, by marking cards as "In Progress" or "Done".</blockquote><h3 id="c-flexibility-how-much-can-it-change-">C. Flexibility - how much can it change: </h3><p>This really depends upon the company stage and culture. Typically, pre-Product Market Fit companies tend to build faster, and NEED to be flexible. Every week you uncover insights that will impact what you're building. So the roadmaps tend to be very agile.</p><p>Larger companies have more stiff roadmaps. The reason typically is that roadmaps are communicated to other teams, and through them, to the external world. Moving away from the promises that have already been made makes roadmap stiffer. If done at the right stage, and for the right reasons, it's a good thing.</p><h2 id="so-how-do-i-make-my-roadmap">So How Do I Make My Roadmap?</h2><p>Making your roadmap depends upon your requirement. Let us assume that you need a real Planning roadmap - something that you and your team will use to develop your product.</p><p>You already have a list of ideas. What you need is this:</p><ol><li>Write down Value Drivers that are relevant to your customers. Eg saving money</li><li>Write down the cost drivers. </li><li>Rate the feature on the value and cost drivers. Pick the top ones.</li><li>Keep all relevant information connected to the chosen stories. These include specs, designs, customer feedback, market research - essentially anything that helps figure out why this should be built and how.</li><li>Add the stories to a release plan. And you are done.</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1073"><div><div><p> This article is going to be a quick tutorial on how to set webpack aliases in a Vue JS project.  This article is going to assume that your project has been created using <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vue Cli</a>.  If it makes sense for your project, I highly recommend using it.</p><p> Webpack aliases are a great way to simplify imports in your Vue JS projects. Instead of specifying long paths, we can instead use a short alias and webpack will generate the full path when we build/run our project.</p><p> To start, open up the <strong>vue.config.js</strong> file in the root directory of your project. If this file does not exist, create it.</p><p> Then, post in the following snippet:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>const</span> path <span>=</span> require<span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br> module.<span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br> configureWebpack<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; resolve<span>:</span> <span>{</span></p><p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alias<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>//aliases go here</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><span>,</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><span>,</span><br> <span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> Take a look at the <strong> alias</strong> property of the <strong>configureWebpack</strong> object. This is where we are going to put all of our aliases.</p><p> A webpack alias looks something like the following:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br></p></td><td><p><span>'@c'</span><span>:</span> path.<span>resolve</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>'src/components'</span><span>)</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> What we can do now is fill out this alias object with a few paths that we want to alias. To create an alias, simply create a property which will be the name of your alias.  In this example, all of the aliases will be prefixed with the <strong>@</strong> symbol, but you could pretty much do whatever you want. The value must be set to the path for the directory you want to alias.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br></p></td><td><p><span>const</span> path <span>=</span> require<span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br> module.<span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br> configureWebpack<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; resolve<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alias<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>'@c'</span><span>:</span> path.<span>resolve</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>'src/components'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>'@m'</span><span>:</span> path.<span>resolve</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>'src/mixins'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><span>,</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><span>,</span><br> <span>}</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> Awesome, we have aliases.  How can we use them in our Vue components?</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>import</span> MyComponent from <span>'@c/MyComponent.vue'</span><br> <span>import</span> MyMixin from <span>'@m/MyMixin'</span><br> <span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>{</span><br> &nbsp; name<span>:</span> <span>'Home'</span><span>,</span><br> &nbsp; components<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; MyComponent<span>,</span><br> &nbsp; <span>}</span><span>,</span><br> &nbsp; mixins<span>:</span> <span>[</span>MyMixin<span>]</span><span>,</span></p><p>  <span>}</span><span>;</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> Wow, isn’t that awesome. Look at how short those import statements are. No we don’t have to worry about typing out a bunch of long, unmaintainable paths.</p><p> I hope you enjoyed this content.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_mesh" target="_blank">Service mesh<sup><i></i></sup></a> is a blazing hot topic in software engineering right now and rightfully so. I think it’s extremely promising technology and I’d love to see it widely adopted (in cases where it truly makes sense). Yet it remains shrouded in mystery for many people and even those who <em>are</em> familiar with it have trouble articulating what it’s good for and what it even is (like yours truly). In this post, I’m going to help rectify that by providing a simple <strong>list of use cases</strong> for service meshes.</p><p>First, some big caveats:</p><ul><li>I’ve never worked on a service mesh or used one outside of projects undertaken for my own edification. But I did write a bunch of docs for Twitter’s internal service mesh back in 2015 (it wasn’t even called a service mesh then) and I helped with the
<a href="https://linkerd.io/" target="_blank">Linkerd<sup><i></i></sup></a> site and docs a while back so I guess that counts for something.</li><li>This list is highly provisional and non-exhaustive. There may be use cases I’m not aware of, and there will surely be use cases that arise later on as the technology matures and grows in popularity.</li><li>Not all of these use cases will be supported by every available service mesh. I use expressions like “service meshes provide…” to mean “some and maybe all widely used service meshes provide…”</li><li>The use cases are in no particular order.</li></ul><h2 id="the-list">The list</h2><ul><li><a href="#service-discovery">Service discovery</a></li><li><a href="#encryption">Encryption</a></li><li><a href="#authz">Authentication and authorization</a></li><li><a href="#load-balancing">Load balancing</a></li><li><a href="#circuit-breaking">Circuit breaking</a></li><li><a href="#autoscaling">Autoscaling</a></li><li><a href="#canary-deployments">Canary deployments</a></li><li><a href="#blue-green-deployments">Blue-green deployments</a></li><li><a href="#health-checking">Health checking</a></li><li><a href="#load-shedding">Load shedding</a></li><li><a href="#traffic-shadowing">Traffic shadowing</a></li><li><a href="#isolation">Isolation</a></li><li><a href="#retries-rate-limiting-and-timeouts">Retries, rate limiting, and timeouts</a></li><li><a href="#telemetry">Telemetry</a></li><li><a href="#auditing">Auditing</a></li><li><a href="#visualization">Visualization</a></li></ul><h3 id="service-discovery">Service discovery</h3><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Access other services in the network using simple names.</p></blockquote><p>Your services need to be able to automatically “find” each other via readily comprehensible names, such as <code>service.api.production</code> or <code>pets/staging</code> or <code>cassandra</code>. Cloud environments are highly elastic environments where many instances of a service will be gathered behind that name and hard-coding IP addresses is thus a complete non-starter.</p><p>And once a service finds another service, it needs to be able to send requests to that service without worrying that it’s going to hit a non-responsive service instance. That means that the service mesh needs to keep track of instance liveness and keep the host list as up to date as possible.</p><p>Different service meshes provide service discovery in different ways. Right now it seems most common to delegate service discovery to an external mechanism like Kubernetes DNS. At Twitter back in the day we used the
<a href="https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Names.html" target="_blank">Finagle<sup><i></i></sup></a> naming system. Service mesh even paves the way to fully custom naming mechanisms, though I haven’t seen one that provides this.</p><h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Eliminate unencrypted traffic between services in a scalable, automated way.</p></blockquote><p>It’s nice to ensure that malicious agents can’t penetrate into your internal network. Firewalls are good for that. But what happens if they manage to break in? Should they be able to run amok, snooping inter-service traffic at will? Let’s hope not. In order to prevent this scenario, you need to establish a zero-trust network in which all traffic between all of your services is encrypted. Most existing service meshes do this by providing mutual
<a href="https://lucperkins.dev/blog/service-mesh-use-cases/[TLS]%28https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security%29">TLS</a> (mTLS). And in some cases, mTLS works across clouds and clusters and someday probably planets.</p><p>You don’t <em>need</em> a service mesh for mTLS, of course. You could let each service handle its own TLS, but that would mean that you need to figure out a way to generate certs, distribute them to your service hosts, write application code that pulls in those certs from the filesystem, and then rotate those certs at established intervals. Service meshes automate mTLS using systems like
<a href="https://spiffe.io/" target="_blank">SPIFFE<sup><i></i></sup></a> that in turn automate certificate issuance and rotation.</p><h3 id="authz">Authentication and authorization</h3><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Determine who is making a request and determine what they’re allowed to do before the request even reaches your service.</p></blockquote><p>Services often need to know <em>who</em> is making a request (authentication) and, on the basis of that ascertained identity, decide what they’re allowed to do (authorization). The “who” here can be either:</p><ol><li><p>Other services. This is called <strong>peer</strong> authentication. The <code>web</code> service wants to access the <code>db</code> service. Service meshes typically solve this via
<a href="#encryption">mTLS</a>, whereby certificates provide the necessary ID card.</p></li><li><p>Specific human users. This is called <strong>request</strong> authentication. User <code>haxor69</code> wants to purchase a new lamp. Service meshes provide various mechanisms for this, such as
<a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">JSON Web Tokens<sup><i></i></sup></a>.</p><p>This is something that we’re all used to doing in our application code. A request comes in, we ask our <code>users</code> table if the user exists and has provided the right password, then we check the <code>permissions</code> column in our <code>users</code> table, etc. With service mesh this transpires before the request even reaches your service.</p></li></ol><p>Once you figure out who a request is coming from, you need to determine what they’re authorized to do. Some service meshes enable you to define simple policies about who gets to do what using YAML or the command line, while others offer integrations with generalized frameworks like
<a href="https://openpolicyagent.org/" target="_blank">Open Policy Agent<sup><i></i></sup></a>. The end goal is that your services can safely assume that every request is from an allowed party <em>and</em> that the action is authorized.</p><h3 id="load-balancing">Load balancing</h3><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Distribute load across service instances in accordance with a desired pattern.</p></blockquote><p>A “service” in a service mesh is very often comprised of multiple identical service instances, such as a <code>cache</code> service that has 5 instances today but might have 11 tomorrow. When requests are made to the <code>cache</code> service, those need to be distributed in accordance with some goal, such as minimizing response latency or maximizing the likelihood of reaching a healthy instance on the first try. Round-robin load balancing tends to be the most common pattern, but there are many others, such as weighted request (you can select targets to “favor”), ring hash (using consistent hashing for upstream hosts), or least requests (the instance receiving the least requests is favored).</p><p>Traditional balancers offer other features like HTTP caching and DDoS protection, but those are less widely used for east-west traffic (the standard domain for service mesh). You don’t need to use a service mesh for load balancing, of course, but service meshes do enable you to control load balancing policies on a per-service basis and from a centralized control plane, eliminating the need to run and configure dedicated load balancers in your networking stack.</p><h3 id="circuit-breaking">Circuit breaking</h3><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Stop traffic to a struggling service and control damage from worst-case scenarios.</p></blockquote><p>If a service is failing to keep up with traffic for whatever reason, service meshes provide you a range of options for coping with this (a few are covered in other sections). Circuit breaking is the “nuclear option” of stopping traffic to the service. But don’t want to just stop traffic cold; you need to specify a fallback plan. That could mean applying backpressure into requesting services (make sure to configure your mesh for that!) or it could mean something like updating your status page to red and directing users to a “fail whale” page.</p><p>Service meshes enable you not just to specify both <em>when</em> circuit breaking should occur and <em>what</em> happens when it does. The “when” could mean that any number of specified maxima are exceeded: total requests in the last time period, concurrent connections, pending requests, active retries, etc.</p><p>Circuit breaking isn’t something you want to do often, but it is good to be able to have an absolute last-ditch fallback plan in place.</p><h3 id="autoscaling">Autoscaling</h3><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Add or remove service instances automatically based on specified criteria.</p></blockquote><p>Service meshes aren’t schedulers, so they don’t <em>perform</em> autoscaling themselves. But they can provide the information that schedulers can use to make those decisions. Because service meshes have access to all traffic between services, they’re privy to a wealth of information about what’s going on—which services are struggling, which are so lightly trafficked that capacity is being wasted, etc.</p><p>Kubernetes, for example, can autoscale services based on CPU and memory usage of Pods, but if you want to scale based on anything else, in our case anything traffic related, you need a custom metric. A tutorial like
<a href="https://medium.com/cloudzone/autoscaling-kubernetes-workloads-with-istio-metrics-92f86baabba9" target="_blank">this one<sup><i></i></sup></a> shows you how to do this with
<a href="https://envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank">Envoy<sup><i></i></sup></a>,
<a href="https://istio.io/" target="_blank">Istio<sup><i></i></sup></a>, and
<a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus<sup><i></i></sup></a> but it’s pretty complex. I’d love to see a scheduler/service mesh make this simpler, enabling you to specify something like “scale the <code>auth</code> service up if it’s exceeded a pending requests threshold for more than a minute.”</p><h3 id="canary-deployments">Canary deployments</h3><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Roll out features or versions of a service only to a subset of users.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s say you’re building a SaaS product and you have an exciting new version of your service that you want to roll out. You’ve tested it in staging and everything seems fine. But you’re not sure how it will do in the wild and don’t want to burn your credibility with users. Canary deployments are the art of exposing that feature only to some subset of users. Perhaps you want it rolled out to your most loyal users, users on the free tier, or users that have specifically opted to be guinea pigs.</p><p>Service meshes enable you to do this by specifying criteria that determine who sees which version and routing traffic appropriately. The services themselves don’t need to make that decision. Version 1 of the service can assume that all requests are from users who are supposed to see that version, and version 1.1 can assume the same thing. Meanwhile, you can slowly shift a higher and higher percentage of traffic to the new version if things are going smoothly and your guinea pigs are giving the thumbs up.</p><h3 id="blue-green-deployments">Blue-green deployments</h3><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Roll out that hot new feature, but be prepared to instantly roll back.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html" target="_blank">Blue-green deployments<sup><i></i></sup></a> involve releasing a new service by running your new “blue” service alongside your current “green” service. If things go smoothly and the new service is battle tested you can decommission the green service. And someday, what once was blue will sadly turn green and fade away. Blue-green deployments are unlike …</p></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s an excerpt from the fake email message that Sophos received:</p>
<blockquote><p>From: WordPress<br>
Subject: nakedsecurity.sophos.com DNS Update<br>
Weâ€™re upgrading your domain DNS for something even better, freely!<br>
We care about your privacy and the protection of your domains, so we will soon be upgrading them, from basic Domain Name System (DNS) to Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).</p></blockquote>
<p>And hereâ€™s an actual screenshot of the scam message’s contents:<br>

<p>Most users today are aware that DNS stands from domain name system, the globally distributed databases that turns server names into network numbers. In fact, as pointed out by the security experts, DNSSEC which is mentioned in the message (see above) does exist. It is a protocol that adds authentication to DNS data transfers with the idea to prevent cybercriminals from filling the DNS database with fake entries that hijack web traffic.</p>

<hr>
<p>DNSSEC means domain name system security extensions, and it has been available for more than 20 years. However, since DNSSEC is usually a feature used by service providers to help sustain their own DNS databases, most bloggers and website owners most likely have never set it up by themselves. This means that receiving this message could most likely trick bloggers into believing its authentic, which could lead recipients into revealing sensitive information, which is what usually scammers are after.</p>
<blockquote><p>Any data you enter here goes straight to the crooks, and if you donâ€™t have two-factor authentication enabled on your account, the crooks may very well be able to log on to your website or blog right away and take it over completely, Sophos warns.</p></blockquote>
<h3>What can WordPress bloggers like you do to protect themselves?</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of simple but useful tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Donâ€™t reveal your login credentials via links you received in unexpected emails. Usually, most companies and services donâ€™t support this practice, and would find a more appropriate way to inform you about any changes that concern you.</li>
<li>Use two-factor authentication to increase your accountâ€™s security.</li>

One of my favorite<a href="#foot1" id="cite1">¹</a> concepts for multi-dimensional data visualization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face">Chernoff Face</a>. The idea here is that for a dataset with many dependent variables, it is often difficult to immediately understand the influences one variable may have on another. However, humans are great at recognizing small differences in faces, so maybe we can leverage that!</p><h2>
Tired: traditional plotting</h2><p>
The example from Wikipedia plots the differences between a few judges on some rating dimensions:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I_lJGg7QnmM/Xvl1rXrnm-I/AAAAAAAA534/0wm9LMMmQ0kgtxdNq9exqELo-jgSsqCMACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1000px-Chernoff_faces_for_evaluations_of_US_judges.svg.png"><img data-original-height="750" data-original-width="1000" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I_lJGg7QnmM/Xvl1rXrnm-I/AAAAAAAA534/0wm9LMMmQ0kgtxdNq9exqELo-jgSsqCMACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/1000px-Chernoff_faces_for_evaluations_of_US_judges.svg.png" width="320"></a></p><p>
which already improves on the "traditional" way to present such data, which is something similar to a line chart:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFSg9Y-NJYg/XvmB6rUCFmI/AAAAAAAA54g/pXmUUEPqWf4QXqrasbL_WxSjN3zWu1_TwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/x.png"><img data-original-height="353" data-original-width="583" height="193" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFSg9Y-NJYg/XvmB6rUCFmI/AAAAAAAA54g/pXmUUEPqWf4QXqrasbL_WxSjN3zWu1_TwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/x.png" width="320"></a></p>
<p>
or a radar chart:</p><p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dh3hoPt0f5A/XvmBsL-eM7I/AAAAAAAA54c/r0KXd9byh1wQ06Yp5Y3Ds-LV44p_DEfpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/x.png"><img data-original-height="356" data-original-width="591" height="192" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dh3hoPt0f5A/XvmBsL-eM7I/AAAAAAAA54c/r0KXd9byh1wQ06Yp5Y3Ds-LV44p_DEfpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/x.png" width="320"></a></p>


<p>
Clearly<a href="#foot2" id="cite2">²</a> the Chernoff faces are the best way to present this data, but they leave some of the gamut unexplored.</p>

<h2>
Wired: using GANs to synthesize faces</h2>


<p>
The GAN technique is pretty easily summarized. You set up two neural networks, a generator, which tries to generate realistic images, and a discriminator, which tries to distinguish between the output of the generator and a real corpus of images. By training the networks together, adding more layers, fooling around with hyperparameters and overall "the scientific process", you manage to get results where the generator network is able to fool the discriminator (and humans) with high-quality images of faces that do not actually map to anybody in the real world. StyleGAN improves on some of the basic structure here by using a novel generator architecture that stacks a bunch of layers together and ends up with an intermediate latent space that has "nice" properties.</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JxAnoglX3VU/Xvl-BPsI1XI/AAAAAAAA54I/HTbKb0qKkhE88y4HzqyHwele2NAzZM0WgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/n9fgba8b0qr01.png"><img data-original-height="1461" data-original-width="1600" height="292" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JxAnoglX3VU/Xvl-BPsI1XI/AAAAAAAA54I/HTbKb0qKkhE88y4HzqyHwele2NAzZM0WgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/n9fgba8b0qr01.png" width="320"></a></p>
<p><i>Basically how it works.</i></p>
<br>
<div><p>
A trained StyleGAN (1 or 2; the architecture for the dimensions does not change between versions), at the end of the day, takes a 512 element vector in the latent space "Z", then sends it through some </p><strike>nonsense</strike><p> fully-connected layers to form a "dlatent"<a href="#foot3" id="cite3">³</a> vector of size 18x512. The 18 here indicates how many layers there are in the generator proper—the trained networks that NVIDIA provides produce 1024x1024 images; there are 2 layers for each of the dimensions from 2^2=4 to 2^10=1024.</p></div>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RLpfhFZBSuo/Xvl-Wzo0B2I/AAAAAAAA54Q/ztjxSsS_JJYSz9MZBXnXBYuGC2IkT9SAACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/x.png"><img data-original-height="767" data-original-width="267" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RLpfhFZBSuo/Xvl-Wzo0B2I/AAAAAAAA54Q/ztjxSsS_JJYSz9MZBXnXBYuGC2IkT9SAACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/x.png" width="111"></a></p>
<p><i>What part of STACK MORE LAYERS did you not get?</i></p>
<br>
<div>
<p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a>The upshot is that the 18x512 space has nice linearity properties that will be useful to us when we want to generate photorealistic faces that only differ on one axis of importance. The authors of the NVIDIA paper call each of the 18 layers a "style", and the observation is that copying qualities from each style gives qualitatively different results.</p><p>

The styles that correspond to coarse resolutions bring high-level aspects like pose, hair style, face shape; the styles that correspond to fine resolutions bring low-level aspects like color scheme. But they only roughly correspond to these, so it's going to be somewhat annoying to play around with the latent space! What we need is some way to automatically classify these images for the properties we want to use in our Chernoff faces...</p></div>
<p>
<br>
<h3>
Putting it all together</h3>
</p>
<div><p>
What I did was take an <a href="https://github.com/rosasalberto/StyleGAN2-TensorFlow-2.x">unofficial re-implementation of StyleGAN2</a> and run it to generate 4096 random images (corresponding actually to random seeds 0 - 4095 in the original repository). The reason why we're using an unofficial implementation is that the unofficial implementation ports everything to TensorFlow 2, which also enabled me to run it with (a) less GPU RAM (I only have a GTX 1080 at home) and (b) on the CPU if needed for a future project where I serve these images dynamically.</p><p>

I was also too lazy to train a network to recognize any features, so I fed these images through <a href="https://www.kairos.com/pricing">Kairos</a>'s free trial, receiving API responses that roughly looked like <a href="https://pastebin.com/PXWDKkYf">this</a>. (There's no code for this part, you can just do it with cURL<a href="#foot4" id="cite4">⁴</a>).</p><p>

<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a>Then, somewhere in this <a href="https://github.com/patrickxia/StyleGAN2-TensorFlow-2.x/blob/master/play_around_with_directions.ipynb">gigantic unorganized notebook</a>&nbsp;that I need to clean up, I train some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Linear_SVM">linear SVMs</a> to split our sample of the latent space; eventually I will clean this up and make it so it's a little more automated than the crazy experimentation I was doing. After I train the SVMs and receive the normal vector from their separating hyperplanes, I manually explore the latent space by considering only one style's worth of elements from each of the normal vectors, plotting the results, and seeing what changes about the photos (which could be different than the feature from the API response!). This could probably be automated; I should likely use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_entropy">conditional entropy</a> of the Kairos API responses given the SVM result to rank which styles are most important and then automatically return that instead of manually pruning styles.<br>
<span><br></span>
<span>I ended up with seven usable properties plus one I threw out before I got tired of doing this by hand.</span></p><ul>
<li>yaw</li>
<li>eye squint</li>
<li>age</li>
<li>smile</li>
<li>skin tone</li>
<li>gender</li>
<li>hair length</li>
<li>quality of photo</li>
</ul>
<div><p>
I decided not to use quality of photo (you can see the results in the notebook results) because I didn't want half the photos to just look terrible. The good news is that I made <a href="https://github.com/patrickxia/StyleGAN2-TensorFlow-2.x/blob/master/chernoff_faces.ipynb">a new notebook</a> for generating the actual faces, one that should actually work for you if you clone the repo.</p><p>

After generating a few images and using the `montage` command from ImageMagick, we get our preliminary results!</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BUwEV9KxEHU/XvmKsnDLQdI/AAAAAAAA54w/LRRwtnI9zl80FV5sIQMEQfcmGFcX8cYCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/out.png"><img data-original-height="426" data-original-width="512" height="331" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BUwEV9KxEHU/XvmKsnDLQdI/AAAAAAAA54w/LRRwtnI9zl80FV5sIQMEQfcmGFcX8cYCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/out.png" width="400"></a></p>

Now that's the future!</p>

			<p>The narrative fallacy is that past events prefigure the future. It is especially common in biographies, where the subject’s early life is reduced down to a collection of events that suggest that their future path was obvious, if you only knew how to look. It ignores all the other people who did almost the same thing, and ended up somewhere else entirely.</p>

<hr>

<p>The term “open source” was officially adopted in 1998, fifteen years after Richard Stallman began the “free software” movement, which itself was built upon a long-standing tradition of open collaboration in the academic programming community.</p>

<p>Eric Raymond’s <em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em> was published a year earlier, and shaped the open source narrative. It guided the reader through the lifecycle of an open source project, which first “[scratches] a developer’s personal itch”, and then accretes contributors until it becomes world-class software. This was undeniably possible; the Linux kernel existed (as did Raymond’s own fetchmail project, which he never failed to mention in the same breath).</p>

<p>For Raymond, however, this progression wasn’t just possible; it was the natural, inexorable outcome. All the eyes upon an open source project would smooth away the rough edges, like stones beneath a river. Even at the beginning, with Torvald’s first post about his “hobby” operating system, the seeds of greatness were there, if you only knew how to look.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny">Manifest Destiny</a> was the belief that America had a duty to expand its boundaries, spreading its ideals. The term was coined in 1845, forty years after the Louisiana Purchase and only five years before California was granted statehood, by a columnist living in New York.</p>

<p>According to its believers, families uprooted their lives and traveled thousands of miles because democracy abhors a vacuum, and their hardship was small when weighed against the growing reach of America’s great experiment. The first settlers on the banks of the Mississippi not only prefigured the city of St Louis, they pined for it. They knew how to look.</p>

<hr>

<p>These were simplistic narratives, written at the periphery, layered atop the complex and diverse forces that drove people to explore. Both suffered from an obvious flaw: many pioneers didn’t welcome civilization once it caught up.</p>

<p>Consider this excerpt from John Mason Peck’s <em>A New Guide For Emigrants to the West</em>, written almost ten years before “manifest destiny” was invented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First comes the pioneer, who depends for the subsistence of his family chiefly upon the natural growth of vegetation, called the “range,” and the proceeds of hunting. His implements of agriculture are rude [and] chiefly of his own make…. He builds his cabin, gathers around him a few other families of similar tastes and habits, and occupies till the range is somewhat subdued, and hunting a little precarious, or, which is more frequently the case, till the neighbors crowd around, roads, bridges, and fields annoy him, and he lacks elbow room. The preëmption law enables him to dispose of his cabin and cornfield to the next class of emigrants; and, to employ his own figures, he “breaks for the high timber,” “clears out for the New Purchase,” or migrates to Arkansas or Texas, to work the same process over…. [T]he real Eldorado is still farther on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A similar pattern can be seen in the open source community. There has been, for instance, a consistent migratory pattern from Ruby to node.js to Go, Rust, and Elixir. At first, each community is defined by its potential. But as that potential is realized, the community begins to be defined by its compromises. That change is felt most keenly by the people who were there first, who remember what it was like when anything seemed possible. They feel fenced in and so they move on, in search of their golden city.</p>

<p>This isn’t the behavior of people who want to collaborate towards world-class software. This is the behavior of people who want ownership. They want to build something lasting, something which holds its shape even as the world around it changes. They want to force the world to conform to their sensibilities, rather than the other way round.</p>

<p>This won’t be surprising to anyone paying even a little attention to the open source ecosystem. The sheer profusion of frontend frameworks, each trying to differentiate itself in the least possible kilobytes of gzipped Javascript, makes this an obvious conclusion. But the framework for our discussions about open source, introduced by Eric Raymond and unchanged in the ensuing decades, barely acknowledges this reality. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleepwalkers_(Koestler_book)">We tell ourselves we live in a geocentric universe, even as we use navigational charts that tell us something else entirely</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>A more charitable interpretation, perhaps, is that “open source” and “manifest destiny” don’t speak to the motivations of anyone involved, just the emergent result of their actions. Whatever the reasons, the Linux kernel and St Louis exist, that much cannot be denied. But if we use this interpretation, we acknowledge that these narratives have no predictive power. They are, at best, existence proofs that such a thing can be created under these circumstances.</p>

<p>Indeed, any model constructed using the narrative fallacy lacks predictive power. A similar criticism can, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/the-disruption-machine">and has</a>, been leveled at Christensen’s theory of “innovative disruption”. They provide a neat narrative arc for the past few decades, and continually point to their ability to explain the past even as they’re confounded by the future.</p>

<hr>

<p>This disconnect means that we have a very limited vocabulary for discussing the goals of an open source project. According to the mythos of open source, a log cabin in the wilderness is just a city that suffers from poor stewardship. If the cabin’s creator had only engaged the community, we’re told, they too could be administrating a huge, vibrant city.</p>

<p>Of course, an administrator is just that. Very little real ownership is possible; they have to balance many needs, often sublimating their own. This change occurs slowly, one pull request at a time. Each outside contribution cedes a little ownership to someone else, giving them more reason to contribute to the project in the future. The value of this is obvious: the capabilities of the project will grow, and its direction will represent a more diverse set of needs. It will, in short, become more useful software.</p>

<p>The cost of this, however, is more subtle. For some people, creating widely used software is highly rewarding, and the administrative responsibilities it introduces are a small price to pay. For others, especially those who chase the frontiers of open source, loss of ownership leads to a loss of interest. By letting a project grow too large, they effectively chase themselves away.</p>

<p>As potential users of an open source project, we want to know if our needs matter to the maintainer. As potential contributors to an open source project, we want to know if our changes will be welcomed, accepted resentfully, or just ignored. Unfortunately, since everyone pays lip service to our idealized vision of what open source should be, it’s impossible to tell. Creators should be able to be honest, to themselves and others, about what really motivates them.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another problem with the open source mythos is that we’re told communities just <em>happen</em>. If we write it, they will come. But left alone, a community will be shaped by whoever shows up first, and most of the early adopters will be people looking to leave their mark. Their chief values will be autonomy and productivity, and the culture they create will reflect that.</p>

<p>Typically, this results in a small inner circle, often sharing the same physical location. Conversations will be informal, unrecorded, and highly productive. Decisions will have a clear rationale to everyone within the circle, and seem arbitrary to everyone else. This circle is typically composed of the people who showed up first. Anyone showing up too late, trying to claim their own sliver of ownership, will be rebuffed without any clear recourse. These latecomers will typically move on, in search of something less populated.</p>

<p>This can be a very effective way to build software, until the inner circle starts to move on. At that point, the informal processes have to be formalized. Disagreements will have to be settled using something other than strength of personality. Most projects never achieve this, and simply fall into disuse.</p>

<p>If we hope to build a project with a growing community and renewable leadership, we can’t allow a community to simply happen. It has to be planned.</p>

<hr>

<p>The need to create, and own, something lasting is part of every creative endeavor. It’s neither bad nor surprising to find it in the open source community. It is, however, harmful to pretend it doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>If we don’t change how we talk about open source, creators will continue to burn themselves out chasing an ideal they don’t really care about. New projects will continue to be excoriated for lacking novelty. We will continue to build the same ad hoc culture atop every greenfield we find.</p>

<p>We should create a shared vocabulary for how projects will handle contributions, scaling from “no, thank you” to ZeroMQ’s <a href="http://hintjens.com/blog:106">optimistic merging</a> strategy. We should give the techniques for deliberately building a community as much critical attention as our techniques for building software.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we should understand that when someone shares their source code, they didn’t necessarily make it for us.</p>

            <p>If you were dropped on a deserted island (let’s call it Island 1) that is absolutely barren, aside from an unlimited buffet and an empty cabin with a huge stack of paper and some pens. After the novelty of the buffet wore off, how long would it take for you to get so bored that you start writing, drawing, folding the paper, or playing with the food and making different things? How long would it take for you to start creating and producing things?</p>
<p>Now imagine a clone of that island (let’s call this one Island 2) except along with the cabin, buffet, pen and paper, you have a magical rock. This magical rock is the gateway to an endless catalog of entertainment, media, books, shows, news, comics, articles, games.</p>
<p>Now how long would it take for you to start creating and producing things on Island 2, and how would you feel about it?</p>
<hr>
<p>My goal is to go on my computer this morning and write this blog post. Unfortunately I live on Island 2. I have to use some willpower to not check the news, or browse social media and see what the world is up to. The very nature of my computer, my smartphone, my tablet, my smart speaker, all these devices that can connect me to an endless catalog of entertainment, makes it so that a state of distraction saturates my life. The side effect of this life is that the anticipation of doing something ‘productive’ fills me with a sense of dreadful obligation.</p>
<p>If I lived on the barren Island 1, this task of writing a blog post would be the farthest thing from an obligation, it would be a massively welcome oasis in the desert of boredom that I would be stewing in. Focus, distraction, would not be concepts I would even have to think about because I would be jumping at the opportunity to do something other than stare at the wall. I would have been so full of boredom just waiting to be burnt to make something.</p>
<p>This example is extreme but it highlights the obvious ability for boredom to drive us to do something, to create, change or produce something. The uncomfortable state of doing absolutely nothing generates boredom, which fuels us with the drive to do something to get out of that state.</p>
<p>Boredom acts like a pressure that builds up within us. After a certain point, it becomes extremely uncomfortable to hold in, and we feel the need to release it. We all learn as kids or teenagers that entertainment is a black hole for boredom, it can eat up a seemingly endless amount of our boredom, so as we grow up, we use most of our leisure time (and sometimes more than just our leisure time) engaging in this systemic destruction of our boredom.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we may have gotten too good at it.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://realisticwanderlust.com/assets/images/boredom-fuel/boredom-graph.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Boredom as shown on Island 1, and evidenced by the universal anecdote of ‘I did it because I was bored’, can fuel productivity and creativity but it’s rarely remembered as a driving force to create. Other more fuels of productivity and creativity are vastly more popular: survival/necessity (an increasingly rare motivator for those of us fortunate to live in developed countries), willpower and inspiration. The latter mental resources are some of our favorite fuels when we try and ‘be more productive’ or ‘create’. But although they can be effective, we are all too familiar with the ill side effects of relying solely on willpower or inspiration to help us get things done: we procrastinate or we burn out.</p>
<p>However if boredom is the fuel for your productivity and creativity, it produces none of these nasty by products. If you’re writing out of boredom, the concept of procrastinating on the task is ridiculous. If you’re building something because you’re bored, the concept of burning out makes no sense.</p>
<p>But how do we direct boredom to drive us to the things we want to get done? Well we don’t have any playbooks yet, because we’ve vilified it too much to explore the possibilities on a mainstream scale. We’ve been taught that being bored is a waste of time: <em>Carpe Diem, YOLO, Live every day as if it were your last</em>. These mainstream mantras are the antithesis of the engine of boredom. We tell ourselves we don’t have time to be bored, there’s too much to do and we need to do all of it. So we drive ourselves to the edge of our limited capacity of willpower and run on what small fumes of inspiration we have sputtering from our brains. Often, we produce more frustration than results. We spend large chunks of time procrastinating, dreading the things we have to push ourselves to do, and eventually we’ll need to recover from the inevitable burn out of squeezing our willpower and inspirations dry.</p>
<p>Yet this resource called boredom, that we all know can motivate us to create and produce things, piles up for free in our brains. We can’t even get rid of it fast enough, it keeps coming back, replenishing naturally, no matter what we do. We invent new forms of entertainment, gadgets and activities to try and decimate it, but it defies every attempt to clear it for good and inevitably comes back, more plentiful than before. What a crazy, endlessly renewable resource. </p>
<p>What if we experimented and learned how to harness it to fuel the things we want to do, instead of disregarding it because of it’s rough edges.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>I’ve been practicing letting myself be bored for about 4 weeks now, just to see what happens. Instead of reaching for my screens as soon as I feel a little sprout of boredom poking out, I just do nothing, maybe stare out the window. Initially it was awkward and uncomfortable but after a while it became very refreshing. I find myself more focused, clear headed, and looking forward to work and writing because I’m so bored. Also my house is the cleanest and most organized it has ever been.</em></p>

I didn’t care to explore or see the sights here, I wanted a place to call home for a while, so that I wouldn’t have to be constantly planning where I was going to sleep the follow week. I also wanted to see if I would enjoy living in a busy urban city like Shanghai. I’ve traveled many times to...</p>

		<p>Between roughly 1975 and 1995, access to computers accelerated much more quickly than access to computer networks. First in the United States, and then in other wealthy countries, computers became commonplace in the homes of the affluent, and nearly ubiquitous in institutions of higher education. But if users of those computers wanted to connect their machines together – to exchange email, download software, or find a community where they could discuss their favorite hobby, they had few options. Home users could connect to services like CompuServe. But, until the introduction of flat monthly fees in the late 1980s, they charged by the hour at rates relatively few could afford. Some university students and faculty could connect to a packet-switched computer network, but many more could not. By 1981, only about 280 computers had access to ARPANET. CSNET and BITNET would eventually connect hundreds more, but they only got started in the early 1980s. At that time the U.S. counted more than 3,000 institutions of higher education, virtually all of which would have had multiple computers, ranging from large mainframes to small workstations.</p>
<p>Both communities, home hobbyists and those academics who were excluded from the big networks, turned to the same technological solution to connect to one another. They hacked the plain-old telephone system, the Bell network, into a kind of telegraph, carrying digital messages instead of voices, and relaying messages from computer to computer across the country and the world.</p>
<p>These were among the earliest peer-to-peer computer networks. Unlike CompuServe and other such centralized systems, onto which home computers latched to drink down information like so many nursing calves, information spread through these networks like ripples on a pond, starting from anywhere and ending up everywhere. Yet they still became rife with disputes over politics and power. In the late 1990s, as the Internet erupted into popular view, many claimed that it would flatten social and economic relations. By enabling anyone to connect with anyone, the middle men and bureaucrats who had dominated our lives would find themselves cut out of the action. A new era of direct democracy and open markets would dawn, where everyone had an equal voice and equal access. Such prophets might have hesitated had they reflected on what happened on Usenet and Fidonet in the 1980s. Be its technical substructure ever so flat, every computer network is embedded within a community of human users. And human societies, no matter how one kneads and stretches, always seem to keep their lumps.</p>
<h2>Usenet</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1979, Tom Truscott was living the dream life for a young computer nerd. A grad student in computer science at Duke University with an interest in computer chess, he landed an internship at Bell Labs’ New Jersey headquarters, where he got to rub elbows with the creators of Unix, the latest craze to sweep the world of academic computing.</p>
<p>The origins of Unix, like those of the Internet itself, lay in the shadow of American telecommunications policy. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Labs decided in the late 1960s to build a leaner, much pared-down version of the massive MIT Multics system to which they had contributed as software developers. The new operating system quickly proved a hit within the labs, popular for its combination of low overhead (allowing it to run on even inexpensive machines) and high flexibility. However, AT&amp;T could do little to profit from their success. A 1956 agreement with the Justice Department required AT&amp;T to license non-telephone technologies to all comers at a reasonable rate, and to stay out of all business sectors other than supplying common carrier communications.</p>
<p>So AT&amp;T began to license Unix to universities for use in academic settings on very generous terms. These early licensees, who were granted access to the source code, began building and selling their own Unix variants, most notably the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix created at the the University of California’s flagship campus. The new operating system quickly swept academia. Unlike other popular operating systems, such as the DEC TENEX / TOPS-20, it could run on hardware from a variety of vendors, many of them offering very low-cost machines. And Berkeley distributed the software for only a nominal fee, in addition to the modest licensing fee from AT&amp;T.<sup id="fnref-13802-fee"><a href="#fn-13802-fee">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Truscott felt that he sat at the root of all things, therefore, when he got to spend the summer as Ken Thompson’s intern, playing a few morning rounds of volleyball before starting work at midday, sharing a pizza dinner with his idols, and working late into the night slinging code on Unix and the C programming language. He did not want to give up the connection to that world when his internship ended, and so as soon as he returned to Duke in the fall, he figured out how to connect the computer science department’s Unix-equipped PDP 11/70 back to the mothership in Murray Hill, using a program written by one of his erstwhile colleagues, Mike Lesk. It was called <em><span>uucp</span></em> – Unix to Unix copy – and it was one of a suite of “uu” programs new to the just-released Unix Version 7, which allowed one Unix system to connect to another over a modem. Specifically, <em>uucp</em> allowed one to copy files back and forth between the two connected computers, which allowed Truscott to exchange email with Thompson and Ritchie.</p>

<p>It was Truscott’s fellow grad student, Jim Ellis, who had installed the new Version 7 on the Duke computer, but even as the new upgrade gave with one hand, it took away with the other. The news program that was distributed by the Unix users’ group, USENIX, which would broadcast news items to all users of a given Unix computer system, no longer worked on the new operating ssytem. Truscott and Ellis decided they would replace it with their own 7-compatible news program, with more advanced features, and return their improved software back to the community for a little bit of prestige.</p>
<p><span>At this same time, Truscott was also using <em>uucp</em> to connect with a Unix machine at the University of North Carolina ten miles to the southwest in Chapel Hill, and talking to a grad student there named Steve Bellovin.<sup id="fnref-13802-bellovin"><a href="#fn-13802-bellovin">2</a></sup> Bellovin had also started building his own news program, which notably included the concept of topic-based <em>newsgroups</em>, to which one could subscribe, rather than only having a single broadcast channel for all news. Bellovin, Truscot and Ellis decided to combine their efforts and build a networked news system with newsgroups, that would use <em>uucp</em> to share news between sites. They intended to distributed provide Unix-related news for USENIX members, so they called their system Usenet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Duke would serve as the central clearinghouse at first, using its auto-dialer and <em>uucp</em> to connect to each other site on the network at regular intervals, in order to pick up it local news updates and deposit updates from its peers. Bellovin wrote the initial code, but it used shell scripts that operated very slowly, so Stephen Daniel, another Duke grad student, rewrote the program in C. Daniel’s version became know as A News. Ellis promoted the program at the January 1980 Usenix conference in Boulder, Colorado, and gave away all eighty copies of the software that he had brought with him. By the next Usenix conference that summer, the organizers had added A News to the general software package that they distributed to all attendees.</p>
<p>The creators described the system, cheekily, as a “poor man’s ARPANET.” Though one may not be accustomed to thinking of Duke as underprivileged, it did not have the clout in the world of computer science necessary at the time to get a connection to that premiere American computer network. But access to Usenet required no one’s permission, only a Unix system, a modem, and the ability to pay the phone bills for regular news transfers, requirements that virtually any institution of higher education could meet by the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Private companies also joined up with Usenet, and helped to facilitate the spread of the network. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) agreed to act as an intermediary between Duke and UC Berkeley, footing the long-distance telephone bills for inter-coastal data transfer. This allowed Berkeley to become a second, west-coast hub for Usenet, connecting up UC San Francisco, UC San Diego, and others, including Sytek, an early LAN business. The connection to Berkeley, an ARPANET site, also enabled cross-talk between ARPANET and Usenet (after a second re-write by Mark Horton and Matt Glickman to create B News). ARPANET sites began picking up Usenet content and vice versa, though ARPA rules technically forbid interconnection with other networks. The network grew rapidly, from fifteen sites carrying ten posts a day in in 1980, to 600 sites and 120 posts in 1983, and 5000 sites and 1000 posts in 1987.<sup id="fnref-13802-sitesandposts"><a href="#fn-13802-sitesandposts">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Its creators had originally conceived Usenet as a way to connect the Unix user community and discuss Unix developments, and to that end they created two groups, <em>net.general</em> and <em>net.v7bugs</em> (the latter for discussing problems with the latest version of Unix). However they left the system entirely open for expansion. Anyone was free to create a new group under “net”, and users very quickly added non-technical topics such as <em>net.jokes</em>. Just as one was free to send whatever one chose, recipients could also ignore whatever groups they chose, e.g. a system could join Usenet and request data only for <em>net.v7bugs,</em> ignoring the rest of the content. Quite unlike the carefully planned ARPANET, Usenet self-organized, and grew in an anarchic way overseen by no central authority.</p>
<p>Yet out of this superficially democratic medium a hierarchical order quickly emerged, with a certain subset of highly-connected, high-traffic sites recognized as the “backbone” of the system. This process developed fairly naturally. Because each transfer of data from one …</p></div></div>

The more individuals with access to your website, the more chance there are of their individual IP addresses being targeted by hackers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Of course, for large organizations, it’s often necessary for a lot of people to need to log in to the back end of a website and if that’s the case then I would recommend being careful with the roles you grant.</span></p><p><span>Keep full admin access for the very few people who will actually require it on a regular basis and for the rest author, editor or read-only access should suffice.</span></p><h3><b>2.

This means that you limit how many times a user can request a page over a duration. For example, maybe they can only access 10 pages every 30 seconds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This helps prevent automated hacking and scripts that are meant to hack your website, which requires them to be able to access your site thousands of times a minute. Doing so will drastically increase your security and reduce the risk of being hacked.</span></p><h3><b>3.

However, </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/"><span>sim swapping</span></a><span> has recently caused a lot of problems for people.

Any website without HTTPS doesn’t encrypt data. Keep the plugins or any software for your website up to date because vulnerabilities are discovered from time to time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Use two-factor authentication for providing access to critical data because the website administrator requires more security than a normal user. Store passwords in a hashed form not as plain text, then if a data breach occurs the passwords will still be secured.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Always validate inputs on your website because cross-site scripting and SQL injections attacks are very common. Maintain some timely backup mechanisms for your website because anything can happen in the real world.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>5.

  <p><img src="https://dtransposed.github.io/assets/img/whatmatters.png"></p><p>Recent paper from Google Brain team, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05990">What Matters In On-Policy Reinforcement Learning? A Large-Scale Empirical Study</a>, tackles one of the notoriously neglected problems in deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL). I believe this is a pain point both for RL researchers and engineers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Out of dozens of RL algorithm hyperparameters, which choices are actually important for the performance of the agent?</p>

  <p>In other words, the goal is to understand how the different choices affect the final performance of an agent and to derive recommendations for these choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this blog post I will go through the key takeaways from the paper. My goal is to present the learnings and briefly comment on them. <strong>I believe that many of those findings may be hugely beneficial for any machine learning engineer who dips his toes in the field of RL.</strong></p>

<p>Kudos for the Google Brain Team for compiling sort of a “check list” in their research paper. In every section they present the most important hyperparameters and suggest how one should go about initialising and tuning them. Even though this study is focused on the on-policy RL, the majority of learnings can be reused for off-policy algorithms.</p>

<p>The reader can choose to quickly scam through the write-up to extract those “rules of thumb” but I recommend to read the source publication thoroughly. The study is really well documented with all the details explained.</p>



<p>I believe that the publication may resonate with many engineers out there. Once it has been decided that our particular problem can be solved using deep RL, the first step is usually to set up the RL scaffolding. Here, one could either reimplement an algorithm from the paper, along with the necessary infrastructure or just use one of the available RL frameworks: be it <a href="https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst">Catalyst</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/agents">TF-Agents</a> , <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/Acme">Acme</a>  or <a href="https://github.com/ray-project/ray">Ray</a>. The second step is to design your environment. It will change over time and enrich our agent with the experience. Finally, the third step: run python script, monitor the training and tap yourself on the back. Tensorboard displays increasing average reward over time and our agent, slowly but surely, appears to acquire some form of intelligence…</p>

<p>…well, in reality, <strong>you would face TONS of problems on the way.</strong> Those could be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The sheer amount of hyperparameters available for tuning. This includes both “ML-specific” choices (batch size, networks’ architecture, learning rate), but also “RL-specific” (time discount , hyperparameters of advantage estimator). If your agent does not converge with default hyperparameters - bad luck. You will probably need to not only find out which hyperparameter is the key to your agent’s performance, but also figure out its optimal value.</li>
  <li>It is quite likely that there are strong interactions existing between certain hyperparameters (e.g batch size and learning rate are very much intertwined). This makes the tuning complexity significantly harder.</li>
  <li>Same algorithms may be implemented differently in different research papers or RL frameworks. Your initial prototype of the PPO agent may be training fine. But later you would like to distribute your system using Ray framework, and their implementation of PPO could be slightly different. As the result, your previous hyperparameter configuration does not work for the current implementation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Point 3. Brings me to the the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12729">Implementation Matters in Deep Policy Gradients: A Case Study on PPO and TRPO</a>. This publication highlights the following problem: if your algorithm turns out to be superior to, let’s say, current state-of-the-art, is it better because the algorithm is more clever, or you just used more favourable sets of hyperparameters (or simply just better code quality)?</p>

<p><strong>All those aforementioned issues could be (partially) avoided if we had a sound understanding of the importance of various hyperparameters</strong>. If we could draw some general conclusions about the significance of a particular configurations perhaps we could be more aware of its consequences on our RL system. Additionally, we could be less prone to mistaking more favourable hyperparameter configuration for superior algorithm design.</p>



<p>For benchmarking the researchers employ five, diverse OpenAI Gym environments: Hopper-v1, Walker2d-v1, HalfCheetah-v1, Ant-v1 and Humanoid-v1.</p>

<p>They run about 250 000 experiments to investigate design choices from eight thematic groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Policy Losses</em></li>
  <li><em>Networks Architecture</em></li>
  <li><em>Normalisation and Clipping</em></li>
  <li><em>Advantage Estimation</em></li>
  <li><em>Training Setup</em></li>
  <li><em>Timestep Handling</em></li>
  <li><em>Optimizers</em></li>
  <li><em>Regularization</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="policy-losses">Policy Losses</h2>

<p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> choice of different policy losses (e.g. PPO, policy gradient, V-MPO etc.) on the performance of the benchmark environments.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the on-policy setting, PPO policy loss is a recommendable default choice for majority of environments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The PPO clipping threshold should be set by default to  and then tuned.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="networks-architecture">Networks Architecture</h2>

<p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> structure/size of actor/critic, activation functions, initialisation of network weights, standard deviations of actions, transformations of sampled actions.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Initialize the last policy layer with  smaller weights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use<em> softplus</em> to transform network input into action standard deviation and add a (negative) offset to its input to decrease the initial standard deviations of actions. Tune this offset if possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use <em>tanh</em> both as the activation function (if the networks are not too deep) and to transform the samples from the normal distribution to the bounded action space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a wide value MLP (no layers shared with the policy) but tune the policy width (it might need to be narrower then the value MLP).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Prior to reading this study, I had the impression that sharing some layers between actor and critic is beneficial for the agent. I reasoned that parameter sharing could accelerate training (gradient flowing from both the actor and the critic). However, I have learned that the norm of gradients flowing back from the actor and the critic could be at completely different scale. As a result, actor’s gradients may destabilise critic’s parameters and vice-versa. This is probably the reason for keeping policy and value network separate.</li>
  <li>Surprisingly, it is better to use<em> tanh</em> activations rather than <em>ReLU</em> between actor’s/critic’s MLP layers. But only networks with limited capacity shall benefit from it. Anecdotically,<em> tanh</em> activation tends to be more reliable when you have smaller networks. It learns faster and is less sensitive to big differences in input features than <em>ReLU</em>.</li>
  <li>The authors repetitively stress the importance of weights initialisation in actor’s final layer. Those weights should be very small, so that the initial action distribution is centred around zero with a small standard deviation. The authors claim that this boosts performance of an agent, but do not give an intuition why. Perhaps this way we avoid biasing the agent towards some certain, suboptimal trajectory ahead of time (from which the agent may not fully recover).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="normalisation-and-clipping">Normalisation and Clipping</h2>

<p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> observation normalisation, value function normalisation, per-minibatch advantage normalisation, gradient and observation clipping.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Always use observation normalisation and check if value function normalisation improves performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gradient clipping might slightly help but is of secondary importance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong> Not surprisingly, observation normalisation is crucial. This is true for most of the (un-) supervised machine learning algorithms. However, I am personally (anecdotally) quite sure that gradient clipping tends to help a lot in certain situations. But naturally, this could be more or less true depending on the particular environment.</p>

<h2 id="advantage-estimation">Advantage Estimation</h2>

<p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> choice of different advantage estimators (e.g. GAE, N-step) and their hyperparameters on the performance of the benchmark environments.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>In the on-policy setting, GAE with  is a recommendable default choice for majority of environments.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="training-setup">Training Setup</h2>

<p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> number of parallel environments, number of transitions gathered in each iteration, number of passes over the data, mini batch size, how the data is split into mini batches</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go over experience multiple times (allows to quickly find an approximately optimal policy).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shuffle individual transitions before assigning them to mini batches and recompute advantages once per data pass (PPO-specific advice).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For faster wall-clock time training use many parallel environments and increase the batch size (both might hurt the sample complexity).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tune the number of transitions in each iteration if possible.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong> This paragraph has brought my attention to the fact that naively increasing number of parallel environments does not automatically lead to faster training. Over last few months I have noticed some TF-Agents users actually complaining that it can actually be harmful (<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/agents/issues/336">here</a>). This is definitely something I would like to investigate further.</p>

<h2 id="timesteps-handling">Timesteps Handling</h2>

<p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> discount factor , frame skip, episode termination handling.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Discount factor  turns out to be pretty crucial for the performance and should be individually tuned for every environment (with the default value of 0.99).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frame skipping (the number of frames an action is repeated before a new action is selected) can also help in some cases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For large step limits, there is no need to handle environment step limits.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong> One of the problems with the conventional RL benchmarks is the fact, that we test agents in environments where episodes have fixed number of steps. However, this information is hardly ever contained in the agent’s state and thus violates the Markovian assumption of MPDs. Why assuming infinite time horizon but training for finite time horizon could be a problem? Think about a tie in the basketball game. Players may …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Worrying about the NPM Ecosystem]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>The <acronym>npm</acronym> ecosystem seems unwell. If you are concerned with security, reliability, or long-term maintenance, it is almost impossible to pick a suitable package to use — both because there are 1.3 million packages available, and even if you find one that is well documented and maintained, it might depend on hundreds of other packages, with dependency trees stretching ten or more levels deep — as one developer, it’s impossible to validate them all.</p>

<p>I spend some time measuring the extent of the problem.</p>

<p>I suggest that this is a social problem, more than a technical one, and propose a semi-social solution: a human-maintained subset of the total registry, based on shared criteria by which a “healthy” package can receive a seal of approval. One criterion would be to only depend on other approved packages.</p>

<h3 id="the-premise">The premise</h3>

<p>I don’t like the way I feel when I’m installing packages with npm. Selecting a package, installing it, discovering the 93 additional packages that were installed along with it, and hoping all of <em>them</em> are also suitable for my project… it feels out of control.</p>

<p>I feel unhappy because picking dependencies is hard, so I blame npm, and that way my problems are not my fault.</p>

<p>Is there some way for me to measure this badness, and thus more thoroughly escape the blame?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-a-bit-like-a-scientist-but-not-too-much">Thinking a bit like a scientist, but not too much</h3>

<p>Can we make meaningful empirical measurements of the health of the <acronym>npm</acronym> registry? I think so; but before I do, in order to maintain the slightest semblance of impartiality, I want to lay out what I <em>expect</em> a healthy package registry to look like. If it turns out that npm, taken as a whole, mostly looks the way I expect a healthy registry to look, I’ll have to put my tail between my legs and take ownership of my struggles. If it looks wildly different, I’ll still have hope for blaming the system.</p>

<h3 id="imagining-a-healthy-repository">Imagining a healthy repository</h3>

<p>In my ideal world there are, mostly, 4 types of packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Utilities:</strong></p>

    <p>A utility is a simple package, with no dependencies, that accomplishes a single small but onerous task. For example: lodash is a collection of utilities (and you can install each one separately). Controversially, left-pad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Libraries:</strong></p>

    <p>A library is one step up in abstraction. It may depend on a handful of utilities, and it accomplishes a whole set of related tasks. For example: urlib has just a few simple dependencies, and while it does many things, it respects a clear unifying principle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Frameworks:</strong></p>

    <p>A framework provides scaffolding for an entire project, and may depend on multiple libraries and utilities. You should only ever need zero or one of these in your project. Examples: React, angular, express.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plugins:</strong></p>

    <p>A plugin enhances a framework with additional, special-use functionality. For a plugin, the framework should be a peer dependency, not a true dependency. It might also depend directly on a library, or a handful of utilities. Examples: an angular component or a jquery plugin.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, the world is messy! I don’t expect 100% of packages to fit into such simple categories, nor are any of these definitions strict and unyielding. But overall, I’d hope <em>many</em> or even <em>most</em> packages to <em>mostly</em> conform to a categorization <em>something</em> like that, with most packages being utilities and libraries, and the fewest packages being frameworks.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-that-mean-statistically">What would that mean statistically?</h3>

<p>In a world where packages fit mostly into that hierarchy, a registry of many packages would have these qualities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No dependency cycles</li>
  <li>Most packages would have dependency trees 0-4 levels deep, leaning towards lower numbers</li>
  <li>Even the deepest and broadest frameworks would depend on fewer than 250 packages, including dependencies of dependencies (3-4 steps deep, with 3-4 dependencies per package, &lt;= 4<sup>4</sup> max). Most packages would install well under 30 other packages. These numbers are extremely generous; smaller numbers would make me even happier.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-we-actually-see">What do we actually see?</h3>

<p>I downloaded the metadata for all 1.3 million packages in the npmjs.org repository and attempted to crunch some numbers. (For more technical details on how I did this, see the final section, titled “Appendix: Methods”)</p>

<p>I’m going to use “the number of other packages that depend on this one” as a poor-man’s proxy for how popular a package is. It’s not a <em>good</em> proxy, but neither is the other common choice: the number of downloads (see the section <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/#background">“Background”</a>, from PyPI). The number of downloads would have been much more computationally expensive to acquire, so I used dependents.</p>

<h3 id="circular-dependencies">Circular dependencies</h3>

<p>Of those 1.3 million packages, 1,700 depend directly on themselves, either perfectly circularly, or a different version of the same package. I have no explanation for that.</p>

<p>2500 packages are part of a two-package dependency cycle.</p>

<p>Then ~500, ~125, and ~25 are part of 3-, 4-, and 5-package cycles, respectively. (These are not always simple circles; it may be three codependent packages in any loopy arrangement)</p>

<p>My immediate reaction was that those numbers seemed like good news; out of a million packages, only a tiny percentage of oddball packages have circular dependencies, and the rest are fine. Right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what I discovered was that almost 150,000 packages — more than 1 in 10 — had at least one of these circular dependencies <em>somewhere</em> in their dependency graph. That means at least a few of those “oddballs” are actually major, highly-referenced packages. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>babel-core</code> depends on <code>babel-register</code>, which depends on <code>babel-core</code>.</li>
  <li><code>yeoman-generator</code> depends on <code>yeoman-environment</code> which depends on <code>yeoman-generator</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are not isolated instances; I plucked them as the most easily recognizable out of a list of dozens of highly-depended-upon packages with circular dependencies.</p>

<p>I need to be clear, here, that this is not <em>technically</em> a problem! <acronym>npm</acronym> can install these packages just fine. They can circularly-depend on one another; there’s no technical problem. They work. Obviously. If <code>babel-core</code> didn’t work, someone would have said something by now.</p>

<p>But I’m not particularly comfortable with it. I’m especially uncomfortable when the cycles involved are longer than two packages, which makes them seem less intentional. Maybe there’s a good reason; these folks are smart, and I always try to assume that odd choices were made for important reasons. And yet…</p>

<h3 id="what-about-devdependencies">What about <code>devDependencies</code>?</h3>

<p>Among the most-depended-upon packages are</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>@types/</code>[something]</li>
  <li>compilers like <code>typescript</code> and <code>babel</code></li>
  <li>build systems like <code>gulp</code> and <code>webpack</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m <strong>not</strong> measuring that using <code>devDependencies</code> — <code>typescript</code> appears in over 12,000 “dependency” lists.</p>

<p>So while I am less concerned with packages having large and deep <code>devDependency</code> trees (I <em>am</em> still concerned, but less so), it seems that a large proportion of packages aren’t making use of the distinctions between <code>dependencies</code> and <code>devDependencies</code> in the first place. That <em>is</em> concerning.</p>

<h3 id="dependency-tree-depths">Dependency tree depths</h3>

<p>I am defining the depth of a package’s dependency tree as the longest dependency-of-a-dependency-of-a-dependency chain I can find. Especially deep dependency trees are a problem because of how difficult they make it to audit all the packages that will get installed when including a single new package.</p>

<p>The <em>average</em> dependency tree depth in npmjs.org is just under 4. Which doesn’t sound too bad!</p>

<p>As often happens, though, the mean does not tell the whole story. Almost half of all packages have no dependencies at all — which is a good thing! — but all those zeros dramatically drop the average of the packages that <em>do</em> have dependencies.</p>

<p>If we charted of the number of packages with each dependency tree depth greater than zero, then based on the idealized registry I imagined above, here’s what I’d hope to see:</p>

<p><strong>Imagined:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth_ideal.svg" alt="Imaginary chart of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>And here’s what we actually get:</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth.svg" alt="Real chart of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>Remember that we were hoping for mostly 2, 3, and 4. Instead, there is still a long tail of packages with tree depths <em>above 20</em>. 20 is… much larger than I was expecting, and I was expecting to be disappointed.</p>

<p>But let’s re-use the “oddball” theory: perhaps all those packages with extremely deep dependency trees are rarely used, and not worth worrying about. Let’s check.</p>

<p>Here’s a scatterplot, where each package is placed based on its tree depth plotted and how many other packages reference it. On the right of the plot are the most-referenced (~popular) packages; on the top are the deepest dependency trees. Again, my hopes first:</p>

<p><strong>Imagined:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth_and_dependents_ideal.svg" alt="Imaginary scatterplot of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>Followed by reality:</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth_and_dependents.svg" alt="Real scatterplot of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>There are heaps of 10+ tree-depths up among even the most popular packages, and a few even reach 20+. Extremely deep trees are not just a problem of “oddball” packages.</p>

<h3 id="direct-dependencies-branching-factor">Direct dependencies (branching factor)</h3>

<p>The average number of direct dependencies (among packages with any dependencies at all) is 5. That, by itself, doesn’t seem to bad. It feels a little alarming when combined with high tree depths, though. Does that mean some of these packages have 5<sup>10</sup> total dependencies? (Spoiler: no.)</p>

<p>Here’s a graph of how many packages have 1 dependency, 2 dependencies… up to 30 — a nice, neat exponential decay.</p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_direct_dependencies.svg" alt="Chart of package counts per direct dependencies"></p>

<p>This curve is clean enough that I would not be surprised to see something pretty similar in any package registry — maybe not the exact same parameters, but a similar shape. Not shown here is an <em>incredibly</em> long tail; there are 4 packages tied for the most direct dependencies with exactly 1000, and there are runners-up spread pretty smoothly up to that maximum.</p>

<h3 id="indirect-dependencies">Indirect dependencies</h3>

<p>Knowing the average depth and branching factor, you have to imagine that counting the total dependencies of each package, including dependencies-of-dependencies, is not going to yield good news. But many of the branches of a large dependency tree are shared — multiple packages in the tree all depend on the same library. And the tree depth I have measured is the <em>maximum</em> depth for each package — not the average. So the picture is not necessarily as dire as an initial …</p></div></div>

		<p>PicToBrick is a <span>software to generate mosaics</span> from digital pictures. The materials to construct the mosaic as well as their colours and forms can be chosen freely. For mosaics constructed  by <span>Ministeck®</span> and <span>LEGO®</span> PicToBrick provides complete system configurations. These configurations contain information for current colours and respectively forms of elements and can be modified and enlarged user-defined.</p>
		<p>To get results as good as possible for different master illustrations seven methods of  colour definition (quantisation) are at your disposal. In addition you can choose between five methods to define the element forms (tiling).</p>
		<p>Besides the produced mosaic picture PicToBrick provides a multitude of different output documents. Among other things they contain a list of materials, a construction manual as well as information about the utilised colours and forms of  material.</p>
		<p>PicToBrick was completely developed in <span>JAVA</span> and can be used <span>cross platform</span> (Windows, Linux, Mac). The software is published as <span>open source</span> under GPL2. Furthermore PricToBrick is <span>free</span>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Each container except read only image space, consume also some writable space from storage layer.<br>
This writable and none writable space are managed together by storage driver.</p>

<p>Storage driver is a plugin for docker which is responsible for creating and maintaining union filesystem used by containers - for example: creating proper directory layout on filesystem.<br>
It is important to notice that under storage driver we always have got regular filesystem like ext4, zfs or vfs.</p>
<p>Storage drivers in docker language are called graph drivers.</p>

<p>For all currently supported Linux distributions preferred storage driver is overlay2. After installing docker it is set by default if kernel supports it.</p>
<p>If we want use another driver it is good to follow bellow rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>RHEL/CentOS/Fedora - kernel 4.x+ - docker 17.06 and newer - overlay2</li>
<li>RHEL/CentOS/Fedora - kernel lower than 4.x - docker lower than 17.06 - devicemapper</li>
<li>Ubuntu/Debian - kernel 4.x+ - overlay2</li>
<li>Ubuntu/Debian - kernel 3.13 - aufs</li>
<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server - brtfs</li>
<li>btrfs or zfs as backing filesystem - btrfs or zfs</li>
<li>no copy on write can be used - vfs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>overlay2, overlay -&gt; xfs with ftype=1, ext4</li>
<li>aufs	-&gt; xfs, ext4</li>
<li>devicemapper	-&gt; direct-lvm</li>
<li>btrfs -&gt; btrfs</li>
<li>zfs -&gt; zfs</li>
<li>vfs -&gt; any filesystem</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="important">Important!</h5>
<p>Best option is to set storage driver once when we setting up our docker host and not changing it later.<br>
If we have to change it on used for a while host, we should remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>main path for docker files for Linux is <code>/var/lib/docker</code></li>
<li>under <code>/var/lib/docker</code> each storage driver creates folder in which storage files are stored - for overlay2 path will be: <code>/var/lib/docker/overlay2</code>, for aufs path will be <code>/var/lib/docker/aufs</code> etc.</li>
<li>after changing storage drivers all images and containers writable layers stays at directory for storage driver that created them!</li>
</ul>
<p>We have to manually move docker images with <code>docker save</code>(before changing driver), <code>docker load</code>(after changing driver) and starting our containers - that all objects get recreated under new storage driver directory.</p>

<div>

<p>Introducing <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/stress"><code>stress</code>, a simple tool for debugging inconsistent errors</a>. No one likes seeing a test fail in (CI) and then pressing <code>Up</code> + <code>Enter</code> every 3 minutes locally to catch a flake!<sup><a href="https://cbzehner.com/introducing-stress/#lovemanuallytesting">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Try it out! <code>cargo install stress &amp;&amp; stress --output --bail -- ls -a</code></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>This is frustratingly common in tests due to a variety of factors including</p>
<ul>
<li>Code-skew as the code changes without updating the tests</li>
<li>Poor test isolation</li>
<li>Transient errors as tests interact with multiple pieces of infrastructure. Ex: frontend + backend + database</li>
</ul>
<p>Often the fix is either <del>deleting the test</del><sup><a href="https://cbzehner.com/introducing-stress/#deletingflakes">2</a></sup> editing the test code or changing something about the environment where the test is running, increasing available memory or tweaking the config.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Pass in a command say <code>ls -a</code> and it will be run a specified number of times (default: 10). The exit codes encountered and the number of occurrences will be printed out along with the command output (with the <code>--output</code> flag). </p>
<p>If all that's needed is to see if any runs fail there's a <code>--bail</code> flag that stops the program on the first command run that ends with a failure (non-zero exit code).</p>

<p>Definitely! That's also a great option if it works for you! A while-loop in bash should be sufficient, as one of my coworkers wisely pointed out.</p>
<p>So why do this, you might wonder? Just to scratch my own itch.</p>
<p>Next time I need to debug a test, I can focus on the problem instead of the tooling.</p>
<h2 id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading</h2>
<p>Leave your thoughts and feedback <a href="https://github.com/cbzehner/stress/issues">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you're using <code>stress</code> <a href="https://github.com/cbzehner/stress/issues">let me know</a> how I can improve it for <em>you</em>.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p><a name="lovemanuallytesting">1</a>: If you love manually trying to catch flakes...uh...🤯</p>
<p><a name="deletingflakes">2</a>: This is obviously a joke! But it's not always the wrong approach. Test flakes, especially in CI, are a burden on your entire engineering team. They slow down continuous development and reduce trust in the test suite. Empowering engineers to turn off flakes forces engineering teams to confront a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>, failed CI runs.</p>

The first draft for Service Workers has been <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-service-workers-20140508/">published in 2014</a> and now they are supported by <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/">all major browsers</a>.</p><p>Like the definition already pointed out, Service Workers are network proxies. This means that that they can <strong>control all
network requests</strong> from the page and they can be programmed to respond with a <strong>cached response</strong>.</p><p>Just like Web Workers, their code is executed in a <strong>separate thread</strong>, which allows them to be active even though all tabs of the webpage are closed.
The browser, however, will terminate and re-activate them depending on whether they are being used or not.</p><p>The Service Worker API <strong>relies heavily on promises</strong>, which is why it's recommended to learn about them first. A good point to start if you're new to
promises is <a href="https://web.dev/promises/">Google's developer blog</a>.</p><h2 id="how-can-i-register-a-service-worker"><a href="#how-can-i-register-a-service-worker" aria-label="how can i register a service worker permalink"></a>How can I register a Service Worker?</h2><p>Registering a Service Worker doesn't involve much code at all. All you need is a JavaScript file
for the Service Worker code (I'll call it <code>service-worker.js</code>) and a place in your application where you'll register it.
In my example, <code>service-worker.js</code> is located at the root of the project and hosted under the same domain.</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

examples.</p><p>Service Workers enable the following features, which are the core of Progressive Web Apps:</p><ul><li>Offline capabilities</li><li>Periodic background syncs</li><li>Push notifications</li></ul><h3 id="offline-capabilities"><a href="#offline-capabilities" aria-label="offline capabilities permalink"></a>Offline capabilities</h3><blockquote><p><em>Since this is the main selling point of Service Workers, I'll go a little more into the details of how this works.</em></p></blockquote><p>Service Workers provide offline capabilities by <strong>caching</strong> resources and <strong>intercepting</strong> network requests, which can
be served with the previously cached resources instead of requesting the server.</p><p>We can derive two steps from this:</p><ul><li>Precaching</li><li>Serving requests from the cache</li></ul><p>Both of these steps make use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache">Cache API</a>, which can be used by Web Workers and the browser and which provides us
with a <strong>storage mechanism for network requests</strong>.</p><p>Access to localStorage is blocked for the context of Web- and Service Workers to prevent concurrency issues.
As an alternative, IndexedDB can be used for storing larger amounts of data.</p><h4 id="precaching"><a href="#precaching" aria-label="precaching permalink"></a>Precaching</h4><p>Precaching is a term that describes downloading and caching files <em>before</em> the Service Worker becomes active.
It's done during the "<a href="https://felixgerschau.com/service-worker-lifecycle-update#installing">Installing</a>" step of the Service Worker's lifecycle.
Once the Service Worker has become active, it will then be ready to serve the files from the cache.</p><blockquote><p><em>I wrote an entire <a href="https://felixgerschau.com/service-worker-lifecycle-update/">article on the Service Worker lifecycle</a>, which is why I won't go deeper on this topic right now.</em></p></blockquote><p>Usually, we want to cache the <a href="https://felixgerschau.com/how-to-make-your-react-app-a-progressive-web-app-pwa/#application-shell">Application Shell</a>,
which is the minimal amount of code required to run your website. It's the <strong>bundle of code that you would upload to
an app store</strong> if you developed a native application. This includes all the basic JavaScript, HTML, and pictures necessary.</p><p>service-worker.js</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>self<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'install'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

for the <code>install</code> and <code>activate</code> events of the Service Worker (read the documentation <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ExtendableEvent">here</a>).</p><h5 id="what-about-bundled-files"><a href="#what-about-bundled-files" aria-label="what about bundled files permalink"></a>What about bundled files?</h5><p>You might not always know the name of the files you want to precache because you are using a bundler that auto-generates
files with hashes in their names (like Webpack or Rollup for example).</p><p>For those cases, you can use <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox">Workbox</a>,
which provides tools that integrate into your build and automatically create a precaching list for you
(check out the Workbox plugin for <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-workbox">Rollup</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-webpack-plugin">Webpack</a>).</p><h4 id="serving-requests-from-the-cache"><a href="#serving-requests-from-the-cache" aria-label="serving requests from the cache permalink"></a>Serving requests from the cache</h4><p>At this stage we already have all our application code stored in the cache and the Service Worker has become active and is controlling the page.</p><p>Now the only thing missing is listening to the <code>fetch</code> event and returning results from the cache.</p><p>service-worker.js</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>self<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'fetch'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

As a fallback, we make a network request.</p><p>This is called a <strong>cache first</strong> strategy. There are a few others, like <strong>network first</strong>, <strong>cache only</strong> and <strong>network only</strong>.
The names are already pretty self-explaining but if you want to read more about it you can read more on
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/caching-files-with-service-worker">Google's developer blog</a>.</p><h3 id="periodic-background-syncs"><a href="#periodic-background-syncs" aria-label="periodic background syncs permalink"></a>(Periodic) background syncs</h3><p>As I already mentioned in the introduction, Service Workers run on a <strong>separate thread</strong> from the other Service Workers and they can even
execute their code when the page is closed. This ability is important for doing background synchronizations and providing push notifications.</p><p>I put "periodic" in parentheses because background syncs and periodic background syncs are not quite the same.
So let's have a look at what they can do:</p><h4 id="background-syncs"><a href="#background-syncs" aria-label="background syncs permalink"></a>Background syncs</h4><p>Background syncs are usually used for synchronizing data after the user navigated away from the page.</p><p>As an example, after editing a document on your phone you will hit "save" and leave the page. If your internet
connection drops during editing the document, you would have to wait for the connection to come back
to save the document.</p><p>Background syncs intend to solve this problem by <strong>automatically sending the data once the connection is re-established</strong>.</p><p>Instead of actively waiting for the connection to come back, your UI can give immediate feedback that the changes will be saved
in the background and you can put the phone back without losing time.</p><p>Let's have a look at a code example:</p><p>app.js</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>navigator<span>.</span>serviceWorker<span>.</span>ready<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>registration</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> registration<span>.</span>sync<span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'sync-save-document'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>This codes registers a one-time sync in the Service Worker.</p><p>service-worker.js</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>self<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'sync'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>event<span>.</span>tag <span>===</span> <span>'sync-save-document'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    event<span>.</span><span>waitUntil</span><span>(</span><span>saveDocument</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>We can identify the sync by its <code>tag</code> attribute.</p><p><code>saveDocument</code> is a function that returns a promise that can either be resolved or rejected. If it's being rejected — due to
network issues for example — the sync will automatically try again.</p><p>One important thing to note is that the <strong>sync tags have to be unique</strong>. If I want to schedule 5 background syncs of the type
"message" for example, only the last one will go through. That's why in this case, each tag should have a unique identifier.</p><h4 id="periodic-background-syncs-1"><a href="#periodic-background-syncs-1" aria-label="periodic background syncs 1 permalink"></a>Periodic background syncs</h4><p>Periodic background syncs are supposed to solve a different problem than normal background syncs. This API can be used
for <strong>updating data in the background</strong> without having to wait for any interaction of the user.</p><p>This can be useful for a broad range of apps. With this technology, the user might be able to read the latest news articles without
having an internet connection.</p><p>To prevent websites from abusing this, <strong>the frequency of those synchronizations depends on the site-engagement score</strong>,
which the browser sets for every website. If you open a specific web app a lot, this frequency can go up to a maximum of 12 hours.</p><p>Another requirement for this to work is that the website is installed and added to the home screen as a Progressive Web App on mobile
devices.</p><p>At the time of writing this article, the <code>periodicSync</code> API is only supported by Chrome (v80) and Edge and thus not ready for
production use.</p><h3 id="push-notifications"><a href="#push-notifications" aria-label="push notifications permalink"></a>Push notifications</h3><p>Another native-like feature that Service Workers enable is push-notifications.
We usually know them from our phones in the form of messages or social media notifications, but they are also available on desktop computers.</p><p>They are supported on <strong>all major browsers except Safari</strong>, which has its own implementation for the desktop app.</p><p>To use push notifications, you need to set up a server, that will be <em>pushing</em> the notification to all clients.
Since the Service Worker runs in the background on a different thread, the user will be able to see push notifications <strong>even though
the page isn't currently open</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><em>The implementation is a little more complicated and worth of an article on its own, that's why I won't include any code examples
here. You can check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-push-notifications">this introduction</a> if you are curious.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="service-worker-browser-support"><a href="#service-worker-browser-support" aria-label="service worker browser support permalink"></a>Service Worker Browser Support</h2><p data-feature="serviceworkers" data-periods="future_1,current,past_1,past_2" data-accessible-colours="false">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the earliest bits of code in Laddertruck, the Ruby on Rails app that powers FireHydrant, consistently gets a mention in our Slack. Here it is:</p><pre><p><span>fun_creator = FunctionalityCreator.new(organization, actor: actor, account: account)</span></p><p><span>fun_creator.create(fun).tap do |funfunfun_looking_forward_to_the_weekend|</span></p><p><span>  if funfunfun_looking_forward_to_the_weekend.successful?</span></p><p><span>    service.functionalities &lt;&lt; funfunfun_looking_forward_to_the_weekend.object</span></p><p><span>  end</span></p><p><span>end</span></p></pre><p>If you’re unfamiliar, this is an homage to the oh so catchy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0">Rebecca Black’s “Friday.”</a></p><p>This tiny chunk of code adds functionality to a service in a user’s FireHydrant organization. As far as the user knows, this code could be anything, with any variables, and any class names.&nbsp;<strong>They only care that it works.</strong>&nbsp;But to us, this piece of code is much more, it’s a reflection of who we are as a team.</p><h3>The codebase should be a fun place to work</h3><p>We’re remote first, especially now, at FireHydrant. With no office, watercooler, or team outings, it can be challenging to talk to your peers. The place that we do “talk” to each other is our code. Our codebase is our metaphorical office, it’s where we collaborate and solve problems together. So why do so many companies have a codebase that’s sterile and devoid of any fun?</p><p>At FireHydrant, there’s a consistent laugh when you work in our codebases. You’ll find all sorts of things ranging from YouTube links that you have no idea where they go (it’s not a Rickroll, I promise), funny test arguments, and witty mentions to a phrase a teammate uses.</p><p>Take this piece that needs to clear a cache on the record in Laddertruck</p><pre><p><span># THE FRESH MAKER</span></p><p><span># &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgqgcE8Zck&gt;</span></p><p><span>incident.reload</span></p></pre><p>Another example is one of our engineers saying “dig” when he likes something. I believe it means “I dig it.” It caught on a little bit in the team, so when voting on runbooks was introduced, this line of code came with it.</p><pre><p><span>case params[:direction]</span></p><p><span>when ‘up’, ‘dig’</span></p><p><span>  # … voting up logic</span></p><p><span>when ‘down’</span></p><p><span>  # …</span></p><p><span>end</span></p></pre><p>Beyond having fun in code, we also write comments as if we were talking to each other in person. You can almost tell who wrote the comment without needing to git blame. They are entertaining to read, and I sometimes wonder if I would skip it entirely if it had no personality.</p><p>Said another way, our codebase has a personality:&nbsp;<strong>our company’s personality</strong>. Yours does, too.</p><h3>Your codebase is a result of your culture.</h3><p>You can see codebase culture in programming language communities. If you’re a Rubyist like I am, you probably know about the fun rubygem names like capybara, faraday, and puma. It’s not a surprise that the Ruby community has this commonality with personalities like Aaron “Tenderlove” Patterson and Bryan “test all the f***ng time” Liles, to name only two. Both of whom were exceptionally early in the Ruby community itself.</p><p>It’s incredibly likely that your company’s codebase mimics the personality of the engineers contributing to it. If you want a no-frills codebase, you should hire people that exhibit that behavior in their day to day work. If you wish to have a codebase that is fun and will make you laugh from time to time as I do, you need to hire people with that personality. It truly is your decision on what type of codebase culture you want, and it starts with hiring.</p><h3>Culture is set early.</h3><p>Probably everyone at FireHydrant has heard me say this: The trajectory of anything is set the second time you do something.</p><p>If you want to have a test-driven development culture, do it early and often. If you want a good code review culture, do it on as many pull requests as possible. If you want to see fun variables, Easter egg links, and descriptive comments… you get the idea.</p><h3>What type of codebase do you want?</h3><p>If your codebase doesn’t have your team’s personality, or worse, has a toxic one, what does that say about it? What constraints are teams operating within that they think exist, but don’t? Are people not writing comments because there is another group that thinks comments are useless? Are there no tests because it feels pointless to write one now?</p><p>A codebase with no personality makes me think of an office with bright fluorescent lights, plain walls, and no windows. I’d also assume product and project managers write a Jira issue, wad it up, and throw it to engineers saying it needs to be done by the end of the week.</p><p>We’re designing a company at FireHydrant. The early decisions we’ve made like the name of the application itself (Laddertruck), object names and even Slack channels like <code>#wtf_is_happening_with_my_code</code> are going to end up in our customer’s hands either directly, or indirectly. We want FireHydrant to be a fun and uplifting place to work, and looking at our codebase is one of the many ways to verify we’re doing that successfully.</p><p>Your codebase(s) are where you work, and having one that lacks any personality will make engineers feel like they don’t have agency in their contributions to it. I’m not advocating that you should name every single variable something funny, or that you should always write comments in first-person. Doing so would lead to a funhouse codebase where you have no idea what is up, down, left, or right. But every once in awhile, it’s a great idea to add some pizzazz to the codebase.</p><p>So why name a variable <code>functionality_creator</code> when you can call it <code>fun_creator</code> ?</p></div></div>]]>

June 29, 2020 | https://blog.wikichoon.com/2020/06/virt-manager-deprecated-in-rhel.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.wikichoon.com/2020/06/virt-manager-deprecated-in-rhel.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I'm the primary author of virt-manager. virt-manager is deprecated in RHEL8 in favor of cockpit, but ONLY in RHEL8 and future RHEL releases. The upstream project virt-manager is still maintained and is still relevant for other distros.</p>
<p>Google 'virt-manager deprecated' and you'll find some discussions suggesting
virt-manager is no longer maintained, <a href="https://cockpit-project.org/">Cockpit</a> is replacing virt-manager, virt-manager is going to be removed from every distro, etc. These conclusions are misinformed.</p>
<p>The primary source for this confusion is the section 'virt-manager has been deprecated' from the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.2_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_virtualization">RHEL8 release notes virtualization deprecation section</a>. Relevant quote from the RHEL8.2 docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Virtual Machine Manager application, also known as virt-manager, has been deprecated.
The RHEL 8 web console, also known as Cockpit, is intended to become its replacement in a subsequent release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What that means:</p>
<ul>
<li>virt-manager is in RHEL8 and will be there for the lifetime of RHEL8.</li>
<li>Red Hat engineering effort assigned to the virt-manager UI has been reduced compared to previous RHEL versions.</li>
<li>The tentative plan is to not ship the virt-manager UI in RHEL9.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this happening? As I understand it, RHEL wants to roughly standardize on Cockpit as their host admin UI tool. It's a great project with great engineers and great UI designers. Red Hat is going all in on it for RHEL and aims to replace the mismash of system-config-X tools and project specific admin frontends (like virt-manager) with a unified project. (Please note: this is my paraphrased understanding, I'm not speaking on behalf of Red Hat here.)</p>
<p>Notice though, this is all about RHEL. virt-manager is not deprecated upstream, or deprecated in other distros automatically just because RHEL has made this decision. The upstream virt-manager project continues on and Red Hat continues to allocate resources to maintain it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm distinguishing virt-manager UI from the virt-manager project, which includes tools like <code>virt-install</code>. I fully expect <code>virt-install</code> to be shipped in RHEL9 and actively maintained (FWIW Cockpit uses it behind the scenes).</p>
<p>And even if the virt-manager UI is not in RHEL9 repos, it will likely end up shipped in EPEL, so the UI will still be available for install, just through external repos.</p>
<p>Overall my personal opinion is that as long as libvirt+KVM is in use on linux desktops and servers, virt-manager will be relevant. I don't expect anything to change in that area any time soon.</p>

			<p><span>D</span>ear Bella,</p><p>I’m going to imitate Rudyard Kipling and tell you a just-so story. Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the world 100 years ago. He wrote <i>The Jungle Book</i>. And also <i>Just So Stories</i>, which began as bedtime stories he told his daughter Josephine. They were about how animals got their famous features, like the camel’s hump and the leopard’s spots. Kipling was a wonderful writer but he made up his animal stories. My story is based on science, which means many people, through many recent experiments, have concluded things might “just so” be the way of this story.</p><p>It’s also a story about evolution, which is nature’s research and development department. Like Kipling, I’ve given a human voice to certain things: Bacteria form committees and petition the research and development department for answers to their problems, as do plants and dinosaurs. And the R&amp;D department (which is to say, evolution) tries to come up with solutions. I’m going to call evolution “Mr. R&amp;D.” When he finds a problem, Mr. R&amp;D tests things out in different ways to come up with a solution. But sometimes those solutions have unforeseen consequences. So here we go!</p><blockquote><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. But why did dinosaurs have them?</p> </blockquote><p>Once upon a time, on a cold day in January, I was jogging through Regent’s Park in London, stepping carefully through flocks of geese, seagulls, pigeons, and ducks surrounding the boating lake. But, perhaps because of the book I had just been reading (Nick Lane’s <i>Oxygen</i>) my eye picked out a couple of geese that were strangers in this flock: Bar-headed geese, a boy and a girl.<br></p><p>But what were they doing in London in January? During the winter, they usually live in the middle of India, and in the summer they live in Kazakhstan or Mongolia. If you look at a map of the Earth, you can see the barrier between Kazakhstan and India is the Himalayan Mountain Range, the tallest in the world. Every year, millions of bar-headed geese migrate over the Himalayas and have been doing so for millions of years. They have been seen flying at 28,000 feet. They have flown over Mount Everest! How do they do that?</p><p>The answer seems to be that bar-headed geese, like all birds—hummingbirds, ostriches, pigeons—have super-efficient lungs. It makes our lungs—and the lungs of all mammals—look primitive. I’m sure when birds get together they gossip about how pathetic our lungs are!</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17339_169ea72d893b7bfe6a36b531a78b48af.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BIG AIR:</strong> Dinosaur’s lungs were so efficient that when oxygen levels rose over tens of millions of years, they were able to get very big—bigger than land mammals like elephants have ever gotten, or ever could get.</span><span>VectorPlotnikoff / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>All mammals, including us, breathe in through the same opening that we breathe out. Can you imagine if our digestive system worked the same way? What if the food we put in our mouths, after digestion, came out the same way? It doesn’t bear thinking about! Luckily, for digestion, we have a separate in and out. And that’s what the birds have with their lungs: an in point and an out point. They also have air sacs and hollow spaces in their bones. When they breathe in, half of the good air (with oxygen) goes into these hollow spaces, and the other half goes into their lungs through the rear entrance. When they breathe out, the good air that has been stored in the hollow places now also goes into their lungs through that rear entrance, and the bad air (carbon dioxide and water vapor) is pushed out the front exit. So it doesn’t matter whether birds are breathing in or out: Good air is always going in one direction through their lungs, pushing all the bad air out ahead of it.<br></p><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. Birds are dinosaurs! When I was growing up in the 1940s, there was a category in biology called Aves, which meant birds. But scientists have now folded Aves into a category called Dinosauria, and those dinosauria, like pigeons and seagulls and geese, are flying all around us today. If you want to know what a dinosaur probably tasted like, eat some chicken!</p><blockquote><p>Plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this.</p> </blockquote><p>So, dinosaurs had this super-efficient lung system, and they successfully strode the Earth as the dominant species, starting around 250 million years ago to about 65 million years ago, when a huge asteroid crashed into Mexico and most of them went extinct. Except for birds. But why did dinosaurs have this super lung system in the first place?<br></p><p>To answer that, we have to go way back, to when plants came out of the ocean onto land, about 450 million years ago. Earlier than that, plant life lived only in the ocean: The surface of the Earth was a desert.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity, some pioneer plants got together and said, “Let’s go!” and migrated up onto land. But once the plants got out of the water, they discovered something they never had to deal with in the ocean: gravity. In the ocean, if you’re a plant, you can just float, because the density of a plant is not that different from water. Out of the ocean, the density of a plant is much greater than air, and so gravity can pull it down.</p><p>So for many tens of millions of years, plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this, and decided to form a committee to request an exemption from Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello. What’s your problem?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Our problem is gravity. We never had to deal with it in the ocean, and it’s a problem for us on land.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Why is gravity a problem for you?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: We want to do what we did in the ocean, which is absorb lots of sunlight, and the best way to do that is to have a long stalk, and then to have branches with leaves at the end of the branches and maximize our potential to absorb sunlight.</p> <p><b>MR. R&amp;D</b>: I understand what you want, but it will take me some time. Come back in a million years or so.</p> <p><i>The plants twiddle their thumbs for a million years.</i></p> <p><b>PC</b>: OK, a million years is up! Did you manage to discover something?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Yes, let me see, I think I have it in the drawer. Here it is: lignin.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: What’s lignin?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: It’s a rigid molecule made of carbon and hydrogen. If you absorb it into the cells of your body, it will interact with the molecules of floppy cellulose you already have, and this will create a very firm structure that will allow your cells to become like bricks. You can then stack one cell upon the other, and you can go as high as you want.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: How high?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Over 300 feet.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Wow!</p> <p>So the plants happily swallowed the lignin, and sure enough, it worked exactly as Mr. R&amp;D said, and within a short time stalks, trunks, branches, roots, leaves began popping up all over the Earth.</p> <p>The only problem was that when one of these trees reached the end of its natural life, bacteria and fungal spores got ready to decompose it, sharpening their knives. But when they got to the lignin, their knives stuck: They couldn’t digest the lignin. The very thing that made lignin strong defeated the bacteria and fungi back then. So, they did what we do when we eat a chicken dinner: They ate all the meat and left the bones, which is to say: the lignin.</p><p>Eventually another tree would die and fall on top of the first, and then the same thing would happen again, and another and another, and it kept going like this for hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions of years. In the end, over 100 million years of dead trees and ferns and undigested lignin were deposited under the surface of the Earth. We call the time when most of this happened the Carboniferous (carbon-making) age.</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17341_c9dcf2529a5f4bf66234540fbe60b74e.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BUG OUT:</strong> Around 300 million years ago, there was so much oxygen that insects, who have inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies (seen here in a lifesize model in Italy) had a wingspan of about three feet.</span><span>life_in_a_pixel / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>Remember how evolution sometimes has unforeseen consequences? Well, this deposit of lignin produced an oxygen surge in the atmosphere. Because for every hydrocarbon atom that goes into the Earth, an oxygen atom is not used up in the decay process. Massive amounts of carbon (lignin) were going into the Earth, so massive amounts of oxygen were building up in the atmosphere. Today, oxygen is 21 percent of the atmosphere. But around 300 million years ago, oxygen was well over 30 percent. There was so much oxygen that insects, who have very inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies had a wingspan of three feet, millipedes were eight feet long. Amphibians—frogs and such—also have inefficient lungs, and they were able to get as big as dining room tables.<br></p><p>The microorganisms of the time eventually became aware of this surge in oxygen. The insects and the amphibians didn’t seem to care, because they were dependent on that rich source of oxygen. So the now-worried microorganisms got their committee (MC) together and went to see Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello, what I can do for you?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: We think there is a dangerous situation developing, because oxygen levels have gotten higher every year and they might now be at 35 percent.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: So?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: With indigestible lignin, there is nothing to keep it from continuing to go up.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: I see your point, because at 43 percent a lightning strike will cause the entire atmosphere to ignite since it is so high in flammable oxygen. And the whole experiment of life on Earth will be over. Yes, I agree we have to do something. Give me a million years and I’ll see what I can do.</p> <p><i>For a million years, oxygen levels continue to rise. The even more worried microorganisms come back to Mr. R&amp;D.</i></p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: The bad news is I don’t have anything physical to give you. But I can give you a koan.</p> <p><b>MC</b>: What’s that?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: A koan is something you can think of that will help you in your situation. Here it is: “To receive you must first give.”</p> <p><b>MC</b>: What does that mean?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: All I can tell you is: Think about it, and it …</p></div></div>

      <b>Policy Break:</b> GitGuardian scans more than just secrets, we also scan for high risk file extension (example: keystore) and file names (example: .env), when we detect something that breaks the rules of our policies, we call this a policy break. 
</p><p>
<b>Match: </b>A match is the component that triggered a policy break, for example the match of a detected secret will be the secret string itself.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2><strong>Hi there! Who are you and whatâ€™s your background?</strong></h2>

<p>Howdy! Iâ€™m Justin Duke. I run two newsletters, both centered around my product (itself, fittingly, a newsletter tool) â€” <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown Monthly</a> and <a href="https://weeknotes.buttondown.email/">Weeknotes from Buttondown</a>. </p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not geeking out about newsletters, I â€¦ geek out about other things.  (Itâ€™s a habit.). Iâ€™m a big poetry and weightlifting nerd, and it's summer right now in Seattle so Iâ€™ve been trying to spend as much time outside as I can. (In my day job, I work as a software engineer at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, making it easier for folks to start and grow their online business.)</p>

<p>Prior to Stripe, I cut my teeth working at Amazon building out infrastructure for Kindle content.</p>

<h2><strong>What are your newsletters about?</strong></h2>

<p>As you might guess, both of my newsletters focus on <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a>: the tool itself, the landscape, and my journey both as a developer and as a creator in the indie hackers niche.  It started out as a fairly typical product development newsletter (â€œhereâ€™s what we launched this monthâ€�, â€œhereâ€™s whatâ€™s coming down the pipelineâ€�) but I realized early on that folks were resonating <em>way</em> more with the trivial pieces: the bugs I ran into, the things I learned, and my personal stories rather than the â€œcorporateâ€� side of things.</p>

<p>When I launched paid newsletters, I knew I wanted to <a href="https://deviq.com/dogfooding/">dogfood</a>, and so I thought Iâ€™d pull out some of the most interesting bits for a paid weekly newsletter.  The intended audience of my main newsletter was, first and foremost, folks who used Buttondown as a product â€” I thought it would be more fun to generalize the paid newsletter a bit, to appeal to folks who were more interested in following my journey less from the â€œnewslettersâ€� point of view and more from the â€œcreatorâ€� point of view.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Buttondown? What motivated you to create the product?</strong></h2>

<p>Buttondown is a tool Iâ€™ve built for technical newsletters! Think â€œ<a href="https://tinyletter.com/">TinyLetter</a> or <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, except with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and more APIsâ€� â€” itâ€™s a niche product for people like me, who are a bit more programmatically inclined but still want something quick and easy to manage emails and subscribers.</p>

<p>I was motivated to build Buttondown after I had been using TinyLetter for a while, and had perhaps the worst thought that any developer can have: â€œI bet I can build a better version of this in a weekend.â€�  It took quite a bit longer than that to get the entire thing done, but I was able to use my own tool instead of TinyLetter at the end of two weeks; after I showed it off to a few friends they convinced me to make it something more than just a self-hosted tool.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been building Buttondown for over three years now, after mistakenly thinking it would be a quick one-and-done project.  I got my first paying customer after around a month and itâ€™s now just shy of $5,000/month.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.radletters.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbmdDIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--32e0faa0c0d26f19431f0d9cd8755781d782cd30/btndwn2.png" alt="buttondown-product"></p>

<h2><strong>What are some of the difficulties youâ€™ve encountered in running your newsletters?</strong></h2>

<p>Motivation and timing is absolutely the hardest part for me.  Iâ€™ve been fortunate the past few months to get into a very strict schedule and rhythm (every Saturday morning, without fail, I sit down and write), but I experience a bit of a slipping effect every now and then: I forget (or life gets in the way) one weekend, so I miss it, and then the following weekend I get so anxious that I miss that one too, and so on.  The important part is <em>consistency</em>, both for yourself and for your readers.</p>

<h2><strong>Do you have a monetization strategy for your newsletters?</strong></h2>

<p>Having two newsletters means I get to segment a little bit!  My main updates newsletter is free, but you have to pay $4/month for weeknotes.  Theyâ€™re both ad-free (they advertise Buttondown, but that hardly counts ;)). Weeknotes brings in a solid $900/month, which is not exactly a life-changing amount but is still wonderful and humbling (and pays for my two biggest vices, coffee and Green Chartreuse.)</p>

<h2><strong>What newsletters are you subscribed to?</strong></h2>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Money Stuff</a> is Bloombergâ€™s daily finance newsletter written by Matt Levine.  It is, for my money, the perfect newsletter: witty, informative, and precise.  Matt does an amazing job of breaking down things like credit default swaps or investor buyouts in a way that youâ€™ll grasp them easily <em>and</em> understand the bigger picture.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://letterstosummer.com/">Letters to Summer</a> is an intimate, sweet look at a conversation between two friends.  Iâ€™ve been turned onto this one from my friend Jasdev and itâ€™s been great: Iâ€™ve discovered new games, new music, and (clichÃ© as it is to say) a little bit of a new outlook on life.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>What goals do you have for the future?</strong></h2>

<p>If you had told me two years ago Buttondown would become as large as it has, I would have laughed â€” it was a tool I made for myself first and foremost, and secondarily for my friends who also wanted an easier way to build newsletters.  Thatâ€™s equally true for the newsletters: the fact that a hundred or so folks are willing to pay me for the privilege of following me on my journey is super humbling!</p>

<p>Honestly, I hope for more of the same down the line.  Buttondown â€” both as a newsletter and a tool â€” is something that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever want to do full time, because itâ€™s a privilege that it can be a place where I <em>retreat</em> from my day job.  </p>

<h2><strong>Where can readers go to learn more about you and your newsletter?</strong></h2>

<p>Readers can visit the <a href="https://buttondown.email/">website</a>, find Buttondown on <a href="https://twitter.com/buttondown">Twitter</a>, or sign up for Weeknotes from Buttondown at <a href="https://weeknotes.buttondown.email/">weeknotes.buttondown.email</a>!</p>

We<span>'ll read in the Antartica penguins dataset directly from a .csv file at the GitHub repository that hosts seaborn'</span>s datasets<span>.</span>

Let's put the data <span>in</span> a pandas DataFrame <span>and</span> check out the first few rows<span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div data-cy="code-cell"><div><p>df_penguins <span>=</span> pd<span>.</span>read_csv<span>(</span><span>'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv'</span><span>)</span>

The first sidetable DataFrame method we<span>'ll check out is `stb.missing()`.

With `df<span>.</span>info<span>(</span><span>)</span>`<span>,</span> we would have had to do the arithmetic <span>in</span> our head<span>.</span> 🤔

Alternatively<span>,</span> we could see <span>all</span> the missing values by column <span>with</span> `df<span>.</span>isna<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>`<span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>But `df<span>.</span>isna<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>` doesn<span>'t include the percentages and isn'</span>t nicely formatted<span>.</span> Speaking of nice formatting<span>,</span> let<span>'s make sidetable'</span>s output prettier<span>.</span> 💐</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div data-cy="code-cell"><div><p>df_penguins<span>.</span>stb<span>.</span>missing<span>(</span>style<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Passing `style<span>=</span><span>True</span>` cleans up the <span>*</span>Percent<span>*</span> column formatting<span>.</span>

Yo<span>u've seen how you can use sidetable to quickly display missing values, make nicely formatted frequency tables, and show grand totals and subtotals. It'</span>s a handy little library<span>.</span> 👍



Here's a recap of the API<span>:</span>
<span>-</span> `stb<span>.</span>missing<span>(</span><span>)</span>` <span>-</span> display helpful information about missing values<span>.</span>
<span>-</span> `stb<span>.</span>freq<span>(</span><span>)</span>` <span>-</span> display counts<span>,</span> percents<span>,</span> <span>and</span> cumulative information <span>for</span> columns<span>.</span>

Passing `style<span>=</span><span>True</span>` to `stb<span>.</span>missing<span>(</span><span>)</span>` <span>and</span> `stb<span>.</span>freq<span>(</span><span>)</span>` makes the output nicely formatted<span>.</span> There are a nubmer of other arguments you can <span>pass</span> to `stb<span>.</span>freq<span>(</span><span>)</span>` to modify the output<span>.</span>

<p>These are the techniques I’ve found most effective to get paid fast when doing technology freelancing.<br></p>



<p><strong>1. Ask for a portion of the fee upfront.</strong></p>



<p>This one seems obvious to me now, but I went several years before I moved beyond the “work a bunch of hours then send an invoice and wait” model. You can do this whether you are fixed fee or hourly, basing the latter on an estimate.</p>



<p><strong>2. Ask for the entire fee upfront.</strong></p>



<p>You’d be surprised how acceptable this becomes once you simply start making it your convention. And, really, it’s not all that strange when you consider that you can’t drive away with a car (or even walk out of Walmart) before paying for your purchase, as well as the fact that in most cases you are taking on greater risk than the client is by working on a project for a client for a few weeks or months with only the “hope” that you’ll get paid at the end. You are a freelancer, not your client’s banker/lender.</p>



<p><strong>3. Set expectations upfront.</strong></p>



<p>If the buyer can make the full investment decision upfront, rather than hope or guess, it’s easier to get paid faster. A lot of delayed payments are really because the buyer is disappointed with either the fee, the value, or the result. If your fees are fixed and thus entirely set upfront, this is easy. If you charge hourly/daily/weekly, estimate conservatively and… see the next item.</p>



<p><strong>4. Offer compelling value.</strong></p>



<p>I prefer to not only discuss the project upfront, but to then come back to the client with a written summary (which ends up being the proposal). The summary is in my own words but drawn entirely from our discussions. It contains, at a minimum, with a nod to the value-based fee model taught by Alan Weiss:</p>



<ul><li>The situation appraisal</li><li>The business objectives (outputs/improved conditions) tied to the work</li><li>The believed value of the work (business-wise and sometimes personally and professionally for the buyer)</li><li>The implicit or explicit metrics or indicators of success for the work against the objectives</li></ul>



<p>In this way, the buyer and I don’t proceed until there is a true “meeting of the minds” over the value of the work. It’s easy to get into a discussion about the inputs (tasks), but the real value is in the results. The better understanding I have of the ideal result that the client has in mind, the closer I can tie my work to compelling value. And the happier the client will be to pay, period.</p>



<p><strong>5. Constantly communicate.</strong></p>



<p>You know when you should be providing updates. Generally it is whenever you’ve promised to, just before or after major milestones, when there are hiccups that may impact scheduling or results, or any other time you know you should but are avoiding doing so only because you are concerned about the reaction. 🙂</p>



<p><strong>6. Meet commitments.</strong></p>



<p>If you make a promise, meet it. Simple, but not always easy. If something isn’t going as planned, just communicate that and adjust. Unless you make a pattern of it – or don’t learn from your mistakes – it’ll be probably okay.</p>



<p><strong>7. Use plain language. (Avoid legalese.)</strong></p>



<p>Don’t create proposals that require legal departments / attorneys to get involved. And if you can’t avoid it entirely, keep them sane. Business is risk.[1]</p>



<p><strong>8. Make it easy to pay you.</strong></p>



<p>Accept checks, eChecks (ACH), and all major credit and debit cards as well as, if possible, via multiple processors. I accept payment via PayPal, Google Checkout, and Stripe. There is overlap between these, but every buyer/client has their own favorite service. I don’t care which they use, just as long as they pay as promptly or – preferably – as rapidly as possible.</p>



<p>If you are concerned about paying 2% to 3% on credit card transactions, you are overlooking that you are in a high margin business. Paying 3% on credit card transactions will make you cringe sometimes, but don’t overlook the big picture. You are providing a service with an 80%-90% profit margin. And, having money in your hand – rather than “in the mail” – is the difference between an actual sale and just talk. It’s also the difference between putting food on the table and starving waiting for money to arrive in the indefinite future.</p>



<p><strong>9. Follow-up when a payment is late. Do so immediately and in a professional, consistent, and assertive manner.</strong></p>



<p>I suggest clear language that doesn’t whine (it’s not their problem you can’t pay your mortgage, but it is their problem they are failing to fulfill their commitment). I prefer automated follow-up so that it always happens, otherwise I will put it off. Most on-line invoicing solutions can be set-up to do this automatically for you after a configured number of days.</p>



<p><strong>10. Always make payment arrangements and discuss payment problems with your buyer (the decision maker / business sponsor), not the client’s bookkeeper or accounts payable department.</strong></p>



<p>The buyer can escalate, assert their authority, and negotiate when there are problems. They are also the one who is impacted if a missed payment results in a project delay. The A/P department on the other hand isn’t any of these things.</p>



<p><strong>11. Generate professional invoices that are easy-to-read.</strong></p>



<p>They should clearly describe the work, account for every hour (if you are billing for time), and reference the project, proposal, and buyer clearly. Make them very simple, without any extra language or legalese.</p>



<p><strong>12. Send invoices in a timely manner and do so consistently.</strong></p>



<p>Immediately upon gaining agreement on a proposal. Consistently at milestones or the agreed upon dates. If possible, generate and schedule delivery ahead of time. If a series of invoices is likely, you can even provide them all upfront with rolling due dates, if that seems like it’ll be helpful.</p>



<p><strong>13. State a late fee on every invoice generated that applies if it is not the balance is paid in a timely manner.</strong></p>



<p>Pretty self-explanatory. A flat fee or charging interest are fine, but if the latter make sure you understand usurp your state/country specific restrictions on charging interest.</p>



<p><strong>14. State all invoices as being “Due upon receipt.”</strong></p>



<p>If you learn an organization is taking advantage of this phrasing to not pay within 7-10 business days, change their next invoice to be “Net 15” (due in 15 days). If they can’t pay on time, tell them to use a credit card.</p>



<p><strong>15. Offer a small discount for pre-payment in full upfront.</strong></p>



<p>I always ask for a portion of the fee upfront for every project, while offering a small discount for pre-payment in full upfront (in the 5% to 10% range). For projects I consider to be relatively small (e.g. &lt;$5,000) I don’t offer a discount, but outright require full payment upfront.</p>

<p>Ever since the <em>serverless</em> buzzword first took off around 2015, people
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22servers%20in%20serverless%22">have</a>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22servers+in+serverless%22">been</a>
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless#toc-are-there--aDx9w_gl">asking</a>.</p>
<div><p>
Are there servers in serverless?
</p>

</div>

<p>Today, after some thorough research, and drawing on my experience working in
the deepest bowels of Amazon's gargantuan cloud, I can share the definitive
answer with you. Hover your mouse over the grey box below to find out.
</p>
<p>As you can see, since the word <em>serverless</em> contains the word <em>server</em>, we have
found evidence for <em>servers</em> in <em>serverless</em>! </p>
<p>Ok, so now you think I'm a smart-ass. Also, if you were
looking closely we only found <em>one</em> server, singular.</p>
<p>If you'll just bear with me for one second, I think we can do better.</p>


<p>Whoa! It turns out, there are server<em>s</em> (plural) in server<em>less</em> after
all! <a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2>A more serious answer</h2>
<p>First, let's start with a definition of <em>serverless</em>. I'm going to use one
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless">from AWS</a>, because they popularized the
term, and seem to be the leader in the space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without
thinking about servers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a pretty good definition. Developers always say they just want to think
about business logic. They don't want to worry about messy details, so this
sounds great.  But why do very smart people get so <a href="https://twitter.com/g_bonfiglio/status/1052680017249996800">passionate and
agitated</a> about the
word <em>serverless</em>. It seems to trigger almost a primal reaction in many
engineers, because they <em>know</em> there are some computers somewhere doing <em>the
thing</em> and if they're in a datacenter, you can probably call them servers.</p>
<p>I think the answer is: <em>serverless often fails spectacularly to deliver on it's
core promise</em>. Developers using serverless technologies are often finding
themselves dealing with servers, but in weird and unusual ways.</p>
<h3>Outrageous example: Aurora Serverless</h3>
<p>This example makes me suspect that some marketing team slapped the <em>serverless</em>
name on a feature that was designed with less lofty goals. I don't know for
sure, but I can't think of a better explanation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/faqs/">Aurora Serverless FAQ states</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Aurora Serverless [...] you pay a flat rate per second [...] with a
minimum of 5 minutes of usage each time the database is activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AWS Lambda, the original service that popularized the <em>serverless</em> model has
100 <em>millisecond</em> increments for billing. But Aurora will bill me for FIVE
MINUTES For one request? That's like making one request to AWS Lambda, but
then getting charged for 3,000.</p>
<p>For comparison, the minimum billing increment for both a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing">Google Cloud Virtual
Machine (VM)</a>, or an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/#Per_Second_Billing">AWS
EC2 VM</a> is one minute.
Both of those products are actual (virtual) servers.</p>
<p>The bottom line? Aurora serverless has a less granular pricing model than
<em>actual servers</em>. That's a fail in my book.</p>
<h3>Subtle example: hunt the chips</h3>
<p>No current serverless technology<a href="#fn2"><sup>1</sup></a> abstracts the underlying
CPU. For instance, <a href="https://alestic.com/2014/11/aws-lambda-environment/">Eric
Hammond</a> found that his
Lambda function was running on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 in 2014. I think that's
the same CPU as the EC2 C3 instance type. AWS can probably migrate Lambda
functions to later-and-greater <em>Intel</em> EC2 instances without any customers
noticing too much.</p>
<p>However, AWS has recently been spruiking their ARM based Graviton2 chips as
being better value than Intel chips.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to bring customers the next gen of Amazon EC2 instances powered by <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AWS</a>-designed, Arm-based Graviton2 processors that deliver up to 40% better price/performance than comparable current x86 instances. Should be a game changer! <a href="https://t.co/UCmidWcTmP">https://t.co/UCmidWcTmP</a></p>— Andy Jassy (@ajassy) <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy/status/1271264376394149888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>
Normally I would expect the Lambda team to migrate workloads to these newer,
cheaper EC2 instances. AWS loves to talk about how they <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-storage-update-s3-glacier-price-reductions/">"work relentlessly to
reduce [costs] and to pass the resulting savings
along"</a>.
However, with Graviton and Lambda, I don't think they can. A lot of code that
was written for the Intel, or x86 architecture will likely break on ARM, even
if it's running inside virtual machines like Python, or NodeJS. AWS doesn't
know if your Python, or JavaScript code depends on <a href="https://www.nickwilcox.com/blog/arm_vs_x86_memory_model/">subtle or less
subtle</a> features of
x86 architecture. If you're using their <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html#runtimes-custom-build">custom
runtimes</a>
then it's even worse.</p>
<p>Contrast this to services like S3 and DynamoDB. How would you, a customer know
if the S3, or DynamoDB team migrated from x86 to ARM? You wouldn't. You just
see data going in, and data going out. Everything else is Amazon's problem.</p>
<p>Will serverless hit a speed-bump as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_ARM">industry</a>
<a href="https://www.top500.org/news/japan-captures-top500-crown-arm-powered-supercomputer/">shifts</a>
from Intel to ARM? Will we have to recompile our serverless functions to ARM to
get the lowest prices? I haven't seen anybody else talking about this yet, so
either I'm early, or it's less of an issue than I thought.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I've just shown one joke way, and two real ways where "servers", or the
underlying hardware are not fully abstracted by serverless. I suspect this is
one reason why people like to
<a href="https://twitter.com/IamStan/status/1018755075827814400">make</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/findgriffin/status/1205214120569556992">fun</a> of serverless
on Twitter. Additionally, I think those who argue
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq3Nx0S27dU">passionately</a> that serverless
isn't the future of our industry have a point. Surely there will be future
waves of innovation that deliver better abstractions, performance, and pricing
than serverless currently does.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you want to help me figure out what might come after serverless, please get
in touch, I have a few ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup id="fn1">1</sup> There is actually a serious point to be made here, which
is to define your branding around what you're <em>for</em> rather than what you're
<em>against</em>. The point of serverless isn't that servers are bad. It's that I (a
developer) don't want to think about them. A better name for serverless might
have been something like "developer-centric", "zero-fixed-cost", or
"granular-scalability"<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p><sup id="fn2">2</sup> I'm only counting <em>compute</em> services here. In other
words, services that execute code. Examples include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud
Functions, Azure Functions, CloudFlare Workers, and Fastly <a href="http://blog.drgriffin.com.au/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="15567a786560617055507172703b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>
<p><sup id="fn3">3</sup> Ok, none of these are great, but hopefully you get the
idea. This is why I don't work in marketing.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Office design as a risk factor for disability retirement: A prospective registry study of Norwegian employees</p><div id="abstracttext">
<p><strong>Objectives</strong> This aim of this study was to (i) examine differences in risk of subsequent disability retirement between employees working in cellular, shared, and open-plan offices and (ii) determine the contribution of gender, skill-level, work ability, medically certified sickness absence, leadership position, and personality traits (extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness) as confounders.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong> Survey data on predictor variables combined with official objective registry data on disability retirement and sickness absence were extracted from a large Norwegian occupational cohort of office workers (N=6779, 53.5% women). Questionnaire data included the respondents’ office designs, comparing cellular, shared, and open-plan offices, demographic characteristics, workability, and personality factors. Objective data on disability retirement and medically certified sickness absence were extracted from the sickness and disability benefit register of the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> In the final fully adjusted model, employees working in shared [hazard rato (HR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–2.16] and open-plan (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.31–2.90) offices had significantly higher risk of subsequent disability retirement compared to employees in cellular offices. Gender, work ability, medically certified sickness absence, and conscientiousness had independent direct effects on risk of disability retirement.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> This study shows that open and shared workspace designs have detrimental effects by increasing risk of disability retirement among office workers, even when taking other known predictive factors into account.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">

<p>While Flask has become the de-facto choice for API development in Machine Learning projects, there is a new framework called FastAPI that has been getting a lot of community traction.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/flask-to-fastapi.png" alt="Flask and FastAPI Logo"></p>
<p>I recently decided to give FastAPI a spin by porting a production project written in Flask. FastAPI was very easy to pick up coming from Flask and I was able to get things up and running in just a few hours.</p>
<p>The added benefit of automatic data validation, documentation generation and baked-in best-practices such as pydantic schemas and python typing makes this a strong choice for future projects.</p>
<p>In this post, I will introduce FastAPI by contrasting the implementation of various common use-cases in both Flask and FastAPI.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Version Info:</strong></p><p>
At the time of this writing, the Flask version is 1.1.2 and the FastAPI version is 0.58.1
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Both Flask and FastAPI are available on PyPI. For conda, you need to use the <code>conda-forge</code> channel to install FastAPI while it’s available in the default channel for Flask.</p>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install </span>flask
conda <span>install </span>flask
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install </span>fastapi uvicorn
conda <span>install </span>fastapi uvicorn <span>-c</span> conda-forge
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="running-hello-world">Running “Hello World”</h2>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Flask</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>Flask</span><span>(</span><span>__name__</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>home</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'hello'</span><span>:</span> <span>'world'</span><span>}</span>

    <span>app</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now you can run the development server using the below command. It runs on port 5000 by default.</p>

<p><strong>FastAPI</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py
</span><span>import</span> <span>uvicorn</span>

    <span>uvicorn</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>app</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>FastAPI defers serving to a production-ready server called <code>uvicorn</code>. We can run it in development mode with a default port of 8000.</p>

<h2 id="production-server">Production server</h2>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>

<p>For a production server, <code>gunicorn</code> is a common choice in Flask.</p>

<p>You can also start it in hot-reload mode by running</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can change the port as well.</p>

<h2 id="url-variables">URL Variables</h2>
<p>We want to get the user id from the URL e.g. <code>/users/1</code> and then return the user id to the user.</p>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/users/&lt;int:user_id&gt;'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>get_user_details</span><span>(</span><span>user_id</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'user_id'</span><span>:</span> <span>user_id</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong></p>
<p>In FastAPI, we make use of type hints in Python to specify all the data types. For example, here we specify that <code>user_id</code> should be an integer. The variable in the URL path is also specified similar to f-strings.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/users/{user_id}'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>get_user_details</span><span>(</span><span>user_id</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'user_id'</span><span>:</span> <span>user_id</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="query-strings">Query Strings</h2>
<p>We want to allow the user to specify a search term by using a query string <code>?q=abc</code> in the URL.</p>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="json-post-request">JSON POST Request</h2>
<p>Let’s take a toy example where we want to send a JSON POST request with a <code>text</code> key and get back a lowercased version.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#</span><span> </span><span>Request</span><span>
</span><span>{</span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"HELLO"</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>#</span><span> </span><span>Response</span><span>
</span><span>{</span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello"</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>request</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/lowercase'</span><span>,</span> <span>methods</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'POST'</span><span>])</span>
<span>def</span> <span>lower_case</span><span>():</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'text'</span><span>:</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>()}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong><br>
If you simply replicate the functionality from Flask, you can do it as follows in FastAPI.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Dict</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'/lowercase'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>lower_case</span><span>(</span><span>json_data</span><span>:</span> <span>Dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>json_data</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'text'</span><span>:</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>()}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But, this is where FastAPI introduces a new concept of creating Pydantic schema that maps to the JSON data being received. We can refactor the above example using pydantic as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>pydantic</span> <span>import</span> <span>BaseModel</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Sentence</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'/lowercase'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>lower_case</span><span>(</span><span>sentence</span><span>:</span> <span>Sentence</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'text'</span><span>:</span> <span>sentence</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>()}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As seen, instead of getting a dictionary, the JSON data is converted into an object of the schema <code>Sentence</code>. As such, we can access the data using data attributes such as <code>sentence.text</code>. This also provides automatic validation of data types. If the user tries to send any data other than a string, they will be given an auto-generated validation error.</p>
<p><strong>Example Invalid Request</strong></p>

<p><strong>Automatic Response</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"detail"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
        </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"loc"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
                </span><span>"body"</span><span>,</span><span>
                </span><span>"text"</span><span>
            </span><span>],</span><span>
            </span><span>"msg"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"none is not an allowed value"</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"type_error.none.not_allowed"</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="modular-views">Modular Views</h2>
<p>We want to decompose the views from a single app.py into separate files.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>-</span><span> </span><span>app.py</span><span>
</span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>views</span><span>
  </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>user.py</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong><br>
In Flask, we use a concept called blueprints to manage this. We would first create a blueprint for the user view as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># views/user.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Blueprint</span>
<span>user_blueprint</span> <span>=</span> <span>Blueprint</span><span>(</span><span>'user'</span><span>,</span> <span>__name__</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>user_blueprint</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/users'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>list_users</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'users'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>'b'</span><span>,</span> <span>'c'</span><span>]}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, this view is registered in the main <code>app.py</code> file.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Flask</span>
<span>from</span> <span>views.user</span> <span>import</span> <span>user_blueprint</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>Flask</span><span>(</span><span>__name__</span><span>)</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>register_blueprint</span><span>(</span><span>user_blueprint</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong><br>
In FastAPI, the equivalent of a blueprint is called a router. First, we create a user router as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># routers/user.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>APIRouter</span>
<span>router</span> <span>=</span> <span>APIRouter</span><span>()</span>

<span>@</span><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/users'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>list_users</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'users'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>'b'</span><span>,</span> <span>'c'</span><span>]}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, we attach this router to the main app object as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>
<span>from</span> <span>routers</span> <span>import</span> <span>user</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>include_router</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>router</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="data-validation">Data Validation</h2>
<p><strong>Flask</strong><br>
Flask doesn’t provide any input data validation feature out-of-the-box. It’s common practice to either write custom validation logic or use libraries such as <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">marshmalllow</a> or <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a>.</p>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong></p>
<p>FastAPI wraps pydantic into its framework and allow data validation by simply using a combination of pydantic schema and python type hints.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>
<span>from</span> <span>pydantic</span> <span>import</span> <span>BaseModel</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>

<span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'/users'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>User</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
            <span>'age'</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>age</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This code will perform automatic validation to ensure <code>name</code> is a string and <code>age</code> is an integer. If any other data type is sent, it auto-generates validation error with a relevant message.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of pydantic schema for common use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-key-value-pairs">Example 1: Key-value pairs</h3>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

<p>You can learn more about Python Type hints from <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-documentation">Automatic Documentation</h2>
<p><strong>Flask</strong><br>
Flask doesn’t provide any built-in feature for documentation generation. There are extensions such as <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flask-swagger/">flask-swagger</a> or <a href="https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/swagger.html">flask-restful</a> to fill that gap but the workflow is comparatively complex.</p>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong><br>
FastAPI automatically generates an interactive swagger documentation endpoint at <code>/docs</code> and a reference documentation at <code>/redoc</code>.</p>
<p>For example, say we had a simple view given below that echoes what the user searched for.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/search'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'query'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="swagger-documentation">Swagger Documentation</h3>
<p>If you run the server and goto the endpoint <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</code>, you will get an auto-generated swagger documentation.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/fastapi-swagger.png" alt="OpenAPI Swagger UI in FastAPI"></p>
<p>You can interactively try out the API from the browser itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/fastapi-swagger-interactive.png" alt="Interactive API Usage in FastAPI"></p>
<h3 id="redoc-documentation">ReDoc Documentation</h3>
<p>In addition to swagger, if you goto the endpoint <code>http://127.0.0.01:8000/redoc</code>, you will get an auto-generated reference documentation. There is information on parameters, request format, response format and status codes.<br>
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/fastapi-redoc.png" alt="ReDoc functionality in FastAPI"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thus, FastAPI is an excellent alternative to Flask for building robust APIs with best-practices baked in. You can refer to the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">documentation</a> to learn more.</p>

                    <p>Why do startups move fast and enterprises move slowly?</p><p>I recently had a call with an ex-employee of a well known and a well-funded startup that has been around for a few years, let's say it was a household name.</p><p>She told me that getting anything done was slow, painful and costing the company growth and even worse, stopping the company quickly capitalising on new opportunities.</p><p>She then preceded to say that speed was one of our biggest strategic advantages as an early-stage startup.</p><p>I don't disagree.</p><p>Over the last 12 months, our startup VEED has moved extremely fast and grown even faster. It has been a lot of fun. Now that our team is getting close to 20 (Yikes :S) I can feel things slowing down a little.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-29-at-11.42.34.png"><figcaption>Growth At VEED - Indie Hackers</figcaption></figure><p>I am somewhat cool with that...</p><p>However, I want to try and uncover the exact formula that has allowed startups like ours to move fast so we can continue to do so in the future the bigger we grow. The main questions I would like to answer in this post are:</p><ul><li>What are the advantages of moving fast?</li><li>Can you build an infrastructure to allow your company to move fast?</li><li>How to build and hire a fast team?</li><li>And finally, how to continue moving fast as your company gets bigger?</li></ul><p>As this article is all about moving fast, let's get onto the first topic?</p><h3 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-moving-fast">What are the advantages of moving fast?</h3><p>By moving fast you can amplify the speed of learning in your company. The speed of learning is important because this gives the ability to make better-informed decisions on real data. This allows you to validate your ideas and hypothesis quicker.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/SpeedOfLEarning-.png"><figcaption>Publish fast, learn fast</figcaption></figure><p>If you can Build -&gt; Measure -&gt; Learn a product feature in just 1 week instead of 4, you will be 4 times closer to satisfying your customers needs in the same period of time. Simple, of course, but this means your are quicker to market and by building a better product quicker you help the company to start making money on these features faster.</p><p>For example, If we added billing to VEED 4 month earlier, our revenue would be double what it is now, that's a big deal and a lot of money. </p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/Add-Text-Copy-145.png"><figcaption>Cost of delay @ VEED.IO</figcaption></figure><p>However, by doing so you are obviously going to have to compromise. You absolutely have to "cut the fat" to see results quicker. This might mean reducing the desired feature set for launch, not having pixel-perfect implementation or handing over ownership to your team.</p><p>All the three points above perfectly sum up the first few months of our startup journey as we hacked together VEED. These were our humble scrappy beginnings ❤️</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/IMG_6063-1.jpg"><figcaption>First Office</figcaption></figure><p>One of my tutors at art school (Rebecca Ross) said something to me that I will never forget. "Perfectionism is a form of procrastination" As many early-stage startup founders come from a product background, it's easy to convince yourself that building polished feature after feature is a good use of your time, however, you might just be heading in the completely wrong direction.</p><p>The final strategic advantage for a startup to move fast is that you are able to simply outpace your competition before they have time to react and capture market share.</p><p>For example, we could easily assume competitors of ours such as Adobe are working on competing product offerings, however, they are not able to to move as fast as us.</p><p>It is crazy! Think about it, a bootstrapped company can move faster than corporate such as Adobe with a $190Bn Market cap!</p><h3 id="why-can-startups-move-fast">Why can startups move fast?</h3><p>Startups are fast.</p><p>Big companies are slow.</p><p>But why?</p><p>One common idea is related to network latency. The idea is simple, in a small team, information passing, validation of ideas and decision making can be made quickly as all of these things don't need to go through layers of bureaucracy.</p><p>Let's look at an example.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/moving-fast-veed.png"><figcaption><strong>Why can startups move fast?</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Above we can see that by reducing the number of stakeholders, information can flow quicker and therefore decisions can be made much faster. Amazon believes that 2 pizzas should feed each team. By keeping teams small, cross-functional and agile you can avoid holdups and eat the pizza while it is still hot!</p><blockquote><em>For more on this topic, I recommend reading the The Everything Store - by Brad Stone where he goes into detail how Amazon builds cross-functional teams.</em></blockquote><p><br>In the early days of VEED the team was just Tim and myself, between us we covered design, product, dev and marketing. Our next two hires Mate &amp; Veljko were also not afraid to step out of their comfort zone and work with new challenges outside their designated roles.</p><h3 id="how-can-you-build-an-infrastructure-to-allows-you-to-move-fast">How can you build an infrastructure to allows you to move fast?</h3><p>Another reason startups can move fast is they don not yet have the same infrastructure to maintain vs their enterprise counterparts. As your company gets bigger, so does your codebase, your user needs, testing surface area and more.</p><p>So how do you build an infrastructure that allows you to move fast. The answer is simple, you don't! Here is a good example I recently came across.</p><p>Superhuman is a popular email client that has raised over $33M in funding. A few weeks ago I went to update my billing information on the app and saw they were using Stripe's default checkout. Superhuman has the resources to build a custom checkout, however, they opted to use the default option provided by stipe.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/EXfLrkMWoAA57EN.jpeg"><figcaption>Keep it simple</figcaption></figure><p>I have a lot of respect for this. Superhuman is clearly focusing on building more value into the core reason why the user originally bought the product. Not spending time making a nice checkout process.</p><p>As I reflect on this, we have spent way too much time building custom login systems, custom checkouts and marketing automations that could have been spent building a better video editor.</p><p>In light of this, we have now moved all of our marking sites to Webflow and all of our marketing automation to Zappier. The idea is to use 3rd party tools / low code / no code wherever you can, so we can focus on building a great video editor. Everything else outside of video editing and our core value proposition is not where we should be spending our time, it is not what we are good at. By doing this you are reducing technical debt, engineering time and allowing your entire team to move faster.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/IMG_20200629_115539.jpg"><figcaption>Building Marketing Sites in Webflow</figcaption></figure><p>Let's look at building a login system from engineering point of view, as it is a good example. A customer login system requires connecting a mail provider, building password reset, protecting users data, adding the ability to update email and so much more. In addition, we had more than 10 customer service tickers every day with users who were unable to login. Most of the time they simply forgot the password or entered their email wrong. VS opting for passwordless login, we don't need to think about any of the above while also benefiting from incredibly low maintenance.</p><h3 id="how-to-build-a-fast-team">How to build a fast team?</h3><p>Just like when putting together Jamaica's first bobsled team, picking candidates that are already fast is a proven way to to make sure you have the DNA for speed. We like to look for side projects, self-initiated work, hunger to learn. We also look for candidates that show the ability to manage their own time well and also have the attitude to do their best work. &nbsp;However, we just don't have enough experience with hiring right now to effectively comment on this.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/cool-2.jpg"><figcaption>Moving Fast - Cool Runnings</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, the one thing we do have a lot of experience in is messing up! We believe that having a no-blame culture helps provide an environment that allows our team to experiment and make mistakes and if we are not making mistakes, we are not taking enough risks. If you had to attempt a backflip without a soft landing, there is little chance that you would attempt it, however knowing fully well that there is a soft landing, there is a good chance you will give it a go.</p><blockquote><em>The idea of a no-blame culture is partly stolen from Creativity, Inc - Amy Wallace and Edwin Catmull.</em></blockquote><h3 id="how-to-continue-moving-fast-as-your-company-gets-bigger">How to continue moving fast as your company gets bigger?</h3><p>Now we have explored all the main points that I wanted to cover, its time to put together a list of our key learnings for this post to help us to continue to move fast as we get bigger.</p><p><strong>Teams</strong></p><p>Keep teams small &amp; cross-functional. Keep information moving between the teams fast and avoid any outside stakeholders/gatekeepers. You should fully trust your team to do an amazing job, that's why you hired them.</p><p><strong>Individuals</strong></p><p>Give your team members the freedom to do their best work. Have a no-blame culture by never pointing the finger and celebrating failure.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p><p>Less code = the better! More off-the-shelf products means there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Don't block the team and empower everyone to push work/changes to production fast.</p><p><strong>The road ahead</strong></p><p>Provide top-line strategies, but provide enough flexibility to go off-piste... Rules are there to be broken! Remember validated learning with quicker feedback loops = faster team!</p><p>Final thoughts, there are going to be many things I have missed from this article, and in the spirit of moving fast, if this resonates with readers, we will be back to update it with more info. If you need an online video editing app or an amazing subtitle tool, this is something we can definitely help you out with.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_29_63e">

<div>
<p>Facebook’s rise popularised the ‘News Feed’ as a social, infinitely scrollable aggregation of content posted by your family, friends and liked pages. Made up of ‘news’ closer to the home, the feed was largely composed of personal milestones, announcements, photo albums etc. But in late 2019 Facebook introduced a beta feature called the ‘News Tab’ that’s now been rolled out in the US this month, an entirely separate feature to the News Feed that focuses on aggregating news from vetted sources based on user curation. Though not immediately obvious, this is in fact a step toward its more private and personal approach to the platform – here we’re talking about the aggregation and distribution of news and journalism moving closer to its readership, with user-curated and distributed news bringing mainstream media into the fold of the user’s smaller, more personal circles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given that the premise of Facebook remains largely social, the introduction of this feature doesn’t necessarily mean all users will jump at the opportunity to actively curate and share news. It’s even located oddly offscreen where users need to click on the three-line “hamburger” and then find the news box amid other menu options. The News Tab rather represents a point of distribution, where the users who do actively participate will take on the role of curators for their respective networks within the platform. If successful, the News Tab represents a shift in the power of news distribution – away from publications and toward power users who have the ability to propagate information through the social network.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why do users hold more distribution power within the Facebook ecosystem?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There are two factors that enable users to hold more distribution power within the Facebook ecosystem and they’re very much intertwined.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Private virality&nbsp;</li><li>Improved efficiency of sharing, discovery and signalling</li></ol>



<p>While private virality sounds like an oxymoron, it simply alludes to the nature of virality (the quick circulation of some media from one internet user to another) within the more private context of a circles-based social media platform like Facebook. To understand why the ‘private’ is an operative term lets explore the characteristics of user propagated information within social circles:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Greater levels of trust as the point of distribution gets closer to the inner circle → <strong>improved efficiency of sharing</strong></li><li>Greater alignment of interests as the point of distribution gets closer to the inner circle → <strong>improved efficiency of discovery&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Greater level of social signalling – social capital generated from social signalling to family and friends is stickier than capital generated in forums like Twitter and Reddit → <strong>improved efficiency of signalling</strong></li></ol>



<p>The virality of user propagated news on Facebook is stronger for the traits it carries as it passes through social channels, even the most tenuous social link is stronger than the links that currently exist between the public and media sources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nature of private virality creates improved efficiency of discovery, sharing and signalling –&nbsp; creating a feedback loop that makes it a stronger and stronger proposition each time. Imagine that you, as a reader, discover an article that resonates with you on the source’s primary website (e.g. a NY times or WSJ) and decide to share it with your social or professional circles – at present this requires the added step of ‘porting’. Either follow a share link or copy and paste the article onto another platform. While this step is trivial in nature it signifies a disconnect between the source and destination of information in social networks, a disconnect that the Facebook News Tab would transform into one fluid motion (News Tab to News Feed) making private virality even easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The efficiency in sharing, both in terms of ease and relevance, creates better discoverability and in turn, makes for stronger signalling. The incentive to remain a connector node or user who distributes information and the incentive to continue consuming user propagated news appear much clearer and stronger than in the absence of the feature. Publishers, who are still able to tap into other avenues of propagation can expect to relinquish the propagation power within social networks to such connectors or power users –&nbsp; who in this instance are simply more effective distributors.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why has Facebook empowered its users as its distributors of information?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Typically news aggregators or publications act as the point of distribution, resulting in externally curated news feeds. Facebook is banking on shifting the externally determined distribution of news from Facebook or publishers, towards user-centric curation and propagation. It’s important to note that this adds value to the core user base of Facebook (regardless of whether they interact with the News Tab or not), where most consumption will take place in the personal feeds that these connector nodes share news to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The combination of Facebook’s social capital and a news aggregator tab is not typically available to other mediums of news distribution. This places Facebook in a unique position to not only become an effective news aggregator but also compound on the user stickiness to the platform – essentially extending their core value proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why the News Tab is different to previous attempts</h3>



<p>Facebook’s previous iterations of news features like the Open Graph platform in 2011 and Instant Articles in 2015, failed to gain traction and were eventually phased out. This was primarily because Facebook introduced the news as an extraneous element to users’ primary use of Facebook which is to connect with friends and family. Open Graph, which auto shared articles users were reading at the time, came at a time when the platform was still consolidating its social focus. When Facebook changed its feed post design and deprioritised social reader apps in 2012, the platform was abandoned. Instant Articles – an in-application news content hosting feature – suffered a similar fate, it was abandoned in 2017 when Facebook’s restrictions around the content was affecting subscription conversions and ad revenue for the publishers using the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, Facebook decreased the presence of news in users’ personal feed from 5% to 4% to prioritize content from friends and family. This was Facebook deprioritizing news when it remained a peripheral element of the social network. The introduction of the News Tab, in a time when Facebook is more comfortably able to expand its proposition, speaks to Facebook’s newer strategy of prioritizing user-centricity across all of the platform’s experiences. The quote below, found on Facebook’s media page, is indicative of the platform’s shift to bring news into the fold of more personal experiences:</p>



<p>“Our goal with News Feed is to show you the stories that matter most to you, every time you visit Facebook. Your News Feed is a personalised, ever-changing collection of photos, videos, links and updates from the friends, family, <strong>businesses and news sources</strong> that you’ve connected to on Facebook.”</p>





<p>
<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Connectors and the tipping point for information dissemination in social networks</h3>



<p>In his magnum opus, The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell introduces the actors within a network who all have a role to play in the dissemination of information within a network. He references the ‘maven’ – a person who is innately knowledgeable or pursues knowledge and information, the ‘salesman’ – a person with the innate ability to convince others and ‘connector’ – a person with vast social reach and a predisposition for connecting others together.</p>



<p>“But in the case of Connectors, their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, and energy.”</p>



<p>Gladwell’s litany on Lois Weisberg, a socialite in 1950s Chicago, is demonstrative of the power of ‘connectors’ to marry information from disparate ends of a network into cohesive and emphatic outcomes.</p>



<p>“if you looked harder at Weisberg’s life you could probably subdivide her experiences into fifteen or twenty worlds… The point about Connectors is that by having a foot in so many different worlds, they have the effect of bringing them all together.</p>



<p>“I [Lois Weisberg] said, do you know anyone in Chicago interested in talking to Arthur Clarke. He said, yeah, Isaac Asimov is in town.”… This is in some ways the archetypal Lois Weisberg story. First, she reaches out to somebody, to someone outside her world. Then, equally important, that person responds to her.”</p>



<p>Extrapolating to modern social networks, the concept of the ‘connector’ is very much still at the heart of information dissemination – where the networking platforms themselves are now the connector – democratising access to information and reach for their millions of users.</p>

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada,&nbsp;more than 8,500 <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html#a1">deaths in Canada have been related to&nbsp;COVID-19</a>.&nbsp;Based on Canadian health data, the estimated number of annual deaths from influenza is much lower.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Based on data from past flu seasons, the Public Health Agency of Canada estimates that influenza causes an average of 3,500 deaths annually, a spokesperson told CBC in an email on Monday.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH |&nbsp;Need to address questions and doubts about vaccines, epidemiologist says</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Epidemiologist Dr. Christopher Labos says the vast majority of a population needs to be vaccinated in order to develop herd immunity.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:58</span></span></span></p>  <p>In an email to CBC on Monday, Kuntz cited data from&nbsp;<a href="https://ipac-canada.org/influenza-resources.php">Infection Prevention and Control Canada</a>, which states that when pneumonia is factored in as a complication of influenza, the combined death toll is "more than 8,000 people a year."&nbsp;</p>  <p>However, pneumonia is also one of the potentially fatal complications of COVID-19. In addition, the number of COVID-19 deaths counted in Canada are only those that have been laboratory-confirmed.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Part of the&nbsp;strategy used by anti-vaccination groups has been to&nbsp;take legitimate cautions by some well-recognized physicians in the U.S. that the quest to find a coronavirus vaccine must not be rushed and that it must go&nbsp;through all of the necessary steps to ensure it is safe and effective&nbsp;— and then misrepresent&nbsp;those comments as arguments against a vaccine, said Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator in the Office for Science and Society at McGill University in Montreal, which has a mandate to debunk misinformation for the public.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We have the beginnings of a perfect storm on our hands [to fuel vaccine misinformation]," Jarry said.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>LISTEN&nbsp;| How close are we to an effective&nbsp;vaccine for COVID-19?</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>As we continue to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, most of us are anxious to return to normal life, when we can hug our elderly parents or grandparents and once again gather in large groups.

Some infectious disease experts say it may not be fully safe to hug elderly loved ones until an effective vaccine or treatment is developed. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Maggie MacPherson/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>To combat that, both Crowcroft and Jarry agree, it's essential that public health officials, physicians and community leaders talk openly and transparently with Canadians about the vaccine development process&nbsp;and directly answer their questions and concerns&nbsp;— and they need to start now.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"There's a small sliver of the population that is ferociously anti-vaccination. And it's very difficult to reason with these people," Jarry said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"But there's a larger segment of the population that is vaccine-hesitant.&nbsp;And that is where our efforts need to be invested."</p>  <h2>'The current situation is so different'</h2>  <p>One of the key concerns that needs to be directly addressed is how&nbsp;a coronavirus&nbsp;vaccine can&nbsp;be developed more quickly than any vaccine before it and still be safe, Jarry&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The answer, Crowcroft said, is that "the current situation is so different that it is possible to get through the development steps faster without cutting any corners that might compromise safety."</p>  <p>It normally takes "years and years and years" to develop a vaccine, she said. "I mean 10 years would not be unusual."</p>  <p>A big part of the reason for that, Crowcroft&nbsp;said, is that scientists often come up with a vaccine candidate&nbsp;but have a difficult time getting funding to move it to the next phase of clinical trials, because every trial stage is expensive and pharmaceutical companies are hesitant to risk spending enormous amounts of money on a product that could fail at the next stage. Plus, there's often no guarantee there will be a market for the vaccine&nbsp;even if it does work.&nbsp;</p>    <p>But in the midst of a pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry is confident that the demand for a vaccine exists, she said. In addition, governments around the world are providing funding for vaccine development, which removes the potential for a huge financial loss if a company invests in a vaccine candidate that doesn't succeed in the end.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Governments are helping to speed things up by funding the trials so they can go on in parallel and/or the gaps between each step are shorter, without the long delays for decision-making about whether the company wants to take the [financial]&nbsp;risk of moving forward," said Crowcroft, who was recently appointed&nbsp;a senior technical adviser for&nbsp;the World Health Organization's measles, mumps and rubella program.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Because of that, there are more than 100 different vaccine candidates in various phases of research at the same time around the world,&nbsp;increasing the odds that at least one, possibly more, will prove to be safe and effective, she said.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH&nbsp;|&nbsp;States brace for impact of COVID-19 surge in U.S.:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Some parts of the U.S. are bracing for the impact on hospitals as cases of COVID-19 surge amid a lack of political will to respond.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:01</span></span></span></p>  <p>Because of advances in genetic sequencing,&nbsp;scientists' ability to learn about a new virus is also more advanced than it has ever been in the past, giving researchers a head start in figuring out what part of it to target with a vaccine.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Nothing in the history of humankind has ever been seen like this before," Crowcroft said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Finally, she&nbsp;said, amid all the hype as companies put out news releases boasting about their progress in vaccine development,&nbsp;&nbsp;it's "important to remember that the press release does not determine whether a vaccine will eventually be used."</p>  <p>It's up to each country's regulatory agency, such as Health Canada,&nbsp;to determine whether a vaccine can be used&nbsp;and be independent of any industry influence.</p>  <p>"Safety cannot be compromised," Crowcroft said.

    <p>You’ve likely experienced it: “You’re above and beyond everything we’re asking. There’s no promotion this round but all you need to do is <strong>__</strong>_”. Insert a semi-important but not absolutely necessary thing. Even worse if it’s something you’re really not good at.</p>

<p>One of the most demotivating things that an organization or manager can do is requiring “perfection” for a promotion. It’s a problem with two main dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s incommensurate with the value being added to the business.</li>
  <li>Perfection is subjective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incommensurate-with-value-add">Incommensurate with Value-Add</h2>

<p>Ultimately all performance comes down to one thing: how much value are you adding to the business? Examples of where forcing perfection gets things out of whack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I coded up a feature that brought in $10M to the business this year. I wasn’t promoted because they said I don’t speak enough in meetings.</li>
  <li>I saved the company from collapse because I was the only one who knew how to debug the system when it was melting. I wasn’t promoted because they said I show up too late every day.</li>
  <li>I identified a winning strategy for the entire business that drove us to another echelon of success. I wasn’t promoted because my design docs have typos.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that matters is the value being added to the business. There are nuances where behavior can set bad examples or cause issues for others, but that detracts from value added to the business and should be considered. The unfortunate and unbelievably common case is that some sort of benign missing strength is held against people.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-subjective">Perfection is Subjective</h2>

<p>When managers go down the rabbit whole of chasing perfect promotions they’re much more likely to be biased. In reality, most people’s internal picture of a perfect candidate for a promotion is something like “what did I look like when I got promoted?” That’s often the closest image a manager has of what a promotion at that level looks like.</p>

<p>In mild cases you get things like “when I got promoted I had to walk in the snow to work, uphill both ways.”</p>

<p>In more severe cases you get things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Men who don’t promote women because they’re not “aggressive enough” or they “don’t speak up enough”</li>
  <li>Extroverts who don’t promote introverts because they don’t like public speaking.</li>
  <li>Non-parents who don’t promote parents because they don’t work until midnight in the office.</li>
</ul>

<p>Promote people based on impact to the business, not their style of delivery.  Don’t hold people down because they deliver value in a way that isn’t comfortable, known, or practiced by you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In promotions and growth, focus more on amplifying strengths than fixing “weaknesses”.  You’ll find it’s much easier and much more fruitful to have people play to their strengths.</p>

<p>Promote imperfect people - that’s all you’ve got.</p>

			<p><span>Note: This post is adapted from my</span> <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1bJMtLWHFvP82" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">journal paper</a>, <span>which was accepted to Acta Astronautica in Spring 2020. You can read the full paper</span> <a href="https://gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-s2.0-S0094576520303106-main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<h3><span>Abstract – Neural Network Optimal Control in Astrodynamics</span></h3>
<p><span>While high-efficiency propulsion techniques are enabling new mission concepts in deep space exploration, their limited thrust capabilities necessitate long thrusting arcs and make spacecraft more susceptible to</span> <a href="https://gereshes.com/2019/09/02/missed-thrust-events-in-deep-space-trajectories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">missed thrust events</a>&nbsp; <span>(MTE). To correct for such mishaps, most spacecraft require updated trajectories that are relayed from Earth. While this solution is viable for spacecraft near Earth, in deep space, where one-way communication time is measured in hours, a delay in transmission may prolong the time of flight or result in a complete loss of mission. Such problems can be alleviated by increasing the spacecraft’s onboard autonomy in guidance. This paper demonstrates how a computationally lightweight neural network can map the spacecraft’s state to a near-optimal control action, autonomously guiding a spacecraft within different astrodynamic regimes and optimality criteria. The neural network is trained using supervised learning and datasets comprised of optimal state-action pairs, as determined through traditional direct and indirect methods. Additionally, the neural network-designed solutions retain optimality and time of flight corresponding to traditional trajectories. Finally, the same neural networks can autonomously correct for most missed thrust events encountered on long-duration low-thrust trajectories. The presented results provide a path for mitigating risks associated with the use of high-efficiency low-thrust propulsion techniques.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>A neural network can guide a spacecraft to its target &gt;97% of the time</span></li>
<li><span>The same network can autonomously repair MTEs in an interplanetary trajectory &gt;77% of the time. (There were no MTEs in the training dataset)</span></li>
<li><span>The neural network is smaller in size (about 1000) than neural networks already deployed in space missions</span></li>

<p>If not, I highly suggest seeking out a copy. Keep in mind, it's more than just a <em>book</em> -- <em>Juggling for the Complete Klutz</em> has these amazing attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's spiral-bound</li>
<li>It has hilarious drawings</li>
<li>It comes attached with three real-life bean bags!</li>
</ul>
<p>These are book super-powers, in my book (a Klutz-worthy pun?). In our day, my sister and I owned, devoured, and treasured these Klutz titles:</p>

<p>As a kid, there was nothing better than getting a new Klutz book (ok, maybe a Super Nintendo game). But unlike a replay of <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, these Klutz books require no nostaglia goggles. Here's why I think they're magic:</p>
<h3>Klutz books are spiral-bound</h3>
<p>Books for learning stuff should be able to open up and stay flat. The old 1980s computer manuals for computers like the Commodore VIC-20, the Commodore 64, and <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/my-new-old-apple-iie-computer">my new old Apple IIe</a> knew this much -- their manuals were spiral-bound and spell-binding.</p>
<p>So, why don't we see more spiral-bound books? Without knowing that much about printing costs, I imagine they're more expensive. Also, they do look slightly worse on a bookshelf, especially if you're going for that 'grammable color pattern look (so, just don't do this).</p>
<h3>Klutz books come with the required materials</h3>
<p>The little "paper" football that came with the <em>Table Top Football: A Guide to the Classic Lunchroom Sport</em> was a revered grail of mine. I remember that my dad took a sheetrock knife and made a small incision in its plastic case attached to the book so that the football could be slid in and out, with the explicit rule that the football must either be <em>in the case</em> or <em>being used in a game</em>. This is much like the inexorable <a href="https://hypercritical.co/">Jon Siracusan</a> rule for Airpods. Obey, or the Airpods will be instantly lost forever.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>Side note that there are some people who just love making small cuts into the plastic cases for things, so that you easily return them to their "pristine" condition. I, myself, don't understand these people. I like wripping these cases to shreds instantly.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to these Klutz books. By including juggling bean bags, yarn for friendship bracelets, or a real harmonica, Klutz Press books gave you everything you needed to get your hands dirty. "Active learning", or something like that. Playing = learning. Etcetera.</p>
<h3>Klutz books have hilarious art</h3>

<p>Just look at that paper airplane stuck in the teacher's hair!</p>
<p>Klutz had a particular art direction that spoke to me as a child. The goofy people in their guides made me feel like it was <em>okay to be a klutz</em>. </p>
<p>Which brings me to the most important reason that Klutz books are special.</p>
<h3>Klutz books embrace the Beginner's Mindset</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the experts mind there are few - Shunryū Suzuki</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone starts out as a klutz. No matter what. That means it's okay to make mistakes. It can even be funny - in fact, it should be funny! Because it's fun to learn new things.</p>
<p>Being a klutz, making mistakes, having fun, this is the path to wonderful things.</p>
<h2>Who's behind Klutz Press?</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klutz_Press">Wikipedia</a>, Klutz Press was founded in 1977 by three friends in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>The apocryphal story is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassidy_(author)">John Cassidy</a>, a recent Stanford grad working as a high school teacher, brought a bucket of tennis balls and some hand-written instructions for juggling to his remedial reading class. The laughs and learning and genuine reading and genuine juggling that ensued inspired Cassidy and his buddies from Stanford to publish <em>Juggling For the Complete Klutz</em> under their new company: Klutz Press.</p>
<p><em>Juggling For the Complete Klutz</em> has sold over 2.5 million copies. But Googling for Klutz Press is somewhat challenging these days. In 2000, Klutz was acquired by a company called Nelvana for $74 million, and in 2002 Klutz became a subsidiary of Scholastic, Inc. This latter merger is a good match in my book, as the Scholastic Book Fair also ranks heavily in my childhood memories of learning to love reading. The only other company I'd feel comfortable with owning Klutz Press is Pizza Hut - thanks to their delicious <a href="https://www.bookitprogram.com/">BOOK-IT!</a> reading program, which brought me dozens of delicious cheese Personal Pan Pizzas during the 1990s. My parents couldn't decide if they hated or loved Pizza Hut for this.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Klutz.com redirects to the Scholastic website, and it's unclear what's out-of-print or available from the voluminous Klutz catalog. So if you do find a genuine Klutz book and kit, I'd snag them quickly!</p>
<p>Luckily, I was able to find a good interview with Cassidy from 1995 on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616182712/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1154/is_n5_v83/ai_16857996/">Wayback Machine</a>. In 1995, Klutz was at the height of their power and influence in kid's minds. Here are some choice quotes from Cassidy:</p>
<p>On their company culture at Klutz Press:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In terms of being laid back, we take a back seat to nobody."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On their "teaching" style:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Talk to a kid about fun and math, and it's like you're talking about two different sides of the universe. If we can climb this mountain, there's nothing we can't tackle."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kids don't learn all that much by listening or reading. They need to get elbow-deep in a subject and touch it, feel it, and smell it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of Seymour Paypert's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465046746/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0465046746&amp;linkId=2949aefc36d4bd9d9f632170d2ac23de">Mindstorms book</a> about his work with LOGO and the Turtle machine (you can check out <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/mindstorms">my notes</a> on the book)</p>
<p>The article explains a bit about their business:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of Klutz' books sell for less than $20</li>
<li>They can have low prices because: (1) the books (with their accompanying "stuff") are viewed as more than books - but "toys/novelties", so more retailers than booksellers are interesting in carring them, and (2) they do large printing runs (150k copies vs the usual 10k for children's books)</li>
</ul>
<p>And, importantly, the final word from Cassidy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can hang a spoon off my nose," Cassidy boasts, "and I take a lot of pride in that".</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Create wonderful things, be good, have fun</h2>
<p>I just wanted to write that out again. I've decided to adopt their credo as my own life motto.</p>
<p>I learned so much from Klutz Press as a kid. I'm still learning now. Thank you, John Cassidy and team, for making these wonderful books. My juggling is finally starting to get pretty good, but I'll always be a klutz.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><article><header></header><a id="article"></a><p>The first blog post I wrote was lost, the oldest one I kept is from September 8, 2005. It’s been almost 15 years and I am very happy to see how much better I got in writing and in understanding the world.</p><p>Keeping a site like this is not just about writing and choosing photos. It takes curation and revising how things are organised to make sure nothing gets lost.</p><p>One of the things that I didn’t want to lose were the comments from all the amazing people that have stopped by and given some of their time to show appreciation or disagreement. The last one is always a good opportunity to learn and make sure your beliefs are still sound and logic.</p><p>So I dove into the database of comments, finding some of them lost and misplaced because the website’s posts changed links.</p><p>Some of the links were broken and had to be pieced together; others were wrong and their comments gone.</p><p>I believed I saved all of the comments and in the process drove down an avenue of memories and hindsight on fragile the web we built is.</p><h2 id="photos-and-images">Photos and Images</h2><p>Remember flickr ? It’s still alive and running but not everyone I knew back in 2007 still uses it. A lot of the photos you see in my old posts come from there, but the attribution link is broken because the user decided to delete their account. Some are still working, but the photographer moved on, or passed away.</p><p>Those links are still here for historical reasons, and because it is important to show that those photos have owners, talented people that were kind to share their work without asking for return.</p><p>And the problem doesn’t stop at the attributions of copyright that land in a “Page Not Found” message. Even the files seem to deteriorate.</p><p>As technology evolved, we got better cameras and better monitors. Photos that were pristine now look faded or pixelated. Storage was also a problem. Keeping a website means storing all the files and for a 25 year old with a small budget that meant saving every cent. So I made sure to keep a good balance in image quality and file size. It didn’t do an amazing job resisting the test of time.</p><h2 id="files-and-websites">Files and websites</h2><p>Websites have a life cycle, and some of the links I found no longer work. Google hates broken links as much as I do, but I also hate to be unjust to the reader. Links that point to other resources, that no longer exist, are still present in the articles I wrote. Again, for the reason of proof of existence.</p><p>I have known of this problem for a while now, and for that reason I got into the habit of saving every file that I use for reference. PDFs, videos, images, music, etc. They may not be used in the article, because there is a link to the original version or author, but if one day that link stops working, the value won’t be lost with it. (This is why this site amounts to over 9 GB)</p><p>Back in the day, like many, this site was powered by WordPress. It had it’s own comment system. Then disqus<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> appeared, and I tried it for a while. After I stopped using WordPress, I kept the same comment service running. This was when all the links changed to improve the Search Engine Rankings, and a lot of comments got lost in the database.</p><p>Remember Path? How about any of these?</p><ul><li>Delicious</li><li>FriendFeed</li><li>Google Wave</li><li>Jaiku</li><li>MySpace</li><li>Orkut</li><li>Posterous</li><li>Shelfari</li><li>Vine</li></ul><p>The list could go on, the point is that they have disappeared and some good content along with them.</p><p>And a social network doesn’t have to vanish for you to lose access to what’s there. The owner of a piece of content may lock their profile for any number of reasons and you or your readers won’t be able to see it ever again.</p><p>Legal action on copyright infringement can also take away access to something that was public. Just think about what happens when a YouTube video is found to be at fault with the guidelines.</p><h2 id="we-have-built-a-fragile-web">We have built a fragile web</h2><p>And we are making some of the same mistakes. Think about how many Social Networks use URL shorteners. What happens if Bit.ly decides to close and all those links stop working?</p><p>The websites that we are building use content management software like WordPress, Drupal and others. Will they withstand the test of time or will we have to migrate them to a new system at some point? Trick question, it won’t. Until then we can stay true to our mission and keep on publishing.</p><p>If you were hoping for a bright ending, please don’t give up just now.</p><h2 id="fragile-and-amazing">Fragile and Amazing</h2><p>Through these ordeals and all the experiments we have been running in the way we can communicate among ourselves, we saw a lot of good come out of it. Creators that could have gone unnoticed for ages found a spotlight.</p><p>Social Networks have found business models that are more or less stable without infringing on our privacy. Take <a href="https://patreon.com/">Patreon</a> and <a href="https://etsy.com/">Etsy</a> as an example.</p><p>We have built an economy and services that were important when dealing with the covid-19 lock down.</p><p>And if we fight fake news, we are able to see a variety of important perspectives about what is going on in the world. We can connect with a Human who lives across the ocean and who happens to play guitar.</p><p>The web we built is a living thing and is faced with challenges today. It grew too fast, got infected by fake news and scams.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/demo.gif"></p><p><em>See bigger version of the above demo as .gif <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwplotka/bingo/master/examples/bingo-demo.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></em></p><p>In this blog post, I would like to introduce <a href="https://github.com/bwplotka/bingo" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>bingo</code></a>, a simple and efficient CLI (Command Line Interface) Tool ,
I wrote for managing versions of Go binaries that are required for your project development.</p><p><strong>TL;DR: <code>bingo</code> is built on top of the native <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Go Modules dependency management</a> and in my opinion,
it solves the hard problem of flexible versioning developer tools written in Go. It already improves our integration with tools in the
production-grade projects like <a href="https://thanos.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Thanos</a>. Check it out and contribute!🤗</strong></p><figure><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/automation.gif" alt="This is NOT what you want to do in your project..."><figcaption>This is NOT what you want to do in your project...</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Automation is <strong>amazing</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Especially nowadays, all projects, whether open or closed source, use at least bunch of tools to automate some tasks. For example in Go community
you can see following popular tools:</p><ul><li>Running tests: <code>go test</code>, <code>go test -race</code></li><li>Benchmarks: <code>go bench</code>, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/benchcmp?tab=doc" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>benchcmp</code></a>, <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>benchstat</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/funcbench" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>funcbench</code></a></li><li>Auto formatters: <code>go fmt</code>, <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>goimports</code></a></li><li>Static analysis: <code>go vet</code>, <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>lint</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>golangci-lint</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/fatih/faillint" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>faillint</code></a></li><li>Documentation Generators: <a href="https://github.com/campoy/embedmd" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>embedmd</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/tree/master/scripts/cfggen" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">docs auto generators</a></li><li>Build tools: <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>goreleaser</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/promu" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>promu</code></a></li><li>Other projects (!) you want to run integrations tests against.</li><li>…and millions of other tools: <a href="https://gohugo.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">website builder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/raviqqe/liche" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">link check</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/tree/master/scripts/copyright" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">copyright checker</a>, protobuf + gRPC generation, jsonnet generators and bundlers, <a href="https://github.com/brancz/gojsontoyaml" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">YAML tools</a>, etc…</li></ul><p>I could list even more, and to be honest, I am so amazed with the amount of things we have <strong>for free</strong>! They help to maintain a very good quality of the
project, and saves an enormous amount of time.</p><p>So what projects do? They obviously tend to use gazillion of those tools, reusing amazing ideas and solid code that someone else in open source wrote
and maintains every day with love.</p><p>That’s great, but how many times you have cloned the project, want to contribute run <code>make</code> and see things like:</p><pre><code>$ make 
zsh: command not found: clang
zsh: command not found: goimports
zsh: command not found: goreleaser
zsh: command not found: hugo
</code></pre><p>And that’s even a nice error! Usually, you get a confusing error that does not make any sense like:</p><pre><code>$ make 
dafg;lkghd;lsfjgpdsjgp 
zsh: exit 1
</code></pre><p>…because you have the required tool installed but <strong>WRONG version</strong> of it!</p><p>Now, if you want to be a nice project to work with, you give a hand and either print meaningful errors and tells how
to install a dependant tool and what version of it, in case of users not having a tool or have the wrong version installed. This is
a step in a good direction, but in my opinion <strong>we can do much better.</strong></p><p>In all projects I maintain, we tried hard to be even more explicit and helpful by ensuring our scripts will install all dependencies
needed manually. We also largely leverage a good, old school <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Makefile</code></a> for tasks like this.
It is as easy as:</p><pre><code>DEPENDENCY_TOOL = $(GOBIN)/tool 

task: $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)
	@do task using $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)

# Will be built only if $(GOBIN)/tool file is missing.
$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL):
	@install tool
</code></pre><h2 id="always-pin-the-version">Always Pin the Version</h2><p>The above example works great, but obviously will not always work if you require a <strong>certain</strong> version of the tool.
If you would remember only one thing from this blog post, remember this:</p><blockquote><p>You really want to pin version of ALL the tools your project depends on!</p></blockquote><p>Why? Well, the quick answer is that versioning is hard and things are constantly moving. Tools are being improved and changed every day.</p><p>Trust me, the last things you want to do is to investigate why CI constantly fails or have the spam of bugs and issues, about someone, somewhere
being unable to build your project because of an obsolete, or a too new tool that was required.</p><p>We can easily extend our above <code>Makefile</code> example to improve resiliency and development experience by pinning tools’ versions
and maintaining immutable binary files.</p><p>Immutable binary names safeguard us from accidental usage of the wrong version that might have been installed outside. There is nothing worse than chasing a non-existing issue, only to realize you use the wrong version.</p><p>Without immutability, we would have to checksum and verify all build to ensure the correct version which is doable, just a bit more complex to maintain. (BTW, how nice it would
be to have CLI <code>man</code> equivalent for printing <code>version</code>! (: ).</p><p>We can achieve immutable binary names, as follows:</p><pre><code>DEPENDENCY_TOOL_VERSION = v1.124.3
DEPENDENCY_TOOL        = $(GOBIN)/tool-$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL_VERSION)

task: $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)
   @do task using $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL) 

# Will be built only if $(GOBIN)/tool-v1.124.3 file is missing.
$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL):
   @install tool@$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL_VERSION)
   @cp tool $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)
</code></pre><p>Version pinning was easy, right? Now, fun stuff, how can we reliably install those tools in the required version? Let’s look at possible solutions:</p><h3 id="commit-built-dependant-binaries-straight-to-your-vcs-e-g-git">Commit built, dependant binaries straight to your VCS (e.g git) 😱</h3><p>This is usually <strong>a bad idea</strong>. While it might work for you, other users would probably want to run your software on different
machines with different architectures and different operating systems, etc. And even if you would host all permutations of
each required binary, each can “weight” from 10-100MB which is most likely too much for common VCSs (e.g <code>git</code>). This
will make it extremely slow, if not impossible to clone your project. Plus there is no merge conflict resolution that
works well for binary files.</p><p>Hope I made this clear: Please don’t do this. (:</p><h3 id="use-package-manager">Use Package Manager</h3><p>Now, this is what’s usually recommended, and it looks innocent.</p><figure><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/pkg.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/pkg.jpg" alt="Use Package Manager they said..."><figcaption>Use Package Manager they said...</figcaption></figure><p>The idea would be to use the package manager available on the user’s OS e.g. <code>apt</code> <code>yum</code>, etc.</p><p>I will stop here because in practice this is impossible. Let’s look at the following reasons:</p><ul><li>While there are standard package managers for major operating systems, some people might not use it (you can disable it).
On top of there are 99% chances that the amazing tool you need is not packaged there or the version available is extremely old.</li><li>There are other custom pkg managers like <code>snap</code>, <code>brew</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>pacman</code> <code>NuGet</code> <code>pip</code> but not everybody has them
preinstalled, so it’s <code>chicken &amp; egg</code> problem.</li><li>Most of the tools work only with tools written in a certain programming language that is NOT Go (:</li></ul><h3 id="curl-released-binaries">Curl Released Binaries</h3><p>You can probably get quite far with just automatic <code>curl</code> of pre-built binary against the certain operating system, released on
GitHub by authors. Unfortunately, again, in practice, not many projects maintain that. Especially, for a small tool, it’s an overkill.</p><h3 id="pre-build-container-images">Pre-Build Container Images</h3><p>That is quite a fancy solution and has many benefits (portability, isolation, etc). This is great but comes with the tradeoff of
long and non-trivial bake times, overhead, and latency when running a job inside a container.</p><p>On top of that, you have to most likely share files between guests and hosts, which is always clunky and problematic (permissions, paths, file ownership, etc).</p><h3 id="solution-pin-certain-version-of-source-code-instead">Solution: Pin Certain version of Source Code Instead!</h3><p>Have you spotted a certain pattern among all the tools I mentioned in <a href="#automate-all-the-things">Automate all the things!</a> section?</p><p><strong>Yes! They all are written in <a href="https://golang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Go</a>.</strong> The Go community believes in automation, so the amount of tools that was produced is <strong>impressing</strong>. And those are NOT only useful for Go projects but actually any project of it. Tools written in Go tend to be extremely reliable and very easy to maintain and fix. You should try writing your own tooling in Go as well, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxc8B2fjDvY" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">this amazing video</a> from our friend <a href="https://twitter.com/fatih" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Fatih</a> ❤️ on how to write language tool (e.g linter).</p><p>So, if we assume all our tools will be written in Go, does this simplify our life? The answer is: Yes!</p><h4 id="rant-about-go-modules">Rant About Go Modules</h4><figure><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/gomod.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/gomod.jpg" alt="Calling Go Modules for help!"><figcaption>Calling Go Modules for help!</figcaption></figure><p>A few years ago Go Team released its sophisticated answer for dependency problem in Go Community: <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Go Modules</a>.
It (usually) works and it’s quite amazing for many reasons:</p><ul><li>It is decentralized. Anyone can publish their code, anywhere.</li><li>Finally, Go projects do not need to be inside <code>$GOPATH</code></li><li>Supports using multiple different (major) versions of the same module in the same build.</li><li>It is ~secure. HTTPS and SSH are the default and <code>go.sum</code> exists to verify checksums.</li><li>Supports caching proxies/mirroring.</li><li>Semantic Import Versioning</li><li>It is an official tool, which means finally a single standard. They are also built-in other Go tools.</li></ul><p>But let me say this loud and clear: <strong>It’s also far from being perfect.</strong> Consider the following reasons:</p><ul><li>It assumes everyone uses <strong>semantic versioning</strong> properly.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Halo Go Team, can I have your attention for a second? 🤗</p></blockquote><p><strong>99.9% of Go projects do NOT use semantic versioning properly and NEVER will be!</strong></p><p>It’s because maintainers either have no time, don’t care or they simply semantically version their APIs or part of packages only. See <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/prometheus-developers/Go$20Modules%7Csort:date/prometheus-developers/F1Vp0rLk3TQ/TyF2WxlkBgAJ" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">detailed
discussion on this matter in Prometheus (30k stars’ project) mailing list.</a></p><p>This leads to most of the problems users experience. You can’t escape from a huge amount of <code>replace</code> hacks.
Plus, instead of making it easier for such use cases, Go blames others. ):</p><p>This is also why <code>bingo</code> was needed and why I built it.</p><ul><li><p>We build and import packages, but version modules. If you add an overhead of maintaining modules and releasing it (see the above issue),
it’s clear that maintaining multiple modules is not a good answer. That’s why <a href="https://www.bwplotka.dev/2020/bingo/Helcaraxan" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Duco’s</a> amazing <a href="https://github.com/modularise/modularise" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>modularise</code></a>
the project was born. It would be better if we have good out of box solution instead.</p></li><li><p>Managing Major versions are painful. Rewriting path for everything to include this <code>v2</code> is very nasty and tedious, but the only
way of doing a major release and still support multi-version of the same dependency. I hope it will get redesigned someday.</p></li><li><p>Vendoring is allowed and sometimes even (😱) recommended. This is opinionated and controversial, but <strong>why would you use <code>git</code> if you want
version things in subdirectories, are we in 2005 again?</strong> If for cache purposes, then let’s use cache instead. (: Probably a
good topic for the next blog post. I would love to see better and easier ways to use proxies instead. For now, you can read some details <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/prometheus-developers/WLQQd_uNRlw/zKyTD9C4BQAJ" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></p></li></ul><blockquote><p>I was complaining a bit, but keep in mind that building solution that meets all the requirements

<p>If you go to the Wikipedia page for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_and_Clyde_Canal">Forth and Clyde Canal</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Siberian_Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_line_(London_Underground)">the London Circle Line</a> you may notice that they all have route maps with a similar visual style.</p>

  <figcaption>A route map of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Subway">Glasgow subway</a> from Wikipedia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How do the many Wikipedia contributors create all these similar-looking maps? The answer is <strong>BSicons</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="bsicons">BSicons</h2>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/BSicon">BSicons</a> are the building blocks for these route maps. They are an SVG icon set that Wikipedia contributors use to map railways, subways, footpaths, waterways, cycle paths and roads. Any transport system that they want to produce a simplified schematic for.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/glasgow_subway_bsicon_grid.png" alt="A diagram of the Glasgow subway. The diagram is made up of square icons in a grid which is highlighted">
  
  <figcaption>The Glasgow subway map is made up of many BSicons icons. Most are square, but there are a few half-width icons too that allow for a more compact map.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The icons were first used on the German Wikipedia which is why most of their names are based on German words.
‘BSicons’ comes from the German word Bahnstrecken (Railway Lines).</p>

<p>Each icon has a shorthand name that follows some conventions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>Root</strong> picks a given icon such as a station or a crossing.</li>
  <li><strong>Prefixes</strong> change it’s status, such as if it’s underground or disused.</li>
  <li><strong>Suffixes</strong> denote direction and positioning, such as if it curves to the left or is one way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the icons:</p>

<div>
  <header>
    <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/BSicon_STR.svg">
    <h3>STR</h3>

  <p>Two rail lines crossing with one going under the other</p><p>

  Root: <b>STR</b> → <b>STR</b>eke (line)<br>
  Suffix: <b>+l</b> → <b>+</b> (from), <b>l</b>inks (left)</p><p> Directions are relative to the line (which is drawn from top to bottom) rather than the page. This is why the suffix says the line is from the left rather than going to the right.</p>
</div>

<div>

</p></div>

<p>These are a few examples. The <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/BSicon/Catalogue">BSicon Catalogue</a> explains many more conventions.</p>

<h2 id="building-maps">Building maps</h2>

<p>To help put all these icons together into a map Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Routemap">Routemap template</a>. The template defines a syntax to provide shortcuts to build maps.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/glasgow_subway_bsicons_row.png" alt="A diagram of the Glasgow subway loop that shows one line of icons highlighted.">
  
  <figcaption>Routemaps are made up of rows of icons </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here is the code used to generate the single highlighted row:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{Subway|Hillhead}}! !\utkBHF+1\\\utkBHF+4\tSTRa~~{{Subway|St George's Cross}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The syntax is a bit cryptic and uses the shorthand icons names we saw above. Here is what each part does:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code>{{Subway|Hillhead}}</code></strong> is a link to the Wkipedia article about this station</li>
  <li><strong><code>! !</code></strong> separates the text on the left from the icons</li>
  <li><strong><code>\utkBHF+1</code></strong> is the first icon a light rail station in a tunnel that curves</li>
  <li><strong><code>\\</code></strong> adds in two empty icon-sized spaces</li>
  <li><strong><code>\utkBHF+4</code></strong> adds in the second icon, similar to the last but towards top-left corner</li>
  <li><strong><code>\tSTRa</code></strong> adds in the third icon, a start of a stretch of tunnel</li>
  <li><strong><code>~~~</code></strong> separates the icons from the text on the right</li>
  <li><strong><code>{{Subway|St George's Cross}}</code></strong>  a link to the Wikipedia article about this station.</li>

<p>Each icon is simple, so simple many of them are marked as ineligible for copyright on Wikipedia. Together the icons can combine to map more complex systems.
Seeing how these icons can be combined inspired me to make a <strong><a href="https://mapmaker.chriszetter.com/">random BSicon map generator</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying alternatives to Google services lately. No offense to Google. I just used their services uncritically for years. Now I want to evaluate them against their competitors. For example, <a href="https://www.bitlog.com/2020/03/06/duckduckgo-is-good-enough-for-regular-use/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">I now use DuckDuckGo instead of Google.</a></p>
<p>Basecamp released HEY recently. It is a privacy-focused email client that aims to give power back to the user. This sounded like something that I might appreciate. Every Gmail account I’ve owned uses a similar combination of features. Priority inbox, some specific settings that must be checked, a bunch of filters, etc. It’s always the result of iteration and resignation. It never feels quite right. It’s easy for me to believe that an email client could provide me a “wow” experience by encoding my workflow into the UI, and providing an “I’ve never known it before, but I’ve always wanted that!” moment.</p>
<p>I got a launch invite and decided to try it for a week.</p>
<p>Let’s cut to the chase: HEY is a good email client, but it’s not a good fit for my relationship with email. I’m not going to pay for it. But this post isn’t a hit piece. Negativity is cheap and lazy. I’m going to explain the value that HEY provides. I will also explain why it wasn’t a good fit for me.</p>

<p>I forwarded my personal Gmail into my <a href="https://hey.com/">hey.com</a> account for one week. I got ~120 emails from ~80 senders. I only sent a handful of emails. This matches my personal email load for a typical week.</p>
<p>I kept a running Google Doc with notes. I especially wanted to split my negative notes into a few piles: bugs, dislikes, and mismatches.</p>
<p>I want to focus on mismatches in this post. When did HEY make me feel uncertain or afraid? When was I fighting it?</p>
<p>I’m not going to mention bugs. Do you really want to hear about a problem with using keyboard shortcuts to scroll through email? They probably fixed it before I published this post.</p>
<p>I’m not going to tell you about nitpicky choices that I didn’t like. This post would become a monument to my own change aversion. “The information density is too low! I can only see 9 emails on my laptop!” Jake. Chill. You’ll get used to it.</p>
<p>Anyways, I used HEY on a variety of platforms. I used the iOS client on my iPhone X. On desktop, I accessed it through Firefox on my 15″ Macbook Pro and my Windows gaming machine.</p>

I wore my mask for both.</figcaption></figure>

<p>I like HEY’s privacy stance. HEY explicitly blocks pixel trackers and loads images through a proxy. It will also “name and shame” companies that send emails with trackers by putting a special binoculars icon over the email.</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/J4_gTcVhCBBrzFWcXv0bWMaRyeUOkgmeuhY5fWewv-wzvCf98oK3pt7eVzDpF2JZarDMRGDmTzaYV32i1hWmCcCJqyKgw4F_OLd4X8wwx7NW5Lk9HfFAU5A1W0upESqUtxVhi6hp" alt="An example showing a pixel tracker notification from Etsy"><figcaption><em>An example showing a pixel tracker notification</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some digital marketers don’t like this. Mailing list health is an important metric. If they can’t track open rates, then they can’t know how people are “progressing through the funnel” of reading their emails.</p>
<p>Fine by me. It’s hard to imagine receiving any benefit from telling a remote server, “psst, I opened your email.” I like that people can opt-out of ads with ad blockers. I also like that HEY focuses on opting-out of tracking pixels.</p>
<p>I didn’t care about the “name and shame” part of their pixel tracking. I’d be happy if they just had a counter saying “We stopped 531 tracking pixels this month.” I’m not interested in learning who sent an email with trackers. I just like that the filtering works.</p>

<p>HEY requires you to “screen in” every email recipient. When someone sends you an email for the first time, HEY shows a button asking you to “screen them in.” You will receive all future emails from them if you say “yes.” You will never get their email if you say “no.”</p>
<p>Do you receive a lot of unsolicited email? Promotional email you never read? Recruiter spam? Then you should seriously consider using HEY. Imagine saying “no thank you” to a spammy recruiter and never thinking about their emails again. Imagine the promotional emails never grabbing your attention. Imagine opening your email every day and only seeing the emails you want to see. That seems to be HEY’s vision, and I like it.</p>
<p>I interacted with the Screener a lot. I received email from ~80 different senders this week. I screened five of them out.</p>
<p>I don’t receive much unsolicited email. I aggressively unsubscribe from promotional mailers. I turn off email notifications that I don’t want. I sometimes delete services if I get too much email as a result of being a member. As a sidebar, deleting my LinkedIn account was a huge email quality-of-life improvement. The constant parade of recruiters dropped to manageable levels. You should consider it.</p>
<p>I spent lots of time considering some of the Screener decisions. I used to have a Netlify project that I have since deleted. I don’t need to receive email from them now. Maybe I should say “no” to a promotional email that they sent me. But what if I want to use Netlify in the future? I liked Netlify. I might use it again. Would my “no” still apply? I would be missing email that I need to receive. What if I lose my job in the recession and Netlify contacted me about a job opportunity? Would it be screened out? I had this kind of debate repeatedly throughout the week. Who is a sender? Is it a single email address? Is it a company? Is it an individual who could be represented by multiple email addresses? What about catch-all addresses like noreply? When can I safely reject email? I only felt safe using the Screener in a few narrow cases. In cases like Netlify, I screened them in and unsubscribed from the mailing list.</p>
<p>I’d like to make two caveats to this section. First: it seems that Gmail does not forward spam to HEY. I don’t know how good HEY’s spam filtering is and I don’t know how important the Screener would be in relation to it. Second: I only used HEY for a week. The Screener was a constant presence in the beginning. It appeared less as the week went on. I imagine that it wouldn’t appear much next week.</p>

<p>When you screen an email into HEY, you can choose one of three categorizations.</p>
<p>The primary location is the Imbox. This is the <strong>IM</strong>portant <strong>BOX</strong>. It’s an intentional spelling, and is designed as an inversion of an email inbox. The logic goes like this: Other people get to decide when stuff appears in your inbox. You need to intervene to stop it. On the other hand, something only appears in your IMbox when you declare it IMportant enough. This means that you have reclaimed power over the email that you receive.</p>
<p>This is also why HEY provides The Feed and Paper Trail. These represent common email types that you may not need to see right away. This is designed to further improve the Imbox experience by moving these emails out of sight until you want to see them.</p>
<p>The Feed is “The place for newsletters, marketing emails, or anything you want to casually browse.” I put a word-of-the-day email, some Google Alerts, and some newsletters into The Feed. Instead of acting like an email inbox, it is designed to be a content reader. You can periodically skim this content. But it’s not front-and-center in your Imbox.</p>
<p>Paper Trail is “The place for receipts, confirmations, and other transactional emails you receive.” I put automated notifications into here: online order confirmations, credit card purchase notifications, Twitch’s “this streamer is now online” notifications, etc.</p>
<p>After using the categorization for a week, it was clear that I struggled with both of them. I receive a daily newsletter with lengthy emails (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Money Stuff</a> by Matt Levine). It’s too big to read all at once during my workday. In practice, I sneak 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there. When it’s in The Feed, this means that it was not an email. Instead it’s a card that is slowly being pushed down by other things in The Feed. The later in the day I started reading it, the harder it becomes to complete it 5 minutes at a time. Maybe I’d move this specific newsletter out of The Feed. There’s not much left at this point. I’d have to keep polling to find when the two or three remaining things ended up in The Feed. Everything might as well be in the Imbox.</p>
<p>I also regretted putting many of my emails into Paper Trail. When I buy something, I want to see the purchase receipt Right Now. I also receive credit card alerts for every purchase I make. This helps me identify recurring purchases that I no longer need. When these are in my inbox, I can read and clear the notification immediately. When things are in Paper Trail, they don’t seem to have “Unread” markers. You need to scrutinize timestamps and dates to figure out what might be new. If my Amazon order ships, I want to say “Cool” and then delete the notification. I definitely want to see it.</p>
<p>I fought against this workflow all week. HEY does a good job of explaining its categorization system. But I struggled to live in it. I really just wanted everything to appear in the Imbox. This is the same reason that I stopped using the “Multiple Inbox” feature in Gmail: I’d rather stop unwanted emails at their source, instead of moving it into a separate low-frequency box.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is a good system that is a mismatch with my relationship with my emails. I don’t “casually browse” my newsletters, and I want to read all of my transaction receipts while my brain is still thinking about the purchase I just made.</p>

<p>There are other advanced features that I didn’t use, or used lightly.</p>
<p>Search worked well. I looked for a few things. I found what I was looking for.</p>
<p>HEY has a pair of features called “Reply Later” and “Reply Focus Mode.” This allows you to put off sending replies to emails. Later, you can enter a focused mode that allows you to reply to these specific emails without any UI distractions. I forwarded myself a few emails to put into here when I was experimenting with HEY, but I didn’t end up using the mode with any real seriousness. I don’t receive a ton of email in my personal account, so I don’t run into this problem much.</p>
<p>You can “Set aside” an email if you need to reference it. I can imagine needing this at work. If …</p></div></div>

    <h2 id="new-cloud-offering-silicon-sterilization">New Cloud Offering: Silicon Sterilization</h2>

<p>Head of Cloud Architecture at CSC, Jenny Miskatonis announced a breakthrough technique for reducing the effect of virtual bacterium, today.</p>

<p>“By regularly rotating through silicon, disks and CPUs, we can ensure that common infection types take no more than 5% of compute,” said Mrs. Miskatonis. “For too long have BioOps staff had to shift clouds and redeploy to remove polymorphic binaries from systems.  Now we offer complete sterilization as a service - guaranteed.”</p>

<p>Virtual Bacterium consume an estimated 23% of global compute per year, despite continued research in the new field of BioOps. In a new innovation, CSC promises to comprehensively overwrite all data on their specialized state-free hardware. “Bacteria can even overwrite Firmware - the part of the computer that controls operation of hardware,” Mrs Miskatonis said, “We ensure this is impossible with our specially developed hardware and Silicon Sterilization. When Bacteria take hold, we erase all data, rotating hardware back into production after sterilization. “</p>

<p>Professor of Technobiology, Dr Fields of MIT, did not see this as a possible solution to the problem of virtual life. “The ubiquity of hardware optimized for simulating neural nets made adaptive artificial life inevitable. We still have concerns that a conscious AI, similar to the imagined SkyNet, will arise as a result of our approach to computing,” he said.  “This is a step in the right direction, but cannot account for the near-line low-latency equipment that exists on industrial sites around the world.”</p>

<p>“In some cases, 90-95% of compute on an industrial site can be taken up by virtual bacterium, and based on my sampling of the domain, it is increasing in complexity. Think of these largely static blocks of compute as nutrient-rich and largely undisturbed bubbling volcanic vents at the bottom of the ocean - given enough time more complex forms will evolve, likely with capabilities more like those we imagined for typical rogue AIs. I forsee continual adaptive mutations leading to more sophisticated vulnerability discovery in cloud hardware. We need a complete rethink of our models of computing, and consider a global shutdown of all compute until these infections can be eradicated. “</p>

<p>Mrs. Mistakonis responded in her recent interview with ABC news, “A complete global compute shutdown is not only economic suicide, but is an unrealistic solution. We simply can’t account for all worldwide compute - organisms may exist in small solar-powered weather stations, or abandoned satellites, or any number of legacy internet-of-things devices, and it just doesn’t make sense to move to a new computing model when a single successful mutated strain will take us back to square one.”</p>

<p>When asked about the prospect of the continuing overhead of BioOps in business, Mistakonis said, “It is a fact of life. Adaptively configuring and actively managing the hardware environment is not going to go away for the forseeable future. We take some pain out of this process, but the process is likely to continue.”</p>

<h2 id="oceania-ad-server-purge-thousands-arrested">Oceania Ad Server Purge: Thousands Arrested</h2>

<p>The improbable election of the hard-right New Oceania party in last week’s elections has continued to surprise, with leftist activists in Oceania facing public shaming and mass arrest in recent days.</p>

<p>Activist-in-exile Toby Frank commented on the situation: “I don’t know a single organization that hasn’t been targeted. Its an absolute purge, and an indictment of the corporations that enabled it.”</p>

<p>Martin Zuckelborg, head of FriendPage, tried to calm international outcry at their involvement: “We are deeply disturbed at the actions of the government in Oceania, and we condemn the third-party data vendors that used our APIs to enable this. We could not have forseen that such a large-scale abuse of data on activist groups would occur.”</p>

<p>Toby Frank believes that stronger action must be taken to address the dangers of Ad tracking.</p>

<p>“Preferences, page likes and site visits of Socialist organizations and publications should have never been stored,” he said, “and this data should have been anonymized by FriendPage long before it was exposed to advertisers. If anything, the cross referencing of the Grinner gay dating app ad backend in 2039 should have been a sign that app data, device IDs and location data are enough to deanonymize individuals, and the exposure of those senators should have been a wake up call to the risk of 3rd party data leaks.”</p>

<p>Advertising industry self regulator AAB issued a statement on Monday addressing the Oceanic government’s seizure of advertising servers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“AAB condemns the actions of the Oceanic government in the strongest terms. The AAB will continue to work closely with the UN to identify the best approach to meet the new consumer focused privacy recommendations as well as drive further transparency in the ad tech supply chain.”</p>

  <p>“Consumers have increasingly come to expect that their online experience is customised and relevant to them. As an industry it’s essential therefore that we work together to find the right balance between delivering customised and relevant content and advertising experience to consumers which respects their privacy, while also allowing businesses to operate in a way that allows them to meet those consumers expectations.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="captcha-arms-race-the-next-weapons">Captcha Arms Race: The Next Weapons</h2>

<p>Gooble is slowly rolling out new technology to better monetize video content this week. A small fraction of users expressed concerns over the change.</p>

<p>“I was shocked at first, but now I’m used to it,” said Martha Vineyard of Los Angeles, “I gasped the first time I saw a deepfake rendition of my dead mother asking me what her middle name is, before enjoying a juicy Bacon Griddle Pop. That’s the price I pay for free content, I guess.”</p>

<p>Some in the Adblocking community see this as a logical step in the monetization arms race. In an interview, the anonymous creator of AdBlast, a popular method of masking involuntary autonomic responses to VR ad inserts, commented on the new technique.</p>

<p>“When VR ad inserts were popularized, many commentators thought there was no way we’d circumvent the advertising and measurement they enabled. Our neural nets and sub-second injections of AdBlast hallucinogens and stimulants defeat useful measurements of involunary preference responses in the vast majority of cases. We’ve already created a proof-of-concept that can edit out ad-vision of people’s dead pets and automatically respond, in their voice, with the captcha name response. We’ll extend this to cover the new model of server-side deepfaking of faces into ad preroll.”</p>

<p>This Web site documents some moderately obscure computer graphics software history: a suite of animation products produced in the late 1980’s for the Atari ST personal computer platform. Although the fact is not widely known, this Atari software, published by a defunct computer magazine called Antic, directly preceded and led to the Autodesk 3D Studio and Discreet 3ds max products used by thousands of people today.</p>
<p>The articles herein basically comprise an oral history: the information is drawn from interviews and hands-on exploration of the software, running under emulation or on original equipment.</p>
<p>The site is organized into a chronological history, followed by in-depth discussions of each major product.</p>


<p>Thanks to my editor, Monica Smith, for making this documentation more respectable.</p>
<p>Thanks to Gary Yost, Tom Hudson, Mark Kimball, Jim Kent, Andy Eddy, Maurice Molyneaux, Boris Tsikanovsky, Darrel Anderson, and Jack Powell for their enthusiastic participation in this project, which is really their project.</p>

Darren Campbell in a lengthy interview with CBC News.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We do know that the gunman was very paranoid. We also know some would describe him as a survivalist," he said.</p>  <p>"He'd voiced concerns about the pandemic, and that he wanted to be prepared in the event of things not working in the way they normally would."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Many questions still remain about the shooter's actions leading up to his deadly rampage. Earlier this month, Maclean's magazine obtained videos of Wortman withdrawing money from a Brink's depot in Dartmouth on March 30 and reported it was a $475,000 transaction. &nbsp;</p>  <p>A spokesperson for Brink's told CBC&nbsp;News it was unable to comment because of the ongoing RCMP investigation.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5583089.1590409131!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/inside-portapique-home-of-gabriel-wortman.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5583089.1590409131!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/inside-portapique-home-of-gabriel-wortman.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5583089.1590409131!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/inside-portapique-home-of-gabriel-wortman.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5583089.1590409131!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/inside-portapique-home-of-gabriel-wortman.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5583089.1590409131!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/inside-portapique-home-of-gabriel-wortman.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5583089.1590409131!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/inside-portapique-home-of-gabriel-wortman.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The remains of the gunman's cottage and the burnt shell of one of his decommissioned RCMP cruisers at his property on Portapique Beach Road on May 13.  <!-- --> <!-- -->(Steve Lawrence/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Campbell said RCMP discovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in a fire-proof container on one of the properties Wortman owned in Portapique.

He was able to amass what wealth he had based on opportunities he took. He was also a recipient of some inheritances. All of those things contributed to his wealth," Campbell said.</p>  <p>In a 2011 will, he left all his assets to his common-law partner. She has since renounced her role as executor of his estate.

There's nothing in that [scenario] that would even be familiar to me and I've been paid many times over my 39 years of dealing with the RCMP," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Derry said he would have refused to go into a Brink's to collect either&nbsp;payment or "flash money" used for a drug buy.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The security breaches, you'd be open&nbsp;to, there would just be too many. You're talking about walking into a privately owned company with many people who work&nbsp;there. The security clearance is going to be minimal in comparison to what you'd need for an undercover operation," he said.</p>  <p>There were always extensive protocols in place for any money transfer and they always involved multiple RCMP officers, one of whom would give the cash to him directly, Derry said.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>RCMP say no evidence of organized crime links</h2>  <p>Campbell maintains investigators have found no evidence that Wortman had illegal sources of income or that he acted in any capacity as an informant or agent for the RCMP.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Revealing whether someone has provided information to police as a confidential source is privileged information that cannot be divulged, said Campbell. However, the Mountie stressed that scenario didn't apply in this case and he called reporting to the contrary a "fairy tale."</p>  <p>"Recent media articles painting him as some underworld, organized crime figure, nothing has been uncovered whatsoever that would suggest that."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628768.1593190524!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/supt-darren-campbell.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628768.1593190524!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/supt-darren-campbell.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628768.1593190524!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/supt-darren-campbell.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628768.1593190524!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/supt-darren-campbell.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628768.1593190524!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/supt-darren-campbell.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628768.1593190524!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/supt-darren-campbell.jpg"></p></div><figcaption> <!-- -->(CBC News)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The RCMP say they've determined the gunman acted alone during the rampage, but they're still&nbsp;investigating whether&nbsp;he had any help leading up to the attacks.

Police say he printed the graphics&nbsp;without his employer's permission. The business owner has not responded to CBC's multiple requests for comment.</p>  <p>Campbell said police have spoken to Griffon and he has been cooperative. He said while there may have been copyright issues related to the RCMP logo, printing the decals isn't a criminal offence.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"He's obviously someone we have discussed at length and we're convinced he wasn't aware of any type of plan that the gunman had," he said.</p>  <h2>Stockpiling gasoline did not raise red flags</h2>  <p>While people have referenced Wortman making some "offside comments" prior to the mass shooting, Campbell said investigators have found the steps he took&nbsp;— including buying hundreds of dollars worth of gasoline — reflected he was stockpiling due to COVID-19 as opposed to any premeditation of the largest mass shooting in Canada's&nbsp;history.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5575062.1591995460!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/gabriel-wortman-s-home-6.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5575062.1591995460!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/gabriel-wortman-s-home-6.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5575062.1591995460!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/gabriel-wortman-s-home-6.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5575062.1591995460!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/gabriel-wortman-s-home-6.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5575062.1591995460!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/gabriel-wortman-s-home-6.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5575062.1591995460!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/gabriel-wortman-s-home-6.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>The burnt-out remains of Gabriel Wortman's home on Portapique Beach Road in Portapique, N.S., taken May 13, 2020.

<p>One of my little pet projects is a neurology book for psychologists, coaches and the like. What most people in these fields imagine about the brain is somewhere between perplexing, preposterous and potentially poisonous. (Seriously, I could tell you stories…) So I kind of wanted to write something like this for them.</p>
<p>Now I do consider it a tall order for me – I have some knowledge of neurology, but actually writing a SENSIBLE, understandable guidebook to neurology, with some practical applications too, that’s a challenge. (Senseless guidebooks to neurology are a dime a dozen, of course. In fact, I’ve walled in at least two people in one library, using only senseless pop-neurology books and as far I can tell, the rotting skeletons still haven’t been found. But then again the rotting corpse smell really doesn’t stand out much in most libraries I’ve been to, so I shouldn’t be surprised.)</p>
<p><a href="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg"><img src="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg 1920w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-1080x720.jpg 1080w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-610x407.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></p>
<p>But back to my main point. The great thing about trying to write a book like that, even attempting to prepare for doing it at one point in the future, when you know enough, is finding all the lovely little holes in how you’re telling the story to yourself. The teeny-tiny little jumps in understanding, the „lies-to-children”, the simplifications.</p>

<p>And one of these, for me, was how neurons get to connect.</p>

<p>And when I asked around, it turned out I wasn’t the only one missing this little bit.</p>

<p>I mean, yeah, we all know Hebb. „Neurons that fire together, wire together”, the neurology mantra in flesh. I can just imagine NeuroZen masters, walking around meditating neurologists, „fiiiiiiiiireeee toooooogeeeether” instead of „ommmm” going around.</p>

<p>That’s how neurons connect. When two fire at once, their connection becomes stronger. The synapse gains long term potentiation/LTP, by both an increase in the neurotransmitters produced, and an increase in the postsynaptic receptors for the neurotransmitters. Short-term it happens through utilizing some of the additional AMPA receptors available near to the synaptic membrane in the postsynaptic cell, long term by changes in protein synthesis and gene expression, in order to ensure a larger number of receptors. So far so good, in one way or another pretty much anyone who understands anything about neurology understands this bit. It might be more or less simplistic, you might have the AMPA receptors memorized or not, but you get the gist of it.&nbsp;(Although this begs the question: does Dale’s principle means that the increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter production influence not just this single synapse, but also the concentration of neurotransmitters in all synaptic connections of the presynaptic neuron? Or perhaps does a reverse mechanism happen, with other connections of the presynaptic neuron being stripped bare of their neurotransmitters? Something I need to check! )</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker: how do neurons that AREN’T already connected connect? How does their “fire/wire” rule go?</p>

<p>I mean, that still applies, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Actually, it doesn’t apply in the original Hebb’s law, since that required the neurons to be connected already and a couple of other things as well. But still, the general principle is how we tend to explain things like associative learning, conditioning, etc. The direct wording of Hebb’s law can’t apply there, because then we’d need every neural network to be connected to every other neural network at once, and that’d be a mess that wouldn’t really work all that well. But the general principle seems to apply.</p>

<p>And when I started asking around, no one could tell me how exactly.</p>

<p>How does a neuron know to extend new axonal or dendric connections towards another neuron, so that they might actually form a synapse between the two? Because this has to happen somehow, and this has to happen in a fairly structured way. If it didn’t happen, if we were only left to the remains of the synaptic pruning we got since birth, then our neural networks would become pretty much immovable after were what, twelve? I mean yeah, I’ve met these people, and so have you, but they’re in the small minority… well, large minority… well, OK, a small majority. But even so, there are quite a few people who aren’t that way. And if the neural growth was haphazard, then we’d get a far more random jumble of associations, then the fairly clean ones we tend to get in any conditioning/associative learning experiences.</p>

<p>So I knew there must be some kind of system for neurons to detect other neurons it should be „aiming for” in their development.</p>

<p>And – this was about two or three years ago as of writing this – no one I asked could tell me what it was. I’ve reached out to a lot of people I’ve considered very competent in the field, including some of my old Uni professors, and no one could direct me. Nor could I find the answer in any of the textbooks I’ve referred to.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the answer is fairly recent, as articles about it only started to appear in the 2000s. Since it took me some time to find it back then, I figured I’d make this article to share it now, making the whole thing easier to find for others.</p>

<p>We’ve known from about 1890 that the endings of both the axon and the dendrites are covered in something known as a growth cone. Like the tip of the branch, this is the part where the cell can further develop and extend, either in original growth, in regeneration, or as a reaction to some factors (including a decrease in overall electric activity which causes a form of synaptic scaling – hence explaining the „devouring” of unused neural pathways of amputated body parts by nearby active structures). But how do the growth cones know how exactly to grow? The brain is a complex three-dimensional web of interconnected neurons, so „hitting” the right point is definitely too hard if the neurons just kept on growing until they hit anything at all.</p>

<p>Now, the synaptic scaling process is still a piece of the answer – even if a neuron forms a new synaptic connection with a different neuron, if the target neuron already has too many connections, it will tend to remove the weakest ones, and this includes the most recent ones. The scaling goes both ways after all – it goes for more synapses when it starts with too few, but for less, if it starts with too many.</p>

<p>But synaptic scaling is not everything. As it turns out, the tips of the growth cone constantly produce structures called filopodia, and these react to specific chemical attractants and repellents. These chemicals are produced by both cells at the target area, and by so-called guidepost cells along the way. There are suggestions that the system for such targeting is fairly robust, especially in early development (and its limitations in later life might explain why spinal cord injuries and the like are so hard to fix).</p>

<p>(There is one other process for directing cells, the growth along the radial glia, but since it mainly refers to embryonic development, it’s really not all that interesting for us in this topic.)</p>

<p>Now, the more perceptive of you will already have noticed that while what I’ve given is AN answer, it is not THE answer to the question I’ve originally asked. Or at least, not necessarily.</p>

<p>It might be possible, that the interaction of the three systems:<br>– a pre-set network of attractor/repellent chemical pathways for guiding axon/dendrite growth,<br>– the synaptic scaling mechanism of homeostatic plasticity, which limits the max connections and promotes new connections if existing neural excitability falls below what is the baseline for the network,<br>– and the good old Hebbian mechanism for strengthening existing neural connections,<br>is in fact enough. That the interplay of these systems does answer our basic question, and simple enough rules result in sufficient flexibility to explain what is observed.</p>

<p>But, obviously, the process might be a bit more complicated. There isn’t that much literature about it, unfortunately, so what I’m doing here is more of an (un)educated guess, but since guidepost cells tend to be neurons which have yet to develop an axon – but already have dendrites and can receive signals, a slightly more complex – but better targeted – system can be imagined, where guidepost cells would be a part of a wider neural network, the stimulation of which „calls forth” further cells to build connections. This, in my understanding (Again, limited, so don’t take my word for it. I mean it.) would be a more effective explanation of how we can rapidly learn to connect fairly new information, even across huge (neurologically-scaled) swaths of neural space. A strongly agitated system produces a stronger „call for connections”, hence mediating the faster development of new and broader associations.</p>

<p>So there you have it, a quick summary of one part of neural connectivity I’ve yet to see described in a textbook about the brain, but which really should be given out there, along with the classic Hebbian principle. Hope it’s useful 🙂</p>

<p>Two years ago, on June 4th of 2018, Microsoft announced its acquisition of GitHub, unicorn darling of the developer tools startup ecosystem, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">for $7.5B in stock</a>. The announcement unearthed a wide range of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17221527" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opinions and pontifications</a>, ranging from “GitHub is doomed” to “Microsoft is smart”, with many predictions about GitHub’s future. Some thought Microsoft’s growing investments in its cloud offering, Azure, might help GitHub. Could an investment by Microsoft improve GitHub’s reliability or harden them against outages like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-ddos-memcached/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DDOSes</a>? Have any of these predictions come true?</p>



<p>We set out to analyze one angle of the GitHub acquisition: Has GitHub become more reliable since its acquisition by Microsoft? Our service, <a href="https://statusgator.com/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">StatusGator</a>, monitors more than 700 status pages of cloud providers and SaaS companies large and small. We aggregate and normalize status page data and make it available to our subscribers however they need: in notifications by email, Slack, Teams, or webhook, and in a <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/01/24/how-to-save-precious-minutes-during-incident-response/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">unified status dashboard</a> for all service dependencies.</p>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-1024x613.png" alt="" srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-1024x613.png 1024w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-300x180.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-768x460.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-1536x919.png 1536w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-720x431.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-580x347.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-320x192.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>For more than 5 years, we have analyzed the <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GitHub status page</a> constantly. Every 5 minutes, StatusGator takes a screenshot and <a href="https://statusgator.com/services/github" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">collects relevant data</a> about their service status. That means we are uniquely positioned to offer analysis of the downtime that GitHub themselves announce via their status page.</p>



<p>What does the data tell us? In the two years since the acquisition announcement, GitHub has reported a 41% increase in status page incidents. Furthermore, there has been a 97% increase in incident minutes, compared to the two years prior to the announcement. Does this actually point to a decrease in reliability? We can’t say. This could simply mean GitHub has increased its transparency, publishing to their status page more frequently.</p>



<h2>Incident Counts</h2>



<p>We calculated an incident count in the 24 months preceding the announcement and the 24 months after. We <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/26/under-the-hood-inside-a-status-page-aggregator/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">classify status pages</a> into four states: <em>up</em>, <em>warn</em>, and <em>down</em>, and <em>maintenance</em>. GitHub does not expose scheduled maintenance on their status page. For these calculations we consider an incident to be any change in status between <em>up</em> and <em>warn</em> or <em>down</em>.</p>



<p>Before the acquisition, there were 89 incidents published on the GitHub status page. After, there were 126 incidents. A 41% increase:</p>

<p>In the graph below, we’ve charted the incident counts by month. The left side shows the 24 months before and the right side shows the 24 months after:</p>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1024x533.png" alt="Graph showing GitHub incidents by month, before and after their acquisition by Microsoft." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1024x533.png 1024w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-300x156.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-768x400.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1536x799.png 1536w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-720x375.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-580x302.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-320x167.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<h2>Incident Minutes</h2>



<p>We calculated incident minutes by subtracting the start and end time of time of incidents. Although not 100% realtime, StatusGator checks frequently: every 5 minutes, so status page changes are detected quickly. We counted time where the page was not in an overall <em>up</em> state.</p>



<p>In the 24 months prior to the acquisition announcement, there were 6,110 minutes of downtime. During the 24 months after, there were 12,074 minutes of downtime, a 97% increase:</p>

<p>In the graph below, we’ve charted the incident minutes by month. The left side shows the 24 months before and the right side shows the 24 months after:</p>

<h2>Status Page Evolution</h2>



<p>During these four years, GitHub has made enormous improvements in their status page information granularity and design. In December 2018, they switched from a home grown status page to one operated by Atlassian’s StatusPage service, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/03/11/2019-statusgator-status-page-awards/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">the most popular status page provider</a>. In doing so, they added numerous <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/11/22/component-status-filtering-is-here/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">individual component statuses</a>. Here’s what GitHub’s status page looked like before their switch to Atlassian StatusPage:</p>



<h3>GitHub’s Old Status Page</h3>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old.png" alt="GitHub status page showing only a single status across all GitHub services." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old.png 645w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-300x187.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-580x361.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-320x199.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px"><figcaption>GitHub status page showing only a single status across all GitHub services.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When they switched to their new status page format, GitHub took a huge step towards increased accountability and transparency by detailing the following individual service components:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Issues, PRs, Dashboard, Projects</li><li>Notifications</li><li>Gists</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<p>Overtime, they have expanded and refined their component statuses. They also started showing historical data right on their status page. As you can see in their newest and most detailed status page format, it shows the following service component statuses:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Issues, PRs, Projects</li><li>GitHub Actions</li><li>GitHub Packages</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<h3>GitHub’s New Status Page</h3>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png" alt="GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png 944w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-277x300.png 277w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-768x833.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-720x781.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-580x629.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-320x347.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"><figcaption>GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service.</figcaption></figure>



<p>They also moved their status page to a dedicated domain, <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">githubstatus.com</a>, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">which follows a best practice we recommend</a> to anyone who hosts a status page. All of this additional transparency, details, and historical data is a commendable effort to relay the most up-to-date information about the status of all GitHub systems. More providers of critical cloud infrastructure should emulate what GitHub has done. <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/07/your-status-page-is-useless-if-you-dont-use-it/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Your status page is useless if you don’t use it.</a></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>What can we conclude from all of this data? Objectively, we can conclude that GitHub has published to their status page more frequently in the two years after their acquisition announcement. They have posted more incidents of disruption and downtime. Those incidents have been longer in duration. According to the data they provided, GitHub has been down more since the acquisition by Microsoft. </p>



<p>But that could be all a part of coordinated effort to be more transparent about their service status, an effort that should be applauded.</p>



<p>Our goal at StatusGator is not to shame anyone for disruptions and outages. Everyone experiences unexpected downtime. We simply strive to make status page data available and accessible in more useful ways. From Slack and <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/03/status-page-monitoring-in-microsoft-teams/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Microsoft Teams</a>, to <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/30/status-page-webhooks-new-and-improved/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">webhooks</a>, an API, and more. StatusGator aggregates status page data and empowers you to keep your team informed. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Coronavirus and the lockdowns it forced has probably sped up the transition to working from home in many jobs by at least a decade. Workers who previously spend time sitting in cubicles or offices found out they could have just as well worked from home. Millions started looking for software that would help them do that. </p>
<p>Enter Zoom, a somewhat popular video-conferencing program made all the way back in 2011. It was already fairly popular before the pandemic, but this year it’s popularity has exploded. The daily average user numbers went from around 10 million in December to over 300 million in April. </p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>Zoom became the go-to choice for many mainly because it’s really easy to use and free (well at least the basic version is) The usually highlighted advantages of Zoom are:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple and easy to use interface</li>
<li>good audio and video quality</li>
<li>smooth and easy to set up conference calls even for large groups up to 100 people</li>
<li>compatibility with various systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS</li>
<li>ability to share slides and content</li>
<li>scheduling conferences via a calendar that can be shared with others</li>
<li>virtual backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>Zoom also helped itself by making the program free to use for K-12 schools in the US since early March, just as the lockdowns were starting. It also received a lot of free publicity from famous users, even the UK government used it to host sessions.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>Well, it’s not all as rosy as it sounds. Zoom has been involved in some controversies that have become more and more apparent as it gained popularity. The main point of criticism has been lackluster security. </p>
<ul>
<li>In 2019 Apple was forced to remove Zoom from Macs after it turned out a security flaw could let websites hijack users’ cameras. Although the company quickly addressed this with fixes and a lengthy blog post, it wasn’t a good look.</li>
<li>Zoom has no end-to-end encryption, despite some advertising materials claiming otherwise. It stores all the keys involved in user data encryption in its own cloud infrastructure. Which means it can access user data at will.</li>
<li>Zoom calls have random generated IDs consisting between 9 and 11 digits and these can apparently be brute-forced or even randomly guessed which means hackers can get into meetings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The flaws were pretty notorious and led to a phenomenon called <em>zoom bombing</em> where pranksters would join meetings to broadcast inappropriate content. It got so bad the FBI had to officially warn schools.</p>
<h2>The Ugly</h2>
<p>Remember that thing about Zoom having access to user data? Well, it turns out that’s not an accident.</p>
<ul>
<li>This month Zoom admitted to closing three meetings commemorating the Tiananmen Square crackdown and suspended the accounts of activists who organized them. This led to teachers voicing concerns about how they’re supposed to cover such topics in classes hosted on the platform.</li>
<li>In April the New York Times found out Zoom’s data mining feature was automatically sending user’s names and emails to LinkedIn allowing participants to access other users’ profile data.</li>
<li>In March Motherboard found out Zoom’s iOS app was automatically sending device analytics to Facebook without informing the user and did it even if the user did not have a Facebook account. There was no mention of this in the privacy policy either.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far this has led to a couple of lawsuits, an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission and outright bans from some tech companies and the UK’s ministry of defense. Not good news for the company to put it mildly. Yet despite all that Zoom is still hugely popular and looks like it will stay that way despite its flaws. To be fair it’s not like it’s main competitors like Microsoft Teams and Google Hangouts don’t have any either, so pick your poison.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs.

<![CDATA[Experimenting with Error Handling via Generics in Go]]>

June 29, 2020 | https://deedlefake.com/experimenting-with-error-handling-via-generics-in-go.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deedlefake.com/experimenting-with-error-handling-via-generics-in-go.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On June 16th, an article was published to the Go blog detailing <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">the next steps for generics in Go</a>. Of particular interest in this case was that along with another updated draft design, this one came along with <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">a tool that allowed users to actually write and use generic code in Go</a>.</p>

<p>So with a request to experiment, experiment I did. I tried a few little things, such an implementation of iterators, but then decided to play around with error handling, and I quickly realized that generics alone may be the beginnings of the solution to the error handling problem that so many people have been clamoring for.</p>

<p>Before I get to error handling and what I did, let’s take a quick look at a slightly simpler case: Secondary boolean returns. In Go, the convention for a function that might not return a value is to have the function return a boolean as a secondary return that indicates whether or not the first value makes any sense. For example, in the <code>os</code> package, there is a function that does just that: <code>func LookupEnv(name string) (string, bool)</code>. This function is a more powerful version of <code>os.Getenv()</code>. Both get the value of an environment variable, but <code>os.Getenv()</code> simply returns an empty string if the variable isn’t set at all, leaving no way to distinguish between an empty variable and an unset variable.</p>

<p>Taking a page out of Rust’s playbook, I decided to try implementing a wrapper for optional values that could provide some convenient common functionality. First, a container for the information and a few simple methods:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Optional</span>(<span>type</span> T) <span>struct</span> {
	v T
	ok <span>bool</span>
}

<span>func</span> (o <span>Optional</span>(T)) <span>Or</span>(v T) <span>Optional</span>(T) {
	<span>if</span> o.ok {
		<span>return</span> o
	}

	<span>return</span> <span>Optional</span>(T){v: v, ok: <span>true</span>}
}

<span>func</span> (o <span>Optional</span>(T)) <span>Get</span>() (T, <span>bool</span>) {
	<span>return</span> o.v, o.ok
}

<span>func</span> (o <span>Optional</span>(T)) <span>Must</span>() T {
	<span>if</span> !o.ok {
		panic(<span>"no value"</span>)
	}
	<span>return</span> o.v
}
</pre>
<p>It’s fairly simple to imagine how this might work, but how do you translate from existing functions following that convention to this new system? If I did, for example,</p>
<pre>v, ok := os.<span>LookupEnv</span>(<span>"DATABASE_URL"</span>)
v = <span>Optional</span>(<span>string</span>){v: v, ok: ok}.<span>Or</span>(DefaultDatabaseURL).<span>Must</span>()
</pre>
<p>then I haven’t exactly gained a whole lot. I even have to manually specify the type of the value now.</p>

<p>The key is a shortcut in Go that allows a call to a function with multiple returns to be passed directly to a call to a function with multiple arguments of the same types in the same order. Given this, a function that can be created such as the following:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Option</span>(<span>type</span> T)(v T, ok <span>bool</span>) <span>Optional</span>(T) {
	<span>return</span> <span>Optional</span>(T){v: v, ok: ok}
}
</pre>
<p>Now usage is very easy:</p>
<pre><span>// Functions do inference of arguments, so this version doesn't
</span><span></span><span>// require a manual type to be specified.
</span><span></span>
v := <span>Option</span>(os.<span>LookupEnv</span>(<span>"DATABASE_URL"</span>)).
	<span>Or</span>(DefaultDatabaseURL).
	<span>Must</span>()
</pre>
<p>This is significantly cleaner, in my opinion, then a manual check of the boolean return. For one thing, it doesn’t clutter up the local namespace with booleans, something that can get quite awkward to deal with if calls are nested into several <code>if</code>s, or if multiple calls need to be done before any of the checks are. For another thing, it avoids the subtleties of shadowing from using <code>:=</code> with multiple assignments. And thirdly, it avoids the problems of trying to assign to a struct field or slice index with <code>:=</code>, which is simply not allowed.</p>

<p>From here, a basic error handling pattern can be established pretty easily, but before getting to that, I’m going to put together an example function that I’ll be attempting to clean up with some error handling wrappers:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Authenticate</span>(ctx context.Context, db *ent.Client, email <span>string</span>, password []<span>byte</span>) (user *ent.User, err <span>error</span>) {
	user, err = db.User.<span>Query</span>().
		<span>Where</span>(user.<span>Email</span>(email)).
		<span>Only</span>(ctx)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"get user: %w"</span>, err)
	}

	dbpass, err := base64.StdEncoding.<span>DecodeString</span>(user.Password)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"decode password: %w"</span>, err)
	}

	err = bcrypt.<span>CompareHashAndPassword</span>(dbpass, password)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"check password: %w"</span>, err)
	}

	<span>return</span> user, <span>nil</span>
}
</pre>
<p>This function is a theoretical implementation of user authentication in, for example, an API backend. You don’t need to know how <a href="https://entgo.io/">ent</a> works to understand what I’m going to do here; you just need to recognize how the standard error convention is being used here.</p>

<p>Now that that’s out of the way, here’s the beginnings of the error handling code:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>type</span> T) <span>struct</span> {
	v T
	err <span>error</span>
}

<span>func</span> <span>Try</span>(<span>type</span> T)(v T, err <span>error</span>) <span>Error</span>(T) {
	<span>return</span> <span>Error</span>(T){v: v, err: err}
}

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Get</span>() (T, <span>error</span>) {
	<span>return</span> e.v, e.err
}

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Must</span>() T {
	<span>if</span> e.err != <span>nil</span> {
		panic(e.err)
	}
	<span>return</span> e.v
}

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Err</span>() <span>error</span> {
	<span>return</span> e.err
}
</pre>
<p>Now, unlike for <code>Optional</code>, an <code>Or()</code> method doesn’t necessarily make as much sense, as there are two values to deal with. More importantly, the user will probably want to do something specific based on what the error value is if there is one. To that end:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>ModFunc</span>(<span>type</span> T) <span>func</span>(T, <span>error</span>) (T, <span>error</span>)

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Mod</span>(f ModFunc) <span>Error</span>(T) {
	<span>return</span> <span>Try</span>(<span>f</span>(e.<span>Get</span>()))
}
</pre>
<p>While this might be generally useful for a number of different ways of handling errors, there is one very common operation that can also be provided to the user:</p>
<pre><span>// Not the most general, perhaps, but fine for the demonstation. Also,
</span><span></span><span>// unfortunately, int its intended use the type will have to be
</span><span></span><span>// specified manually because of shortcomings in the type inference as
</span><span></span><span>// currently implemented.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>Wrap</span>(<span>type</span> T)(str <span>string</span>) <span>ModFunc</span>(T) {
	<span>return</span> <span>func</span>(v T, err <span>error</span>) (T, <span>error</span>) {
		<span>if</span> err == <span>nil</span> {
			<span>return</span> v, err
		}
		<span>return</span> v, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(str + <span>": %w"</span>, err)
	}
}
</pre>
<p>Now that these features have been added, let’s take a quick look at how it’s affected the working example:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Authenticate</span>(ctx context.Context, db *ent.Client, email <span>string</span>, password []<span>byte</span>) (user *ent.User, err <span>error</span>) {
	user, err = db.User.<span>Query</span>().
		<span>Where</span>(user.<span>Email</span>(email)).
		<span>Only</span>(ctx)
	user, err = <span>Try</span>(user, err).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>(*ent.User)(<span>"get user"</span>)).
		<span>Get</span>()
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, err
	}

	dbpass, err := <span>Try</span>(base64.StdEncoding.<span>DecodeString</span>(user.Password)).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>([]<span>byte</span>)(<span>"decode password"</span>)).
		<span>Get</span>()
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, err
	}

	err = bcrypt.<span>CompareHashAndPassword</span>(dbpass, password)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, fmt.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"check password: %w"</span>, err)
	}

	<span>return</span> user, <span>nil</span>
}
</pre>
<p>Hmmm… Hasn’t helped much, huh? There are still <code>err</code> variables and <code>err != nil</code> checks all over the place. In fact, I might even go so far as to say that it’s gotten worse.</p>

<p>Don’t worry. I’m not quite done yet.</p>

<p>First of all, let’s take care of that call to <code>CompareAndHashPassword()</code> at the end. Unlike the others, this one doesn’t return a value, just an error. Thanks to the way Go’s type system works, this is surprisingly straightforward, only requiring a single new function:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Do</span>(err <span>error</span>) <span>Error</span>(<span>struct</span>{}) {
	<span>return</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>struct</span>{}){err: err}
}
</pre>
<p>That call can now be changed to</p>
<pre>err = <span>Do</span>(bcrypt.<span>CompareHashAndPassword</span>(dbpass, password)).
	<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>(<span>struct</span>{})(<span>"check password"</span>)).
	<span>Err</span>()
<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, err
}
</pre>
<p>Alright, time to finally remove all of those manual checks. This is going to require a new type, a couple of modifications to an existing method, and two new functions. First of all, the type and the modification:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> perror <span>struct</span> {
	err <span>error</span>
}

<span>func</span> (err perror) <span>Unwrap</span>() <span>error</span> {
	<span>return</span> err.err
}

<span>func</span> (err perror) <span>Error</span>() <span>string</span> {
	<span>return</span> err.err.<span>Error</span>()
}

<span>func</span> (e <span>Error</span>(T)) <span>Must</span>() T {
	<span>if</span> e.err != <span>nil</span> {
		panic(perror{e.err})
	}
	<span>return</span> e.v
}
</pre>
<p>Now, when a function panics, before control leaves the function all of the deferred function calls are run as though a normal return was happening. Inside of those functions, a special built-in function, <code>recover()</code>, will cause the panicking to stop and will return the value, as an <code>interface{}</code>, that was passed to <code>panic()</code> in the first place. Combining this with the new <code>perror</code> type, it becomes fairly easy to write a function to catch errors that were caused by a call to <code>Must()</code> and <em>only</em> errors that were caused by that call:</p>
<pre><span>type</span> CatchFunc <span>func</span>(err <span>error</span>)

<span>func</span> <span>Catch</span>(f CatchFunc) {
	<span>switch</span> r := recover().(<span>type</span>) {
	<span>case</span> <span>nil</span>:
		<span>return</span>

	<span>case</span> perror:
		<span>f</span>(r)

	<span>default</span>:
		panic(r)
	}
}
</pre>
<p>And to avoid repetition:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Return</span>(rerr *<span>error</span>) CatchFunc {
	<span>return</span> <span>func</span>(err <span>error</span>) {
		<span>if</span> *rerr != <span>nil</span> {
			<span>return</span>
		}
		*rerr = err
	}
}
</pre>
<p>And back to the working example:</p>
<pre><span>func</span> <span>Authenticate</span>(ctx context.Context, db *ent.Client, email <span>string</span>, password []<span>byte</span>) (_ *ent.User, err <span>error</span>) {
	<span>defer</span> <span>Catch</span>(<span>Return</span>(&amp;err))

	user, err := db.User.<span>Query</span>().
		<span>Where</span>(user.<span>Email</span>(email)).
		<span>Only</span>(ctx)
	user = <span>Try</span>(user, err).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>(*ent.User)(<span>"get user"</span>)).
		<span>Must</span>()

	dbpass := <span>Try</span>(base64.StdEncoding.<span>DecodeString</span>(user.Password)).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>([]<span>byte</span>)(<span>"decode password"</span>)).
		<span>Must</span>()

	<span>Do</span>(bcrypt.<span>CompareHashAndPassword</span>(dbpass, password)).
		<span>Mod</span>(<span>Wrap</span>(<span>struct</span>{})(<span>"check password"</span>)).
		<span>Must</span>()

	<span>return</span> user, <span>nil</span>
}
</pre>
<p>I don’t know about you, but that looks a <em>lot</em> cleaner to me, even with the insufficient type inference for the calls to <code>Wrap()</code>.</p>

<p>So will generics fix the error handling ‘problem’? Maybe. It’s hard to tell at this point. But it will definitely be a step closer to that problem being solved.</p>

    <p><img src="https://gorillapdf.com/blog/10-facts-about-pdf-infographic/10-facts-about-pdf.png" title="Ten facts about PDF"></p><p>We love lists and hope you love them too! Today we have a list of <strong>10 facts about <a href="https://gorillapdf.com/blog/what-does-pdf-stand-for/" title="PDF File Format">PDF file format</a></strong>. </p>
<p>The list is complemented with a colorful infographic and we hope you’ll like it.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are so many facts about one of the most popular file formats on the planet, but Gorilla only counts to 10.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 10 interesting facts about PDF.</p>
<h2>10 PDF Facts</h2>
<ol>
<li>PDF is an invention of Adobe Systems. It was created in the early 1990s and officially presented in January 1993 at the Windows and OS|2 Conference.</li>
<li>PDF is independent of software and hardware, and can be accessed from every device. PDFs retain their original formatting no matter from which device they are accessed.</li>
<li>The initial project was called The Camelot Project. Later renamed to Carousel.</li>
<li>PDF Files can be optimized for the web. You can add a web friendly filename, define a good title and meta description, add headings to structure your PDF, insert links, include it on a website as a normal page and optimize the PDF file in size.</li>
<li>Acrobat Reader initial cost was $50.</li>
<li>PDF is the most popular file extension on the web. See yourself and try the filetype: operator in Google Search to limit results to a specific file type. For example, filetype:pdf hardware will result with PDF files with the term "hardware" in them. Try the same for several filetypes and compare the number of results.</li>
<li>One of the first early adopters of PDF were the US tax authorities. The service distributed tax forms as PDF files.</li>
<li>PDF supports security. You can add different levels of security and password protect your PDF files.</li>
<li>PDF is ISO standardized 15 years after invention (1993-2008). In 2008, PDF 1.7 (and beyond) by Adobe Systems became ISO 32000:1:2008 standard. A new version was published in July 2017, which is the ISO 32000-2:2017 PDF specification.</li>
<li>PDF can contain links, buttons, form fields, audio, video and business logic.</li>

    <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p><img src="https://media.eurekalert.org/multimedia_prod/pub/web/235928_web.jpg" height="200" width="200">Staring at a deep red light for three minutes a day can significantly improve declining eyesight, finds a new University College of London (UCL)-led study, the first of its kind in humans. Scientists believe the discovery, published online on June 29, 2020 in The Journals of Gerontology, Series A, could signal the dawn of new, affordable, home-based eye therapies, helping the millions of people globally with naturally declining vision. The article is titled “Optically Improved Mitochondrial Function Redeems Aged Human Visual Decline.” In the UK, there are currently presently 12 million people aged over 65: in 50 years, this will increase to approximatley 20 million and all will have some degree of visual decline because of retinal aging. Lead author, Professor Glen Jeffery, PhD, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, said: "As you age your visual system declines significantly, particularly once over 40. Your retinal sensitivity and your color vision are both gradually undermined, and with an aging population, this is an increasingly important issue. To try to stem or reverse this decline, we sought to reboot the retina's aging cells with short bursts of longwave light."In humans around 40 years-old, cells in the eye's retina begin to age, and the pace of this aging is caused, in part, when the cell's mitochondria, whose role is to produce energy (known as ATP) and boost cell function, also start to decline. Mitochondrial density is greatest in the retina's photoreceptor cells, which have high energy demands. As a result, the retina ages faster than other organs, with a 70% ATP reduction over life, causing a significant decline in photoreceptor function as these receptors lack the energy to perform their normal role. Researchers built on their previous results in mice, bumblebees, and fruit flies, which all demonstrated significant improvements in the function of the retina's photoreceptors when their eyes were exposed to 670 nanometer (long-wavelength) deep red light. </p>
<p>"Mitochondria have specific light absorbance characteristics influencing their performance: longer wavelengths spanning 650 to 1000 nm are absorbed and improve mitochondrial performance to increase energy production," said Professor Jeffery. </p>
<p>The retina's photoreceptor population is formed of cones, which mediate color vision and rods, which provide peripheral vision and adapt vision in low/dim light. </p>
<p>For the study, 24 people (12 male, 12 female), aged between 28 and 72, who had no ocular disease, were recruited. All participants' eyes were tested for the sensitivity of their rods and cones at the start of the study. Rod sensitivity was measured in dark-adapted eyes (with pupils dilated) by asking participants to detect dim light signals in the dark, and cone function was tested by subjects identifying colored letters that had very low contrast and appeared increasingly blurred, a process called color contrast. </p>
<p>All participants were then given a small LED torch to take home and were asked to look into its deep red 670 nm light beam for three minutes a day for two weeks. They were then re-tested for their rod and cone sensitivity.</p>
<p>COLOR &amp; NIGHT VISION BOTH IMPROVED BY SIMPLE APPROACH</p>
<p>Researchers found the 670 nm light had no impact in younger individuals, but in those around 40 years and over, significant improvements were obtained. </p>
<p>Cone color contrast sensitivity (the ability to detect colors) improved by up to 20% in some people aged around 40 and over. Improvements were more significant in the blue part of the color spectrum that is more vulnerable in aging.<br>
Rod sensitivity (the ability to see in low light) also improved significantly in those aged around 40 and over, though less than color contrast.</p>
<p>Professor Jeffery said: "Our study shows that it is possible to significantly improve vision that has declined in aged individuals using simple brief exposures to light wavelengths that recharge the energy system that has declined in the retina cells, rather like re-charging a battery.</p>
<p>"The technology is simple and very safe, using a deep red light of a specific wavelength, that is absorbed by mitochondria in the retina that supply energy for cellular function.</p>
<p>"Our devices cost about £12 (~$15) to make, so the technology is highly accessible to members of the public." </p>
<p>WARNING</p>
<p>Be aware these are preliminary results of a very small study. This approach should not be attempted by anyone until further studies are completed to determine the safety and efficacy of this novel approach. Please consult your ophthalmologist to determine the status of this developing approach to possibly reducing vision loss associated with aging. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><h2>Outline</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>First I'll introduce the rationale behind this new series of blog posts called <em>Raku to the Rescue</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterwards we will dig into a small Raku script which quickly sets up my keyboard to use the CAPSLOCK key as a toggle switch for inputting APL characters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The magic sauce of reactive programming is introduced to solve a problem where we need to periodically check via a system command whether (some layer of) the Linux desktop has annoyingly reset my <code>XKB</code> config and then place back our carefully chosen configuration settings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Introducing.. <em>Raku to the Rescue!</em></h2>
<p>It's been several years since <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a> became my primary scripting language of choice. Whenever I have the option to use it, I do. Since it is always installed on my machines and there are always thingies that need to get glued together so Raku ends up getting used a fair bit.</p>
<p>This series aims to publicize some of the successful solutions that I've written while scripting annoying little problems into oblivion.</p>
<p>So follow me, brave reader, if you dare, for the first installment of our serialized adventure series exploring the wild unknown... <em>Raku to the Rescue!</em></p>
<h2>Today's Problem</h2>
<p><strong>At some layer of the Linux desktop, something is re-setting the <code>XKB</code> configuration that I've carefully set with <code>setxkbmap</code>.</strong></p>
<p>The kind of periodic checking for this betrayal that best addresses this problem is very easy to do in Raku -- and <em>without</em> feeling like some gross deviant who relies on a <code>while(1)</code> with a <code>sleep</code> call tucked inside. Nice!</p>
<h3>APL?</h3>
<p>While Raku is still regarded with baseless suspicion by many, I may have recently fallen in love with a language with an even more maligned image amongst the modern programmer: APL.</p>
<p>I won't go into depth about the history of the language here -- one of my absolute favorite aspects of APL (or any language) is removing boiler plate. There are a ton of intro articles on every damn thing in the world and I can't see myself doing it better.</p>
<p>Another thing I love about APL is the rich historical record. For my particular brand of dorky madness, it's downright intoxicating at times. So go forth and read some <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/papers">APL history</a> for yourself.</p>
<p>And if you need a bit of convincing about why array programming is a crucial paradigm to consider for the performance problems we face today, I recommend the excellent talk <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK2WUDIY4hk">Rectangles All The Way Down</a></em> by Martin Thompson.</p>
<h2>The Raku Solution</h2>
<p>One of my absolute favorite features of Raku is being able to script a command-line program with as little boilerplate as possible <em>(if this guy hates boilerplate so much, why does he keep repeating himself? - ed.)</em>.</p>
<pre><code>sub MAIN(:$interval = 30, :$key = 'caps_switch', :v($verbose) = False) {
  react {
    whenever Supply.interval($interval) {
      set-xkbmap-for-apl($key, $verbose)
        if not xkbmap-contains-apl;
    }

    whenever signal(SIGINT) {
      say "Reset a total of $total-resets out of $total-checks checks"
      	if $verbose;
      exit;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Example invocation</h3>
<pre><code>apl-keyboard-keeper --interval 60 -v &gt;&gt; /tmp/xkb-resets.log &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>This slows the checks down to 60 seconds and turns on logging that is then append piped to the file <code>/tmp/xkb-resets.log</code> for later investigation.</p>
<p>Additional logging could be added should I ever bother investigating the underlying issue beyond the simple statistics provided now. However I have rarely used this script since I installed <a href="https://hikari.acmelabs.space/">Hikari</a> on Wayland. (Wayland does not use <code>setxkbmap</code> for modifying <code>XKB</code> settings, instead relying on environment variables like a sane UNIX tool).</p>
<h3>The <code>MAIN</code> thing</h3>
<p>I don't need to reach for a single library. Every feature is in core Raku. I get a short-hand <code>-v</code> toggle just by adjusting the signature declaration ever so slightly. That's because named arguments to your <code>MAIN</code> routine will be interpreted as CLI flags. This allows Raku to provide sugar to adjust the CLI argument parsing by changing the name of the argument slightly.</p>
<p>This is all inter-related to the topics of <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature"><code>Signature</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Pair"><code>Pair</code></a>, should you wish to dive deeper.</p>
<h3>Go ahead, <code>react whenever</code></h3>
<p>The reason I reach for Raku whenever I need a task repeated on a time based manner is because it is exactly as easy as you see above.</p>
<p>The pattern is so easy to write that there is really no reason to ever generalize it in a module -- I just write it every time I need it. One example that had a big impact on my physical health was setting up a timer to stand up and walk around every 30 minutes as I had been instructed by my doctor. I wrote it as a one-liner and set it running every day when I got into work.</p>
<p>In this case we are using <code>Supply.interval</code> to trigger it's <code>whenever</code> block, um, <em>whenever</em> it fires. This checks whether our settings have been erased and resets them if that is the case.</p>
<p>We take care of our exit case by responding to the <code>SIGINT</code> signal with our own codepath. Note that <code>exit</code> is not required, meaning that one can write code to try and untangle whatever state has led a user to send a <code>SIGINT</code> to the process.</p>
<h3>Next generation regex</h3>
<p>Perl was once the pinnacle of text processing due to it's first class handling of "regexes" (we don't call them "regular expressions" out of fear that academically minded nerds will come for our keyboards).</p>
<p>However, as anyone who has written or edited a PCRE (Perl Compatible Reg Ex) before can attest, it's rarely pretty.</p>
<p>A lot of work has been done in Raku to elevate regex syntax to new levels of usability. An example from my script:</p>
<pre><code>  if $xkb-settings ~~ /^^ "layout:" \s* $&lt;layout&gt;=(&lt;.graph&gt;*) $$/ {
    $layout = $&lt;layout&gt;.Str;
  } else {
    die "Aborting. The xkb settings do not specify any layout:\n$xkb-settings";
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Here we use the logical line begin/end matchers, <code>^^</code> and <code>$$</code> respectively. Notice that string literals must be quoted to be matched now. A wonderful knock-on effect of this is way fewer backslash escapes are required to input your match string.</p>
<p>Named regex capture groups are very easy to define and are done in a way that interacts directly with <code>$/</code>, the <code>Match</code> object. This removes the awful implications of <code>$1, $2,...</code> that seeped throughout in Perl 5. (Named captures are not necessary but positionals are accessed through the <code>$/</code> object as well, eg <code>$/[1,2]</code>).</p>
<p><code>&lt;.graph&gt;</code> is a handy included character class that includes <code>&lt;alnum&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;punct&gt;</code>. This allows us to slurp in our comma-separated values. The <code>.</code> in <code>&lt;.graph&gt;</code> is to avoid it becoming a named capture (the default behavior of a character class in a regex is to act as a capture group named after that character class).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Today I've shown how Raku came to my rescue and saved me from the frustrations of trying to use my new-found muscle memory for typing APL characters only to find out that my OS is shuffling my config around and forcing me to manually re-invoke <code>setxkbmap</code>.</p>
<p>Below is the full script.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env raku

# Small script to ensure that APL keyboard layout is still set in xkb settings.
# Note that this is a patch for some sort of deranged time-based reset of these
# settings that is happening at a lower level of the Xorg-based Linux user experience.
#
# It's not clear what is causing these resets but this script allows us to more
# or less not care about it and get on with our hacking.

<p>After publishing the URU Key project people keep asking me to make it open source. I have tried to organize sources in a more readable way but I still think that plain C and ESP IDF are too difficult for the broad audience. And, unfortunately, the biometrics part is covered by NDA and can not be published.</p>
<p>Therefore I am starting a new project to address these and other issues.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-form-factor">Size and form factor</h2>
<p>A few months ago I have finalized the <a href="https://en.ovcharov.me/2020/04/06/uru-key-final-hardware-design/">URU Key hardware design</a> and started working on housing for it. Yes, it is very small and lightweight but carrying it around is a kind of a problem. The device is too fragile to be worn on the keyring and a bit thick to put in the pocket. The necklace is not my style.</p>

<p>However, my wallet is always with me. The PCB sized as a standard credit card should perfectly fit there. The power source becomes a problem, that’s true. But, wait, is it difficult to find a charger or power bank with Micro USB nowadays?</p>

<p>The name <strong>URU Card</strong> makes a lot of sense for this project, isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User interface</h2>
<p>As on one hand, I can not use biometrics for open source project and on other hand, I do not want to omit the authentication completely leaving the device insecure there is a need for some form of user verification. Simple touch keyboard and OLED screen should allow people to enter pin code or password.</p>

<p>The keyboard should be implemented with the <strong>MPR121</strong> I2C touch-sensor controller, and the screen is a widely available <strong>OLED</strong> screen with the <strong>SSD1306</strong> controller. The screen is placed in the special cut in the PCB keeping the device thickness below 2 millimetres.</p>
<h2 id="framework-for-the-development">Framework for the development</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the <strong>Arduino</strong> framework is ported to the <strong>ESP32</strong> platform. There are hundreds of libraries for almost every use case and this factor should significantly simplify the project. There are libraries for <strong>ATECC508A</strong>, <strong>MPR121</strong> and <strong>SSD1306</strong> already. All that is needed is to wire everything together.</p>
<p>However, the Arduino IDE will be hardly usable for a project complex like this one. I am going to use Visual Studio Code + <strong>PlatformIO</strong> for the development and recommend others to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-the-project">The current state of the project</h2>
<p>At the moment the working <strong>BLE server</strong> with <strong>FIDO2</strong> endpoints is implemented. The device is “visible” and the computer connects to it in order to perform an authentication procedure. However, the commands are not implemented yet - it’s going to be the next step.</p>

<p>There is a PCB design as well and you can try to build the device, but do it on your own risk - it’s in a very early stage now.</p>
<h2 id="joining-the-project">Joining the project</h2>
<p>Sweetest part. The project is free to join for everyone. The minimal requirement is just an ESP32 development board like the one below.</p>

    <p>Existing ML for code methods often learn from <a href="https://github.blog/2019-09-26-introducing-the-codesearchnet-challenge/">raw source code</a> and sometimes use <a href="https://slideslive.com/38917598/program-understanding-synthesis-and-verification-with-graph-neural-networks">data flow</a> to understand programs.
While these offer large amounts of data they don’t actually show what code fundamentally does, changes state.</p>

<p>With that in mind I’ve created a dataset of over 1 million ran python programming solutions with state changes shown after each line of code. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/frasergreenlee/ran-hackerrank-solutions">Get it here</a></p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Most AI for code models only learn from reading code. This lets AI models recognise patterns in the code &amp; generate sensible-looking code.</p>

<p>But do these models really understand code? If you were to read code without running anything and had no prior knowledge of programming would you know how to use it?</p>

<h3 id="an-example">An example</h3>

<p>Lets try learning about a single program character the way an AI would.</p>

<p>Below is a simple program with just 1 character replaced by a Chinese character making the code inscrutable. This is a similar experience for an AI seeing the true character for the first time.</p>

<p>As you can see the code is inscrutable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C</span> <span>=</span> <span>A六B</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>B六C</span>
<span>E</span> <span>=</span> <span>A六D</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>C六E</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How could I make this understandable without showing the true character?</p>

<p>Since all code does is change state, lets show state changes between each line.</p>

<p>Below shows state changes but the values are also represented by Chinese characters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>..</span> <span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>书</span>
<span>..</span> <span>B</span> <span>=</span> <span>書</span>
<span>C</span> <span>=</span> <span>A六B</span>
<span>..</span> <span>C</span> <span>=</span> <span>書</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>B六C</span>
<span>..</span> <span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>书</span>
<span>E</span> <span>=</span> <span>A六D</span>
<span>..</span> <span>E</span> <span>=</span> <span>书</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>C六E</span>
<span>..</span> <span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>書</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Lets look at all the operations with the values substituted in:</p>

<p><code>书六書=書</code>, <code>書六書=书</code>, <code>书六书=书</code>, <code>書六书=書</code></p>

<p>If you are familiar with programming you may be able to guess that <code>六</code> is an <code>and</code> operator with <code>书</code> being <code>True</code> &amp; <code>書</code> being <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s the original code with swapped words:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#  and is 六
#  True is 书
#  False is 書
</span><span>C</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span> <span>and</span> <span>B</span>
<span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span> <span>and</span> <span>C</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>C</span> <span>and</span> <span>B</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>D</span> <span>and</span> <span>D</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Think how much more code you would need to read to figure out what <code>六</code> meant if you couldn’t see state changes. For this reason I rekon showing state changes will help AI models understand code.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-got-this-data">How I got this data</h2>

<p>I first found the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/arjoonn/codechef-competitive-programming">CodeChef dataset</a> it’s got 1 million solutions to programming problems but few are in Python and many aren’t runnable.</p>

<p>HackerRank is a site where programmers can practice for interviews on their huge range of programming problems. It has a “See Solutions” button that lets you read other peoples solutions.
I used <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html">Selenium</a> to click on that button for every problem to get solution URLs. Then I used <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Requests</a> to download those solutions.
After a few days I had 1 million solution code snippets with on average 1k solutions per problem.</p>

<h3 id="recording-state-changes">Recording State Changes</h3>

<p>Once I had my runnable code snippets I used <a href="https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop">Snoop</a> to record all the state changes occurring in each program run.</p>

<p>Snoop dynamically adds logs to your code showing what has executed &amp; which state values have changed. To see how this works check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm47491S-Fo">talk</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/snoops-output.png" alt="Some Snoop output." title="Some Snoop output."></p>

<p>Next step was to run all the code snippets. The script used to run the code and progress logs can be found <a href="https://app.wandb.ai/fraser/run-code-snippets/runs/3q9pzype/files/code/data/run_code/hacker-rank/get_problem_snoops.py">here</a>. Thankfully running all these code snippets didn’t cause many issues, I just had to watch out for some the occasional massive code snippet.</p>

<p>An interesting yet worrying feature of the Snoop files is that they are highly compressible, the zip file is 1/10th the size of the txt file. This is likely due to repetitions in the snoop due to the same code being ran repeatedly in for loops and method calls.</p>

<h2 id="initial-results">Initial Results</h2>

<p>With the dataset completed I trained <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">gpt2</a> to perform causal language modelling on the raw text. I wanted to see if the Snoops text offers the model any unique insights about code.</p>

<h3 id="pre-training">Pre-Training</h3>

<p><a href="https://app.wandb.ai/fraser/lm_snoop">Here</a> you can see some initial results on training gpt2 &amp; <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/">BERT</a> on the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/snoops-gpt2-training.png" alt="Eval loss while training gpt2-medium from-scratch/pre-trained on the Snoop text." title="Eval loss while training gpt2-medium from-scratch/pre-trained on the Snoop text."></p>

<p>Surprisingly gpt2 with OpenAI pre-training (blue) is actually already very accurate on the Snoop text.</p>

<p>When having it generate text with short prompts I found it to be far less accurate than the 1.1 evaluation perplexity. It seems like the gpt2 model is spotting patterns in it’s prefix string &amp; is using them to predict future tokens rather than having a probabilistic model of an interpreter.</p>

<h3 id="a-downstream-task">A Downstream Task</h3>

<p><a href="https://app.wandb.ai/fraser/conala">Here</a> you can see it fine-tuned on <a href="https://conala-corpus.github.io/">CoNaLa</a> (a description-to-code translation task). The Snoop data is better than no pre-training but not as good as gpt2 with OpenAI pre-training. Of course the Snoops model hasn’t had the same amount of training time nor has it seen natural language before so its not a fair test.</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/conala-gpt2.png" alt="Fine-tuning gpt2 from scratch vs pre-trained." title="Fine-tuning gpt2 from scratch vs pre-trained."></p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/conala-gpt2-pretrained.png" alt="Fine-tuning Snoop pre-trained vs OpenAI pre-trained." title="Fine-tuning Snoop pre-trained vs OpenAI pre-trained."></p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of potential in using state changes to understand code. Right now I don’t think just reading the raw snoops text is the way to go but I think a well formatted, compressed version could do better.
Next time I’ll show how well a compressed version of this dataset can teach a transformer to act as a Python interpreter.</p>

<p>Here’s some other investigations you could do with this dataset:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Further testing on how this helps downstream tasks, try training a language model on just the code &amp; just the Snoop, see which does better on downstream tasks &amp; by how much. These downstream tasks could include bug detection, data type prediction, search &amp; description2code generation.</li>
  <li>Run Snoop on the Django source code with the <a href="https://ahcweb01.naist.jp/pseudogen/">English2Django dataset</a> comments in the code. That way a language model will learn NLP, code &amp; state all at the same time. Warning I got a lot of <code>STATE_UNAVAILABLE</code> messages when I tried this so be ready to filter a lot of data.</li>
  <li>Try applying this method to another programming language, maybe there’s a similar tool for Java or Javascript?</li>
  <li>Try filtering &amp; rearranging the data for new tasks. It offers a valuable insight as to what parts of the source code are useful to humans.</li>
</ul>

            <p>“I’m trying to go down a bottomless pit. I’ll never make it till the end.”</p>
<p>That’s what I thought when I tried to create my own video game. I was young, beautiful, and I was struggling to use <code>for</code> loops and <code>arrays</code> at the same time.
There was so much to learn!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found the strength to continue. More and more, the concepts behind programming began to make sense. From there, learning wasn’t a chore anymore, but an intrepid journey. Going through a book about C and trying to create my own adventure on MS-DOS was a crazy Indiana Jone’s-like discovery I’ll never forget.</p>
<p>My first video game wasn’t great, but it was mine. It was <em>my</em> creation. Yet, what I remember today, with a tear in my left eye, is not the result, but the learning process itself. It was these “Aha!” moments which brought me the most joy!</p>
<p>I love learning. For a long, long time. That’s why I tried, through the years, to make my learning gradually more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>Learning is essential for developers. We need to learn about the new breakthroughs, discoveries, and changes in the industry.</p>
<p>We need to learn about our history, to know what’s really new, what’s not, and what to do with it, <em>in what context</em>.</p>
<p>We need to learn about the business domain of the company we’re working with.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to better communicates with our teammates.</p>
<p>We need to learn about what our customers really want.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, this article will brush over the wide subject of learning, as a developer. We’ll try to answer these questions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s learning?</li>
<li>Why do we learn? Should learning serve a goal?</li>
<li>How to avoid ineffective learning methods, procrastination, and distractions?</li>
<li>Should we have a mentor or learn by ourselves?</li>
<li>Is practice only makes perfect?</li>
<li>How to test ourselves to avoid the illusion of competence?</li>
<li>Are feedback important? What kind of feedback can you get? What feedback should you be interested in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to dive? Good. Take your machete and let’s go together through the Deep Jungle of Knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="whats-learning">What’s learning?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we can be very surprised of the meaning of common words. Especially if we never question their definitions.</p>
<p>For example, I’m always surprised to hear people saying that learning is only a question of memory. It’s not wrong, but it’s incomplete.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/learning">oxford dictionary</a>, learning means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives us clues about how to learn (study, experience, or being taught), but not really about the meaning of “acquisition of knowledge”.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the definition of <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/knowledge">knowledge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can already see, thanks to these definitions, two main foundations for learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding</li>
<li>Remembering (acquisition)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll add a third one:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Transfer</li>
</ol>
<p>Transfer is applying the knowledge from the learning context to another context. For example, it could be applying the programming knowledge your learned at school to the side project you always dreamt to build.</p>
<p>Transfer is not a necessity for learning. After all, you can understand and remember something without ever using what you learned.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, we learn in hope to apply the knowledge acquired. That’s why it’s still a major component of our learning experiences.</p>

</picture>



<h3 id="enriching-your-life">Enriching Your Life</h3>
<p>Learning will enrich your life in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your opinions will evolve.</li>
<li>Your vision on the world will change.</li>
<li>You’ll feel strong connections with people who share your interests, creating passionate and mind-binding conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning can open doors in your professional life:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can help you climbing the corporate ladder.</li>
<li>It can help you to negotiate a better salary. After all, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge workers</a>: our worth is <em>partly</em> our knowledge.</li>
<li>It will create opportunities for <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/guide-debate-software-developer-skill/">healthy debates with your fellow colleagues</a>.</li>
<li>Your CTO might call you <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/software-developer-titles-junior-senior/">“Rockstar” or “Ninja”</a> too, you lucky pit of knowledge!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning-with-or-without-goals">Learning With or Without Goals?</h3>
<p>When you try to learn something, it’s useful to have concrete goals you want to achieve with the knowledge acquired. These goals could be a good occasion to <em>transfer</em> your knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, you want to learn programming because you always dreamt to create a revolutionary video game, where you can break bricks with a ball. Maybe you want to learn what’s the <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/dry-principle-cost-benefit-example/">DRY principle</a>, to finally refactor your favorite legacy application.</p>
<p>Without meaningful goals, it will be difficult to be motivated in the long run. Learning is not easy. Understanding can be a daunting task (depending of what you learn), remembering even more so, and transfer is maybe the worst of all.</p>
<p>It takes time, too. That’s why being able to reach concrete goals with your new skills and knowledge can be very satisfying. It will give you the needed motivation to continue on your learning path.</p>
<p>It’s even more true when you try to learn complex topics. Your motivation is something you should try to assess and even measure along the way, to see if you need to boost it by making (and finishing) something important to you.</p>
<p>It’s always possible to learn for the sake of learning. Heck, I do it quite a lot myself. Yet, you need to have a good confidence on your motivation, and you need to be aware of the benefits of the learning journey itself.</p>
<p>If you have difficulties to find concrete ideas and goals where you can transfer your new knowledge, I wrote a whole article about techniques <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/generate-programming-side-project-ideas/">to generate project ideas</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-deep-do-you-want-to-go">How Deep Do You Want to Go?</h2>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/experts.jpg" alt="Being an expert is not necessarily your goal">
</picture>



<p>Now that you have your goals, you need to decide <em>how much</em> you want to learn.</p>
<p>After all, you don’t need to be an expert in everything.</p>
<p>Moreover, knowledge acquisition is not like buying a new table for your living room. You need some maintenance not to forget the knowledge and skills acquired.</p>
<p>It means that you need to constantly refresh your knowledge and skills, for everything you want to be an expert at. It takes time, energy, and require, again, a lot of motivation.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that your life’s dream is to write a PHP script to rename automatically thousands of your holidays pictures. You don’t need to be a PHP evangelist to answer your needs. Trying to understand superficially how PHP works to accomplish what you want might be enough.</p>
<p>Superficial learning works well if you don’t have any goal, too. You can read about programming paradigms for example, by pure curiosity, to have a global overview of all of them. You can still dive deeper if you wish later.</p>
<p>Beyond the superficial, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model of competence</a> can help you deciding how competent you want to become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novice</strong> - Shallow understanding, or no understanding at all.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Beginner</strong> - Can make things works, often rely on following a series of steps.</li>
<li><strong>Competent</strong> - Can spot the roots of problems (background understanding), know all the rules and can select a rule depending of the situation. Still make many mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Proficient</strong> - Very conscious about performance, know perfectly what approaches to take in what situation.</li>
<li><strong>Expert</strong> - Intuition very well developed, apply his skills without thoughts, performances look magical.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see now how you should prepare yourself before learning anything.</p>
<p>The following advice won’t change your life from one day to another. You need to work on it, actively seeking to apply these advice, day after day. The rewards are, however, huge. I promise.</p>
<h3 id="the-mistakes-to-avoid">The Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>Let’s go back years in your past, when you were young, innocent, and not a caffeine junky yet.</p>
<p>You’re at school. The teacher is speaking about whatever subject he wants you to learn. His tone is monotonous, he doesn’t believe in what he’s saying, you think about what you’ll eat at lunch.</p>
<p>You’re bored.</p>
<p>The seconds feel like minutes. Minutes feel like hours. You can’t do anything, except waiting. Will it ever end? Will you feel joy again? Is it the end of time?</p>
<p>Finally, against all odds, the course end. The teacher ask you to learn a new chapter of your book. He will test you next time.</p>
<p>At home, you read again and again the learning material. You have difficulties to concentrate, but you’re a serious boy (or girl), so you push yourself through. After five reading, you judge yourself good enough to pass the next test.</p>
<p>You close your book, satisfied with yourself, and switch on the TV, because Youtube might not exist yet.</p>
<p>What I just described is the worst way to learn something. <em>Passively</em> listening to somebody, then <em>passively</em> going through some learning materials might teach you something, but very, very slowly. You don’t need to be in a class for that: just switch on Youtube and consume <em>passively</em> any video on programming.</p>
<p>When you close your book after your passive learning, you think you learned something. Yet, when you’ll pass your test, you’ll understand that you really didn’t.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>illusion of competence</strong>: we have often the <em>impression</em> we learned something, even if we didn’t.</p>
<p>You should spend most of your time <em>actively learning</em>. You need to be an actor in your own learning, not only consuming it like you would consume Netflix.</p>
<p>I would compare active learning as playing a video game. Yes, I was a video game junky.</p>
<p>When you play, you’re actively doing something. Consequently, I’m sure you can remember many more video games than what you read in your last books.</p>
<p>This is due to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Video games are fun. You can make your learning experience fun, too. More you’ll learn what you love, more you’ll like the process of learning.</li>
<li>Playing is an active endeavor, not a passive one.</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, before actively learning, you need first …</p></section></article></div></div>

		<p>It's been quite a while now that I'm relying on self-learning for my education. As I became a better learner, I tackled broader and more complex topics on my own.</p><p>At first, it was just specific books or guides that people referred me to. Usually, it was a part of following a path designed by either my teachers, lecturers, parents, or professional acquaintances. I would then use that resource and continue with the original learning path.</p><p>When I started approaching entire subjects on my own, I needed to design the learning paths myself. I discovered that it's a hard and tedious job mapping topics.</p><p>It included understanding what the broader topic is about, laying out the different subtopics, and getting an idea of which one to learn first, which next, and on. Next, I needed to find the best resources to learn from.</p><p>With the rise of online learning, I was able to deepen my understanding in many new areas. I gained access to many new courses, books, teachers, podcasts, YouTube videos, guides, and more. It was a blessing and a curse.</p><p>I enjoyed the abundance of available books, courses, podcasts, YouTube series, large and small learning platforms, and many more websites wanting to educate us. However, it was a blessing and a curse, since eventually, I needed to choose something from the variety.</p><p>Let's take a look at the google result page for the term "learn javascript":</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/2020/06/xCleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59,402x-1.png.pagespeed.ic.YN9LKTphkG.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/CleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59@2x-1.png 600w, https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/CleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59@2x-1.png 1000w, https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/xCleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59,402x-1.png.pagespeed.ic.rhznren1dl.png 1600w, https://blog.jiruto.com/content/images/size/w1748/2020/06/CleanShot-2020-06-28-at-11.52.59@2x-1.png 1748w"><figcaption>The first half of the results page for "learning javascript"</figcaption></figure><p>3.2 Billion results. Half of the first page is occupied by ads, and then start the massive list of learning resources. Videos, articles, courses, and so much more. It's easy to get lost or overwhelmed by the amount of information.</p><p>Two important things I learned, searching for excellent resources, are:</p><ol><li>Staying on the first google page is not enough.</li><li>The best resources hide in forum posts and blog articles.</li></ol><p>Scanning blogs and forums takes time, but I did it anyway because I didn't want to waste time on outdated or inferior learning resources. Too often, I felt I missed something, that I didn't do a proper outlining of the field. That I was supposed to learn something before, and that's why the difficulties right now. I call it the "I don't know what I don't know" syndrome.</p><p>Trying to take on a whole field, such a Mathematics, or CS (my main fields), became a much harder task. It became a job on its own. It introduces so much overhead with syllabus and curriculum design, ordering of topics and their subtopics, and then finding learning resources for them all.</p><hr><p>To summarize, my pains learning online are:</p><ol><li>Mapping topics</li><li>Creating a syllabus</li><li>Finding good learning resources</li><li>Ordering and organizing the resources</li></ol><p>As stated above, the best solutions often come from blogs and forums, or in other words, from the community. So social learning already happens, but it's unorganized and unmaintained.</p><p>A new forum or blog post must be created to reflect any changes:</p><ol><li>A learning resource becomes outdated</li><li>Better ones are created</li><li>More effective learning methods are introduced</li></ol><p>It's hard to scale this system up. More people now rely on e-learning, and for more complex topics as well. Its importance and demand rise, and there's a need for a structured system.</p><p>The pains and the reasons above are why I started <a href="https://jiruto.com/">Jiruto</a>: to facilitate social learning and help e-learning scale up. To design a space for all our learning needs: find resources, talk about the process, get updates on our fields of interest, and more.</p><p>The "social" in "social learning" indicates we rely on the community: The people who've already been through this path. Other learners who take it with us. Professionals on the bleeding-edge frontline, forming and adding to the field itself.</p><p>As a learner, you can browse the created paths, look for one that fits your needs. The follow it. If it's</p><p>It's only together that we'll be able to realize that goal.

                <p>A program is not a very fast pencil.</p>
<p>Software operates on different plane when compared to pen-and-paper business. It is the duty of software developer to avoid the trap of aligning software with principles of a traditional business.</p>
<p>In this article, we will describe how the fast pencil fallacy becomes reality in a common software development project. After that, we will explain how that fallacy can be avoided.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
<p>To better understand how brand-new software inadvertently becomes a fast pencil, we need to understand the process of delivering software. It all begins with the customer, probably feeling lost in the process of defining requirements – desires if you will – specifying what the future product should and should not do.</p>
<p>The customer is running a business, in a way which has remained the same for a hundred years maybe. They are using very primitive tools, quite different from the tools we use in software development. They are accustomed to using a pencil.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image1.png" alt="image1.png"></p><p>And what they ask a software developer to do, is to come up with a nice and square software to enhance the way their business is run. And indeed, developer comes up with a piece of software, which is meant to replace that traditional pen-and-paper business. That is the moment when magic happens in its least desired form, because the customer, no matter how hard they tried, will never be able to see the difference between the two, the pencil and the software.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image2.png" alt="image2.png"></p><p>They will normally see the program as a very fast pencil. They will invariantly look at the program as a fast replacement for their traditional business. And that is the problem. Modern software development practices based on accepting customer’s requirements and implementing them to the point where any distinction between software and a pencil disappears is the root cause of bad software design.</p>
<p>If you try to oversee software development today, you will see programs of all kinds working exactly the same as the pen-and-paper business they are addressing, with only one tiny distinction, and that is that software is automated to a degree. That is precisely why customers will keep seeing software as their very fast pencil.</p>
<p>Do you want to develop that? No, you don’t! But what will you do instead? How will you respond to customer’s requirements? To answer these questions, we need to return to place where it all begins: To the bare business.</p>
<p>Spoiler ahead. When developing software, we will not regard customer as the source of truth. Not everything your customer will tell is correct. We will now look at software development from a different perspective.</p>
<h2>Avoiding the Fallacy</h2>
<p>To understand how software should be developed, we will once again start from the customer, who is utterly lost with so many thoughts in their head. They have a business, that’s the fact. But that is not relevant to software development, because nobody wants to have a business. People want to have a vacation, not a business. Something else they have is of our interest instead, which remains to be discovered.</p>
<p>In software development, voyage begins with understanding that customer, who owns the business, has something else of importance. That will probably be the element you have never met in your programming life. They, customers, have the problem. They have something that is hurting them, or hurting their own customers.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image3.png" alt="image3.png"></p><p>Their entire business is built around methods of addressing that problem. That is the whole point of businesses, and the reason why it was said above that nobody wants to have a business. Customers want to solve the problem for their own customers and to make money by being successful at it.</p>
<p>Where does the software fit into this picture, then? Software comes as a representation of a solution to the problem. You would move the problem away from the customer and put software in between. That makes software a layer of abstraction between the user and the problem.</p>
<p>At this point, we are switching to term user, not customer anymore. Basically, user is the one who is using software, and customer is the one who is paying for the software to be developed. This definition may not cover all angles, but it will be sufficient to understand the explanations that follow.</p>
<p>When put that way, users will use the software, and software will abstract away that pointy thing below which is hurting them. The rule of the game is to remove the problem from user’s view, and to replace it with an abstract representation of the problem, so that software can act as an automated solution to the problem instance.</p>
<p>Finally, there comes the question of avoiding the fast pencil fallacy. You will avoid it best if you understand that software itself is of no interest to the user. What is of interest, however, is the way the user will send commands to software. That is how user is controlling the abstraction of the problem. You will need to think about how to best implement commands, then.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image4.png" alt="image4.png"></p><p>Software will ultimately produce one tiny item, and that is the only thing your user will ever care about. That is the output, the product of applying software.</p>
<p>In effect, the user will only be concerned with giving commands to software and collecting the result. And even those commands will be of little concern, with that result of applying software remaining the only thing that is useful to the user. Software is not important. Problem is not important. Output is the only thing that counts.</p>
<p>Software developer will effectively switch to thinking how to let somebody apply the program to produce output. In that way, all that lies below a very thin line under the user interface becomes the developer’s own problem, rather than being the customer’s problem. The customer will see none of the elements below the surface and they will forever remain the software developer’s domain of business.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image5.png" alt="image5.png"></p><h2>Software as a Useful Tool</h2>
<p>From a broader perspective, to develop a working software means to develop the inner parts in such way that outer parts, the user interface, can operate and let the user produce the desired output.</p>
<p>All business processes remain the duty of the software to perform. Software will not expect the user to navigate through processes and effectively run them manually. Instead, software will expect the user to fill in the required information so that the processes can be executed on their own.</p>
<p>If you were successful doing that, your software will not be a very fast pencil. It will turn the tables and do the right thing (whatever that is) to solve the problem for the user.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we have shed light on one of the most prominent issues in software development – the problem of understanding what customer needs, as opposed to accepting what the customer is asking for.</p>
<p>When we scratch under the surface, we find great uncertainty in customers’ views, which comes from misunderstanding the role of software, and the working principles of machines if you like.</p>
<p>Customers need guidance to the realm of software. Developers need to interview customers to understand the problem the business is solving, not just the current working principles of the business itself.</p>
<p>Once understanding of the problem is established, the duty of software developer is to produce abstract model of the problem and implement processes upon it. The result should be the software product, which is performing business processes in fully automated fashion, so that the user doesn’t have to perform them manually.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the bait of this inflammatory and simplistic title. I promise you that the rest of the article will be more reasoned and nuanced.</p><p><strong><i>In summary:</i></strong> for far-ranging data attributes, such as database columns and API fields, <strong>I recommend namespacing keys using 'snake case', contrary to the current Clojure convention of using 'lisp-case' (for example: favour <code>:myapp_user_first_name</code> over <code>:myapp.user/first-name</code>)</strong>, because the portability benefits of the former notation outweigh whatever affordances Clojure provides for the latter. This is an instance of trading local conveniences for system-wide benefits.</p><p>You may already be convinced at this point, in which case the rest of this article will be of little value to you. Otherwise, I want to provoke you to go through the following mental process:</p><ol><li><strong>Consider <code>:namespacing_keys_in_snake_case</code> for data attributes</strong> in Clojure, rather than the conventional <code>:namespacing.keys/in-lisp-case</code>.</li><li><strong>Get angry</strong>, because that's disgusting to any self-respecting Clojure-bred programmer.</li><li>Recognize that you're angry because you've got <strong>attached to an arbitrary convention,</strong> and superficial ergonomics around it.</li><li>Optional: try to bargain with reality, by attempting to find some hacky mechanisms to keep both notations around. Realize that it's not satisfactory.</li><li>Give up, be at peace, and reap the benefits of designing your programs <strong>system-first rather than language-first</strong>.</li></ol><p>I went slowly through this process myself, with some maintenance pains in the way, which hopefully this article can spare you.</p><h2 id="the_great_benefits_of_namespaced_keys">The great benefits of namespaced keys</h2><p>First, it's worth emphasizing that <strong>the naming of data attributes is an important issue, however innocuous it may feel.</strong> Data attributes such as database columns or API fields are not only the bread and butter of our code, they're also some of the strongest commitments we make when growing an information system, often stronger that the choice of programming language. Once a data attribute is part of the contract between several components the system, it becomes very hard to change. This is true even of small systems such as web or mobile apps.</p><p>In recent years, Clojure has encouraged the programming convention of conveying data using <i>namespaced</i> keys, e.g using <code>:myapp.user/id</code> rather than just <code>:id</code>. Namespacing is great, because by reducing the potential for name collisions, it eliminates a lot of ambiguity about names.</p><p>The <strong>significant benefits</strong> of this approach are:</p><ol><li><strong>context-free readability:</strong> when you see <code>:myapp.user/id</code> in your code, thanks to the <code>myapp.user</code> part, you can tell immediately what kind of data it conveys, and what type of entity it operates on. If you just saw <code>:id</code>, you'd have to figure that out from context.</li><li><strong>data traceability:</strong> with a simple text search in the code, you can immediately follow all the places where this piece of data is used across your entire system, whatever the language used at each place. This basic ability is significantly helpful for maintenability. I think many developers don't realize how big a difference it makes.</li></ol><p>Observe that these benefits apply regardless of the choice of namespacing notation: you would reap them whether you write <code>:myapp.user/id</code>, <code>:myapp-user-id</code>, <code>:myappUserId</code> or <code>:myapp_user_id</code>. <strong>It does not matter which namespacing notation you choose, as long as you use it everywhere.</strong></p><p>In other languages, programmers have traditionally relied on type systems to remove such ambiguity. Type systems are not as good for this purpose, because they don't reach beyond language boundaries.</p><p>Clojure's specific convention also offers some comparatively <strong>insignificant benefits:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>prettiness:</strong> <i>"look at <code>:myapp.user/first-name</code>, it's so beautiful! I can use slashes and dashes in programmatic names, this is THE POWER OF LISP!"</i></li><li><strong>concision affordances:</strong> in Clojure code, using namespace aliases, you can write <code>::user/first-name</code> as a shorthand for <code>:myapp.user/first-name</code>. Big deal. I mean, I can relate to how pleasing this feels when coding, but again, please consider that thinking of the whole system may be more important than this sort of local preferences.</li></ul><h2 id="advantages_of_'snake_case':_portability_and_ubiquity">Advantages of 'snake case': portability and ubiquity</h2><p>In a real-world system, data attributes are bound to travel through many media: SQL columns, ElasticSearch fields, GraphQL fields, JSON documents... if the system involves other languages as Clojure, they may be represented as class members. As mentioned above, using the same name - spelled in <i>exactly</i> the same way - for the data attribute in all these representations is a precious thing, because you can trace it across your codebase with one basic text search. You can track its usage not only in Clojure code, but also in SQL queries, ElasticSearch queries, JavaScript client code, etc.</p><p>Clojure's conventional notation for keys (e.g <code>myapp.person/first-name</code>), <strong>a.k.a lisp-case, is portable to almost none of these other platforms:</strong> it's not suitable for SQL column names, nor for GraphQL field names, nor for ElasticSearch fields, nor for Java/Python class members... Some people have argued that in those systems you should just drop the entity-name part (<code>myapp.person</code>), as it will be represented in another construct such as the SQL table name, but that's generally misguided IMO, because you're back to having to disambiguate meaning from context, and you're making the fragile assumption that colocated keys should always have the same entity-name part (think e.g of <code>:myapp.person/name</code> and <code>myapp.admin/password</code>).</p><p>On the other hand, as far as I can tell, <strong>it's hard to come by a platform that does not support <code>snake_case</code>.</strong> Using it may not always be idiomatic, but it's almost always supported. That's reason enough to make snake_case a better default, because having one ubiquitous notation is much preferrable to having many locally idiomatic ones.</p><h2 id="frequent_objections">Frequent objections</h2><h3 id="'this_is_not_idiomatic_clojure'">'This is not idiomatic Clojure'</h3><p>Arguably, your programs have more important requirements than being idiomatic. Programming history is riddled with bad design decisions made in the name of being idiomatic. Anyone who's worked through a nasty Scala class hierarchy knows how much incidental complexity some programmers are willing to inflict upon themselves for the sake of being idiomatic (<i>"because it's SO much better to write <code>subject.verb(complement)</code> than <code>verb(subject, complement)</code>. It's more idiomatic, you see."</i>). Let's avoid doing that to your program, or the Clojure ecosystem.</p><h3 id="'the_lisp-case_convention_lets_me_destructure_keywords'">'The lisp-case convention lets me destructure keywords'</h3><p><i>I like the ability of destructuring my keywords into an entity-name part and an attribute part, for instance:</i></p><pre><code>(namespace :myapp.user/first-name)
=&gt; "myapp.user"

(name :myapp.user/first-name)
=&gt; "first-name"
</code></pre><p><i>I can leverage that to manipulate my data attributes generically in my programs.</i></p><p>Don't do that. Don't treat Clojure keywords as composite data structures. This is accidental complexity waiting to happen. Programmatic names are meant for humans to read, not for programs to interpret. Changing an attribute name should not be able to change the behaviour of your program. In Hickeyian terms: you'd be complecting naming with structure.</p><p>As a basic example of how this may break, consider that it's normal and expected to find in the same entity keys with different namespaces, e.g <code>:person/first-name</code> and <code>:myapp.user/signup-date</code>. If you have a SQL database, there's a high chance that you need both attributes as columns of the same table (1): yet the default behaviour of a namespace-aware tool like <a href="https://cljdoc.org/d/seancorfield/next.jdbc/1.1.547/doc/readme"><code>next.jdbc</code></a> is to constrain both keywords to have the same namespace, which would be problematic in this case, and may be viewed as revealing a complecting of attribute naming and storage layout (2).</p><p><i>Notes:</i></p><ul><li><i>(1) Yes, I know about SQL tables normalization... and that you can do too much of it.</i></li><li><i>(2) Don't worry, that won't prevent you from using <code>next.jdbc</code>: this default behaviour is easily opted out of.</i></li></ul><h3 id="'but_clojure.spec_encourages_the_use_of_clojure-namespaced_keywords!'">'But clojure.spec encourages the use of Clojure-namespaced keywords!'</h3><p>Yeah... I know. In a way, Clojure Spec does what I've told you not to do in the previous section: relying programmatically on a naming convention for keywords, as Spec expects the keys you register to be Clojure-namespaced. Pushing further in that direction would be, in my opinion, a design error of clojure.spec.</p><p>That said, clojure.spec does quite sensibly make room for other namespacing conventions (via <code>:req-un</code> and <code>:opt-un</code>), and so clojure.spec is compatible with the recommendation this article is making. The semantics of Clojure Spec would be completely broken if name collisions were allowed, and so it's understandable that it's decided to check for namespacing.</p><h3 id="'this_will_create_inconsistencies_in_our_code_style'">'This will create inconsistencies in our code style'</h3><p><strong>What might worry you:</strong> some parts of your code might be forced to use keywords in lisp-case - for instance, because libraries like Integrant impose them on you. Having these keys in lisp-case and other in snake_case might be disturbing.</p><p>If that's troubling you, you're in for a pleasant surprise: the visual constrast between <code>snake_case</code> and <code>lisp-case</code> actually makes the code <i>more</i> readable, because it's signals which keys are meant for local use and which are meant to travel across the system.</p><p>By the way, you have already seen an instance of readability enhanced by contrasted notation: in Clojure's syntax itself, where parens <code>(... )</code> are used to denote invocations, and square brackets <code>[... ]</code> are used to denote lexical bindings, departing from the Lisp tradition of using …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>This is a (very late) reply to Patrick McKenzie's "<a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice</a>". I find much of his advice very sensible, and it might be very helpful to someone in the beginning of their career – assuming they can act upon it (and I really don't know whether my 20-year-old self could actually use the advice to improve his negotiation skills, for example).</p>
<p>A few things in the article I disagree with, however. Here I'll mostly focus on those few things, recommending you to read the original article so that you don't miss the rest of it.</p>
<p>"Disagree" is not necessarily the right word – a more precise way to put it would be "it's different in my experience". Which is to be expected because both of us are speaking based on our own careers, which have been rather different. Patrick McKenzie is a small business owner running <a href="http://www.bingocardcreator.com/">Bingo Card Creator</a> and a successful consultant. I'm a lead chip architect at a billion-dollar company. Both of us have thus traveled some distance away from "purely programming" (whatever that means), but in rather different directions.</p>
<p><strong>What company are you going to work for?<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Patrick McKenzie says 90% of the jobs involve things like implementing an internal travel expense reporting form, rather than a product shipped to external customers. He advises you to get used to the idea, even though such software is "soul-crushingly boring" as he puts it.</p>
<p>How bad is it, and is it really 90% of the jobs? Spolsky <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/04.html">thinks</a> it's maybe 80% – and that it's bad enough to "drain the life out of you". He goes on to elaborate why it "sucks to be an in-house programmer":</p>
<ul>
<li>There's rarely a business reason to improve in-house software past the point of "barely good enough". "Forget any pride of craftsmanship – you're going to churn out embarrassing junk".</li>
<li>At software companies, what you do is more directly related to the way the company makes money, so you're more likely to be respected. "A programmer is never going to rise to become CEO of Viacom, but you might well rise to become CEO of a tech company." "…no matter how critical it was for Viacom to get this internet thing  right, when it came time to assign people to desks, the in-house  programmers were stuck with 3 people per cubicle in a dark part of the  office".</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that McKenzie and Spolsky are in almost complete agreement over these points. But then Spolsky says you should be gunning for a position in a software company – the environment where creatures of your kind naturally thrive. Conversely, McKenzie explains how to prosper as a programmer outside software companies – <em>moving in the opposite direction of where things go by default</em> (being stuck in a dark part of the office while they're trying to outsource your job.)</p>
<p>So the question is which path you prefer. "Not so fast", you say: one of these jobs is way easier to land – 80-90% of the chances are you're not getting inside a software company – so it's not just a question of preference.</p>
<p>Here I disagree: even if only 10-20% of programmers work in software companies (where are the stats?..), and even if they're "the best" (according to what metric?), McKenzie himself says in that same article:</p>
<blockquote><p>You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with:&nbsp; Many people already successfully employed as senior engineers cannot actually implement FizzBuzz.</p></blockquote>
<p>But if competition is relatively unskilled on average, you probably can land a job in the 10-20% of the sector that you want – as did most people who graduated around the time I did. So I rather firmly believe that it's a matter of choice: do you <em>want</em> to work on in-house software or one-off businessy projects of that kind, or do you prefer a software company?</p>
<p>Let's proceed to McKenzie's advice to in-house programmers – which should in itself help one make that choice.</p>
<p><strong>How to call yourself<br>
</strong></p>
<p>One such advice is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don't call yourself a programmer. “Programmer” sounds like “anomalously high-cost peon who types some mumbo-jumbo into some other mumbo-jumbo.” Instead, describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previous employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure – an in-house programmer is likely doing some type of expensive mumbo-jumbo in the eyes of his non-technical MBA-wielding manager.</p>
<p>To me, however, a programmer is who I'm looking for, while a resume full of revenue increases and cost reductions sounds like an "anomalously high-cost parasite who types some mumbo-jumbo into Excel and PowerPoint, claiming credit for others' work".</p>
<p>McKenzie says a software company looks at this just like a company hiring internal programmers, essentially. His example is "the guy who wrote the backend billing code that 97% of Google’s revenue passes through – he’s now an angel investor". The guy apparently got rich by being near a "profit center" rather than through his unusual skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, in this case I believe he's talking about <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/">Ron Garret</a>, the PhD from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Do you think they hired him because he described his work at the JPL in terms of revenues and costs? (BTW he didn't like working on the billing code, bought his stock options and quit, instead of choosing a career at the company's biggest "profit center".)</p>
<p>Did any unusual skills go into the billing code? Ron Garret <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/xooglers.html">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I did end up writing the credit card billing and accounting system, which is a nontrivial thing to get right. Fortunately for me, just before coming to Google I had taken some time to study computer security and cryptography, so I was actually well prepared for that particular task. …I designed the billing system to be secure against even a dishonest employee with root access (which is not such an easy thing to do). I have no idea if they are still using my system, but if they are then I'd feel pretty confident that my credit card number was not going to get stolen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds to me that his technical knowledge and programming ability was the bulk of his contribution, whereas deep thoughts such as realizing that there will be some "cost reduction" due to not having credit card numbers stolen is not something an employer needs to hire anyone for.</p>
<p>So if I ever send out a resume as a chip architect, I will focus on my technical role in transitioning from fixed-function hardware accelerators to programmable processors, more than the manpower this saved and the business we won as a result (which I think were real outcomes of our work, but which is rather hard to quantify – as these things often are unless you're a business-friendly-sounding liar.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm not sure <em>when </em>I'll send out that resume, which brings us to the next point.</p>
<p><strong>On job hopping, backstabbing, and the lack thereof </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Co-workers and bosses are not usually your friends: You will spend a lot of time with co-workers.&nbsp; You may eventually become close friends with some of them, but in general, you will move on in three years…</p>
<p>&lt;your boss will&gt; attempt to do things that none of your actual friends would ever do,  like try to talk you down several thousand dollars in salary or  guilt-trip you into spending more time with the company when you could  be spending time with your actual friends. &nbsp;You will have other  coworkers who — affably and ethically — will suggest things which go  against your interests…</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a certain internal consistency to a view that your coworkers are not your friends, because you will move on in 3 years. In fact, it's a bit circular. They aren't your friends – because you'll move on. And why will you move on? Well, I dunno, maybe for a 10% salary increase. What's there to lose? Relationships with coworkers? But coworkers aren't your friends!</p>
<p>Again, I don't disagree, but rather offer an alternative view, equally internally consistent. I have stayed at one job for more than a decade, in large part because I'm rather attached to the people I work with. To be sure, I got raises, and I was ready to quit over employment terms – but it'd take much more than 10%.</p>
<p>Isn't it just a quantitative difference in preferences – a 10% raise not being fundamentally different than, say, 100%? Well, sufficiently large quantitative changes add up to qualitative changes, as Marxian dialectics or some other Soviet philosophy thingie that my parents sometimes quote taught us. What's going on is that both approaches can lead to career advancement, but they do so very differently.</p>
<p>If you're willing to change jobs over a small raise, you'll be changing them frequently. You won't get attached to people, or to the work you're doing together. You will be very good at finding jobs and you will know what's generally going on in the industry and what's in demand. You will <em>not </em>know that many things specific to any of your employers. <em>You and your employer will become very useful to each other fairly quickly, but you'll also be somewhat expendable for each other.</em></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can keep a job as long as it's a fun environment, requiring a significant raise once in a while. Your relationships with people combined with your long-term outlook can let you do things together that you otherwise couldn't plan or execute, and learn things you wouldn't have learned.</p>
<p>Much of my knowledge about chip design comes from ASIC hackers I worked with, and their willingness to develop their biggest ideas together with me came from trust that necessarily took time to build. It takes time to learn that none of you is in the habit of "suggesting things going against the other's interest", or pulling other unfriendly shenanigans.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you stay at one place for a long while, then your worth to the employer grows to the point where you can get the significant raise that you'd quit over without actually quitting. Your worth can also grow well above what employers are willing to pay to experienced new hires, so there's no longer a point in switching jobs. This is somewhat analogous to becoming a consultant after having switched a …</p></div></div>

    <p>Ubuntu LTS is always lagging behind in newer releases of software, for stability reason, though it’s not always true, because one of the most stable Linux distribution Red Hat has reported kernel security issues which was already fixed 17 months prior. Anyway, to have software updated, Snap is a good choice and preinstalled in all recent Ubuntu releases, and I loved it before I knew how exactly it works.</p>

<p>Snap is a sandbox environment for software, where program is bundled by the developer all together into a single platform independent package, which can run in all systems with <code>snapd</code> installed. Then many problems occur, generally performance related, snap daemon constantly causes high resource usage and slow down my system, and whenever I shutdown or reboot the system, snap always block there to stop something for minutes.</p>

<p>Another serious problem for me is input method engine, because the Snap sandbox isolates the program with host so that it can’t access the host environment. I use fcitx a lot, so when I run VS Code from snap, I was not able to input Chinese, until then I searched around and realized how does snap work. And I even found another sandbox Flatpak, gave it a try but unfortunately fcitx didn’t work neither. So I removed all those sandboxes.</p>

<p>The first step is reboot your system, because without that snap may block you from removing packages. Then do a <code>snap list</code> to get all the packages installed, and remove them.</p>

<p><img src="https://vec.io/images/2020/06/29/snap-list.png" alt="snap"></p>

<p>Looks scary, huh? Yes they have <code>core</code> installed, and you may also have <code>gnome-3-34</code> or <code>gtk-common-themes</code>, all seems something you should not remove, otherwise they would break your system. However I did remove all of them with <code>sudo snap remove core18</code> and blah blah.</p>

<p>After all of them removed, I purged the snapd package by <code>sudo apt purge snapd</code> and made a system reboot.</p>

<p>All good, and shutdown is never stuck.</p>

    </span></p><h2 id="background"><a href="#background" aria-label="background permalink"></a>Background</h2><p>While working on a big project where multiple teams merge their feature branches frequently into a <span title="Click to find out more">release Git branch</span>, developers often run into situations where they find that some of their work have been either removed, modified or affected by someone else's work accidentally. It can happen in smaller teams as well. Two features could have been working perfectly fine until they got merged together and broke something. That's a highly possible case. There are many other cases which could cause such hard to understand and subtle bugs which even continuous integration (CI) systems running the entire test suite of our projects couldn't catch.</p><p>We are not going to discuss how such subtle bugs can get into our release branch because that's just a wild territory out there. Instead, we can definitely discuss about how to find a commit that deviated an expected outcome of a certain feature. The deviation could be any behaviour of our code that we can measure distinctively — either good or bad in general.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Examples of deviations</th><th>Measurement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A commit that introduced a bug or a regression</td><td><code>Good</code> or <code>Bad</code></td></tr><tr><td>A commit that changed the code style</td><td><code>New</code> or <code>Old</code></td></tr><tr><td>A commit caused a benchmark's performance</td><td><code>Fast</code> or <code>Slow</code></td></tr><tr><td>A commit that fixed a bug</td><td><code>Fixed</code> or <code>Broken</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Finding the exact point where it changed the course of our code base in terms of either of such deviations could be difficult to trace down and involves a lot of efforts if we have to do it manually.</p><h2 id="a-common-problem"><a href="#a-common-problem" aria-label="a common problem permalink"></a>A common problem</h2><p>Let's assume an example.</p><p>We are looking for a commit that broke something in our shipment feature which was working perfectly fine until the last release. We had tagged that release commit with <code>v12.1.0-rc4</code>. We also have a few tests in our test suite that can help us identify whether that commit is good or bad. Then just recently, some teams merged their feature branches that introduced about close to hundred of commits into our release branch. That's a normal practice in our project assuming we have a bunch of teams working on different feature branches constantly. Then suddenly our CI service reports a red build for the tests run on the latest release branch. CI marked that build as failed since it found that the tests related to the shipment feature were failing. That's very unfortunate and all teams are worried now. But why everyone has to worry? Because everyone have to start with the code in the release branch as the base code and build features atop meaning they would get same test failures in their feature branches, too and won't be able to merge that without a succsessful build on CI. Such a cascaded effect slows down the overall progress and morale of the teams, right?!</p><div>

  </div></div><p>Because we are the team responisble for the shipment feature, we need to fix those failing tests in the release branch. But everyone in our team is pretty sure that it's not our fault because the overall shipment feature was working until we released <code>v12.1.0-rc4</code>. But anyway we need to triage and fix it, right? So we start with the <code>HEAD</code> commit in the latest release branch. We confirm that the shipment feature breaks on it by running our test suite. Then we keep checking out to each of the previous commits in the Git history until we find a commit where our test suite passes. In a worst case scenario, that succsessful commit could be the one which is tagged with <code>v12.1.0-rc4</code> — meaning we have to checkout to about hundred commits one-by-one to find a good commit. The commit made just after that <strong>good commit</strong> in the commit history tree is what we can refer a <strong>bad commit</strong>.</p><p>If we take such a route, we would end up spending unimaginable hours (or days) chasing down a bad commit. That's definitely not an ideal solution.</p><h2 id="a-bunch-of-solutions"><a href="#a-bunch-of-solutions" aria-label="a bunch of solutions permalink"></a>A bunch of solutions!</h2><p>So what options do we have?</p><ul><li><strong>Option 1</strong>: We can equally divide the commits between a well known good commit and a bad commit among the team members and manually checkout to each commit accordingly to reduce the overall efforts. This excercise suits that popular saying, <em>work as a team!</em></li><li><strong>Option 2</strong>: <code>The Nerd John</code> in our team has a clever idea to implement a fancy tool that would utilize a  binary search algorithm that automatically keeps dividing the commits equally by running the test suite until it finds a commit which was the first bad commit in the commit history. We all know, John's so nerdy!</li><li><strong>Option 3</strong>: Use a readymade tool <code>git bisect</code> which comes built-in with <code>git</code> that <code>The Nerd John</code> could have been end up building — but only in its half-baked form.</li></ul><h2 id="git-bisect-a-good-solution"><a href="#git-bisect-a-good-solution" aria-label="git bisect a good solution permalink"></a>git bisect: a good solution</h2><p>The <code>git bisect</code> command uses an efficient binary search algorithm to help us find a commit that we are looking for. It requires us to specify a bad commit and at least a good commit (can specify many good commits though to further narrow down the search). It then keeps <strong><span title="Click to find out more">bisecting</span></strong> the commits between the specified bad and good commits until it finds the first commit in the commit history that caused the <span title="Click to find out more">deviation</span>.</p><p>The <code>git bisect</code> command can run in either manual (interactive) mode or in a fully automated mode. Before each iteration, bisect needs to know whether the given commit is a bad commit or a good commit.</p><div>

      <p><time datetime="2020-06-27 00:00:00 +0000">27 Jun 2020</time></p><p>Having your application produce the right amount and quality of logs will help you debug faster, optimize better and keep your data safe and secure. I was always fascinated with logging and tried to figure out the best ways to log and create telemetry for my applications.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to work with multiple startups, I came into close contact with all of Node.js’ major logging packages. Lately, I had the luck to work with highly security aware businesses, for whom security is an existential threat. When tasked with the challenge of creating secure applications for them, I knew without hesitation that I had to create a new library to meet all the new requirements that were at play.</p>

<p>I want to introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a>, a versatile and powerful logger for Node.js.</p>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/planning.jpg" alt="Logging Flow"></p>

<h2 id="the-logging-requirements">The Logging Requirements</h2>

<p>These are the logging requirements that were on the drawing board when Logality was first implemented. I could find some of them in some packages, but not all of them in one package:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#a-common-logging-schema"><strong>Complete Flexibility on Properties</strong></a>. In order for my organization to have a common logging schema, it is required of the logging library to allow the definition of properties from scratch. A lot of the packages make those decisions for you leaving you with no options to normalize the logging schema. The most common example for this is the date field, you can find it as <code>dt</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>timestamp</code> or any other variance, without any option to change the name.</li>
  <li><a href="#serializers-of-data-objects"><strong>Serializers of Data Objects</strong></a>. As <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> is primarily a JSON logger, dealing with data is the most common operation. Being able to serialize known data structures is key in this case. Just drop your user data object to logality and the built-in or your custom serializer will make sure to transform the object so only what you want will be logged.</li>
  <li><a href="#custom-output-and-pretty-print"><strong>Support Custom Outputs</strong></a>. Logality’s Default output is JSON but the library should not limit you as to the kind of output you want, for instance print human readable logs while on development. Custom outputs also allow you to filter log messages so you can suppress dynamically certain types or log levels of messages.</li>
  <li><a href="#logging-metadata"><strong>Logging Metadata</strong></a>. Have the logger automatically log the location of the file that the log originated from. As well as other useful system information (OS version, runtime info, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="#the-power-of-middleware"><strong>Middleware Support</strong></a>. Supporting middleware is a very powerful way to transform and augment each one of your log messages. The options that this feature opens up are endless.</li>
  <li><a href="#linking-multiple-logality-instances"><strong>Logging for Libraries</strong></a>. All open source contributors must have faced this challenge at least once: How do I output logs from my library? This is no easy task, Logality provides an eloquent and powerful solution to this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these requirements in place, <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> was created on May 18, 2018. Ever since then the library has been iteratively improving and bug fixed. Today, the current Version is 3.0.0, which was released on April of 2020. In the following sections, we will go through a more detailed analysis of the features and powerful capabilities of Logality.</p>

<h2 id="a-common-logging-schema">A Common Logging Schema</h2>

<p>The more standardized your log messages are, the easier it will be to query, parse and subsequently analyze them. Consequently, your log messages need to have a schema. As we all know, the most ubiquitous format for text based serialization today, is JSON.</p>

<p>Logality is a JSON logger that provides an initial recommendation of a logging schema but allows you to define your own schemas down to the last property.</p>

<p>This is a very important feature. When you are trying to have a common logging schema across multiple operating systems, platforms and programming languages, it is essential that your tooling allows you to be flexible and versatile.</p>

<p>Schema mutation in Logality happens through <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> and <a href="#serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers</a>, both of which we touch on below.</p>



<p>Logality will take care of all your metadata needs so you won’t need to log any additional information. In particular, Logality will automatically resolve and log for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The location of the file where the log originated from.</li>
  <li>The hostname of the machine that runs the application.</li>
  <li>The process id.</li>
  <li>The process name.</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple <code>log.info('hello world')</code> log will produce the following log message (expanded):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"severity"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"level"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"info"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"dt"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2018-05-18T16:25:57.815Z"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"message"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello world"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"event"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"context"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"runtime"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"application"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"testLogality"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"source"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>"file_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/test/spec/surface.test.js"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"system"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"hostname"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"localhost"</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"pid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>36255</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"process_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"node ."</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the use of <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> you can create and attach your own metadata on each one of your log messages.</p>

<h2 id="serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers of Data Objects</h2>

<p>As standardization of logging data is a primary requirement for Logality, serializers were introduced to solve the problem of consistently logging known data objects.</p>

<p>Let’s take for example the User Data Object (UDO) and the action of logging in, you could log the event as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>`User </span><span>${</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>}</span><span> logged in`</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But that is not a JSON log message, that is a string log message and it is not easily query-able. Let’s try this again with Logality’s JSON logging feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>User logged in</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>user</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we passed the UDO to logality, however, Logality has no instruction of what portions of the UDO we want logged and here is where serializers come in. Serializers are simple functions that take the objects that you pass as input and output the properties that you want to have logged.</p>

<p>This way, you standardize how your models are logged across your infrastructure and protect your system from logging sensitive fields like a user’s password or unnecessary information like meta data of a product.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-middleware">The Power of Middleware</h2>

<p>Logality introduces middleware which allows you to manipulate and mutate the logging messages as you see fit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>((</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Remove user data object from logging</span>
    <span>delete</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>user</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Add debugging flag on all messages</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>debug</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Middleware, you can create powerful data flows, augmenting log messages as they come in with rich metadata information collected from the environment and runtime.</p>

<p>You can also have conditional transformations of the data that pass through logality for absolute control over the data flows and your compliance requirements.</p>

<h2 id="linking-multiple-logality-instances">Linking Multiple Logality Instances</h2>

<p>As an open source contributor, one of the biggest problems I have been challenged with is how to log on open source libraries. If you want to have logging on your library you are challenged with quite a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide an option to turn off logging.</li>
  <li>Provide a way to filter the logging level.</li>
  <li>How do you format the logs according to your downstream application’s standards?</li>
  <li>Should you log to stdout, an event or a function?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are very challenging problems, to the point where no practical solution exists. Until today that is, as Logality introduces piping. You can pipe one Logality instance into another and have all the middleware functions handle the piped logality’s log messages. When Logality is piped, the log messages get passed as pure data objects so that the downstream consuming function can properly parse and manipulate them.</p>

<p>This is huge as it enables your application to granularly control how much information is logged from the libraries you are using. And at the same time have your third-party libraries log in the exact same format-schema that your entire infrastructure is logging. Isn’t that great?</p>

<p>Piping happens simply by providing the child Logality instance to the parent’s <code>pipe()</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>thirdPartyLibrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>thirdparty</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>applicationLogality</span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>thirdPartyLibrary</span><span>.</span><span>logality</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="custom-output-and-pretty-print">Custom Output and Pretty Print</h2>

<p>Finally, after all the processing the log message has gone through, you can control how the final serialization and output is handled. By default Logality will JSON serialize and output to stdout but you may have other plans.</p>

<p>This operation also enables you to filter certain log messages based on your custom criteria. This is particularly useful when managing multiple log streams from various upstreams (third-party libraries) that are piping their logs to your main application Logality logger.</p>

<p>Logality also offers a built-in pretty print functionality that, as the word suggests, will print the log messages in a human readable format, with nice colors, emojis and all. This is particularly useful when you are developing the application and don’t want to see JSON serialized log messages.</p>

<h3 id="outline-of-logalitys-lifecycle-and-piping">Outline of Logality’s Lifecycle and Piping</h3>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/logality-lifecycle-outline.svg" alt="Logality Lifecycle Outline"></p>

<h2 id="synchronous-or-asynchronous">Synchronous or Asynchronous?</h2>

<p>With a flick of a switch you can have Logality become asynchronous and reveal its Promise API. When in async mode, Logality’s Middleware and Custom Output functions will be able to handle a promise and allow you to capture log messages en-route.</p>

<p>Say you want to push all log messages to a queue, or for any reason, you want to store some, or all, of the log messages into your database. By enabling async mode on Logality you can easily and safely perform those tasks:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Security middleware for logality, store the log message</span>
<span>// in our database as well and send it to our queue for</span>
<span>// further processing and alerting</span>
<span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>security</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>// login failed, log it</span>
<span>await</span> <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>warn</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Login Failed</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>security</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you rightfully observed, when async mode is enabled Logality’s logging is, well, async, and thus returns a promise that needs to be resolved. Therefore, that is why you see the <code>await</code> before the <code>log.warn()</code> invocation.</p>

<p>Personally, my use case for using async mode and secondary data stores <a href="https://srop.co/" title="SROP The Secure Drop">at SROP</a> was for auditing log trails. When an audit log event occurred, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		    
<p>Before moving to the suburbs, I had been living in NYC for 12+ years, so my skills with a set of tools aren’t extensive. There are lots of problems I could <em>eventually</em> fix with significant time and money invested into projects, as I do like my projects to tinker with, but I don’t have infinite resources to do all the things. That’s why I’ve got a handyman I call up, as everyone should.</p>



<p>My handyman is Roger, a now semi-retired civil engineer and MIT grad. His visits entwine a blessing of knowledge around an otherwise potentially disastrous event – roof tiles flying off, an oven subtly leaking gas, or what has become an annual occurrence where some form of plumbing threatens to flood my house. I take a crack at it and when my pridefulness is eclipsed by the existential threat of my living space facing certain doom, I give him a call.</p>



<p>“And you’d think this would all be standardized, but it’s not! It’s like cmon, why can’t you just get this all straight!?” he laughs as he rips apart my sink. He pulls out a pair of pump pliers and sets to work as another faucet piece pops off. I solemnly nod, taking in how to deconstruct/reconstruct the bathroom should the need arise again. It will, naturally. My house seems to break down every other week.</p>



<p>His approach to home repair tickles those same parts of my brain as does software engineering. A lack of standardization? I get that. He remarks how houses don’t come with an owner’s manual. Wouldn’t it be nice if companies did too. Shouldn’t I know <em>everything</em> about the place? I live here, after all. Yet here I am, the resident (if you can excuse the pun) expert, deferring to his expertise.</p>



<p>“Just make sure you cover the drain when taking out the screws. You know how I know to do that? Because I’ve dropped them down there enough times”. He knows how to approach problems because, as he says, he’s seen the same six or eight versions of it before. He hasn’t honed his skills on work perfectly crafted from the start, but from seeing the gaps evolve from imperfect planning. Remarking on sealing the corners of the tub, he notes the walls shifting as joints meet and separate through varying temperature changes. A seemingly static house itself is constantly in flux, much like our working environments.</p>



<p>Then he stands up straight and waves at me a hereto unknown part of my sink. “You know what this is?” I naturally answer in the negative. “Neither do I. Time to go see my guy at the plumbing store. <em>He’s</em> the guy who’s seen everything and done everything, the XK-587 or whatever here. Doesn’t matter what I bring in, he knows exactly what to do.”</p>



<p>My expert has <em>his own expert</em> when he doesn’t know something. The guy who’s “seen and done it all” still has someone he rings up, because that’s what experts do, sourcing from upstream and relaying that information back down to another node on the graph. If I’m lucky, I’ll retain enough information to use or maybe even pass along to someone else.</p>



<p>Which brings us back to software engineering. We’re always so surprised when the expert manages to jump to the right config, flip a switch, and set the machine back in order. We assume it’s innate talent, some magic imbued that resides only within them and goes no further. I’m deeply appreciative of expertise, but we hold too many folks up on pedestals, when in truth they have their own gurus who they rely upon. They remember their screws dropped down the drain and ask their authority in plumbing, combined into charting a best path forward.</p>



<p>A few thoughts and questions arise from all of this:</p>



<ul><li>How do we go about observing the near infinite number of changes around us, filtering down to what we’ll need “someday”?</li><li>If experts have their own experts, we as professionals need to develop a system of interconnected people capable of adapting to the unknown failures we experience in both a local and global focus. Machines need people and people need people.</li><li>That interconnected network then, in its collaboration, needs to have self awareness of what skills need to be honed and how we go about distributing that skill. The shared knowledge isn’t just how to fix but meta information about that ability.</li><li>We talk often of avoiding as many failures as we can, but which are the failures we’re ok with <em>and how are we seeking them out?</em> Put another way, we need to experience a few screws dropped down the drain to learn but developing an understanding of which pain points we can reasonably withstand takes experience as well.</li><li>Where does the balance lie in letting our non-experts take over to return the system to a stable state, potentially educating the next batch of specialists? We emphasize the importance of learning from incidents as experiences after the fact, but generally regard the chance to educate during an incident as “too costly”.</li><li>How are we making continual efforts to prepare for these failures – to be ready to resolve them, to retain information during, and perhaps most importantly pass that information along afterwards? Relying solely upon experts with no additional knowledge sharing is itself a brittleness that exists within a system.</li></ul>



<p>Eventually, Roger returns from talking with his expert and immediately passes to me a replacement part. Sure enough, the gears inside don’t show the same wear and tear. My bathroom is still in pieces, but they’re all there and I’ve seen enough to finish up. “Until next time!” he knowingly laughs. Because of course there will be another disaster. Here’s hoping I’ll be a little more prepared for it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Cross-compiling self-contained Java desktop application launchers.</p><h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2><p>Java’s promise of <em>write once, run anywhere</em> still resonates with me, perhaps because I cut my teeth on JDK 1.0.2b. It was amazing to write cross-platform networking applications without concern for variations in POSIX implementations, or having to worry about nuances between C compilers, or even needing to grok <code>htons</code>. Someone else could wrestle with <code>#ifdef</code>s, shielding others by high-level, standard abstractions. Although Smalltalk had concocted platform-independence punch in 1983, it wasn’t until 1996 that Java’s virtual machine (VM) and subsequent OEM distributions made drinking the mantra of cross-platform development an easy reality.</p><p>Strategically—and selfishly—Microsoft smote that future with a sledgehammer: it moved to <em>embrace and extend</em> Java to achieve vendor lock-in, splintering the platform.</p><p>Developers can no longer rely on systems having a Java VM available. This implies that end-users must download (and install) two independent programs: a suitable VM and a Java archive. It also means that developers now have choices ahead of them that were once bygone worries. Choices that burden end-users and developers alike. Asking people to download a VM for their operating system and CPU architecture is a barrier to product adoption. What’s worse is that some VMs now support “full” Java while others don’t support JavaFX modules at all.</p><p>We’ll address that last point later.</p><p>In late 2019, <a href="https://github.com/kevinrushforth">Kevin Rushforth</a>, of Oracle’s Java Team, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZGW9AalZLN4?t=504">presented</a> a solution to the packaging problem: <code>jpackage</code> and <code>jlink</code>. During the presentation he listed some of the tooling’s shortcomings, which include:</p><ul><li>No cross-platform deployment</li><li>No cross-compilation (must run on MacOS to produce <code>.dmg</code>)</li></ul><p>Let’s not mince words: Java developers could once build applications on their preferred operating system and deploy anywhere; now, they must build installers for every individual platform they intend to target on those very systems.</p><p>Was that the <em>punch-line</em> to a two-decade lead up?</p><p>Requiring developers to have at least two commercial operating systems (Windows, MacOS X), even if emulated inside of a virtualized container—as opposed to using physical hardware—for a platform-independent programming language is an ironic barrier to entry. <em>Especially</em> for people bereft of bankroll.</p><p>Yes, those tools—alongside modules—help produce minimal executables. Who cares? What they don’t do is make it possible to create a set of native, standalone launcher binaries from a single build machine. Let’s fix that by pouring over the big splashes of how to cross-compile application launchers for Java on one build machine. We’ll use Linux because it’s free.</p><h2 id="software-requirements">Software Requirements</h2><p>You will need:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/dgiagio/warp">Warp Packer</a>, a tool for building native application launchers</li><li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, a source code management tool</li><li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>, a tool for fetching files</li><li><a href="https://gradle.org/">gradle</a> version 6.4.1, a build system</li><li><a href="https://dave.autonoma.ca/blog/2020/06/29/write-once-build-anywhere/build-template">build-template</a>, my own starter shell script (MIT licensed)</li></ul><p>Install <code>git</code> and <code>wget</code> using the package manager for your Linux distro.</p><h3 id="install-warp-packer">Install Warp Packer</h3><p>The installation instructions for Warp Packer are a bit buried. Install the software on a Linux system as follows (change the version number to suit):</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/bin
cd $HOME/bin
wget -O warp-packer \
  https://github.com/dgiagio/warp/releases/download/v0.3.0/linux-x64.warp-packer
chmod +x warp-packer</code></pre><p>If needed, include <code>$HOME/bin</code> in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable by adding the following line to <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code>:</p><pre><code>export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"</code></pre><p>Apply the new environment settings by opening a new terminal or <code>source</code>’ing the <code>.bashrc</code> file directly.</p><p>Warp Packer is installed.</p><h3 id="install-build-template">Install Build Template</h3><p>Copy, move, or download <code>build-template</code> into <code>$HOME/bin</code>.</p><p>The build template is installed.</p><h2 id="javafx">JavaFX</h2><p>Before we get into building a Java application, a little more history is warranted. Originally, the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) came bundled with Java, for the same reasons that having a bundled networking API was useful. The AWT lacked aesthetic, both in appearance and as a library. Swing, the AWT’s successor, made strides to address both, but fell short. JavaFX, which was also initially bundled with Java (versions 8 to 10), is a modern graphical user interface (GUI) library for developing desktop applications, as well as a superb replacement for Swing.</p><p>It has been argued that JavaFX should never have been bundled with Java. Nevertheless, the decision to un-bundle JavaFX from Java 11 onwards has led to Java projects that will be stuck with old Java versions for years to come—possibly leading to their abandonment—because it takes <em>a lot</em> of effort to migrate a build process to support these new, un-bundled Java Development Kits (JDKs).</p><p>Part of that effort entails re-bundling JavaFX. There are a few ways this can be accomplished:</p><ul><li>Create a single <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11947093/59087">überjar</a></em> that contains native libraries for all intended platform targets.</li><li>Create separate <em>überjars</em>, with each JAR containing native libraries specific to its target platform.</li></ul><p>It’s almost a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice">Hobson’s choice</a> because we have to create launcher binaries for each target platform anyway. Meaning bundling all of the target platform libraries into each native launcher is wasteful; however, bundling them in a single JAR file for those who have a Java VM installed already may be somewhat useful.</p><p>Java has introduced the concept of modules, looking to simplify the build process. Sometimes, though, modules cannot be included because of outdated dependencies. Problems can arise when running <code>jlink</code> against old dependencies. Compounding the issue is when the projects have been sundowned or have long release schedules. Nevertheless, for our purposes, we’ll want to download a version of OpenJDK that supports JavaFX.</p><p>With that background in mind, let’s go cross-compile some binaries.</p><h2 id="java-application">Java Application</h2><p>We’ll create native application launchers for <a href="https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar/">Scrivenvar</a>, a JavaFX-based text editor that I’ve been developing.</p><p>Dive in by cloning the latest version as follows:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/dev
cd $HOME/dev
git clone https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar.git
cd scrivenvar</code></pre><p>The application is downloaded.</p><h2 id="build-scripts">Build Scripts</h2><p>Let’s review the scripts that help build the application, which include:</p><ul><li><code>build.gradle</code> — builds application Java Archive (JAR) files</li><li><code>installer</code> — builds native, standalone binaries</li></ul><p>Separating the <code>installer</code> script’s responsibilities from <code>build.gradle</code> is not necessary, technically. When running third-party executables (e.g., <code>warp-packer</code>), my first inclination is to use a shell script, rather than gradle’s <code>exec</code>.</p><p>The <code>installer</code> script invokes <code>gradle</code> when requested.</p><h2 id="gradle-script">Gradle Script</h2><p>Open up <code>build.gradle</code> to review a few pertinent code blocks.</p><h3 id="target-operating-system">Target Operating System</h3><p>The first snippet determines what native JavaFX libraries (i.e., target platform code) to include within the JAR file:</p><pre><code>String[] os = ["win", "mac", "linux"]

if (project.hasProperty('targetOs')) {
  if ("windows".equals(targetOs)) {
    os = ["win"]
  }
  else {
    os = [targetOs]
  }
}</code></pre><p>Unless instructed otherwise, the build script will create a JAR file that includes JavaFX binaries for Windows, Linux, and MacOS embedded. We can target a specific platform by using the <code>-P</code> command line option when building, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build jar -PtargetOs=linux</code></pre><p>There’s a catch here in that <code>win</code> and <code>windows</code> are different names. The <code>installer</code> script needs to use <code>windows</code> because that’s part of the JDK file name being downloaded. Arguably, we could move that logic into the <code>installer</code> script, but the point is that the JDK filename and JavaFX refer to Windows using different terminology. The difference must be captured somwhere.</p><h3 id="javafx-dependencies">JavaFX Dependencies</h3><p>The second snippet tells the build system to include JavaFX for a given set of operating systems, as follows:</p><pre><code>def fx = ['controls', 'graphics', 'fxml', 'swing']

fx.each { fxitem -&gt;
  os.each { ositem -&gt;
    runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:javafx-${fxitem}:${javafx.version}:${ositem}"
  }
}</code></pre><p>The application uses JavaFX controls, graphics, fxml, and notice that it also lists a JavaFX-Swing integration. Using <code>.each</code> is a tidy way of not having to maintain a list of JavaFX-specific imports for each operating system, should either or both need to change.</p><h3 id="javafx-exclusions">JavaFX Exclusions</h3><p>Of lesser importance are exclude groups:</p><pre><code>implementation('de.jensd:fontawesomefx-fontawesome:4.7.0-11') {
  exclude group: 'org.openjfx'
}</code></pre><p>Without excluding JavaFX from certain JavaFX-related dependencies, the build will fail. Unfortunately, the build fails in such a way that the developer must investigate what package caused the conflict. Ideally, the build failure would pinpoint any collisions for the developer.</p><h3 id="run-application">Run Application</h3><p>The last point of note are the following lines:</p><pre><code>applicationDefaultJvmArgs = [
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control.skin=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=ALL-UNNAMED",
]</code></pre><p>These lines address permissions issues encountered when running the application using gradle, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build run</code></pre><p>Now that we understand how this build script works, let’s move on to the <code>installer</code> shell script.</p><h2 id="installer-script">Installer Script</h2><p>Looking at the big picture, the <code>installer</code> script performs the following steps to create a native launcher binary:</p><ol type="1"><li>Configure platform-specific parameters for extraction.</li><li>Rebuild the <em>überjar</em> for the target platform.</li><li>Clean out the distribution directory for a fresh build.</li><li>Extract the target JDK into the distribution directory.</li><li>Create a platform-dependent launch script to run the application.</li><li>Copy the <em>überjar</em> into the distribution directory.</li><li>Wrap the distribution into a standalone binary.</li></ol><p>These high-level steps can be found in the <code>execute()</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at how the script works.</p><h3 id="build-template">Build Template</h3><p>The <code>build-template</code> script is described in depth in the first three parts of my Typesetting Markdown series. We reuse the script here because it simplifies writing user-friendly shell scripts.</p><p>Downloading and extracting a requisite JDK is pivotal. JDKs can be downloaded from a few places, but most of them have …</p></article></div>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>But having to skip using the YouTube app to cast is already a clunky solution, and downloading every video before playing them is an even worse user experience. Instant playback and ephemeral streams are what make for a pleasant video streaming experience in 2020, and this solution implements neither of them</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md">Since <code>youtube-dl</code> allows us to output to <code>stdout</code></a>, if we can hook its <code>stdout</code> to a casting app, we could emulate the instant playback and ephemeral videos we expect because we don’t have to wait for an entire file to download.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <code>castnow</code> and <code>catt</code> won’t cast from <code>stdin</code>. You’re expected to pass it file locations to cast from.</p> <p>This is where one of my favorite shell features really shines: <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html">process substitution</a>.</p> <p>With process substitution, Bash gives us a convenient way to make ephemeral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe">anonymous pipes</a>. This method is both efficient and concurrent, making this primitive an apt choice to build a solution to the problem at hand. A process reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">pipe</a> blocks until the pipe is opened by another process for writing. A process writing to the pipe will suspend until the pipe’s buffer is read by another process. The anonymous pipe will automatically remove itself, and when it is manually removed, its dependent processes will be terminated.</p> <p>When using process substitution, a process’ <code>stdout</code> is hooked up to an anonymous pipe. That pipe can be accessed from a file descriptor, and the location of the pipe is given to the calling process.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
/dev/fd/63

<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
Content sent to pipe
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In the example above, the <code>&lt;(command)</code> syntax is how we invoke process substitution in Bash. The output of <code>command</code> is written to an anonymous pipe, and the calling process is given the location of the file descriptor to access that pipe.</p> <p>Using that example, we can take advantage of process substitution:</p> <div><div><pre><code>vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The command above will play the YouTube video locally with <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>, and illustrates that process substitution can work for our use case.</p> <p>However, when we try to use <code>castnow</code>, we can’t cast from the pipe:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>castnow &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: Load failed
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Nor can we cast with <code>catt</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>catt cast &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: The chosen file does not exist.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We know we can use VLC locally, and VLC also lets you cast to a Chromecast using its IP address.</p> <p>Let’s try that again using VLC:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_vlc<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

    <span># get the ip address for chromecast.lan host</span>
    <span>ip</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>dig +short chromecast.lan | <span>tail</span> <span>-n</span> 1<span>)</span>

    vlc <span>-I</span> ncurses <span>\</span>

<span>}</span>

cast_vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That works.</p> <p>As an aside, we hook VLC’s <code>stdin</code> to <code>/dev/tty</code> so that we can use the ncurses interface even if we invoke the function from a script.</p> <p>Let’s look at the <a href="https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/ncurses/">ncurses interface</a>.</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d0822203c304db88f3cbec618e94a3d9f55cd269/c5939/assets/imgs/converted/vlc-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div> <p>It only displays the file descriptor, and very little about the video itself. I’m not a fan of that.</p>  <p>Instead of using anonymous pipes, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe">named pipes</a>. Named pipes are like anonymous pipes, except they are not anonymous (they have a name) nor are they ephemeral. Named pipes still give us the efficiency and concurrency benefits that anonymous pipes give us, but Bash lacks the syntactic sugar it has for process substitution when it comes to named pipes.</p> <p>This is how we create named pipes, write to them, read from them and remove them.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkfifo </span>ourpipe

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Not as pretty as <code>&lt;(command)</code>, but it gets the job done.</p> <p>We can give a named pipe the same name as our YouTube video, and that way, the VLC interface will show the name of what we’re watching.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_ytdl<span>()</span> <span>{</span>

cast_ytdl <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This works, too.</p> <p>We need to manually create a named pipe with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/mkfifo"><code>mkfifo</code></a>, redirect <code>youtube-dl</code>’s <code>stdout</code> to the named pipe while running the process in the background, and then cleanup the process after casting from it via VLC, otherwise it might linger in the background. Each of those tasks would have been handled for us automatically using process substitution.</p> <p>But it does look a bit better:</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/25d68fb2085191adb26bb931e9bb31c638e5a634/f664c/assets/imgs/converted/vlc3-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div>  <p>Pipes, anonymous pipes and named pipes are also known by another name because of the way they behave: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)#Pipes">FIFOs</a>, or <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>i</strong>n, <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>o</strong>ut. What’s written to the pipe is read from the pipe in first in, first out order. This behavior maps well to video streaming.</p> <p>While you can interact with anonymous and named pipes like you would a file, the interface isn’t 1:1 with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Regular_file">standard file</a>. You cannot <code>seek()</code> forward or backward in pipe, you can just read the next forward values. For our use case, that means we cannot skip forward or backward in our streaming videos. We can only play, pause or stop the video.</p> <p>That’s not a problem for me, however it’s something that can be mitigated if it’s a problem for you. The first solution I can think of would be to write to a temporary file via <code>youtube-dl</code> and read from it. Or <a href="https://alexdelorenzo.dev/programming/2019/04/14/buffer">perhaps a temporary spooled file can act as a buffer for the pipe</a>, such that you can <code>seek()</code> through the buffer, but the buffer itself is ephemeral unlike a normal file.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-537">
				<!-- .entry-header -->

				<div>
			<p>I belong to a group of faculty and staff who’ve historically met over lunch to discuss teaching and technology. Last week, after three months of meeting on Zoom, we decided to meet in person in a classroom on campus to see what it’s like.<span id="more-537"></span></p>
<p>Four of us met in a third-floor classroom measuring 28’x24′ with a nominal capacity of 28 students. We all wore masks, and at my husband’s suggestion I brought the Stick of Social Distancing (marked at 6′ and 2m).</p>
<p>First I reflect on “the good, the bad, and the ugly,” which I’ve interpreted as what went well (or better than expected), what practical or pedagogical problems arose, and where we had difficulty following safety guidelines. Then I share some recommendations based on these observations. Finally, I conclude with a photo essay documenting our experiment.</p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We were able to arrange the desks to implement the official adjusted room capacity of 15 students plus the instructor. I assumed that would mean staggered rows of desks facing forward, but it also worked to put 12 seats around the edge of the room and 4 in the middle, which were far enough apart to face either in (for a fishbowl discussion) or out (for small group discussions).</li>
<li>We had no problems hearing each each other – although we never did try to have two pairwise conversations in parallel.</li>
<li>We felt more comfortable wearing masks after 75 minutes than we thought we would.</li>
<li>It was nice to spend some time in the physical presence of a few of my closest colleagues. I didn’t feel the anxiety during this experiment that I thought I might.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arriving at the classroom was uncomfortable. After walking up two flights of stairs, our masks were quite moist and sticky.</li>
<li>While there is space for 15 students plus the instructor, there is no space for the instructor to move in the discussion configuration. Perhaps the instructor would be able to use the chalkboard if the desks were in rows facing forward. We didn’t test that.</li>
<li>With 4 groups of 4 students, there is nowhere in the classroom for the instructor to be at all.</li>
<li>Three desks were in pretty uncomfortable positions – one in the corner right by the door, and two with the instructor’s podium between them so they could not see each other. (It would be very tempting to scoot forward to gain a sightline and end up too close together.)</li>
<li>We found that it took a conscious effort to speak at a normal volume rather than projecting. We worried about losing our voices during a full day of classes and other meetings with students. ETA: I normally teach with a cup of water in my hand. And as Emma reminded me, drinking while wearing a mask requires taking the mask off, so no drinking while teaching.</li>
<li>At the end of our meeting, one colleague said I had talked over her several times. While I pointed out I have always had a bad habit of interrupting when excited, she attributed it to not being able to see each other’s faces under the masks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Ugly</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While we’ve typically had 8-9 folks at Zoom meetings, only 4 made it to this meeting on campus. People had different reasons for not coming. It was just as well for this meeting – Walla Walla County is still in Phase 2, which allows meetings of up to 5 people. But it makes me wonder even more about whether it’s going to be realistic to expect most students to come to an in-person class, especially if they have the option to participate online or substitute other activities.</li>
<li>In particular, one colleague who did not join us reported by email that she may have been exposed to COVID-19 and is self-quarantining.</li>
<li>Navigating the hallways and stairs too and from the classroom was a bit nerve-wracking, even with very few people in the building.</li>
<li>Without the Stick of Social Distancing, we might have spaced some of the desks too closely. As it is, I’m concerned that we measured on-center and not edge-to-edge.</li>
<li>Once our conversation got animated, the four of us easily took up the entire room. We definitely got too close to each other after some of us got out of our seats to use the chalkboard.</li>
<li>One of us had a poorly fitting mask that slipped down her nose over the course of our meeting. This might be the thing that made me the most nervous.</li>
<li>After getting home, I cleaned my book and phone, took a shower, and started a load of laundry. That might have been unnecessary, but I felt a lot better after the shower.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To meet in person, we need one-way signs for halls and stairways, floor marks for safe configurations of classrooms with moveable furniture (maybe different-colored tape for different configurations), and hand sanitizer at the door of every classroom.</li>
<li>To meet in person, we need to trust each others’ masks. Students, faculty, and staff should all be provided with several masks (to allow washing) of a design known to be effective.</li>
<li>Everyone, but especially instructors, may need to arrive to class earlier than usual to have extra time to clean their hands, get in place, and cool down. ETA: We also need scheduled breaks to drink water in a place/situation where we can take our masks off. Those who normally teach with a mug of coffee may need to schedule time for advance caffeination.</li>
<li>Instructors need to think carefully about how our usual active learning techniques will adapt to social distancing,&nbsp;<em>in the particular classrooms we are teaching in</em>. In particular, seating the students may not be enough. If the instructor or the students need space to move around, you need a <em>much</em> bigger classroom or many fewer students.</li>
<li>Collaborative work on paper is not an option when you are 6 feet apart. Students need to use chalkboards, whiteboards, or digital tools such as Google Docs.</li>
<li>In collaborative chalkboard work, each person should keep their own chalk during the session. We need to figure out how to stay distanced while moving – possibly by marking boxes on the floor and instituting rules for taking turns writing on the board.</li>
<li>Similarly, instructors should make explicit rules for requesting, taking, and ceding the floor, e.g., by raising and lowering hands. (A talking stick is not an option, for reasons that should be obvious.)</li>
<li>Instructors need to have plans for accommodating unplanned absences due to self-quarantine. While we always have unplanned absences due to illness and personal emergencies, there are going to be a lot more than usual due to requirements to get tested and/or self-quarantine for suspected exposure as well as symptoms. Moreover, vulnerable students who have chosen to return to campus may be <em>much</em> more cautious about attending class while they are feeling ill or during an outbreak. (It goes without saying that we also need plans to move our classes entirely online, even if they start in person.)</li>
<li>Like health care workers, instructors may want to institute a sanitary protocol for returning home after a day with students, especially if they have vulnerable family members.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/dCcLQ5TLFANMj0p3Uh/giphy.gif" alt="Press F to pay respects"></p>
<p>For a year or so I have owned a nice fake-vintage radio/bluetooth speaker that originally caught my eye for sale in a FedEx office. The front has a quite nice VFD-style LED to show the status, a volume knob and four hard buttons. It has Bluetooth, USB, AUX and FM input. The radio and bluetooth was not bad, but there was nothing to be impressed about. It was definitely not "smart."</p>
<p>I decided to hack it to make it a bit smarter: to do AirPlay and be a smart alarm clock and whatever else I could think of. Since it was inexpensive, I had nothing to lose and everything to win. I thought putting a Raspberry Pi 0 or something in it would be nice.</p>
<p>My original plan was to somehow figure out how to hijack all the external components and control them to make the front and back of the radio as neat-looking as possible. At least I hoped to hijack the speaker, the volume knob, and the buttons. The problem I foresaw was that those components are often not documented and there was little chance that I could get a datasheet for them. I was very worried that I might have to give up the fake-VFD LED screen.</p>
<p>It turns out that I had to spend a year hacking it on and off. Here goes.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/fedex-sale.jpg" alt="FedEx sale"></p>
<p>First, I gutted the radio and saw that it has a main PCB with the LED panel directly soldered to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/radio-disassembled.jpg" alt="Disassembled radio"></p>
<p>The chip on the PCB isn't something I recognized. Luckily, the knob and the hard buttons are on a separate breakout board and are connected to the mainboard via a connector.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/main-pcb.jpg" alt="Main PCB"></p>
<h2 id="the-speaker">The speaker</h2>
<p>The speaker is also easy to deal with, as it is completely ordinary. It only required me to desolder it from the mainboard. As the Pi 0 has no built-in soundcard, I had to get a separate sound card for it.</p>
<h3 id="audio-injector-zero">Audio Injector Zero</h3>
<p>Initially, I used the Audio Injector Zero that I have no use for normally. To save space, I decided to permanently sandwich the Audio Injector to the Pi 0. I also had to buy a cheap amp for it, as the sound card can't directly drive the speaker.</p>
<p>One little issue was that the sound card produces stereo input, and the amp is also stereo, but I only have one speaker. I needed to mix both channels left and right to that speaker somehow. To that end, I am sure a Linux guru could make it work with configuring the sound card in software. However, I am not extremely well-versed with how ALSA or Pulse Audio works. I just wired both channels left and right of the amp to one channel input of the amp to mix the channels. For power, the amp needs 5V input, so I siphoned the two power pins from the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>I was surprised when the amp produced a very annoying hum. The hum was extremely noticeable when the Pi is under load. I don't know exactly why this happens, but I spent way too much time on this with no significant improvement. Ultimately, I decided it's the cheap amp that was giving me a hard time, because it was way too noisy. I know the Audio Injector itself was okay because the headphones output was clean.</p>
<h3 id="google-aiy-voice-hat">Google AIY voice hat</h3>
<p>After giving up on the Audio Injector Zero + Amp solution, I tried a different route: Drive the speaker directly with the Google AIY voice bonnet hat. Because the Google AIY sound card doesn't provide an easy way to set up on a plain raspbian, I just got their distro and started from there.</p>
<p>The speaker was hum-free after switching to the Google AIY soundcard. The tradeoff was that the Google Voice Bonnet V2 sound card made the stack quite a bit thicker. It has a female row of pins soldered on it, so I couldn't solder it directly on top of the Pi Zero.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/sound-cards.jpg" alt="Sound cards"></p>

<p>The front panel of the radio has two sets of elements: A knob of some sort to control the volume and four hard buttons. It has four wires hanging out of it. After I inspected the traces on the PCB, it was apparent that there is one common ground. The three other pins are for the buttons and the knob. All of the buttons are connected to a single pin, and the volume knob is connected to the other two.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/buttons-knob.jpg" alt="Buttons and knobs"></p>
<p>As a software person, I didn't know what the knob is called. <a href="http://dbindner.freeshell.org/">Dr. Don Bindner</a> suggested that the button might be a rotary encoder, and that turned out to be true. It seemed <a href="http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Rotary-encoder-circuit.php">trivial enough to read the knob</a>.</p>
<p>The buttons are more interesting. After poking around with a multimeter, it turned out that the buttons were tactile but each of them is connected in series to a different resistor. Then they all connect out to the same pin. The software in the chip scans the pin and figures out what button was pressed by sampling from an Analog-to-Digital (ADC) Converter reading. As the Pi has no ADC, we need something else that has an ADC to figure out what the button was pressed. Of course, I could as well hijack the tactile buttons and not have to deal with the ADC stuff but that seemed too aesthetically unpleasant for me.</p>
<p>I decided to pull out anArduino Pro Micro clone that I bought from China years ago. My reasoning for using the Pro Micro:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Arduino Pro Micro is super cheap: $2 cheap.</li>
<li>Even if I could add an ADC to the Pi, I need to continuously read the ADC from the Pi. That is a pain in the neck. I can't guarantee the timings on the Pi without going to a lot of care.</li>
<li>The Pro Micro can emulate a keyboard over USB, so the Pi can use triggerhappy to catch it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So with that, I made my arduino sketch and it worked out. I wanted to emulate the Winamp-style buttons ZXCV for multimedia keys and UD for volume up/down. Later on, I was quite annoyed with it because the keyboard dumps the keystrokes to the terminal, and <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/very-odd-bug-found-in-jailbreaking-process-20081109/">it could be bad</a>. I decided to implement the keys as multimedia keys. Unfortunately, you need a HID library to implement multimedia keys. Luckily, there is a library called <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HID">HID-Project</a> to achieve exactly what I wanted. After some tweakings for debounce, I could get the volume knob and the buttons to work exactly as I expected:</p>

<p>I could test the Arduino implementation right on my development computer with <code>xev</code> so that was really nice.</p>
<h2 id="the-fake-vfd-led-screen">The fake VFD LED screen</h2>
<p>The screen was the part that I had the most doubt about being able to control, because I have never worked with such a device before. Before trying to reverse-engineer it, I tried to look up similar 7-segment LED screens online hoping to find something similar. Those screens often have more than 8 pins (1 for the ground, 7 for each segment, and some more to select the digit. This one is nothing like that: It has only 7 pins. I wanted to give it up and just buy another screen that has a datasheet to save myself from trouble but I couldn't find anything that would fit into the original cutout for the screen. So I had to bite the bullet and hack the LED screen (I had nothing better to do in the craziness of the pandemic).</p>
<h3 id="general-workings">General workings</h3>
<p>There was no giveaway from the PCB what the ground pin for the display might be. I only had a multimeter in hand so what I did was set it to the diode tester mode. Then I probed pairs of pins to see what lights up. As luck would have it, I found out that each pair of pins lit up a different segment on the screen. So there was no common ground at all! I drew the screen and noted what pin pair light up each segment (excuse my nasty draft paper):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/matrix-draft.jpg" alt="Draft Matrix"></p>
<p>First, I was really annoyed because the screen is yet another custom device I had to reverse engineer. Then, it really impressed me that this screen is quite well designed for such a cheap device. There were exactly 42 segments on this LED screen! The number of different segments is exactly the maximum number of permutations between any 2 pins: P(7,2) = 42. After some more digging, I found out that this wiring scheme is called <a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/charlieplexing/">Charlieplexing</a>. So each LED segment has a voltage drop of 1.860V, and my Arduino is 5V. I assumed a 20mA current and used a LED calculator and to figure out that I need to connect a 150K resistor to the LED. Because of the charlieplexing setup, I actually need half of that resistance for each pin (it will be apparent as you read on), so I soldered a 68K resistor to each pin.</p>
<h3 id="control-the-led-screen-programmatically">Control the LED screen programmatically</h3>
<p>The question then became how to control this LED screen programmatically. It was clear to me I can't possibly draw every segment by toggling the pins on and off in one whole sweep. Then I realized that I need to think of the LED screen like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r38nVmxBfvM">analog TV screen</a>. Thus, each of the pins can be thought of as a horizontal scanline – except they are not on the same “line”! This might be quite obvious to those who have dealt with CRTs in the past (which I have not), but it might be hard to imagine for those who grew up with LCDs.</p>
<p>Let's say I want to draw the screen with segment 17, 18, and 11 lit up. That means I have to do two sweeps. First, pull pin 1 to GND and pull pin 2 to V_LED to light up segment 18. Then, pull pin 4 to GND and pull pin 1 and 7 to V_LED to light up segment 17 and 11 at once. Do it fast enough, and my eyes won't be able to tell we are flashing them!</p></div></div>

    <p>Perhaps more than any other development, finance was ushered into the
modern era with the development of the <em>Capital Asset Pricing Model</em>
(CAPM) by William Sharpe in the early 60s. Though commonly criticized as
too simple and reductionist, the model is still used today as an easy
way to determine a stock's exposure to the market:</p>



<p>$\beta_i$ was originally formulated as
$\frac{\text{Cov}(r_m,r_i)}{\text{Var}(r_m)}$, but it is more commonly
calculated by taking the slope of a linear regression between the asset
and the market. $r_m$ is the expected market return, $r_f$ is the
expected risk-free rate, and $r_i$ is the expected return of the asset.</p>

<p>Perhaps the model is so popular because the interpretation of $\beta$ is
so concrete and easy to understand: a stock's $\beta$ is simply a
multiplier on the market's return. Stocks with high betas are more
volatile than the market, and those with smaller betas less so. In
tumultuous times, investors try and cut their volatility by rotating
into low beta stocks; while in bull markets, investors clamor to those
with the highest betas.</p>

<p>There's been a problem with CAPM, and indeed, the very concept of beta,
for a long time now: it's called the low beta anomaly. Academics
noticed that there was systematic discrepancies between high and low
beta stocks: it seemed like higher beta stocks were under performing and
low beta stocks were outperforming. Consider the <em>Security Market Line</em>
(SML):</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/sml.png" alt="Security Market Line"></p>

<p>According to CAPM, the returns of low beta stocks were supposed to
linearly scaled by their beta exposure, likewise with higher beta
stocks. Instead, it was noticed that there was an unexpected curve:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/lba.png" alt="Low beta anomaly"></p>

<p>As we can see, high volatility (and thus, high beta) portfolios are
returning significantly less than what is expected, thus throwing a
wrench into the very concept of beta. After seeing the chart, a natural
question is: can we exploit this mispricing while not being exposed to
the market? In this post, we'll look into whether it's possible to
profit off of this effect and also discuss the potential structural and
behavioral reasons for this anomaly.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-approach">A Simple Approach</h2>

<p>Of course, the simplest way to try and capture the excess return of the
anomaly is to construct a portfolio of low beta equities and call it a
day. But what if we don't want to be exposed to the market, even to the
degree that low beta equities are? Like most answers in finance, the
answer is a market neutral long/short portfolio!</p>

<p>For this strategy, we'll be using the Quantopian <em>Q1500US</em> universe,
which consists of the 1500 most liquid US equities on any given day. We
then construct our low beta factor as such:</p>



<p>This will give us large positive values for stocks that have low beta,
and small negative values for those that have high beta. Before we rank
and z-score, in order to calculate the beta for each equity, we find the
slope of a simple linear regression over a 252 day rolling window. We
then use these factor values as the weights of our long/short portfolio.
Let's look at the total long/short return of our simple strategy
between 2003-01-01 and 2020-01-01:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/betacum.png" alt="Cumulative return"></p>

<p>Well… this isn't good! Why are we losing money? Does this mean that
the low beta anomaly isn't actually true? Digging into the numbers a
little more, it turns out that the total portfolio beta for this
strategy is actually negative, -38% to be exact. This means that even
though we are market neutral, we have a negative exposure to the market:
when the market goes up, our portfolio loses money, and vice versa.
Since the market goes up most of the time, this isn't a great property
to have. Ideally, we want to have zero beta exposure, not negative
exposure. Let's look at the skew of the distribution of betas over
time:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/skew.png" alt="Skew over time"></p>

<p>In order for our market neutral portfolio to have zero beta, we would
need the skew of the betas to be zero, like for a standard normal
distribution. To make this a little more concrete, let's look at a
histogram for a single time period of stock betas:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/hist.png" alt="Histogram"></p>

<p>Now, the problem becomes evident: even though we are market neutral, we
end up taking on negative beta exposure because the distribution of the
beta of stocks has a long left-side tail. Almost no stocks actually have
negative beta exposure, while many have high beta exposures! This means
that when longing and shorting in equal proportion, we end up with a
large negative beta since our long positions don't have a low enough
beta in order to cancel out our high beta short positions.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the Problem</h2>

<p>So, how do we proceed? We need to find some way to adjust the weights of
our portfolio so that we end up with zero beta exposure. Fortunately,
calculating the beta exposure is relatively straightforward. Given a
column vector of weights:</p>



<p>And a vector of beta exposures:</p>



<p>We can easily find the beta of portfolio:</p>



<p>Traditionally, we would solve this equation by using an optimizer with a
constraint that $\beta_p =0$. But because we only have one factor, we
can find an analytical solution. What we want to do is to try and solve
for a $\beta_p$ of zero. To do this, we first need to rewrite the
equation in terms of the weights that are positive (the low beta side)
and those that are negative (the high beta side):</p>





<p>Likewise, we split up the betas as well:</p>





<p>Where:</p>



<p>Now, our equation becomes:</p>



<p>Where the $\alpha$ vectors contain the positive weights and the $\beta$
vectors, the negative weights. We want to scale up the negative weights
(make them larger, though still negative), so we introduce a scaling
factor, $\lambda$, and set $\beta_p=0$:</p>



<p>We now solve for $\lambda$:</p>



<p>Assuming a leverage ratio of one, i.e:</p>



<p>We can calculate the net long exposure, using $\lambda$ as a parameter:</p>



<p>Below is the graph of net long exposure over time:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/ne.png" alt="Net long exposure"></p>

<p>And the cumulative return:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/betacum2.png" alt="Cumulative return"></p>

<p>Wow, Looks a lot better! Ignoring the Great Recession, the return stream
seems very solid, with limited volatility. Below is a table of some
additional strategy information:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Beta</td>
      <td>1.8%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Ret</td>
      <td>4.0%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Vol</td>
      <td>4.6%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ret/Vol</td>
      <td>0.84</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>With a beta of only 1.8%, it's clear that our method for reducing beta
exposure works quite well. Still, it's surprising that a net long
exposure of such magnitude can still be taken with little to no
correlation to the market. Evidently, there is indeed an excess return
associated with low-beta equities, and quite a large one, at that.</p>

<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>Many academics have tried to explain the structural and behavioral
reasons for the low beta anomaly. The most common explanation put forth
is that due to leverage constraints and borrowing costs, investors seek
out high beta securities in order to achieve a higher natural return. If
high leverage ratios were available to all investors, one might expect
that this mispricing of high beta stocks might go away, as the beta of
any given stock would become less important.</p>

<p>Another possible explanation is that the conflict of interest between
money managers and clients creates an incentive for fund managers to
take excess risk through high beta equities. In good times, managers
collect a performance fee and a management fee while in bad times, only
a management fee. This asymmetric payoff incentives managers to try and
score a big "win," while limited liability prevents managers from ever
losing money on losses.</p>

<p>A third explanation is that high volatility (and thus high beta) stocks
receive more attention from the financial community as they are simply
more interesting to discuss. This interest and attention encourages
increased buying, thus pushing down the expected return of said stocks.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post we have shown that there is indeed a significant abnormal
return associated with low beta stocks. This abnormal return can not
only be captured with a long only (and beta exposed) portfolio, but also
a beta neutral one. Despite the less than stellar risk-adjusted return
of the strategy, perhaps the Sharpe ratio can be improved by controlling
sector and style risks in addition to beta exposure. Perhaps one could
also overlay the low beta factor on top of an existing factor strategy
in order to reduce volatility and boost the risk-adjusted return.</p>

<p>That's all for now, and thanks for reading! If you're interested in
the code and want to play around with it, check it out

        <p>Local economies around the U.S. have continued to change quickly and dramatically – states and cities are slowly reopening, unemployment rates are starting to decline from the recent all-time high, COVID-19 cases are increasing in some states while decreasing in others, and communities are responding to the social unrest and George Floyd protests with city-wide curfews having impacted many businesses that were just able to reopen.</p>
        <p>Yelp last reported on the state of the local economy in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q1-2020.html">our quarterly Yelp Economic Average report on April 28</a>, showing how much consumer activity in major swathes of Main Street had dropped off in just a couple of weeks in March. Now as states start to reopen and the nation responds to anti-Black racism and police brutality, a new set of challenges lay ahead for local economies.</p>

      <h2>Some Businesses Slowly Reopen, While Many Permanently Close</h2>
        <p>As of June 15, there were nearly 140,000 total business closures on Yelp since March 1. In April we reported more than 175,000 business closures, indicating that more than 20% of businesses closed in April have reopened. Las Vegas, NV, endured the highest number of closures relative to the number of businesses in the city (1,921 total closures), while Los Angeles, CA, had the largest total number of closures (11,774 total closures).</p>

        <p>Of all business closures on Yelp since March 1, 41% are permanent closures. Our data shows the largest spikes of permanent closures occurred in March, followed by May and June, indicating that the businesses that were already struggling had to permanently close right away and the businesses that were trying to hold on, but unable to weather the COVID-19 storm, were forced to shutter in recent months.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Retail and Restaurant Businesses Continue Innovating Amid High Closure Rates</h2>
        <p>While many business sectors have struggled during COVID-19 there are a few industries that have endured especially high closure rates. Among those with the highest rate of business closures are shopping and retail (27,663 closed businesses), restaurants (23,981 closed businesses), beauty (15,348 closed businesses) and fitness (5,589 closed businesses).</p>
        <p>Retail was by far the hardest hit, experiencing the highest number of total closures, with the average daily rate continuing to increase since March. Of all closures on Yelp since March 1, 20% are for retail businesses and 35% of closed retail businesses are indicated as permanent on Yelp.</p>
        <p>In March, Restaurants had the highest number of business closures, compared to other industries, and have continued to close at high rates. Of the businesses that closed, 17% are restaurants, and 53% of those restaurant closures are indicated as permanent on Yelp. Restaurants run on thin margins and can sometimes take months or even years to break even, resulting in this higher rate of permanent closures.</p>

Many restaurants pivoted to offering takeout and delivery, while some experimented with take home meal and drink kits, and even virtual cooking classes. Some are finding new ways to use existing technology, like <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.yelp.com/2020/04/use-waitlist-online-takeout-restaurants?utm_source=biz_blog&amp;utm_medium=yelp_blog&amp;utm_content=blog_text_link">Yelp Waitlist to manage curbside pickup</a>.

        <p>With many retail businesses shifting to curbside pickup, we’ve seen consumer interest spike in obtaining their goods in this way with a 20% increase in searches for curbside pickup. In the beauty industry we’ve seen hair stylists offering video hair cutting tutorials, estheticians offering virtual consultations, and small shops shifting their focus to ecommerce. Fitness in particular has seen a significant shift in their business model with gyms and studios offering virtual classes and personal trainers offering one-on-one virtual training sessions.

      <h2>The Desire to Support Black-Owned Businesses Continues to Grow</h2>
        <p>As acknowledgement of anti-Black racism and police brutality become more wide-spread across the nation people are continuing to look for ways to support the Black community. Since May 25, we’ve seen a 1785% relative increase in searches for Black-owned businesses, compared to the three weeks prior. Review mentions of “Black-owned” (and related terms) also skyrocketed, up 426%, as people look to support and surface these businesses to the community.</p>
        <p>D.C. had the highest number of Black-owned searches, accounting for nearly 1% of all searches on Yelp, followed by Minnesota, Maryland, Michigan and Georgia. In fact, every state has shown an increase in searches for Black-owned businesses. Looking at metros, Ann Arbor, MI has the highest increase in searches for Black-owned, up 105X (accounting for 3% of all searches), followed by Denver (up 27X), Minneapolis (up 23X) and Baltimore (up 19X).</p>

      <h2>The Recovering Economy May Look Different Than the Old Economy</h2>
        <p>While some normal activity is starting to bounce back, due to the many changes impacting local economies — state rules, consumer behavior, and social unrest — many of the consumer interest shifts we saw in March and April started to rebound in May, with dramatic shifts in June.</p>
        <p>Outdoor activities that became popular at the height of the pandemic as people were finding ways to stay active while social distancing – such as mountain biking (down 40%), lakes (down 34%), golf (down 33%) and hiking (down 28%) – have dropped in consumer interest since May 1 relative to other active activities. People are starting to feel more comfortable participating in indoor activities, with increased consumer interest for escape games (up 182%), Go Karts (up 147%), axe throwing (up 113%), gyms (up 81%), bowling (up 63%) and yoga (42%). That said, in some instances people are still finding ways to stay outdoors while social distancing with an increased interest in mini golf (up 132%), amusement parks (up 28%) and horseback riding (up 21%).</p>
        <p>The previous spike in community supported agriculture and grocery has started to dip (down 54% and 26%, respectively) as people start heading back into restaurants. In fact, Yelp’s diners seated data shows significantly more people are dining-in at restaurants. During the peak of the pandemic, the number of diners seated across Yelp Reservations and Waitlist dropped essentially to zero. In early June, we've seen diners seated come back substantially – now down 57% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Restaurants that cater to group dining are among those making a comeback – fondue (up 123%), tapas bars (up 98%), hot pot (up 49%) and surprisingly, even buffets (up 17%) – as foods that gained increased interest through takeout and delivery have started to fall – pizza (down 28%), chinese (down 26%), fast food (down 18%). That said, takeout and delivery has continued to sustain interest on Yelp, still up 148% based on consumer interest relative to pre-pandemic levels, indicating this could be a trend that’s here to stay.</p>
        <p>People are also headed back into malls with outlet stores, shopping centers and thrift stores all up (up 84%, 81%, 72%, respectively), as well as hosting or attending formal events with increased interest in bridal (up 70%) and formal wear (up 102%). The previous increase in cannabis dispensaries, head shops and tobacco shops has declined (down 40%, 35% and 32%, respectively). There have also been significant shifts in consumer interest for health and wellness businesses with an increased interest in saunas (up 75%), reflexology (up 69%) and dentists (up 28%), while skilled nursing (down 46%) and hospitals (down 37%) decline.</p>

<h2 id="Contrarian-view-on-mutable-default-arguments.">Contrarian view on mutable default arguments.<a href="#Contrarian-view-on-mutable-default-arguments.">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>The use of <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments">mutable defaults</a> is probably the most infamous Python gotcha.  Default values are evaluated at definition time, which means mutating them will be persistent across multiple calls.  Many articles on this topic even use the same <code>append</code> example.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>And the solution is invariably to use <code>None</code> instead, and convert as needed.</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>There is another solution to the problem of mutating a default value: don't do that.  More specifically, the problem isn't using mutables as defaults; the problem is actually mutating them.</p>
<p>If the input from the caller is being mutated, then the caller doesn't need it returned because the caller already has a reference.  This distinction is explicitly encouraged in Python, e.g., <code>list.sort</code> vs. <code>sorted</code>.  But it follows that if the input doesn't need to be returned, then there's no point in the input being optional.  How would the caller know the difference?</p>
<p>The reason why examples like the fluent <code>append</code> seem so contrived is because they are. No one actually wants a function named <code>append</code> to take one argument.  The realistic fix would be:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Sure, there are rare occassions where a parameter is mutable but optional, such as a recursive algorithm that's implicitly passing around its own cache.  But this author would wager that given any real-world code that's been bitten by this gotcha there is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a ~90% chance the function would have a related bug if defaults were evaluated at runtime</li>
<li>a ~95% chance the function has a poor interface</li>
</ul>
<p>What harm does this advice do?  Well, it's caused an over-reaction resulting in using <code>None</code> as the only default, even for immutables.  It's so prevalent that it appears many beginners believe using <code>None</code> is the one and only way of making an argument optional.</p>
<p>Besides immutable types, there are also cases where mutation is irrelevant.  Consider the following example adapted from a popular project.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>Notice that the correctness of this code relies on the member list being newly created in either case.  What could possible go wrong with:</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>Or better yet, why not support the more liberal interface.</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>The point is that there are at least 4 solutions to this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>use mutable defaults, but don't mutate them</li>
<li>use immutable substitute defaults with a compatible interface</li>
<li>use <code>None</code> for mutables, and matching types for immutables</li>
<li>use <code>None</code> for all defaults</li>
</ol>
<p>Only #1 is even remotely controversial, yet somehow the status quo has landed on #4.  Besides being needlessly verbose, it has another pitfall.  Python doesn't natively support detecting where the argument was actually passed; a sentinel default is required for that.  The implementation detail is leaking through the interface, indicating to the caller that <code>None</code> is an acceptable argument to pass <em>explicitly</em>.  As if the type hint was <code>Optional[List]</code>, even though that's not the intention.  Factor in using <code>**kwargs</code> - which clearly doesn't want data padded with nulls - and actual code breakage can result.</p>
<p>Presumably the disdain for option #1 is because it might <em>encourage</em> the gotcha.  But it's disingenous to just let that go unsaid.  The implementer is responsible for writing correct code, and the caller sees the right interface.  The speculation is that beginners will read code which uses mutable defaults but doesn't mutate them, and follow the former pattern but not the latter.</p>
<p>As a community, let's at least push towards option #3.  Using empty strings and zeros as defaults is all upside.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The finance world is quickly entering the mainstream —</p><p>Every month a notable company goes public. Every week a hot startup raises millions of dollars. And every day moms, pops, and teens check on their stocks. </p><p>Whether a company builds rocket engines or mobile apps, they tell their story using the same language —&nbsp;financial statements. Here's how they work.</p><p>Let's say you run a subscription t-shirt business.</p><p>It's going well — you have happy customers and healthy profit. You're thinking of buying your own factory to make more t-shirts, more quickly, and more cheaply.</p><p>There's just one problem — you can't afford a factory.</p><p>So, you ask the bank for a loan. Your company is profitable and the factory will pay for itself in 3 years, so you know you'll be able to pay it back. But while you know this, the bank doesn't — you'll need to convince them. The bank, however, doesn't know anything about the subscription clothing business.</p><p>To get on the same page, you need a shared language for talking about your business.</p><p><h4 id="heading-1">Double-entry Bookkeeping: The birth of accounting</h4></p><p>Double-entry bookkeeping was the first formalism in finance. The Middle East had it in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40697986" target="_blank">first century AD</a>, Korea independently got it in the <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/issn/1598-2661" target="_blank">11th century</a>, and by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627232023/http://130.74.92.202:82/record=b1000778" target="_blank">1500s</a>, it had been well-documented across Europe.</p><p>It's a simple concept designed to reduce errors when documenting transactions: every entry to an "account" requires an equal and opposite entry to another "account".</p><p>If you bought some cotton to turn into t-shirts, you might record the transaction like this:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-371c827e421c-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde0379b53032713cde77_bookkeeping.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>When you spend $100 on cotton, your "Cash" account gets debited (loses) $100, and your "Materials" account gets credited (gains) $100. The underlying principle is that <em>you can't create something out of nothing</em>.</p><p>This might seem contrived, but with more and more transactions, it can help you spot errors. Since every entry has an equal and opposite entry, the sum of all the debits should always equal the sum of all the credits. If not, you know you made a mistake, and you can look back through your transactions to find it.</p><p>A list of transactions is pretty interesting — it tells a very detailed story about what your company's been up to. Certainly enough to answer the bank's questions when you ask for loan.</p><p>But just as the bank doesn't have time to learn about subscription t-shirts businesses, they don't have time to go through thousands of transactions. To understand what's going on, they need a shorter summary.</p><p><h4 id="heading-2">Financial Statement #1: The Balance Sheet</h4></p><p>If you went through all your transactions and worked out the net value of each account, you'd be able to see things like</p><ul role="list"><li>How much cash you have in the bank</li><li>The total value of the cotton in your inventory</li><li>How much money you owe to your cotton suppliers</li></ul><p>This will give you a snapshot of the current state of your company, split up into "everything you own" (<strong>Assets</strong>) and "everything you owe" (<strong>Liabilities</strong>) — a <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>. These generally won't be equal — ideally your assets will be worth more than your liabilities.</p><p>The difference between the assets and the liabilities is what you, the owner of the company, can rightfully stake a claim to. Crudely, if you sold all your assets today and used that money to pay off all your debts, you'd be left with a pile of cash all to yourself.</p><p>This idea is usually expressed by the "accounting equation":</p><p><strong>Assets - Liabilities = Shareholders Equity</strong></p><p>This is where the "balance" comes in: both sides of the equation are equal. Note that this equation is actually a definition — it asserts that the value of the <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> is the difference between <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Liabilities</strong>. This is the same equation that underpins double-entry bookkeeping.</p><p>Here's what your balance sheet might look like:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-89b5b437bd58-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde1a11602b68a068a079_balance-sheet.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The bank will be interested in seeing this before giving you a loan. It's a quick 'n' dirty way for them to understand the big picture:</p><ul role="list"><li>The orders of magnitude involved — does this company operate in the thousands, millions, or billions?</li><li>An estimate for how much the company is "worth", based on the shareholders equity</li><li>An indication of company health — is the company drowning in debt?</li></ul><p>Financiers often calculate metrics based on the balance sheet, to further summarise the information and to compare numbers across companies.</p><p>The <strong>Debt/Equity Ratio</strong> is a big one, telling you how much a company relies on borrowing money. If it's too high then the company might be too dependent on loans, but if it's too low, this might indicate an inefficiency, since borrowing money to spend on growth can be quicker than earning it the hard way.</p><p>So — the balance sheet summarises a lot about your company, in a way that the bank can understand.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't answer a crucial question — "Do you make money?"</p><p><h4 id="heading-3">Financial Statement #2: The Income Statement (P&amp;L)</h4></p><p>The balance sheet is a snapshot of a single point in time. To understand whether a company makes money, you need see how things change over a period of time (e.g. every month).</p><p>The first thing you need to know is how much money you receive — your <strong>Revenue</strong>. You don't keep all of it — there are costs and expenses along the way — so you need to subtract these. The final number you end up with is your <strong>Profit</strong> — the money you've made at the end of the day.</p><p>Here's how you might do the calculation:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-a4e76259fbb4-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe0c6c8f0be2b6743533b_p%26l.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>You start at Revenue (the top line), subtract your costs, and end up at Profit (the "bottom line" — get it?). This is a simple <strong>Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L)</strong>, or <strong>Income Statement</strong>. Most companies make one every month, to keep an eye on things. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-fec0fade16bf-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe17879b5309ce33ce18b_35274025-14536291245349646_origin.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>With a P&amp;L, you and the bank can understand what's going in and out of your business. If your P&amp;L consistently shows a profit, then the bank will be happy, and so will you.</p><p>In theory, this is very simple. But in practice, each P&amp;L item has hidden nuances to address.</p><p>Let's take just the top line — what does <strong>Revenue</strong> actually mean?</p><p><strong>What is revenue?</strong></p><p>When you started selling shirts, it was a simpler time — you bought them in bulk from China and sold them at the local market.</p><p>Revenue, too, was simple — it was the cold hard cash in your hand.</p><p>But things changed. You started taking bulk orders from shops, who pay you 1 month after you deliver the shirts. And when you went online, your customers started paying you for 12 month subscriptions, all in one go.</p><p>It turns out that if you keep thinking of revenue as "cash in your hand", then things get a little weird —</p><ul role="list"><li>When you get a bulk order, your expenses shoot up. But since you don't get paid until next month, your profit goes way down this month.</li><li>When someone buys a 12-month subscription, your revenue spikes up. But for the next 11 months you have to keep delivering on the order (non-zero cost) without further payments (zero revenue) — your bottom line takes a hit.</li></ul><p>Bulk orders and upfront payments are great for your business, but if revenue means "cash in hand", then your P&amp;L might tell the opposite story.</p><p>A better way to think about revenue is as "the value of products delivered or service provided".</p><p>In each month of a subscription, you do 1 month of work. So even with 12 months' payment upfront, you only recognise 1/12th of that payment as revenue each month. The remaining 11/12th becomes <strong>Deferred Revenue.</strong> This is actually a liability on your balance sheet — your customers have essentially given you a loan which you must pay back each month, in the form of t-shirts.</p><p>The same principle applies for bulk orders — you recognise the revenue when you deliver the product, <em>not</em> when you get paid.</p><p>This is called <strong>Accrual Accounting</strong>, and it more accurately answers the question "Do you make money?".</p><p>So — you've got a balance sheet, showing your current financial state, and you've got a P&amp;L, showing how things change over time. The bank, however, remains unsatisfied.</p><p>Sadly, consistent profits, measured with accrual accounting, can still leave you penniless on payday.</p><p><h4 id="heading-4">Financial Statement #3: The Cashflow Statement</h4></p><p>In 1863, the Dowlais Iron Company had a dilemma.</p><p>On paper, things were great — they'd recovered from a downturn and were posting healthy profits. To smelt more iron, they set out to buy a new blast furnace. But despite their promising P&amp;L, it turned out that they had no cash to buy it.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Their problem was in spending cash too quickly — as soon as they got some, they'd use it on inventory (iron ore, etc). The profits were rolling in, but the cash wasn't sticking around.</p><p>The company needed a way to understand how cash was coming in and out — the cashflow. Their solution was the origin of the modern <strong>Cashflow Statement</strong>.</p><p>Like the P&amp;L, the cashflow statement shows how things change over each month, but crucially, it only focuses on cash — how much you started with, what you spent it on, where you got more of it, and how much you ended up with. In short, the cashflow statement explains the difference between one balance sheet and the next.</p><figure id="w-node-508193268673-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe644e9cf27ec56e99c29_Untitled-3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The bank should now have enough information to decide whether to give you a loan:</p><ul role="list"><li>Balance Sheet — shows everything that you own, and everything that you owe</li><li>P&amp;L/Income Statement — shows how your business operates</li><li>Cashflow Statement — shows how you spend and earn cash</li></ul><p>These financial statements are a shared language, letting businesses communicate across industries and borders. They also "flatten" a business' evolving operations — new business models, delivery methods, and products — to give a coherent view of a company through time.</p><p>Investors use financials to judge performance, lenders use them to assess credit-worthiness, and governments use them to make sure that taxes are correctly paid.</p><p>But the whole system only works if every company follows the same rules when compiling their financials. These rules require years of study to fully understand (this is why accountants exist) and include:</p><ul role="list"><li>How to recognise revenue —&nbsp;accrual accounting</li><li>How to "amortise" costs — spreading upfront expenses over time</li><li>How to "capitalise"&nbsp;costs —&nbsp;turning big purchases into assets on the balance sheet</li></ul><p>Who made these rules?</p><p><h4 id="heading-5">Accounting Standards: Mind the GAAP</h4></p><p>The Industrial Revolution …</p></div></div>
