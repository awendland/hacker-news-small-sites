<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Two years ago when we completed version 1 of The Classics of Science Fiction Short Story list I <a href="https://auxiliarymemory.com/2018/08/18/the-mathematics-of-buying-science-fiction-anthologies/">proposed a math challenge</a>. Version 1 came up with 275 stories. I asked if there was any mathematically way to decide what were the fewest anthologies that contained all 275 stories using ISFDB.org as a reference database. Version 1 was generated using .csv files. Since then we updated the process to a database for version 2 of the list, which produced 101 stories — we believe that was a more practical reading list.</p>
<p>A science fiction fan could read the entire list over the summer by reading one story a day, or in a year by reading one story every three days, but where would they get the 101 science fiction short stories? It might be possible to track down many stories on the internet, but what if people wanted to read them in a printed book? What would be the minimum number of anthologies to buy to get all the stories? That seem like an fascinating mathematical problem to me.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://szymonszott.github.io/">Szymon Szott</a> just <a href="https://github.com/SzymonSzott/science-fiction-anthology-problem">came up with a solution</a> using version 2 of the list. The second link goes to GitHub for Szymon’s Python code and documentation. The first link goes to his bio. Even if you can’t read the programming code you should <a href="https://github.com/SzymonSzott/science-fiction-anthology-problem/blob/master/classics_sf.ipynb">visit this page</a> that explains his solution. Szymon was able to come up with 22 anthologies that collected the 101 stories on the v. 2 of <a href="https://csfquery.com/SearchResult?mincite=8&amp;category=story&amp;sortby=7&amp;list=1">The Classics of Science Fiction Short Stories</a> list.</p>
<p>The photo above pictures eight anthologies that get 81 stories of the version 2 list. Of course, those eight anthologies gets you a lot more than 81 stories. I tried to figure out the solution myself by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BcnkixicU-NtvTrBfwX03vqGSAF5yAorMQTnn-Ytq1M/edit?usp=sharing">using a spreadsheet</a> and the best I could do was find fifteen anthologies to cover 81 stories, and then gave up. I figured my eyeballing method might have gotten me to 30-35 anthologies.</p>
<p>Here’s what Szymon says about the project:</p>
<pre>As a fan of science fiction and a compulsive completionist, Worlds Without End is one of my favorite sites on the Internet. It was there that I learned about Jim and Mike's work on the list of classic science fiction novels which I've been eagerly following. When the list of classic science fiction short stories was announced and Jim blogged about <a href="https://auxiliarymemory.com/2018/08/18/the-mathematics-of-buying-science-fiction-anthologies/">The Mathematics of Buying Science Fiction Anthologies</a>, I knew this was an interesting problem to solve. But it wasn't until I started dabbling in Python that I realized that, along with the 2020 travel-restricted summer holidays, I now had the tools to start chipping away at this. Creating a story-to-anthology mapping using data from the Internet Speculative Fiction Database didn't take too long, but the underlying mathematical problem was harder than I initially thought: it turned out that a brute-force approach of checking all possible combinations is unfeasible. Still, the heuristic used has given us a solution which I'm satisfied with and I don't think there exists a much better global solution. I was most surprised that the Science Fiction Hall of Fame series did not make the list (as I've already read volume one). Thank you Jim for this challenge! Now, all this coding was fun, but it's time to get back to reading: Sense of Wonder is next!</pre>
<p>This isn’t an easy problem. Szymon had to screenscrape the table of contents from 290 anthologies from ISFDB.org, which contained one or more of the 101 stories. Just look at <a href="https://github.com/SzymonSzott/science-fiction-anthology-problem/blob/master/main.csv">this listing</a> to see how often each of these stories was reprinted. Towards the end of his programming loops, he had to use eight anthologies to cover eight stories. If all those singletons had been in one anthology, Szymon’s finally anthology list would have been 15. Most of those singletons were newer stories and there haven’t been enough time for them to be collected into a retrospective anthology. One new anthology could shorten Szymon’s final list.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to Part 2 of my shameless attempt at explaining Docker to beginners. I struggled so you don't have to!</p>
<p>In last week's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.antoniolofiego.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-containers-a-foolproof-hands-on-docker-tutorial-part-1-ckdc4tni0031759s14z0pdd2j">article</a> we covered what Docker is, some of its jargon, and why it outperforms VMs in many use cases in today's typical software development lifecycle. This week we'll go deeper into running Docker on our machines, all while figuring out the most interesting and useful underlying technicalities.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3aGZA6WLI9Jde/giphy.gif" alt="Let's go!"></p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-docker">Getting started with Docker</h2>
<p>If you don't have Docker installed on your machine, head over to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker Download page</a> to get the version that will work on your system.</p>
<p>The Linux version is the easiest to install, given that Docker is built off of Linux utilities. On Mac and Windows, on the other hand, there are two main ways of using Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>
The newer and recommended version of Docker. It is a native solution that works directly along with your OS's processes, so we are free to interface with Docker with your favorite terminal and your favorite IDE/text editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/">Docker Toolbox</a>
This is an old version for machines that don't meet the minimum requirements for Docker Desktop. It is not a native solution as it runs on VirtualBox, so we are forced to use the tools that the Toolbox comes packaged with, making everything more cumbersome and prone to errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main catch is that Docker Desktop is not easy to install on every system. While it is straightforward on macOS 10.13+ and Windows 10 Pro, the Windows 10 Home version needs extra attention.</p>
<p>Docker Desktop on Windows leverages Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's Type 1 hypervisor and only available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. Fortunately, Windows Home supports <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), a Linux kernel developed by Microsoft that allows us to run Linux processes to run natively without emulation. Since March 2020, Docker Desktop supports WSL version 2 as a backend on Windows Home.</p>
<p>To install Docker Desktop on Windows Home we need to install WSL2 first, then install Docker Desktop specifying WSL2 as the backend during the installation process. we can find the whole process to install WSL2 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">here</a> and the subsequent Docker Desktop installation process <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/">here</a>. If you would like to see a walkthrough video of the installation process, let me know and I will work on making one available.</p>
<p>Once installed, we can open our favorite terminal and check that the installation went smoothly by typing</p>
<pre><code>docker --version
</code></pre>
<p>If this returns something the likes of</p>
<pre><code>Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
</code></pre>
<p>we are good to go!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case you are unable to make it work on your machine or if you don't want to install anything yet, Docker also offers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker">online playgrounds</a> to run your code and everything you find in this tutorial would work the same.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-run-our-first-container-">Let's run our first container!</h2>
<p>As we saw last week, to run a container we first need to find an image on the Docker registry. Like everything in the programming, Docker has a Hello World container that we can easily get from its Docker Hub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world">page</a>. As we can see on the website, the command we have to run is</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>which will welcome us with an unsightly wall of output which looks like</p>
<pre><code>Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pulling fs layer
0e03bdcc26d7: Verifying Checksum
0e03bdcc26d7: Download complete
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:49a1c8800c94df04e9658809b006fd8a686cab8028d33cfba2cc049724254202
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
</code></pre>
<p>We can see a few things that we need to cover, namely <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>layers</strong>.</p>
<p>We can check all the images that we have in our machine simply by running <code>$ docker images</code> and inspecting its output:</p>
<pre><code>REPOSITORY       TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE
hello-world      latest     bf756fb1ae65    7 months ago      13.3kB
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we have a <code>hello-world</code> image tagged latest, with a unique image ID (yours may be different) and it weighs only 13.3KB! That is where the gold is! Running a similar basic job using a VM would entail installing an entire OS just to output "Hello world!".</p>
<p>The first column of the <code>docker images</code> output is called <strong>repository</strong>. If you have ever used Git or GitHub, the name might sound familiar. In a Docker Registry, a repository is a collection of different versions of images that share the same base name. Each of the versions is identified by a <strong>tag</strong>, but images can have multiple tags as well!</p>
<p>In general, Docker images follow the naming convention of <code>username/repository:tag</code>. As a quick example, let's suppose that I built an image called <code>mysimpleapp</code> and I shared version 1.0 on the Docker Hub. You could get that image by running</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull antoniolofiego/mysimpleapplication:1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If we do not specify the tag portion, Docker will by default download the image that is tagged as <code>latest</code>. This is not a special tag, but just the one that Docker assigns by default to images when no other tags are specified at build time.</p>
<p>Now that we have the image locally, we want to run it, right? Surely enough, the command to run images is <code>$ docker run &lt;image&gt;</code>. There are mainly three ways to reference an image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By repository</strong>, but it works only if we have a single version of the image (ex: if I have two versions from the same repository, Docker will be confused about which I am referring to).</li>
<li><strong>By repository/tag combination</strong>, which solves the previous problem.</li>
<li><strong>By image ID</strong>, the preferred way, given that every image will always have a unique ID. Note, we can use just the first few characters from the ID and Docker will pick up the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Image ID method, for our <code>hello-world</code> image example we will run</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run bf756
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image that runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

</code></pre>
<p>We have successfully pulled and run our first Docker Image! 🎉 Let's recap all we learned so far by visualizing a repository structure and all the ways to pull or run an image in a simple way</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596760605560/zssexvySE.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Repo structure"></p>
<p>We know how to pull and run simple images! We just scratched the Docker surface, however. Are you ready to go to the next level?</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/570/0*y8AuUHSoTGRqX40h.jpeg" alt="We need to go deeper!"></p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-a-docker-image">Breaking down a Docker Image</h2>
<p>We know from last week that a Docker Image starts as a Dockerfile, which is a recipe that Docker follows to package our application. It is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which specifies a command that Docker needs to run in sequential order.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a Dockerfile that deploys a simple Node.js Express server and try to understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download all the code from this example via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/antoniolofiego/hashnode-dockerseries-expressapp">this</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The folder structure for this example is as follows</p>
<pre><code>📦docker-express-app
 ┣ 📂src
 ┃ ┗ 📜server.js
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜Dockerfile
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┗ 📜package.json
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the Dockerfile sits at the root level of my project folder. Let's now look at its content.</p>
<pre><code>FROM node:11-alpine

RUN mkdir app

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through each step one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>FROM node:11-alpine</code> tells Docker to download the Docker image for Node.js version 11 running on Linux Alpine, a very lightweight Linux distribution. This will be the base image used by our container.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN mkdir app</code> creates a local folder named <code>app</code> at the root of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>WORKDIR /app</code> changes the working directory for all subsequent commands to the <code>/app</code> folder that we created in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>COPY . .</code> tells Docker to copy all the files in the current folder on my machine (my <code>docker-express-app</code> folder) in the current directory of the Docker image (the <code>/app</code> directory).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN npm install</code> installs all the dependencies that I specified in my <code>package.json</code> file, in this case only <code>express</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]</code> is the command that the container will run at instantiation time, in this case, the <code>start</code> script defined in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to build the image. As you can imagine, we have a <code>docker build</code> command that does just that! The standard usage for the build command is</p>
<pre><code>docker build -t &lt;username/repository:tag&gt; &lt;path/to/Dockerfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that, when tagging an image, if we only provide a repository name Docker will assign the <code>latest</code> tag to the image by default. Let's take a look at the output.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build -t docker-express-app .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.013MB
Step 1/6 : FROM node:11-alpine

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Xbox Series X Still Launching November</h2><p>The Xbox Series X is still on track to launch this November. I expect this will be a soft launch, with a range of third party games such as <i>Madden 21</i>, <i>Fifa 21</i>, <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, <i>Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War</i>, <i>NBA 2K21,&nbsp;Assassin's Creed: Valhalla </i>and <i>Watch Dogs Legion</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft will heavily emphasize backwards compatibility on the console, noting the thousands of games that can be played on it. I wouldn't be surprised if it also focused on the 4K/120fps ability, showcasing games that achieve this to help sell the console.&nbsp;</p><h2>PlayStation 5 To Own November?</h2><p>The biggest beneficiary of the delay is Sony. The PlayStation 5 has exclusive games, a clear line-up and vision of where it wants to go. All Sony has to do is announce the price and launch date and watch the PlayStation 5 fly off the shelves this winter.&nbsp;</p><p>As I wrote before, there are no major games that will take advantage of the system's power until next year. But the delay gives Sony a head-start in the next generation. There will be a void and the absence of <i>Halo Infinite</i> could persuade some Xbox gamers to jump ship.</p><h2>Heads To Roll At 343 Industries</h2><p>One of the biggest consequences of the delay could be a shake up at 343. The studio has had over five years since the release of <i>Halo 5: Guardians</i>&nbsp;to get this ready. That would have been plenty of time to get the game ready to be shipped for a November 2020 launch. Something has clearly gone wrong there and I would expect Phil Spencer to investigate fully and make organisational changes as needed to right the ship. Will Bonnie Ross go? Who knows.</p><h2>Microsoft Needs To Get This Right</h2><p>After the disastrous current gen, Microsoft <b>needs</b> to get the next generation right. It cannot afford any slip-ups, nor can it afford to be complacent and rely on the success of Game Pass Ultimate to drive revenue for the Xbox division.&nbsp;</p><p>If I were management at Microsoft and wanted to make a dent, I would undercut the PlayStation 5 and bundle Game Pass Ultimate (for 3 months) with it. Then I would go around making deals with every third party publisher and ensure the system has exclusive DLC/content and new games. Microsoft needs to be aggressive.</p><p>Failure to do so could mean this would be the last console generation it participates in. I expect there are a few higher-ups at Microsoft who would be very happy at that possibility. They are probably thinking 'we are a software company, what are we doing making consoles?'.&nbsp;</p><p>We, as gamers, though, need Microsoft to succeed. Competition is healthy, so we need the Xbox Series X to do well.</p><h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2><p>Halo Infinite's delay is unfortunate. I hope 343 uses the time to make a better game and improve on its foundations, creating a game that will give PlayStation a run for its money. I look forward to seeing the results next year.&nbsp;</p><div><p>***</p><p>If you want to save money on games, take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kinguin.net/cjaffiliate/index/index/ref/cj/?URL=https://deal.kinguin.net&amp;skimoffer=1049864" target="_blank">Kinguin</a></p><p>They have a great Summer sale on at the moment.&nbsp;Good Deals for a Good Week.

<![CDATA[Configure Your Sockets with URIs]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Everybody knows Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. As its name suggests, it’s a way to identify a resource (for instance a file or a phone number).
It is often confused with Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is actually a form of URI. A URL is <em>a compact string representation for a resource available via the Internet</em><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Today I want to share with you the way I define another type of resources: network sockets.
<!--more-->
Everybody knows what a network socket is, right ?</p>

<p>The socket families I often use are <code>inet</code>, <code>inet6</code> and <code>unix</code>. But there are much more types of endpoints: <code>ipx</code>, <code>bluetooth</code>,…</p>

<p>To configure the sockets my services or APIs have to bind, I’m now using URIs! For instance:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>inet://127.0.0.1:80?reuseaddr=true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example I basically create a socket IPv4 on address <code>127.0.0.1</code> and port <code>80</code> with <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> option enabled.</p>

<p><strong>PRO:</strong> It might be specified in any configuration file because it’s basically just a string. You don’t need any complex structure to define socket type or options.</p>

<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>

<p>The URI <em>scheme</em> defines which socket family I have to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>inet</em> for IPv4 sockets</li>
  <li><em>inet6</em> for IPv6 sockets</li>
  <li><em>unix</em> for Unix sockets</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully these schemes are not (yet) registered at IANA<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The URI’s <em>authority</em> and <em>path</em> depend on the family used. Query arguments are used to configure options of the socket. They also depend on the family used.</p>

<h4 id="ipv4-sockets">IPv4 sockets</h4>

<p>For <em>inet</em> family the authority is mandatory. It contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <em>hostname</em> (optional):
    <ul>
      <li>either a IPv4, for instance <code>127.0.0.1</code></li>
      <li>or a hostname which needs to be resolved as a IPv4 address</li>
      <li>if not specified, the default value is <code>0.0.0.0</code>: it binds on all IPv4 addresses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the <em>port</em> (mandatory)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>path</em> is not used in this case, it remains empty.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>inet://127.0.0.1:8080</code> binds on address <code>127.0.0.1</code> and port <code>8080</code>, easy!</li>
  <li><code>inet://example.com:5432</code> resolves <code>example.com</code> to an IPv4 and binds on port <code>5432</code></li>
  <li><code>inet://:80?reuseaddr=true</code> listen on port <code>80</code> and accept connections on any IPv4 of the system (<code>0.0.0.0</code>) even if there are remaining connections in <code>TIME_WAIT</code></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ipv6-sockets">IPv6 sockets</h4>

<p>Idem than <code>inet</code> but for IPv6 and with URI scheme <code>inet6</code>. Some query argments might defer.</p>

<p>You’re probably wondering why I use <code>inet</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>inet6</code>. Indeed I could use an IPv6 address with the <code>inet</code> scheme. However it doesn’t work with domain name resolution. For instance <code>inet://localhost:80</code> will bind on IPv4 address <code>127.0.0.1</code> while <code>inet6://localhost:80</code> will bind on IPv6 address <code>::1</code>.</p>

<h4 id="unix-sockets">Unix sockets</h4>

<p><em>Authority</em> part is not used for <em>unix</em> family. However the path is used like a <code>file:/</code> URI. It defines the path of the unix socket.</p>

<p>For instance: <code>unix:///var/run/my-socket.sock</code></p>

<h3 id="specification--implementation">Specification &amp; implementation</h3>

<p>I don’t think there is already a specification or RFC which tackle this idea.</p>

<p>I guess this trick is already used in <del>some</del> many implementations. To be honnest I didn’t look a lot. But feel free to share your godsend!</p>

These categories are "Do It Yourself (DIY)," "Do It With Me (DIWM)," and "Do It For Me (DIFM)." For each provider we list, your money is protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means you could get your money back up to £85,000 if any of the companies goes bust.

It would help if you have clear goals, know your risk appetite and understand how to build a portfolio.</p><p>When you invest in a fund, please note the fund manager will add various charges within the fund. We haven't included any fund management fees here, just platform and dealing fees. If you would like a rough idea of how fund management fees could impact the total amount you pay to a platform, have a look at the 'Do It With Me' and 'Do It For Me' tabs.

<p>Writing clean, Pythonic code is all about making it as understandable, yet concise, as possible.
This is the third part of a series on Python refactorings, based on those that can be done
automatically by <a href="https://sourcery.ai/">Sourcery</a>. Catch the first part <a href="https://sourcery.ai/blog/explaining-refactorings-1/">here</a>, and
the second part <a href="https://sourcery.ai/blog/explaining-refactorings-2/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The focus of this series is on why these changes are good ideas, not just on how to do them.</p>
<h2>1. Add guard clause</h2>
<p>Deeply nested functions can be very difficult to understand. As you read them you
have to remember the conditions that hold for each level of nesting. This can be even
more difficult in Python, given that there are no brackets to help define conditional
blocks. An easy way to reduce nesting is to convert conditionals into guard clauses.</p>
<p>As an example let's look at this function:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        current_fashion <span>=</span> FASHION_API<span>.</span>get_fashion<span>(</span>FASHION_TYPE<span>.</span>HAT<span>)</span>
        weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        is_stylish <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
            <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span> is_stylish
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is quite hard to parse, given the two layers of nesting. When I get to the
<code>else</code> at the bottom I need to flick back and forth a bit between that and the
<code>if</code> test at the top before I've understood what's going on. This <code>if</code>
condition is a check for an edge case, where something that isn't a hat is
passed in. Since we just return <code>False</code> here it's a perfect place to
introduce a guard clause:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

    current_fashion <span>=</span> get_fashion<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    is_stylish <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> is_stylish</code></pre></div>
<p>We add a guard clause by inverting the condition and returning immediately.
The edge case is now taken care of at the start of the function and I don't have to
worry about it any more. </p>
<p>Having reduced the level of nesting, the rest of the function is now easier to read.
Whether to add a guard clause is sometimes subjective. For really short functions it
may not be worth doing. Where functions are longer or more complex it can often be
a useful tool.</p>
<h2>2. Swap if/else to remove empty if body</h2>
<p>One pattern we sometimes see is a conditional where nothing happens in the main body,
and all of the action is in the <code>else</code> clause.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>if</span> location <span>==</span> OUTSIDE<span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    take_off_hat<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case we can make the code shorter and more concise by swapping the main body
and the <code>else</code> around. We have to make sure to invert the conditional, then the logic
from the <code>else</code> clause moves into the main body.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>if</span> location <span>!=</span> OUTSIDE<span>:</span>
   take_off_hat<span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
   <span>pass</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We then have an <code>else</code> clause which does nothing, so we can remove it.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>if</span> location <span>!=</span> OUTSIDE<span>:</span>
    take_off_hat<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is easier to read, and the intent of the conditional is clearer. When reading
the code I don't have to mentally invert it to understand it, since that has been done for me.</p>
<h2>3. Merge append into list declaration</h2>
<p>When declaring a list and filling it up with values one way that can come naturally
is to declare it as empty and then append to it.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>hats_i_own <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
hats_i_own<span>.</span>append<span>(</span><span>'panama'</span><span>)</span>
hats_i_own<span>.</span>append<span>(</span><span>'baseball_cap'</span><span>)</span>
hats_i_own<span>.</span>append<span>(</span><span>'bowler'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can be done in place, shortening the code and making the intent more explicit.
Now I just need to glance at one line to see that I'm filling a variable with hats,
rather than four.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>hats_i_own <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'panama'</span><span>,</span> <span>'baseball_cap'</span><span>,</span> <span>'bowler'</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Doing it this way is also slightly more performant since it avoids the function calls to <code>append</code>.
The same holds true for filling up other collection types like sets and dictionaries.</p>
<h2>4. Move assignments closer to their usage</h2>
<p>The scope of local variables should always be as tightly defined as possible and
practicable.</p>
<p>This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have to keep the variable in your working memory through the parts of
the function where it's not needed. This cuts down on the cognitive load of
understanding your code.</li>
<li>If code is in coherent blocks where variables are declared and used together, it
makes it easier to split functions apart, which can lead to shorter, easier to
understand methods.</li>
<li>If variables are declared far from their usage, they can become stranded. If the
code where they are used is later changed or removed unused variables can be left
sitting around, complicating the code unnecessarily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take another look at the earlier example.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

    current_fashion <span>=</span> get_fashion<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    is_stylish <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> is_stylish</code></pre></div>
<p>Here the <code>is_stylish</code> variable isn't actually needed if the weather is rainy.
It could be moved inside the <code>else</code> clause. This means we can also move the
<code>current_fashion</code> variable, which is only used here.
You do need to check that these variables aren't used
later in the function, which is easier if functions are kept short and sweet.</p>
<p>Moving the assignment to <code>current_fashion</code> also avoids a function call when the
weather is raining, which could lead to a performance improvement if it's an expensive call. </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

    weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
        current_fashion <span>=</span> get_fashion<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        is_stylish <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> is_stylish</code></pre></div>
<p>We could actually then go one step further and inline the <code>is_stylish</code> variable.
This shows how small refactorings can often build on one another and lead to further
improvements.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>should_i_wear_this_hat</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> Hat<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

    weather_outside <span>=</span> self<span>.</span>look_out_of_window<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> weather_outside<span>.</span>is_raining<span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Damn."</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Great."</span><span>)</span>
        current_fashion <span>=</span> get_fashion<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> self<span>.</span>evaluate_style<span>(</span>hat<span>,</span> current_fashion<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>5. Use items() to directly unpack dictionary values</h2>
<p>When iterating over a dictionary a good tip is that you can use <code>items()</code> to let
you access the keys and values at the same time. This lets you transform this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>hats_by_colour <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'blue'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'panama'</span><span>,</span> <span>'baseball_cap'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span>
<span>for</span> hat_colour <span>in</span> hats_by_colour<span>:</span>
    hats <span>=</span> hats_by_colour<span>[</span>hat_colour<span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> hat_colour <span>in</span> self<span>.</span>favourite_colours<span>:</span>
        think_about_wearing<span>(</span>hats<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>into this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>hats_by_colour <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'blue'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'panama'</span><span>,</span> <span>'baseball_cap'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span>
<span>for</span> hat_colour<span>,</span> hats <span>in</span> hats_by_colour<span>.</span>items<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> hat_colour <span>in</span> self<span>.</span>favourite_colours<span>:</span>
        think_about_wearing<span>(</span>hats<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This saves us the line that we used to assign to <code>hats</code>, incorporating it into the for loop.
The code now reads more naturally, with a touch less duplication.</p>
<h2>6. Simplify sequence comparison</h2>
<p>Something we often do is check whether a list or sequence has elements before we try
and do something with it.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>list_of_hats<span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
    hat_to_wear <span>=</span> choose_hat<span>(</span>list_of_hats<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A Pythonic way of doing this is just to use the fact that Python lists and sequences evaluate
to <code>True</code> if they have elements, and <code>False</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>This means we can write the above code more simply as: </p>

<p>Doing it this way is a convention, set out in Python's <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> style guide.
Once you've gotten used to doing it this way it does make the code slightly easier to read and
a bit less cluttered.</p>

<p>As mentioned, each of these is a refactoring that <a href="https://sourcery.ai/">Sourcery</a> can automatically perform for you.
We're planning on expanding this blog series out and linking them in as additional documentation,
with the aim of turning Sourcery into a great resource for learning how to improve your Python skills.

Providing full Vim emulation was not originally a goal of ModalEdit. The idea of
the extension is to provide an engine that allows the user to <a href="https://johtela.github.io/vscode-modaledit/docs/README.html#configuration">map any key
combination to any command provided by VS Code</a>.
However, most users equate modal editing with Vim and are familiar with its
default keybindings. Vim users really love the powerful key sequences that
combine editing operations with cursor motions or text ranges.</p>
<p>ModalEdit has also evolved by taking inspiration from Vim. Many capabilities
were added with the motive to enable some Vim feature that was previously not
possible to implement. With version 2.0 ModalEdit's functionality is now
extensive enough to build a semi-complete Vim emulation. So, here we go...</p>
<p>Adding Vim keybindings as optional presets serves two purposes: it lowers the
barrier to entry for Vim users who don't want to spend the time defining
bindings from ground up. Secondly, Vim presets serve as an example to show
how you can build sophisticated command sequences using the machinery provided
by ModalEdit.</p>
<p><img src="https://johtela.github.io/vscode-modaledit/docs/images/import-preset.png" alt="importing presets" width="553" height="94">
If you are not interested on how the Vim keybindings are implemented and just
want to use them, you can skip this discussion. Just import the presets by
pressing <key>Ctrl</key>+<key>Shift</key>+<key>P</key> and running command
<strong>ModalEdit: Import preset keybindings</strong>. You will be presented a choice to
import either Vim bindings or any presets that you have created yourself. If
you are planning to customize the bindings, or create Vim-style commands from
scratch, this document gives you pointers how to go about with that.</p>
<h2 id="game-plan">Game Plan</h2>
<p>We start with basic motion commands which are mostly straightforward to
implement. Motions have two modes of operation: normal mode (moving cursor), and
visual mode (extending selection). We make sure all motions work correctly in
both modes. This allows us to reuse these keybindings when implementing more
advanced operations. Our goal is to avoid repetition by building complex
sequences from primitive commands.</p>
<p>In Vim, there are multiple key sequences for a same operation. For example,
you can convert a paragraph upper case by typing
<key>g</key><key>U</key><key>i</key><key>p</key>. You can perform the same
operation using visual mode by typing <key>v</key><key>i</key><key>p</key><key>U</key>.
The trick we use is to convert key sequences that operate on character, word,
line, paragraph, etc. to analagous key sequences that use visual mode. We can
implement all the editing commands just to work on active selection and reuse
these commands with the other key combinations. Consequently, command definition
becomes a string mapping problem. Since we can use JavaScript to expressions to
do string manipulation, these mappings are easy to formulate.</p>

<pre><code>{
    <span>"keybindings"</span>: {

<p>Cursor can be advanced in a file with with enter and space. These are not
technically motion commands but included for compatibility.</p>

<p>Move cursor up/down/left/right.</p>

<pre><code>        "h": "cursorLeft",
        "j": "cursorDown",
        "k": "cursorUp",
        "l": "cursorRight",
</code></pre>
<p>Move to first/last character on line. These work also in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>        "0": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineStart', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "$": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineEnd', select: __selecting }"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Move to first/last non-blank character on line. Also these ones use the
<code>__selecting</code> flag to check whether we are in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>        "^": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineFirstNonWhitespaceCharacter', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "g": {
            "_": {
                "command": "cursorMove",
                "args": "{ to: 'wrappedLineLastNonWhitespaceCharacter', select: __selecting }"
            },
</code></pre>
<p>Moving to the beginning of file is defined as a conditional command to make
it work in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>            "g": {
                "condition": "__selecting",
                "true": "cursorTopSelect",
                "false": "cursorTop"
            },
</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-commands-starting-with-key-g-key">Other Commands Starting with <key>g</key></h2>
<p>Commands starting with <key>g</key> key are bit inconsistent in Vim. Some of
them are basic motion commands, such as <key>g</key><key>_</key> and
<key>g</key><key>g</key>, some are editing commands like <key>g</key><key>J</key>
and <key>g</key><key>U</key>, and some switch between tabs 🤷‍♂️. Since we have to
define all bindings with the same prefix in same place, we take a detour and add
these commands before continuing with rest of the motion commands.</p>
<div>

</div><p>Joining lines without space is done by deleting a character after the join
command.</p>

<pre><code>            "J": [
                "editor.action.joinLines",
                "deleteRight"
            ],
</code></pre>
<p>The lower/uppercase transition works with any motion, but since we have not
defined all of them yet, we explain the command structure
<a href="#editing-with-motions">later in the document</a>.
The structure we use here is exactly the same as with <key>d</key> command, for
example.</p>

<p><key>g</key><key>t</key> and <key>g</key><key>T</key> switch to next/previous

            "T": "workbench.action.previousEditor"
        },
</code></pre>
<h2 id="rest-of-the-motion-commands">Rest of the Motion Commands</h2>
<p>Now we can complete the list of basic motion commands. This one movest the
cursor at the end of the file and selects the range, if visual mode is on.</p>

<pre><code>        "G": {
            "condition": "__selecting",
            "true": "cursorBottomSelect",
            "false": "cursorBottom"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>The logic of separating words is bit different in VS Code and Vim, so we will
not try to imitate Vim behavior here. These keys are mapped to the most similar
motion available. The <key>W</key> and <key>B</key> commands skip separator
characters, and move to the start of the next/previous alphanumeric word.</p>

<pre><code>        "w": "cursorWordStartRight",
        "e": "cursorWordEndRight",
        "b": "cursorWordStartLeft",
        "W": {
            "command": "cursorWordStartRight",
            "repeat": "__char.match(/\\W/)"
        },
        "B": {
            "command": "cursorWordStartLeft",
            "repeat": "__char.match(/\\W/)"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Moving cursor to the top, middle, and bottom of the screen is mapped to
<key>H</key> (high), <key>M</key> (middle), and <key>L</key> (low) keys. These
mappings also work in visual mode.</p>

<pre><code>        "H": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'viewPortTop', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "M": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'viewPortCenter', select: __selecting }"
        },
        "L": {
            "command": "cursorMove",
            "args": "{ to: 'viewPortBottom', select: __selecting }"
        },
</code></pre>
<p>Move to matching bracket command is somewhat challenging to implement
consistently in VS Code. This is due to the problem that there are no commands
that do exactly what Vim's motions do. In normal mode we call the
<code>jumpToBracket</code> command which works if the cursor is on top of a bracket, but
does not allow for the selection to be extended. In visual mode we use the
<code>smartSelect.expand</code> command instead to extend the selection to whatever
syntactic scope is above the current selection. In many cases, it is more useful
motion than jumping to a matching bracket, but using it means that we are
diverging from Vim's …</p></div></div>

          <div>
            

<p>Hey everyone, <br>

Today is a big day for NeuralCam. We have three announcements to make: some news about NeuralCam as a company, a major update for our NightMode app and a brand new <strong>Smart Camera app.</strong>
</p><br>
<h3>
NeuralCam - building Smart Camera Apps
</h3>
<div><p>Let’s start by talking a bit about cameras and AI. </p><p>

At NeuralCam, we think that one of the biggest leaps in technology over the past years has been the advances Deep Learning brought in the area of Computer Vision. It gives computers the ability to see - to understand patterns, images and video similarly to how people do.
 </p></div>



<p>Ultimately, we think this technology will give birth to a new category of cameras - <b>Smart Cameras</b> - that will have a profound impact on every activity that involves capturing and processing images.
</p>

<p>We see this change similar to the transformation from classic cellular phones to the modern smartphone we witnessed 10 years ago. We believe that martphones themselves seem to be the ideal smart camera platform: they have high quality cameras and enough processing power to run modern AI algorithms on-device.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartcameras.png">
</p>

<p>So, we can all have our own personal smart cameras in our pockets, all that’s needed is the right ML software. This ML software is what we call Smart Camera Apps, and these are the type of apps we’re building at NeuralCam.
</p>

<p>Whenever we see a visual task we might say “there’s a Smart Cam App for that”. We’ve been doing a lot of research and prototyping and we’re more and more confident that smart camera apps will play a key role in every industry, from Education through Healthcare to Entertainment, and we can’t wait to contribute something in each of these areas.

</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartapps.png">
</p>

<p>However, the first category that is naturally most likely to change is almost analogous to the camera itself: photography and videography. Thus, this is what we’ve decided to start with, building AI powered Photo &amp; Video apps over the next few years. 
</p>

<p>Our first smart photo app we’ve launched is the NeuralCam NightMode app, which brought Night Mode to all iPhones and all iPhone camera lenses. But, NeuralCam is more than the Night Mode app. We think of NeuralCam as a range of smart camera apps in different categories for various use cases. 
</p>



<p>So, one of the things we did is update our brand to reflect this change. This is the first thing we’d like to show you today, a fresh NeuralCam: 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/nclogo.png"></p>

<p>And this is the new NeuralCam NightMode:</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/NightModeLogo.png">
<br>
</p>
<p>Ok, so that’s the story of NeuralCam - the company. The second thing we want to show you is an update to our NightMode app. 

</p>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">NeuralCam NightMode</h3>

<p>We <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/neuralcam" target="_blank">launched</a> our first smart camera app, NeuralCam NightMode, about a year ago, last August. It brought NightMode to the iPhone and the response from the users and critics <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/30/iphone-camera-app-for-night-shots/" target="_blank">was amazing.</a>
</p>

<p>We’ve been <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/08/28/neuralcam-night-photo-app-brings-ai-powered-low-light-mode-to-iphones/" target="_blank">covered</a> <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/10/25/iphone-11-pro-camera-review-features-with-night-mode-app/" target="_blank">in many</a> <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/30/iphone-11-release-date-soon-specs-camera-night-mode/" target="_blank">major</a> <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2019/08/29/this-app-uses-ai-to-add-a-pixel-style-night-photography-mode-to-your-iphone/" target="_blank">press</a> <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/neuralcam-iphone-app-uses-ai-to-capture-bright-images-at-night-26588672/" target="_blank">publications</a>, got lots of love letters from users, and been recognized as the best NightMode app out there. 
</p>
<p>While Apple has launched a built-in night mode on the iPhone 11 in the meantime, NeuralCam continues to be the NightMode solution for devices or iPhone cameras without a native NightMode - like the newly launched iPhone SE or even the UltraWide &amp; Selfie cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro. </p>
<p>Since its launch, people have used NeuralCam NightMode to take more than 10M low light photos. 
</p>

<div><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/10M.png"></p></div>

<p>Now, with a major update, we have made our NightMode app even better: we've made some major improvements to our algorithm so that it supports higher resolutions on older devices too; we’ve updated the UI to be in-line with the new NeuralCam brand and we’ve officially added iPad support.</p><p>This is how the update NeuralCam NightMode app looks like on an iPad:</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/nmupdate.png">
<br>
</p>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">NeuralCam Live</h3>

<p>The popularity of video calls has exploded lately. In the current global context, most of us use video calls a lot for both getting our job done or to keep in touch with loved ones. For something used as often, we really need to have the best possible tools. 

</p>

<p>Looking at the things out there, we realized that there’s a weak link in all this video call experience, and it’s the webcams. </p><p>We’ve got laptop webcams (quite bad), dedicated webcams (a bit better) or apps that let you use your iPhone as a webcam (best quality). However, these products really only differ from one another in the resolution of the video they provide. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/webcams.png">
<br>
</p>

<p> The problem with webcams is that they’re mostly the same as they were 10 years ago, they do the same thing only slightly better. In the meantime, this cool new technology called Deep Learning came along which could add a whole new dimension to webcams and possibly change the whole video call experience - but nobody uses it. 

</p>

<p>
It turns out that one of the main reasons for Deep Learning not being used with webcams is that no webcam has the processing power required to run the required ML algorithms. Except there is one device which, when converted to a webcam, could do all this: the iPhone in our pocket.
</p>

<p>It’s got one of the best cameras in the smartphone industry and with its fast processors and dedicated machine learning hardware, it is capable of running even video processing machine learning algorithms in real-time. It just needs the right SmartCam App software to do all this. 
  </p><p>We've built this software - we call it NeuralCam Live and it turns the iPhone into the <strong>world’s smartest webcam.</strong>
  </p>
<div><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/LiveLogo.png"></p></div>







<p>
	Ok, so how are we going to do that?
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Technology</h3>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/tech.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>First, we need the software that connects the iPhone to the laptop and makes it appear just like a regular webcam when connected through a USB cable. 
</p>

<p>This software has two modules: the first one is an iOS app that provides the webcam functionality, while the second one is a plugin that’s installed on the laptop to make the iOS app appear as a webcam. Once you install both of these components, all you have to do is select the NeuralCam Live Camera in Zoom, Google Meet or your video call platform of choice.
</p>

<p>So, that was quite easy, now comes the fun part. </p><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/engine.png">
<br>
</p>

<p> The second component we need is the machine learning software to make our smart webcam... well, smart. We call it the <b>LiveEngine</b> </p>

<p>Machine learning, as a generic technology, can help us in two ways when it comes to webcams: we can use it to recognize things in the video feed or generate new video content, improved in some way. </p><p>We’ve developed multiple machine learning modules, some proprietary, some built on top of existing CoreML models and we’ve grouped them in three different machine learning frameworks that cover both video generation and analysis: the Style Framework, the Enhance Framework and the Gesture Framework. Let’s take a quick look at each of these. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_style.png">
<br>
</p>


<p>The <b>Style Framework</b> is a deep learning-based machine learning framework that edits video similarly to a professional colorist. 
</p>
<p>Its Neural Nets were trained on images edited by hand by professionals in a range of different editing styles. The results are quite amazing, generating pro-looking videosf, very close in terms of style to the professionally edited frames it was trained on and it does all this in real-time at 30fps locally, on the user’s iPhone.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_enhance.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>The <b>Enhance Framework</b> contains our set of machine learning models that can enhance a video in a bunch of different ways. </p>

<p>Our real-time video denoising and brightening models in this category achieve levels of quality and performance that are much better than traditional algorithms and make features such as video low light enhancement or face smoothing possible.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_recognition.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>The <b>Recognition Framework</b> is the part of our LiveEngine that is meant to make our smart camera apps understand what they “see”. </p>

<p>It uses a combination of machine learning models provided by the iPhone SDK and adds a number of proprietary elements to detect faces, user gestures or other different patterns in the live video feed. In the app, we can use this type of technology to blur unwanted gestures or guide you to set up an ideal environment for a call.
</p>

<p>Together, all these elements form what we call the LiveEngine - the ever-evolving software module that makes NeuralCam Live a smart webcam.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/NCFeats.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at the actual product. </p>
<p>The iPhone app exposes all of the functionality of the smart iPhone webcam in a simple layout, most of the features can be accessed by just tapping a button on the screen. It also shows a nice preview of the current video feed. 
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartwebcam.png">
<br>
</p>


<p>So, using all this technology, what more can a smart webcam do compared to a traditional webcam? 
</p>

<p>In terms of the outcome they provide to the user, we’ve realized that most of the AI features we’ve built fit nicely in two categories: making you look better and helping you avoid embarrassing mistakes.
</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at these features one-by-one: 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/fiq.png">
<br>
</p>

<h4>Face &amp; Image Quality Meter
</h4>



<p>The Face &amp; Image Quality Meter detects the amount of face lighting, type of face position and background and displays an overall Face Image Quality score. 
</p>

<p>It helps you set up an optimal video-call environment and helps you avoid making typical mistakes, such as sitting with your back towards a bright window or in an unfavorable low angle.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/styles.png">
  <br>
  </p>

<h4>Pro Video Styling</h4>

<p>
  
  Using the Style Framework, NeuralCam Live edits the video feed like a professional colorist would, in a range of different styles. The end-result is a more impactful look, allowing you to choose the style that best fits your mood, the type of call or the environment you're in.

</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/lowlight.png">
  <br>
  </p>

<h4>
  
  Low-light Mode
</h4>

<p>It wouldn't be a NeuralCam product without a Night Mode, right? </p>
<p>NeuralCam Live’s Low Light Mode brightens up your video with a similar (though a lot more lightweight) technique used in our Night Mode photo app. It allows you to look good in video calls even in low light settings, a gentle light from your monitor is usually enough to provide a nice video feed. 
</p>

<p>
  
  And just in case you need to light up things even more, you can use the face-following Ring Light …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>/</p><p>/</p><p>How to Share Your Work Achievements During COVID-19</p></div></div><div><p>COVID-19 is a deadly virus. It spreads super fast and was/is impacting most of the world. Especially the economy and businesses are affected by it. Larger technology companies like Google, Microsoft are all working remotely. Most probably you find yourself also working from home. If it is a technology job or not, everyone needs to get work done. What we often forget though is to write down what we have achieved. This article should teach you how to do properly, how you will feel more grateful for your work and how you impress your colleagues, and more importantly your boss.</p><h2>Working From Home</h2><p>Most of us are forced into the Home office. It might be less than ideal to work from home because of the circumstances. Myself, a software engineer, just needs a laptop to work on. But a single laptop is less than ideal. Most of my colleagues and myself included are working on multiple screens to quickly switch up views. A lot of employees do not have a setup with multiple monitors, an ergonomic keyboard or a good chair and table at home. All of these things will arguably make you more comfortable at your workplace at home or get your productivity to the same level as in an office environment. Of course, some people might even have a better setup to work from home, but this group might be the minority. A lot of companies came up with solutions like a fund for every employee to buy equipment to work from home or offering the employees to get work equipment delivered from an office.</p><p>Another effect on people’s work-life might be other people in the household. Family, friends, or roommates might affect you in negative ways. They can be loud, might not respect your working time, and interrupt you from time to time. Of course, social contacts can also help you to not get socially isolated. There are positive sides too.</p><p>All of these points might affect your work life and with that also your performance at work. In these difficult times, it is more important than ever to keep up efficient productivity to keep your job safe and do not get unemployed. With the rise of more and more unemployment claims, it might be better to play safe and try to get the work environment into a state that will keep you productive. But how can we do this? Of course, the physical work environment might be one part like replacing a chair and table or getting additional monitors but besides that, you can work with your team on keeping up a positive spirit.</p><h2>Keeping everyone up to date at work</h2><p>People like to hear about other people’s life. This is also true for colleagues. The average employee spends 8 hours per day at work and this time will also be spent with colleagues. Not every colleague is awesome but some sympathy shown to colleagues can get you farther in your team, resulting in nice performance reviews and greater career success.</p><p>Most of the teams are connected via a chat software these days like Slack, Microsoft Teams or even Telegram. Human communication is hard via these tools but one good method to stay connected is to do a “Good Morning” routine where every employee writes “Good Morning” in different tones or with different nuances. For example, you could exchange the language to something you know, like writing “Moin Moin alle zusammen” just to bring up something different into the chat. It will also show your colleagues when you are available.</p><p>Throughout the day mostly business-related things are discussed probably within the chats and other communication programs. At the end of the day, it is also important to check-out to signal that you are not available for emergency tasks anymore. During this update, it would be also nice to write down what you have done. Your colleagues probably do not know what you have been up to the whole day and how you contributed to your team’s or company’s success. Describe things you have done, like meetings with external teams, a little bit more in detail so colleagues have an idea of your current workload and what you are dealing with. The first time you will do this review might feel weird, but it will get more common. In the first place, you should also convince your whole team to do this procedure because it will enable employees some insight of the other team members and we all want to know what kind of stuff they were dealing with, maybe we can even help them. A nice gimmick throughout this daily review is to add a random thing or fact that happened throughout the day to you or that you got to know of during the day. It will bring in some personal touch of what your colleagues and you might have experienced. An example summary could look like:</p><ul><li>Worked on the design of feature x to make it ready for development</li><li>Reached out to person y to create a blog article</li><li>…</li><li>Cooked curry today for the first time, was a failure (link image)</li></ul><p>These updates will keep your team engaged in normal life and might not even that self-harming. Everyone is doing substantial work. An important aspect of these notes is that you should mention mostly positive things and never complain about colleagues, the company, or other teams. Try to focus on positivity in the world, except in the fun fact where you can make some fun of yourself.</p><h2>Log your notes</h2><p>Now that you have made a list of work achievement notes already, you can also start tracking these in another application like getworkrecognized to be prepared for your next Performance Review. After tracking your work achievements notes for a longer time you will be able to properly<!-- --> <a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/features/preparing-for-the-self-review">prepare for your next Self-Review</a>. Having the fundamental base, which is the information of what you have actually achieved during the last period, is super important for the Performance Review. So keep your work tracked.</p><p><a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/">getworkrecognized</a> will help you to organize your notes. In the following you can find examples on how this could look like. We use the<!-- --> <a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/blog/how-klarnas-leadership-principles-work">Leadership Principles of Klarna</a> <!-- -->to tag and group the notes.</p><h2>Review Your Actions</h2><p>After writing your actions down for some time it is time to review your mood and behavior. With the actions written down, you can correlate the behavior to the impact you had. A simple task to do would be to look at a random week, check the notes you have written down, and rate yourself from 0 to 10 on how productive you have been. Review your actions, environment, and special methodologies you have used in your work from home routine work out. Seeing trends and optimizing these trends might help you with your work routine.</p><p>Another point that can be reviewed is how your team perceives this daily summary of someone’s workday. Regular surveys about the person’s mood and engagement would help to track this but in general, a simple question would be more than enough. If you see successes feel free to extend this program to a longer time during COVID-19 since it is expected that this pandemic is not ending for a long time.</p><p>With tracking all your work you are already perfectly prepared for your next Performance Review. In companies, like Klarna, a Self-Review is an essential part of the promotion process. The Self-Review consists typically of your bigger work achievements that can be tracked over time. With the routine presented in this article, you have an easy way to access your notes of the past period quite easily. It just gets easier if you use getworkrecognized. Our tool will remind you to write down your notes, even after COVID-19, so you have an easy process for creating the Self-Review and do not just have to look throughout every day’s chat to see what you have done in some period.</p></div></div>]]>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                On November 8th 1969, the "Zodiac Killer" sent the <a href="http://zodiackillerciphers.com/wiki/images/7/7d/340-cipher-hi-resolution.jpg">340 cipher</a> to The San Francisco Chronicle that has never
                been solved, even after 50 years of people trying to crack it.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Hollywood movie called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNncHPl1UXg">Zodiac</a> inspired me to try a few techniques on paper and I decided to create this tool once I realized how much easier this would be to puzzle through in an online format.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since it's been 50 years with no solution, the cipher is either a hoax or it has some advanced transpositions or encipherment that has not been guessed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I might add more features to this like showing stats about sequences, options to save or share progress, and more options to try out other kinds of transpositions such as the period 19
                transposition discussed by David Oranchak in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hk__Hk5c9M">his presentation on this cipher</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        
        <div>
          <p>Early in 2018 <a href="https://f-i-ts.de/">FI-TS</a> decided to build a Kubernetes-as-a-Service solution for
financial institutions. As with every regulated industry, there are digital sovereignty concerns
regarding the control and access of data and compute. Hence, going to the public cloud isn’t feasible
for every workload. So, we got the task to find an enterprise ready stack for our own datacenter, while
also introducing the cloud native digital competency standards.</p>
<h4 id="why-we-built-metal-stack">Why we built metal-stack</h4>
<p>Initially we were looking for an infrastructure platform to run our Kubernetes services. However,
having advanced requirements, we couldn’t find one that fitted our needs. We evaluated different
products, but most of them had shortcomings with regards to networking or set boundary conditions
which we could not compromise on. Maybe OpenStack would have been an option, alas we had no operational
experience with it but already knew about its burdening complexity.</p>
<p>Our main requirements for our Kubernetes services were:</p>
<ul>
<li>fast provisioning (infrastructure and Kubernetes)</li>
<li>tight integration with Kubernetes and its services</li>
<li>high level of separation for sensitive environments (network segmentation)</li>
<li>modern network design and software designed networking</li>
<li>direct Bare-Metal servers without noisy neighbor challenges</li>
<li>deliver a cloud-native experience out of our own datacenters</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we strived for a Kubernetes idiomatic way of handling infrastructure components.</p>
<p>At that point we came across <a href="https://gardener.cloud/">SAP Gardener</a> project. SAP Gardener is a
cloud-agnostic Kubernetes cluster-manager that provides an API for Kubernetes installation and management.
And it is implemented with an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/12/02/gardener-project-update/">Inception design</a>,
adhering to the same Kubernetes idiomatic principles that we set as goal. As we didn’t want to manage all
our Kubernetes clusters manually, this became an important piece to our architecture.</p>
<p>Still missing a proper solution for the infrastructure layer, wanting a fresh and clean take on the overall
subject while willing to innovate, we decided:
“What could possibly go wrong. Let’s build our own…”</p>
<h4 id="our-solution-architecture">Our solution architecture</h4>
<p><img src="https://metal-stack.io/blog/01-why-metal-stack/metal-stack-architecture.png" alt="metal-stack architecture"></p>
<h5 id="network">Network</h5>
<p>Finding a really flexible and scalable solution that doesn’t cost a fortune, was one of the hardest challenges
in our quest. By researching and investigating conferences and talks from the big hyperscalers we came to the
conclusion, that we wanted to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open-Compute Networking equipment (we use EdgeCore Router, but any other vendor should be good), for
cheap hardware</li>
<li>Generic Network Operating System based on Linux for our Routers (we leverage Cumulus-Linux), for
good manageability</li>
<li>Layer-3 separation by starting an VRF instance for every Kubernetes cluster in our environment with
dedicated links for the worker-nodes</li>
<li>an <a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/learn/resources/whitepapers/vxlan-routing-with-evpn">EVPN overlay</a>
network to build a lightweight SDN solution</li>
<li><a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/learn/resources/whitepapers/routing-host-benefits">Routing on the host</a>,
to gain high-availability and scalability</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, we decided to equip every cluster with a dedicated firewall, that connects the private VRF
instance with an exit router to the internet. This is accomplished by installing one of our servers from
the compute node pool with a special firewall Linux image. Also, we have implemented a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/firewall-policy-controller">Kubernetes controller</a>
that generates nftables rules for Services and NetworkPolicies deployed to the cluster.</p>
<h5 id="compute">Compute</h5>
<p>While Open-Compute hardware has interesting servers as well, we were forced to use the existing 19”-Racks in
our datacenter. Therefore, we chose to use a more conservative approach for our compute hardware. As we wanted
to have dedicated links for every server, we ruled out all Blade-Chassis with proprietary switches in their
chassis and decided to buy a bunch of Supermicro Big-Twin servers. These systems have four independent nodes in
a 2U rackmount, that share nothing but the power supplies. Each node is managed by a board management controller,
that can be managed with “standard” IPMI.</p>
<p>As it turned out this form factor is becoming increasingly popular and similar hardware is now available from
other vendors (Lenovo, Dell, …). With increasing standardization it should be possible to integrate any server
that is manageable by IPMI. However, as of today there seems to be no accepted standard IPMI. Each vendor (even model)
implementation has his own quirks. To prevent being caught in a lock-in, we started with a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/go-hal">hardware abstraction layer</a> that can be adjusted to these specific
characteristics. Metal-stack today runs with Supermicro X11DPT and X11SDV boards and we are expanding our range
with every new adopter (e.g. we know that there is someone working on support for Lenovo servers).</p>
<p>Pull requests for additional hardware are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>By default, all systems in our compute pool are assigned to a special management network, where a DHCP server
tells them to boot our bootstrapping agent, called <a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-hammer">metal-hammer</a>.
Essentially this agent does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It collects all kinds of inventory data from the server and uploads it to our control-service
(<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-api">metal-api</a>).</li>
<li>It waits for an installation request from the <a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-api">metal-api</a>,
downloads a <a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-images">machine image</a> and burns it to the system drive
of the server. When finished, a kexec call is made to boot the Linux kernel that was provided in the
machine image.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="storage">Storage</h5>
<p>To provide storage for our environment, we chose to equip each server with local NVMe or SATA drives. We make these
drives accessible as local persistent volumes from Kubernetes by integrating our
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/csi-lvm">LVM CSI driver</a> as a Gardener extension.</p>
<p>To make sure, that data stored on these drives is erased before handing over the node to a cluster, the
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-hammer">metal-hammer</a> either can erase the disks properly (which can take long)
or simply generates a new encryption key for the hardware encryption of the drives..</p>
<p>While having built this environment for the enterprise space, we did not attach an enterprise storage system to our
platform. Instead we use Rook/Ceph on our nodes and we are looking into other solutions for software defined storage,
but this is out of scope for this post.</p>
<h5 id="tooling">Tooling</h5>
<p>As we wanted to have the “Kubernetes feeling” for metal-stack we implemented (almost) everything in Go and tried
to reuse concepts like gRPC or Microservices for infrastructure management. Of course, there is also a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-go">Go library</a> and a command line tool
(<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metalctl">metalctl</a>) for accessing the metal-api.</p>
<p>To make Kubernetes play well together with metal-stack we have implemented a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-ccm">Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager</a> and a
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/gardener-extension-provider-metal">Gardener extension provider</a>. With this
in place failed machines will get replaced automatically and and you can even use the Kubernetes cluster autoscaler
for automagical bare-metal server provisioning.</p>
<p>If you want to get a first impression on how metal-stack works, you can install mini-lab.
<a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/mini-lab">mini-lab</a> is our virtualized deployment, for local development.
It consists of VMs for two Routers (<a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/cumulus-vx/">Cumulus VX</a>), a metal-api
instance and you can create VMs, that resemble the bare-metal hardware pool.</p>

		</div><p>It's Sweden's storied worker protections and climate-conscious citizens welcoming Amazon's ruthless drive for low prices. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Stockholm is preparing for a tug-of-war with one of the world’s most powerful companies — which just announced its entry into the Swedish market — and hopes that its arrival will mean the country of 10 million will be able to change Amazon, instead of being changed by it.</p>
<p>Amazon's plans — dubbed “<a href="https://www.ehandel.se/har-ar-amazon-se-det-blir-en-helsvensk-lansering" target="_blank">Project Dancing Queen</a>,” after the hit song by Swedish pop group Abba — don't have a lot of detail, but analysts believe its Swedish store will go live in the fall, in time for November’s Black Friday online shopping bonanza.</p>
<p>“Amazon has been supporting Swedish customers and selling partners across our different European stores for many years, but the next step is to bring a full retail offering to Sweden and we are making those plans now,” said Alex Ootes, Amazon’s vice president for EU expansion, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon’s turbo-capitalism corporate culture goes against the grain of Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries, which pride themselves in their strong labor unions and sustainability.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls” <em>— Jonas Arnberg, CEO of market-research firm HUI</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But the country also has an affluent, internet-savvy market ripe for Alexa, Kindles, Prime and the thousands of items on Amazon's online store, the company believes. Around 68 percent of Swedes shopped online in 2018, and they spent an average of €200 per online transaction. In total, the Nordic countries spent over €22 billion online in 2018, according to a <a href="https://www.postnord.fi/siteassets/raportit/verkkokauppa-pohjoismaissa/ecommerce-in-the-nordics-2019.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by PostNord, the country’s postal service.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of competition in online marketplaces, and nobody can match Amazon’s massive cornucopia of goods.</p>
<p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls,” said Jonas Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, a market research company.</p>
<p>Amazon will change that, and force local players to adopt e-commerce faster than they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>“It’s a perfect storm in e-commerce now. The COVID-19 impact took us two to three years forward in digitalization. With Amazon’s entry it is going to go even further,” said Kristoffer Väliharju, the CEO of CDON, a Nordic online marketplace. Väliharju is optimistic about CDON’s chances of taking on the tech giant, but said companies without a strong e-commerce game will likely take a big hit.</p>
<p>Initially, Swedish and Nordic clients will be mainly served from German warehouses — known as fulfillment centers in Amazon-speak — with trucks driving up to Sweden through Denmark, and a fulfillment center operated by local partner Kuehne + Nagel in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna, near Stockholm.</p>
<p>Analysts believe local warehouses are inevitable if Amazon is to offer one of its most unique selling points: quick delivery.</p>
<h3>When in Stockholm</h3>
<p>Establishing a local operation will be a major challenge for the company. American Amazon’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/22/how-amazon-is-fighting-back-against-workers-efforts-to-unionize.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-union stance</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working culture</a> is the antithesis of pro-union Sweden. (Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven's political career is rooted in union activism dating from his time as a welder.)</p>
<p>The Swedish labor market is regulated by collective agreements between companies and unions, giving workers plenty of power over corporate decisions. Approximately 70 percent of Swedish workers belong to a union.</p>
<p>“If Amazon wants to succeed in Sweden, they need to work very closely with unions,” said Arne Andersson, an e-commerce expert at PostNord.</p>
<p>Amazon has not yet contacted Handels, the union representing warehouse workers, its political coordinator Emelie Wärn told POLITICO.</p>

<p>“Amazon is welcome to Sweden, but they have to sign a collective agreement. We will work very hard to get them to do that,” Wärn said.</p>
<p>“The fact that international companies takes interest in the Swedish market place is a positive thing. As an employer in Sweden you are obliged to follow Swedish labor legislation, which includes regulations regarding collective bargaining,” said Eva Nordmark, Sweden’s minister of employment, adding that approximately 90 percent of the employees in Sweden are covered by collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>The minimum wage for a card-carrying Swedish warehouse worker is 142.50 Swedish krona (€13.85) per hour before tax, according to Handels. In contrast, Amazon’s Polish warehouse workers who serve the German market <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-amazon-employees-rage/">earn</a> 20 zlotys (around €4.50). Amazon said its workers in Germany earn a base pay of €11.10 an hour.</p>
<p>But the union is confident it will be able to negotiate with the tech goliath. Handels has done similar deals with Japanese fashion chain Uniqlo, Wärn said as an example.</p>
<p>But Uniqlo is not Amazon, and Handels' confidence might be misplaced, according to Markus Varsikko, a retail consultant at Dash Retail, which helps businesses use Amazon's marketplace.</p>
<p>“Amazon is a realist. If they can operate in Germany, they can operate in Sweden. It is an American company with American culture and thinking, and it is far from what we are used to here,” Varsikko said, arguing that Sweden's companies and workers might have to adapt — not the tech giant.</p>
<h3>Handels and Greta</h3>
<p>Amazon might also have to polish its sustainability credentials to appease Swedish consumers.</p>
<p>“What makes the Swedish market unique is that there is a great focus on companies to do good, be transparent and sustainable. For many Swedes, this is even more important than a wide range and low price,” said Niclas Eriksson, the CEO of electronics retailer Elgiganten. And thanks to local activist Greta Thunberg, consumers are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cancel-your-amazon-prime-subscription-save-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">becoming increasingly aware</a> of the carbon footprint of services like next-day delivery.</p>
<blockquote><p>European consumer groups have slammed Amazon for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus Amazon's insistence on lower prices might not be its winning ticket.</p>
<p>The foray into the Swedish market by another e-commerce company, Wish, may serve as a cautionary tale. The American online marketplace, which mostly sells cheap items from China, tried and failed to take over the market a few years ago. The company first wooed consumers with dirt-cheap products such as electronics and clothes, only for Swedes to be disappointed by the quality of the products and frustrated by not being able to return products to sellers.</p>
<p>"[Wish] was cheap, it was a great marketplace, but it was also crap,” said PostNord’s Andersson. Wish did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Amazon's had troubles with quality control too. European consumer groups have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/online-marketplaces-rife-with-unsafe-and-illegal-items-study-shows/">slammed</a> the company for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform. The European Commission also put pressure on online platforms to control scammers and price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>CDON’s Väliharju said Swedish customers are very quality-conscious, and aware of their rights as consumers. Consumer groups and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-big-brands-chanel-canon-louis-vuitton-nike-are-taking-on-big-tech-silicon-valley-at-last/">brands</a> have criticized Amazon and others for not holding sufficient information about their sellers, especially for products that come from outside the European Union that could be dangerous or counterfeit.</p>
<p>“Amazon absolutely could be well met by Swedish consumers in the beginning,” said Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, citing Amazon’s promise of low prices, a big range of products and fast delivery.</p>
<p>“But in the long run they will have to adjust to Sweden."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>The hype is dead, long live the hype. After deep learning, a new entry is about ready to go on stage. The usual journalists are warming up their keyboards for blogs, news feeds, tweets, in one word, hype. This time it’s all about privacy and data confidentiality. The new words, <em>homomorphic encryption</em>.</p> <p>For the record, I am not personally against such a technology - quite the opposite I think it is very powerful and clever, rather against the misleading claims that usually make more followers than the technology itself. The purpose of this post is to shed light on homomorphic encryption, its benefits, and limitations, being as impartial as possible.</p> <h2 id="what-is-homomorphic-encryption">What is Homomorphic Encryption?</h2> <p>Homomorphic encryption (HE) is an encryption scheme that allows one to compute something like <code>Encrypted(2) + Encrypted(3) = Encrypted(5)</code>. While such operation does not shock anyone per se, as a matter of fact, operands <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and result <code>5</code> are <em>never</em> disclosed. Boom!</p> <p>The mathematics behind HE refers to the concept of <em>homomorphism</em> in algebra, a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type. Basically, both encryption and decryption functions can be thought of as homomorphisms between plaintext and ciphertext spaces. This definition explains why the sum of two operands in the plaintext space is preserved in the ciphertext space too.</p> <p>All computations within an HE setting are represented as either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_circuit">Boolean</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_circuit_complexity">arithmetic</a> circuits, depending on the type of computation to represent and the types of gates allowed in each one. Feel free to expand on this at the links provided above.</p> <p>The theory behind HE is not new (as the theory behind deep learning), being the first HE scheme proposed in the late 70s. Since then, many flavors of homomorphic encryption have been proposed, populating the literature with three major schemes recognized by the research community:</p> <ul> <li><strong>partially HE</strong>, supporting the evaluation of circuits of only one type of gate (e.g. only additions or only multiplications)</li> <li><strong>somewhat HE</strong>, capable of evaluating two types of gates</li> <li><strong>fully HE</strong>, capable of evaluating arbitrary circuits (becoming the most valuable and powerful of the three)</li> </ul> <p>From a practical perspective, <strong>somewhat homomorphic encryption</strong> schemes are limited to evaluating low-degree polynomials over encrypted data. Such a scheme is limited because each ciphertext is noisy, and such noise grows as one keeps performing additions and multiplications in the ciphertext space. At some point, the amount of noise that gets accumulated becomes so high that the resulting ciphertext becomes indecipherable. The presence of noise is essential to guarantee a certain degree of security and protecting the secret operands and results of intermediate computations. As in classic encryption, the value to be protected is spread in a large noisy space. The role of the secret key is to decipher and reconstruct securely the encrypted components of a computation. The aforementioned space is usually a very very large polynomial with a degree of 10K or more. In such a context, each coefficient is represented by more than 600 bits. This explains how large a dataset would become after encrypting it with HE schemes to guarantee industrial security. Obviously, one could trade security for a lower degree polynomial and a smaller cyphertext.</p> <p>For many realistic use cases, the only flavor of HE that is considered is <strong>fully HE</strong>. Performing additions and multiplications in an encrypted state are two essential operations to build all other non-primitive operations that are necessary to represent any type of computation. The ultimate goal of such a scheme would be to be capable of performing arbitrary circuits and essentially represent a Turing complete framework.</p> <h2 id="why-should-you-care-about-fhe">Why should you care about FHE?</h2> <p>Because under an FHE scheme no operand and no result is ever disclosed, highly regulated environments are the first to benefit of such a powerful property. Banks, social media platforms and pharmaceutical companies running their business in Amazon Web Services are in fact giving away their secrets. Because <em>“There’s no cloud. It’s just someone else’s computer”</em>. As a matter of fact, doing computation on a system that is being managed by third parties, means that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Operator_From_Hell">BOFH</a> has access to your data.</p> <p>While technologies like AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) implemented at the level of the CPU, encrypt the entire CPU state (basically all the registers) with keys that are not accessible to the other guests, many other use cases require more sophisticated approaches to the problem of data confidentiality. For instance, the requirements for private machine learning go beyond protecting the CPU state and register set.</p> <h2 id="homomorphic-encryption-in-the-real-world">Homomorphic encryption in the real world</h2> <p>Some practical - but nonexhaustive - use cases that would be possible with FHE schemes are listed below:</p> <ol> <li><strong>secure cloud outsourcing</strong> (e.g. sending both data and computation to Amazon EC2 instances and being sure nobody can access them) (already possible with SEV-ES and orders of magnitude more efficient)</li> <li>making the <strong>intersection of private sets</strong> without disclosing the results (e.g. find common records in two private datasets, without revealing any of the datasets, nor the common records if any)</li> <li>training <strong>machine learning</strong> models on private data without revealing the models</li> <li><strong>searching</strong> without revealing the query (nor the results)</li> </ol> <h3 id="performance-and-accuracy">Performance and accuracy</h3> <p>Security and confidentiality usually come at a very high cost in terms of performance. Highly regulated environments that are prone to trade performance for maximum security might be interested in adopting technology like FHE. But what are these costs?</p> <p>Benchmarks (the least scientific version of them) measured from the most widely used family of models in data science, linear regression, with a bit more than a dozen variables are provided below.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Computational cost</th> <th>Memory usage</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>[40x-50x]</td> <td>[10x-20x]</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For the data scientist who is used to train a model in about 1 hour, the same model under the FHE setting would take about 2 days. The same model requiring 2 GB of memory, would need about 30GB. Still doable, if that model is logistic regression. Let’s see how long training a neural network would take.</p> <p>A relatively small neural network that converges in approximately 12 hours, would take about 15 days. And the memory requirements would grow from 10GB to 150GB. However, despite the large divergence in terms of computational cost and memory usage, the accuracy degradation from computation in plaintext to one in cyphertext is negligible. The slight drop in accuracy is usually due to float-to-integer conversions. Each operation performed on a floating-point value decreases its accuracy a little for additions and a bit more for multiplications.</p> <p>Sometimes those overheads are acceptable in some domains e.g. analyzing financial data that are siloed among retail, loan, and investment banking. In many other domains (especially those in which a near real-time prediction is necessary), FHE could not even remotely be considered.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Homomorphic encryption is a very interesting field of research that - like deep learning - has been overlooked in the past years. Different market conditions and innovative findings in tech are making some of the FHE assumptions possible today.

An analogy I would definitely not like to see is the hype around a technology that not only is not ready and but is also limited by the theory of mathematics.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1113">Towards a Homomorphic Machine Learning Big Data Pipeline for the Financial Services Sector</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/IBM/fhe-toolkit-linux">IBM Fully Homomorphic Encryption Toolkit for Linux</a></p>  </div> </article>  </div></div>]]>

		Regardless of the outcome, the election will not stop the rise of hypernationalism, crisis cults and other signs of an empire's terminal decline. 	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chris Hedges </strong>/ Original to Scheerpost</p>



<p>The terminal decline of the United States will not be solved by elections. The political rot and depravity will continue to eat away at the soul of the nation, spawning what anthropologists call crisis cults — movements led by demagogues that prey on an unbearable psychological and financial distress. These crisis cults, already well established among followers of the Christian Right and Donald Trump, peddle magical thinking and an infantilism that promises — in exchange for all autonomy — prosperity, a return to a mythical past, order and security. The dark yearnings among the white working class for vengeance and moral renewal through violence, the unchecked greed and corruption of the corporate oligarchs and billionaires who manage our failed democracy, which has already instituted wholesale government surveillance and revoked most civil liberties, are part of the twisted pathologies that infect all civilizations sputtering towards oblivion. I witnessed the deaths of other nations during the collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and later in the former Yugoslavia. I have smelled this stench before.</p>



<p>The removal of Trump from office will only exacerbate the lust for racist violence he incites and the intoxicating elixir of white nationalism. The ruling elites, who first built a mafia economy and then built a mafia state, will continue under Biden, as they did under Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, to wantonly pillage and loot. The militarized police will not stop their lethal rampages in poor neighborhoods. The endless wars will not end. The bloated military budget will not be reduced. The world’s largest prison population will remain a stain upon the country. The manufacturing jobs shipped overseas will not return and the social inequality will grow. The for-profit health care system will gouge the public and price millions more out of the health care system. The language of hate and bigotry will be normalized as the primary form of communication. Internal enemies, including Muslims, immigrants and dissidents, will be defamed and attacked. The hypermasculinity that compensates for feelings of impotence will intensify. It will direct its venom towards women and all who fail to conform to rigid male stereotypes, especially artists, LGBTQ people and intellectuals. Lies, conspiracy theories, trivia and fake news — what Hannah Arendt called “nihilistic relativism” — will still dominate the airwaves and social media, mocking verifiable fact and truth. The ecocide, which presages the extinction of the human species and most other life forms, will barrel unabated towards its apocalyptic conclusion.</p>



<p>“We run heedlessly into the abyss after putting something in front of us to stop us seeing it,” Pascal wrote.</p>

<hr>



<p>The worse it gets — and it will get worse as the pandemic hits us in wave after deadly wave with an estimated <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">300,000 Americans dead by December</a> and possibly 400,000 by January — the more desperate the nation will become. Tens of millions of people will be thrown into destitution, evicted from their homes and abandoned. Social collapse, as Peter Drucker observed in Weimar Germany in the 1930s, brings with it a loss of faith in ruling institutions and ruling ideologies. With no apparent answers or solutions to mounting chaos and catastrophe — and Biden and the Democratic Party have already precluded the kind of New Deal programs and assault on oligarchic power that saved us during the Great Depression — demagogues and charlatans need only denounce all institutions, all politicians, and all political and social conventions while conjuring up hosts of phantom enemies. Drucker saw that Nazism succeeded not because people believed in its fantastic promises, but in spite of them. Nazi absurdities, he pointed out, had been “witnessed by a hostile press, a hostile radio, a hostile cinema, a hostile church, and a hostile government which untiringly pointed out the Nazi lies, the Nazi inconsistency, the unattainability of their promises, and the dangers and folly of their course.” Nobody, he noted, “would have been a Nazi if rational belief in the Nazi promises had been a prerequisite.” The poet, playwright and socialist revolutionary Ernst Toller, who was forced into exile and stripped of his citizenship when the Nazis took power in 1933, wrote much the same in his autobiography: “The people are tired of reason, tired of thought and reflection. They ask, what has reason done in the last few years, what good have insights and knowledge done us.” After Toller committed suicide in 1939, W.H. Auden in his poem “In Memory of Ernst Toller” wrote:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are lived by powers we pretend to understand:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrange our loves; it is they who direct at the end<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemy bullet, the sickness, or even our hand.</p>



<p>The poor, the vulnerable, those who are not white or not Christian, those who are undocumented or who do not mindlessly repeat the cant of a perverted Christian nationalism, will be offered up in a crisis to the god of death, a familiar form of human sacrifice that plagues sick societies. Once these enemies are purged from the nation, we are promised, America will recover its lost glory, except that once one enemy is obliterated another takes its place. Crisis cults require a steady escalation of conflict. This is what made the war in the former Yugoslavia inevitable. Once one stage of conflict reaches a crescendo it loses its efficacy. It must be replaced by ever more brutal and deadly confrontations. The intoxication and addiction to greater and greater levels of violence to purge the society of evil led to genocide in Germany and the former Yugoslavia. We are not immune. It is what Ernst Jünger called a “feast of death.”</p>



<p>These crisis cults are, as Drucker understood, irrational and schizophrenic. They have no coherent ideology. They turn morality upside down. They appeal exclusively to emotions. Burlesque and celebrity culture become politics. Depravity becomes morality. Atrocities and murder become heroism. Crime and fraud become justice. Greed and nepotism become civic virtues. What these cults stand for today, they condemn tomorrow. At the height of the reign of terror on May 6, 1794 during the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre announced that the Committee for Public Safety now recognized the existence of God. The French revolutionaries, fanatical atheists who had desecrated churches and confiscated church property, murdered hundreds of priests and forced another 30,000 into exile, instantly reversed themselves to send to the guillotine those who disparaged religion. In the end, exhausted by the moral confusion and internal contradictions, these crisis cults yearn for self-annihilation.</p>



<p>The French sociologist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emile-Durkheim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">Emile Durkheim</a> in his classic book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suicide-Penguin-Classics-Emile-Durkheim-ebook/dp/B002RI9XE2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">On Suicide</a>” found that when social bonds are shattered, when a population no longer feels it has a place or meaning in a society, personal and collective acts of self-destruction proliferate. Societies are held together by a web of social bonds that give individuals a sense of being part of a collective and engaged in a project larger than the self. This collective expresses itself through rituals, such as elections and democratic participation or an appeal to patriotism, and shared national beliefs. The bonds provide meaning, a sense of purpose, status and dignity. They offer psychological protection from impending mortality and the meaninglessness that comes with being isolated and alone. The breaking of these bonds plunges individuals into deep psychological distress. Durkheim called this state of hopelessness and despair anomie, which he defined as “ruleless-ness.”</p>



<p>Ruleless-ness means the norms that govern a society and create a sense of organic solidarity no longer function. The belief, for example, that if we work hard, obey the law and get a good education we can achieve stable employment, social status and mobility along with financial security becomes a lie. The old rules, imperfect and often untrue for poor people of color, nevertheless were not a complete fiction in the United States. They offered some Americans — especially those from the white working and middle class — modest social and economic advancement. The disintegration of these bonds has unleashed a widespread malaise Durkheim would have recognized. The self-destructive pathologies that plague the United States — opioid addiction, gambling, suicide, sexual sadism, hate groups and mass shootings — are products of this anomie. So is our political dysfunction. My book, “<a href="http://freshstore.truthdig.com/america-the-farewell-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">America: The Farewell Tour</a>,” is an examination of these pathologies and the widespread anomie that defines American society.</p>



<p>The economic structures, even before the pandemic, were reconfigured to mock faith in a meritocracy and the belief that hard work leads to a productive and valued role in society. American <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+economic+productivity&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">productivity</a>, as The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/magazine/americans-jobs-poverty-homeless.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">pointed out</a>, has increased 77 percent since 1973 but hourly pay has grown only 12 percent. If the federal minimum wage was attached to productivity, the newspaper wrote, it would be more than $20 an hour now, not $7.25. Some 41.7 million workers, a third of the workforce, earn less than $12 an hour, and most of them do not have access to employer-sponsored health insurance. A decade after the 2008 financial meltdown, the Times wrote, the average middle class family’s net worth is more than $40,000 below what it was in 2007. The net worth of black families is down 40 percent, and for Latino families the figure has dropped 46 percent. Some four million evictions are filed each year. One in four tenant households spends <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">about half its pretax income</a> …</p></div></div>

<p>Many prominent figures have attempted to answer the question of what, if anything, makes life meaningful, although they typically have not put it in these terms. Consider, for example, Aristotle on the human function, Aquinas on the beatific vision, and Kant on the highest good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what does it mean to live a meaningful life? This question has been posed by philosophers since ancient times. In his book On the Happiness of Man (c. 450 BCE), Plato asks whether there is any way we can be happy without achieving certain goals or desires. And in his dialogue Phaedo (c. 380 BCE) Socrates asks whether the pursuit of pleasure is always desirable; he concludes that it isn’t, and that happiness lies elsewhere. In the early modern period, William Godwin’s essay What Is Art? (1793) provides a classic formulation of this problem. More recently, existentialist thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus have explored this issue through their writings about existence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, most contemporary philosophers do not address the question directly. Why is it that so few people seem to find life meaningful? To answer this question, I will focus on two main issues: (1) what makes something meaningful; and (2) how can we know what is important in our lives? My aim here is not to provide a comprehensive account of the nature of meaning. Rather, my goal is simply to identify those aspects of life that make us feel alive and happy.</p>



<p>Meaning in life can be thought of as the goal-directed behavior that we engage in as a result of making conscious choices. This concept has been debated by many philosophers, especially those in the existentialist tradition. However, the general idea is fairly intuitive: we all have a sense that our choices matter and that we can affect the world around us. Indeed, this idea is so intuitive that it is practically a tautology. So, what exactly is it about conscious choice that makes life meaningful?</p>



<p>One aspect of meaning in life is its ethical component. This follows from the fact that morality provides us with reasons for action. These reasons can be either moral or amoral, but either way they are the foundations upon which our actions and choices rest. There are three components to these reasons: facts, values, and obligation.</p>



<p>Our lives are governed by facts, and this is what gives rise to the distinction between the objective and subjective. For instance, it is a fact that it is currently Monday. This fact is objective since it is independent of human opinion; in other words, it would remain true whether or not anyone believed it to be true. It is also a fact that I am currently typing on my keyboard. However, facts can be divided into two categories: brute facts and institutional facts. Institutional facts are grounded in brute facts, but they also depend upon human agreement or consent for their veracity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, the fact that it is illegal to drive on the sidewalk is an institutional fact; this is made true by human agreement, but it would not be true unless people agreed or consented to this rule. By contrast, the fact that I have five fingers on my right hand is a brute fact; it is true whether or not humans believe it to be true. The distinction between brute facts and institutional facts is an important one, because many of our facts are institutional in nature. It is for this reason that we can question the meaning of our lives.</p>



<p>The meaning of life can be seen as a function of the facts that govern it. Some facts give meaning to our lives by giving it a purpose or goal; these facts are value-laden, and as such, they provide reasons for action. For instance, I might value health because I want to live a long and happy life. Other facts give meaning to our lives by imposing obligations upon us; for instance, I have a duty to pay my taxes because it is the law.</p>



<p>Meaning arises from the relationship between facts and values. Consider an example: many people value wealth, but the acquisition of wealth does not in itself give life meaning. Rather, it is the value that one places on wealth that imbues it with meaning. This value could be the result of an objective fact; for instance, one might acquire wealth in order to give to those who are poorer than themselves. In this case, acquiring wealth would be the means to an end, and that end would be the satisfaction of helping others. By contrast, one might acquire wealth without any intention of helping others; in this case, the value that one places on wealth would be the result of a subjective fact. It is important to note that this subjective fact need not be an opinion or a matter of preference; it could just as easily be something that one “just feels.”</p>



<p>Whatever the source, values provide reasons for action. These reasons are given validity by our choices and decisions. We can make choices and decisions based on facts alone, but this would not give meaning to our lives; it is the incorporation of values that gives meaning to our lives. In this way, we make meaning out of the world around us. Without values, life would be nothing more than a series of random and disconnected events. With values, life becomes a journey with a purpose.</p>



<p>In short, the meaning of life is found in the relationships between facts and values. If you wish to find your own meaning in life, then you must first determine what makes up your values. Then, you must determine how those facts relate to each other and ultimately to yourself. Once you have done so, you will know what it is that makes up your sense of self and thus what it is that defines your worth as a person.</p>

If you can calculate \(4 \cdot 5 \equiv 6\) in \(\mathbb{F}_7\), you’re good to go.</p>  <p>A <em>zero knowledge protocol</em> is a protocol that allows you to prove that you know some specific mathematical fact, without revealing any information about the fact itself. The proof generated in a zero knowledge protocol is called a <em>zero knowledge proof</em>.</p> <p>Some examples of “mathematical facts” that we can create zero knowledge proofs for include things like:</p> <ul> <li>Knowledge of a three-coloring of a graph (i.e. I know a three-coloring of this publicly-known graph, and I’ll prove that I know it without showing you the coloring)</li> <li>Knowledge of the discrete logarithm of some residue modulo \(p\) (i.e. given public generator \(g\), public modulus \(p\), and some residue \(y\), I know \(x\) such that \(g^x \equiv y\) modulo \(p\))</li> <li>Knowledge of a private key corresponding to a publicly-known public key</li> </ul> <p>The idea of a zero knowledge protocol might seem paradoxical at first glance: how can I prove I know something without showing you the thing that I know? However, it turns out that we actually use zero knowledge protocols all the time! For example, familiar tools like digital signatures are actually zero knowledge proofs. By signing a message, I prove that I know the private key that corresponds to a widely-known public key, but I don’t give away any information about the private key itself. In fact, public-key encryption only works because it is a zero knowledge protocol; if signatures revealed information about your private key, then malicious actors would be able to impersonate you by analyzing your signatures and recovering your private key.</p> <p>Slightly more formally, suppose that you’ve computed \(f(\cdot) = y\) for some publicly known function \(f\) and some secret input \(\cdot\). A zero-knowledge protocol for the function \(f\) would allow you to prove to others that you know a secret input to \(f\) that results in \(y\), without revealing this secret input \(\cdot\).</p> <p>For more on ZKPs, check out <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/">this post</a>.</p>  <p>Like we mentioned above, ZKPs are protocols that allow you to prove knowledge of a specific mathematical fact: discrete log, knowledge of private key, knowledge of three-coloring, etc. However, it’s important to note that early ZKPs only allowed you to prove one kind of mathematical fact at the time. That is, cryptographers developed one protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of discrete log, another protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of three-coloring, and another protocol for digital signatures. But what if we want to generate zero knowledge proofs for arbitrary mathematical functions? For example - what if I want a zero knowledge protocol that would allow me to prove that I know the pre-image of a SHA256 hash output? It would be intractable if, for every use case, I had to go to a cryptographer and ask them to custom-write me a new protocol.</p> <p>zkSNARKs solve this problem. A zkSNARK is a gadget that can be used to generate a ZKP for any mathematical function. Basically, you feed the “code” of a function \(f\) into a zkSNARK, and the SNARK creates a protocol that allows you to generate zero-knowledge proofs for \(f\).</p> <p>As an example, say we have a fake “hash” function \(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\) that we’d like to generate zero knowledge proofs for. First, we can use a zkSNARK to generate a ZKP for \(h\). Then, we can use this generated ZKP to prove claims like “I know a value \(\cdot\) such that \(h(\cdot) = 67\)” - <em>without revealing \(\cdot\)</em>. zkSNARKs also guarantee that this process is “succinct” and “non-interactive”: we can create this proof in linear time, and others can verify it in constant time, without needing to ask additional questions of us (the prover). Together, these properties form a zkSNARK: a <em>Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge</em>.</p> <p>These properties makes SNARKs useful for blockchain applications, where users can create proofs locally, and then upload short proofs for constant-time verification inside a smart contract, where computation is expensive.</p>  <p>A central mechanic in Dark Forest is that the cryptographic “fog of war.” The fog of war ensures that you don’t automatically know where all players, planets, and other points of interests are in the universe; you have to spend computational resources to discover them. This mechanic is secured by zkSNARKs.</p> <p>In a universe with a fog of war, the locations of all players are private and hidden from each other. This means that players don’t upload the coordinates of their planets to the Ethereum blockchain, which can be publicly inspected. Instead, each player uploads the hash of their location to the blockchain. This ensures that players stay “committed” to a specific location, but also that the location can’t be determined from inspection of the Ethereum data layer.</p> <p>Without zkSNARKs, there’s an obvious attack vector - if a player uploads a random string of bytes that doesn’t correspond to a real and valid location, and the integrity of the game is broken. To prevent this, Dark Forest requires players to submit zkSNARKs with every move to ensure that players are indeed submitting hashes corresponding to valid coordinates that they have knowledge of.</p> <p>When players make moves, they’re also required to submit ZK proofs that their moves are “valid” - you can’t move too far or too fast. Without zkSNARKs, a malicious player could make illegal “teleport” moves by claiming that the hash they are moving from is next to the hash they’re moving to, even if the two locations are actually on opposite sides of the universe. Once again, requiring ZK proofs keeps players honest. To use a chess analogy, the required ZK proofs basically tell the contract, “I’m moving my knight; I’m not going to tell you where I moved my knight from, or where I moved it to, but this proof proves that it did in fact move in a legal L-shape.”</p> <p>We’ll dive deeper into the Dark Forest construction and SNARKs in a future blog post!</p>  <p>Like we mentioned above, SNARKs are gadgets which take in a function and output a ZKP for said function. So how do we “feed” a function to a SNARK?</p> <p>SNARKs functions are written as circuits in the Circom language. Here’s an example circuit for our “fake” hash function, \(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\).</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// file: circuit.circom</span>

<span>template</span> <span>BadHash</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>private</span> <span>input</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>x_squared</span><span>;</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>x_cubed</span><span>;</span>
    <span>signal</span> <span>output</span> <span>out</span><span>;</span>

    <span>x_squared</span> <span>&lt;==</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>x_cubed</span> <span>&lt;==</span> <span>x_squared</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>out</span> <span>&lt;==</span> <span>x_cubed</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>component</span> <span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>BadHash</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Our zkSNARK takes in this circuit, chews it up, and spits out a <em>proving key</em> and a <em>verifying key</em>. The proving key allows a prover who is computing <code>BadHash(x) = out</code> to generate a proof that they do indeed know the pre-image of <code>out</code>. The verifying key allows anyone to inspect that proof, along with <code>out</code>, and conclude that the prover did honestly carry out the computation with a known secret input.</p> <p>Concretely, suppose that the prover computes <code>BadHash(4) = 67</code>. The prover publishes their proof, along with <code>out = 67</code>, to the verifier; however, they do not publish the secret input <code>x = 4</code>. The verifier of this proof knows the source code of the <code>BadHash</code> circuit, and also receives <code>out = 67</code> and a proof from the prover. The verifier can then inspect the proof to verify that the prover did indeed compute some valid x, x_squared, and x_cubed to arrive at <code>out</code>. However, the verifier won’t know the specific values that the prover used (<code>x = 4</code>, <code>x_squared = 16</code>, <code>x_cubed = 64</code>) - just that these values were computed correctly.</p> <p>There are two things which make SNARK circuits different from normal “functions” that we’re used to.</p> <p>First, you’ll notice that BadHash only uses three operations: multiplication, addition, and subtraction. At the base level, SNARK constraints are limited to only these operations. There are ways to do operations like division and modulo, but they all ultimately involve breaking operations down into sums and products. The fact that we’re limited to these operations is part of what makes SNARK programming thorny.</p> <p>The second challenge is that each signal in a SNARK is an element of a prime field, and all operations happen inside that prime field. The most obvious implication of this is that there is no native notion of decimals, fractions, negative numbers, or numbers bigger than 77 digits. If you want one of these, you have to make them out of positive integers smaller than <code>p</code>. Another implication is that our operators “wrap around”: the result of <code>3 - 5</code> is <code>p - 2</code>, which is a 77 digit number. The prime is large enough (254) that most of the time this doesn’t matter, but occasionally it can cause subtle correctness bugs.</p> <p>To actually make proofs, we use a library called <a href="https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs">SnarkJS</a>, built by Jordi Baylina and Iden3. <code>SnarkJS</code> uses your circuit to generate proving and verification code in JavaScript and Solidity, as well as protocol paramters and proving and verification keys. This is out of the scope of this post, but you can find a tutorial on it <a href="https://github.com/iden3/circom/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md">here</a>.</p> <p>In the next posts, we’ll talk about the execution model of SNARKs, including the difference between calculation and constraint, and how to do operations like division and modulo.</p> </div> </div>  </div></div>]]>

      <div>
        <article lang="en">
          
          <p>This post lays out an overview of the guiding principles driving much of the
work behind the main parts of the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/">Arcan Project</a>. For
those unaware, Arcan is presented as something as uncommon as a ‘desktop
engine’. The grand claim is that modifying and understanding the entirety of
your desktop should be ‘patching scripts’ level easy if we rework current
popular abstractions and adjust the division of labour.</p>

<p>The principles themselves link together to tell a large chunk of the vision of
the ‘divergent desktop’; a story that has been slowly getting its shape over
many years, greatly influenced by a number of publicly documented experiments
as well as seminal works such as Von Neumann’s “The Computer and the Brain”,
Norbert Weiner’s “The Human use of Human Beings”, Ian Hacking on “Representing
and Intervening”, Jaron Lanier’s trilogy on what the future may hold in store,
as well as the nowadays less digestible amalgamation of +Fravia’s Search Lores.</p>

<p>The overview is quite a long read in its own right, and full versions of each
principle will be added as individual articles over time – If the contents in
the sections here comes off as a bit dense and hard to ingest, fret not! They
are more teasers or appetisers, the full course meal will have better pacing
and technical depth.</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="backstory-and-motivation">Backstory and Motivation</h2>

<p>The Arcan project, at its core, is rooted in assumption that the ‘desktop’ way
of interfacing with computing is inching towards its last of breaths, and
rewriting X11 or JSONifying STDOUT won’t provide much more air than for a final
gasp.</p>

<p>The upside is that this may well turn out to be something positive that
provides opportunity for radical simplification and restructuring of the myriad
of technologies that make out the Rube Goldbergian contraption that is the ‘modern’
desktop.</p>

<p>The first non-academic presentation (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=07nqZIFRDJg">video</a>)
on the Arcan project had a terse, technical-overview style to it, with very little
in terms of motivation or actual intended direction.</p>

<p>The reason for that was that I wanted to keep the attention and focus on “what it is”
rather than “what will it ever be used for”, and carefully note who tries to fill
in the cryptic blank spaces, and with what. This was predicated on the belief
that honest dissemination is done by first demonstrating the feasibility and
soundness of the fundamentals of the tech in isolation; flowery visions,
soap-boxing and sociopolitical annotation are best left deferred to separate
stages should the underlying tech be sufficiently coherent and robust.</p>

<p>It is not, however, some vacuous perspective of the technology as living a life
disjunct from the social consequences of its application, but having that as
the goto default mental model for any fledgling utterances is as much of a
fool’s errand as thinking that it should never be viewed through the optics of
an abstract larger social organism.</p>

<p>The basic motivation for <em>all</em> of this is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am of humble needs and wants: I want to expand my agency, security, safety and quality of experience in regards to all things that computing touch. The largest obstacle to that expansion, right now, is the chaos and complexity of user-space, the dependency creep towards an online ‘service-space’, the peering eyes this ‘service space’ uses to study and repackage some naive interpretation of ‘you’, and how this service space is being used to mutate social- and critical- infrastructure towards something wholly frightening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a personal level, I have coded and experimented with virtually everything
computing since the days of the venerable C-64 (divide it by two, flip it over,
that’s 23) – viruses, anti-viruses; drm protections, cracks; database
engines; operating system kernels; cheats, bots and anti-cheats; emulators
(both interpreter dance and JITterbug); demos; games; parsers for more
formats than I can remember; exploits as well as mitigations. I have worked in
academia, government, military-industrial, fortune-500 as well as fledgling
startups, and got the scars and theses to prove it. The ‘left to observe’ list
has grown rather short over the years.</p>

<p>During this time, the evolution of the capabilities of the devices themselves
have exceeded all expectactions and is nothing short of spectacular. The
hardware and software lockout which plagued the early days is, relatively
speaking, minor; access to both capable devices and deep technical information
has become absolutely stellar, overwhelmingly so. The days of begging companies
for scraps of hardware; scraping public libraries and dumpsters for slices of
information; for quid-pro-quo trading of hacker ‘secrets’ and basic software
building blocks (‘warez’) are mostly faint memories. Hopefully they will remain
as such in spite of troubling signs up ahead.</p>

<p>The counterweight to this positive development is that things have become complex
to the degree that a thorough and deep understanding, <em>preconditions</em> to responsible
control and agency, is a hard thing to come by, and an even harder thing to fight
for. Just add more dependencies and layers! Get it to market! Cash out! Build a
community! Become its figurehead! Sell the community! Pass the plate! Don’t forget
to Like Comment and Subscribe! Oh and this message was sponsored by yet another
pointless VPN from a provider you can’t trust but somehow protects you from a
network you don’t trust. With such words the once so tiny tech snowball continues
its merry way down the mountain towards the village.</p>

<p>No matter the outcome, I have more things on the immediate ‘todo’ in terms of
creative things alone – than I have hours left to live, regardless of how many
those turn out to be. That is a pleasant mental image to fall back on in times of
gloom and doom.</p>

<p>My dedication to this project and the tens of thousands of invested hours has
been described as both ‘a labour of love’ as well as the more colloquial
‘fucking insane’, though personally, I view it as an act of necessity.</p>

<p>Many a times the journey has felt like digging out of a prison using the
collarbone of a fallen mate as a makeshift shovel, fuelled by the vapours of
some faint hope that there is a relatively more free world waiting within
reach, and that the proverbial roses I can smell are not just a hallucinogenic
side effect from some invisible gas deposit that this old canary has stumbled
upon.</p>

<p>The motivation is not all some evolutionary struggle for freedom. The rest
comes from bitter anger, even resentment, towards the dominant status quo and
the trajectory that computing interfaces as a whole is moving along; pandering
to trivial attention grabbing nonsense (‘engagement’) rather than crafting
sharper tools that can claw at the delicious problems that the future holds in
store.</p>

<h2 id="principle-1-professionals-first">Principle 1: Professionals First</h2>


<p>The traditional desktop is a compromise of interests, with the more recent bias
being towards appealing to a supposed ‘mainstream’ audience. This made sense
from an economical growth standpoint within the kinetics of the peculiar brand
of capitalism at the time; the previous demographic was already hooked on the
computing drug - being ‘users’ after all.</p>

<p>The thing nowadays is that the load-bearing mainstream audience is opting out at
a rapid rate and for good reason; smartphones, tablets, digital ‘assistants’,
gaming consoles and so on are all chopping up the generic ‘desktop’ into more
controlled corporate thiefdoms.</p>

<p>Many of the past compromises that were made in order to accomodate this wider
and less experienced audience are also unnecessarily restricting agency,
precision and and efficiency for those (‘the professional’) who possess both a
stronger mental model of computing, and a vested interest in its advancement.</p>

<p>It makes little sense to try and convince your grandmother that she needs a
Free! Open-Source! desktop, and it is a farce, bordering on self-harm, to still
use that scenario as part of some requirement specification for the future.</p>

<p>That aside, the ‘professional’ here is not meant as a vain appeal to exclusionary
hacker elitism – before the numbers of those within such lines dip towards that
of past ‘biker freedom’ seekers such as radio ‘amateurs’, circuit benders and
BBS operators. The ‘professional’ is acknowledging that there is a large number
(millions) of key individuals in a wide gamut of professions that are currenty
wasting much of their time and talents thanks to misguided attempts at software
ergonomics that will try and make due with what the web can give them, but they
should not have to.</p>

<p><em>Revisit past workflows, put the professional first.</em></p>


<h2 id="principle-2-diversify-experience">Principle 2: Diversify Experience</h2>

<p>A long standing maxim in computing is that of ‘mechanism, not policy’. From
a user experience perspective, it is rooted in the assumption that the user
is both willing- and capable- of leveraging mechanisms and configure them into
their own sets of policies. This has largely failed in the ‘desktop’ sense,
and very much stagnated in the command-line processing one.</p>

<p>There are many possible reasons for this, and one likely culprit on a high
level is the marketing gospel of ‘it just works’. This is a rhetoric which
strongly favours a ‘brand identity’ preset of strict policies and aesthetics
at the desktop level and beyond. Its implementation allows for little to no
accessible layering in between the opaqueness of a UI element such as a
‘button’ and the set of actions the idea of it ‘working’ represents.</p>

<p>This turns into a problem when your personal expectations of what ‘just works’
happens to clash with those of …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As a startup founder, I frequently receive questions from friends, family, acquaintances, about how this mysterious fundraising process works. In short, <a href="https://www.startups.com/library/playbooks/funding/structure-your-fundraise"><u>raising venture capital</u></a> funds is a business deal in which you exchange equity, or a percentage of company ownership, for the capital your business needs to grow, in the form of investment funds.</p><p>Rapidly just raised our Seed round in February and now I am currently in the process of raising our Series A in the midst of COVID-19 and a faltering economy. While Rapidly is currently growing despite an economic recession and has plenty of runway from our Seed round, it’s important for every founder to know exactly <i>when</i> they should be fundraising.</p><p>Generally, there are two positions that your company can be in when you as a founder are looking to raise venture capital. These are preemptive fundraising or reactive fundraising.</p><h2><b>Reactive Fundraising</b></h2><p>In a reactive fundraising process, you may only have 3-6 months of funds left in the bank. You may be in a position of going out of business if no further funds are raised. The goal of this funding round is to try to keep the company alive.</p><p>You may be trying to sell a story of needing another 18 months of runway to figure things out and optimize your company to be able to keep growing. This is where bridge rounds from previous investors may come into play, which can help buy time for the business as you raise a larger round.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no or little leverage when your company is in this vulnerable position and teetering on the edge of closing. Investors are going to be especially particular about evaluating your business model to see if it could succeed in any way in the future.</p><h2><b>Preemptive Fundraising</b></h2><p>If you are in a <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-strategic-guide-to-preemptive-funding-offers/"><u>preemptive fundraising</u></a> situation, your company is not running out of money yet and you are generally secure for the time being. You still have funds from your last round in the bank account, with a 9-18 month buffer of money. If no fundraising happens right now your business will be fine. If your company revenues are still growing month over month, you can feel confident in the business.</p><p>In this position, you as a founder have more leverage and have more room to vet potential investors to see if they’re really going to be a good fit for your business. You may have investors reaching out to you during this time who are hearing about you in the press. You are able to evaluate the value they could add to your business, from a stronger position.</p><h2><b>How to vet your investors</b></h2><p>As a founder, you don’t want to just take venture capital money from any interested investor. As much as they are vetting you and your business model, you should also be vetting them. When doing a preemptive round of fundraising, you will have the most leverage and can be more picky in what you’re looking for from investors.</p><p>A few questions that can help weed out the bad investors, double down on the good investors, and keep your options open:</p><ul><li><p>Are they contributing to the growth and success of your business, or are they just asking about how numbers are looking each month?</p></li><li><p>How quickly do they follow up with you after your meetings?</p></li><li><p>How mutually respectful are they of your limited time as an entrepreneur and timely with follow-ups are they?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How communicative are they about whether they are interested in investing or not?&nbsp;</p></li><li><ul><li><p>You are typically not directly asking for the term sheet, but following up asking them if they are interested in learning more about the company</p></li></ul></li><li><p>How high is their interest level in your business and industry?</p></li><li><p>How is the performance of their investment portfolio?</p></li></ul><h2><b>The importance of investor relationships</b></h2><p>Choosing your investors wisely is a crucial part of being a founder and raising money, as these are long-lasting business relationships. Typically in the process of investing from pre-seed to seed to Series A, you will be having different investors in each round.

<p>Most likely, Joe Biden will pick his Vice President at some point in the next 10 days. The Democratic National Convention begins on August 17th and only two candidates in modern history have waited until then to announce their running mate.</p>



<p>Biden’s VP selection has been the largest (and essentially the only) story receiving constant attention related to his campaign for President over the last few months. It has been followed closely only by the narrative that he has lost his marbles which has flared up once again following his regrettable comments about African Americans the other day. One could even speculate that the first storyline has been dragged out by Biden’s campaign intentionally in order to prevent the second from receiving more attention than it already is.</p>



<p>These top two storylines are fundamentally about indecision and a lack of fitness to serve as President, respectively. These are not good themes for someone aiming to get elected President, a role which requires one to be decisive and fit to serve as two of the most primary prerequisites.</p>



<p>I remain baffled by the way Biden’s original VP guarantee has been almost unanimously applauded and totally uncontroversial in the media. If Biden knew his pick already and she was a woman, I would have had no problem with him saying so a few months ago without prematurely revealing her identity at that stage. That was clearly not the case.</p>



<p>The fact of the matter is that Biden had no idea who he was going to pick when he made that guarantee to help secure the primary. This has been demonstrated by months of indecision on the matter with several names moving up and down the leaderboard of his most likely picks. This, to me, makes his guarantee an unfortunate one, though I try to give him the benefit of the doubt that his intentions were good at best and simply to get votes at worst.</p>



<p>That said, if I was a woman, I cannot imagine that I would want the first female Vice President to be selected this way, with the fact that she is a woman being the first and most outwardly advertised criteria. Furthermore, it now seems that our potential next VP’s race has become the second most necessary qualification, although Biden has not as explicitly said so.</p>



<p>I believe that the first female Vice President deserves to be selected at least apparently because she is the best person for the job, not just because she is the best woman for the job or the best black woman for the job. She should be chosen as the best candidate from a field that includes the best of the best regardless of gender or race. Anything else suggests that no woman is capable of landing the position by merit and that is so obviously not true.</p>



<p>Have people already forgotten that Hillary won the popular vote last election? We were well on our way to having our first female President well before this ugly and unnecessary VP guarantee.</p>



<p>Barack Obama won back to back elections to become the first black President. Can you imagine how much less meaningful that would have been if he was instead elected after we decided as a country that we were only going to pick from a pool of black candidates that year? Americans decided he was the best person for the job. That’s how it should be.</p>



<p>Biden’s VP selection comes with added consequence considering he would become the oldest President in America’s history on his first day in The Oval Office. Assuming he makes it through his first term, which is all but guaranteed, it seems doubtful that he would run for a second one. That would leave his VP as the candidate closest to being an incumbent and, all else equal, the most likely to win.</p>



<p>To be clear, I look forward to the day we have our first female President. I just hope she rises to power via election by the people of America, not via selection by the consultants of a presidential candidate who are only looking to assure the greatest possible benefit to his polls.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vue-next (Vue 3) has been out for a while. It is now under release candidate stage which means there won't be big changes on the open APIs. Good to see that Vue has already been stabilized and ready to waltz into our projects.</p><p>I have to say that Vue 2 is already amazing enough. But with Vue 3's new features, it's likely to upgrade our projects to an upper level. I guess the most thrilling feature in Vue 3 would be the composition APIs. Evan You himself mentioned that the composition APIs are inspired by the React hooks. Even though the two APIs hooks and compositions are a lot alike, but from the code base they are completely different. Let's not discuss which is better or promising because I don't really think either framework outraces another.</p><p>In all, it's so happy to see that Vue can also do what React does. Let's have a close look at the new features.</p><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p><h2 id="1-vite"><a href="#1-vite">1.

(For example, data formatting / calculation etc).</p><p>Let's see how Vue 3 doc explains why <code>filters</code> is removed:</p><blockquote><p>While this seems like a convenience, it requires a custom syntax that breaks the assumption of expressions inside of curly braces being "just JavaScript," which has both learning and implementation costs.</p></blockquote><p>I believe it's nothing bad for development without the <code>filters</code>, even though it may cost you extra time on migrating to Vue 3. In my projects, the appearance of <code>filters</code> is pretty a rare case since I could replace such functionality with a <code>method</code> or <code>computed</code> easily.

<div id="outline-container-orgcf4562a">
<h2 id="orgcf4562a">i hope they have emacs in heaven</h2>
<div id="text-orgcf4562a">
<p>
Thunderstorms appeal to me. It isn't just that I'm an introvert at heart, and a nature lover. It's something else, too. Ever since childhood, long before the turbulent adolescent years that gave me lifelong anxiety and simultaneously brought me fledgling UNIX, I've always loved the rain.<br>
</p>

<p>
I share that as a calibration of sorts, to establish that I know when something fits without justification or psychological precedent. And I don't so much seek the rain as the atmosphere it carries, a sort of rarefied buffering of the noise and whirling madness of everyday life, a sort of something-sacred-this-way-comes vestment that drops over the daylight and matches the energy of the day to my baseline mood.<br>
</p>

<p>
So when I say that emacs resonates in a similar way with me, you'll see that I've thought about this.<br>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2b435cb">
<h3 id="org2b435cb">mind mapping and marval priorities</h3>
<div id="text-org2b435cb">
<p>
There was one other time that I discovered something in-phase for me. In the mid-nineties, when I lived in Atlanta, I got my hands on a shareware disc. I was ghosting a book for the retired CEO of a heavy equipment conglomerate, and part of the deal was a primo laptop.  On that CD drive, I discovered a shareware CD, forgotten, with some cool programs.<br>
</p>

<p>
The most interesting of the two were a program called "Above and Beyond," which automatically shifted tasks by juggling timeblocks, and a then-unknown tool from Tony Buzan called "MindManager." I set about using them both, and they were definitely on my wavelength, but both of them induced a standing wave ratio greater than 3.0 in my head.  The ideas came furiously, and the tasks got blitzed at warp speed, but there was no navigator.<br>
</p>

<p>
Unfocused creative activity is a like a drug: it feels amazing, but it leads you nowhere in particular without realizing that you've disconnected from reality.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0999547">
<h3 id="org0999547">enter emacs</h3>
<div id="text-org0999547">
<p>
Luckily, I discovered emacs before I was too far gone. It might have been the timing, it might have been the flexibility, it might have been the fact that I could do everything from one screen (while constantly changing the screen without actually losing anything). Something about it felt right to me, a perfect fit, like rain has always felt.<br>
</p>

<p>
As emacs has grown over the years, and I have grown with it, I've found a way to meet all my screen needs with it.  It is at once disciplined and flexible, spontaneous and ordered, frenetic and balanced. Actually, that's not quite true: I'm the one who's bringing all the contradictions; emacs just provides a flexible vessel that can handle them and blend them and support their contrapuntal coexistence in a sort of seamlessly cantankerous way. And that makes it a perfect fit for me.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org81908bd">
<h3 id="org81908bd">I don't recommend it, per sei</h3>
<div id="text-org81908bd">
<p>
My purpose here is not to promote emacs, but to encourage finding events and phenomena and tools and people that fit your way of being. When I hired into the MAAS team at Canonical, I knew I had found my people. I can be the class clown and the IRC troll and the mediator and the explainer all at the same time, and nobody doubts those roles, and nobody sees that as good or bad: it's just who I am, and I fit, and everybody leaves those jobs to me.<br>
</p>

<p>
What I'm getting at is bigger than an extensible text editor, or an occupation, or a beloved season. I'm saying it's worth finding your resonant frequency, the node where everything's in phase and you can transmit in the clear without looking over your shoulder. I'm convinced everyone has a sweet spot, and once you find it, goals and competitive measures and key milestones dim down enough that you can enjoy life and handle it well, whatever's happening. It's a place where even silence is a source of pleasant sound for you, where the trunk noise is familiar music and the tone is 20dB down on the nose.<br>
</p>

<p>
To indulge myself in the all-too-obvious, it's a place that's right as rain.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Looking at my list of upcoming articles, I keep seeing the same theme repeated over and over.  A sequence table of Numbers.</p><p> Numbers tables are truly invaluable. I use them all of the time for string manipulation, simulating window functions, populating test tables with lots of data, eliminating cursor logic, and many other tasks that would be incredibly difficult without them.</p><p>Is using a table of numbers a hack, as I’ve seen some people claim? No. Show me another way to efficiently do all of the things a numbers table can. Does it waste space? No. The script below will use up around 900 KB of disk space in each database. That’s absolutely nothing. You’ll end up getting millions, maybe billions of times the disk space investment back in terms of ease of development and time saved.</p><p>So henceforth, I will assume in this blog that everyone reading has a Numbers table. And I will politely link to this article as a gentle reminder. But I want you to open Query Analyzer right now and use the following script:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="sql">USE Model
GO

CREATE TABLE Numbers
(
	Number INT NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT PK_Numbers 
		PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (Number)
		WITH FILLFACTOR = 100
)

INSERT INTO Numbers
SELECT
	(a.Number * 256) + b.Number AS Number
FROM 
	(
		SELECT number
		FROM master..spt_values
		WHERE 
			type = 'P'
			AND number &lt;= 255
	) a (Number),
	(
		SELECT number
		FROM master..spt_values
		WHERE 
			type = 'P'
			AND number &lt;= 255
	) b (Number)
GO
</pre><p>There. Now you automatically have a Numbers table in every database you create, populated with every number between 0 and 65535. That’s big enough for most tasks. If you need more numbers, just insert more! It’s fun and easy! And trust me, you’ll use this table. A lot. And you’ll thank me one day, probably by sending me lots of gifts, as a very small token of your appreciation.</p><p> But in the meantime, here are two links with more information on using a numbers table:</p><p><a target="#" href="http://vyaskn.tripod.com/fun_with_numbers_in_t-sql_queries.htm">Fun with numbers in Transact-SQL queries</a></p><hr><p> <b>Update, December 1, 2005</b>: Fixed the insert script for SQL Server 2005; master..spt_values now has a lot more numbers (0-2048 instead of 0-255) so as-is the script was failing. It should work properly now.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><div><h2>Transparent OLEDs <br>(TOLEDs)</h2><p>The first OLED devices were constructed with a metallic cathode, so the light generated in the device exited through the glass substrate (i.e. the anode side of the device). With the invention and development of a transparent cathode, the light can exit through both sides of the device. In addition, when the device is turned off, the device can be transparent.</p><p>Transparent OLED (TOLED) technology enables three key features that have the potential to create a host of new product opportunities.</p><ul><li>Top emission</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Stacking</li></ul><p>Universal Display’s TOLED® technology is based on a proprietary top contact, or cathode, that is optically transparent. In Figure A below, you see typical OLED, where the bottom contact, or anode, consists of a transparent metal oxide film and the top contact consists of a reflective metal. As a result, when light is generated by the OLED, it emits through the bottom transparent surface. TOLEDs, as shown in Figure B, use an optically transparent top cathode, meaning both top and bottom contacts allow light transmission.</p><p>With the same proprietary cathode that is used for transparent OLEDs, TOLED technology can be employed for use in top-emitting OLEDs. In a top emission OLED, as shown in Figure C, the anode and cathode work together to form an optical cavity, emitting light away from the substrate and the backplane, increasing the aperture ratio of the display. This is very good for mobile devices and screens where you can turn the display to ensure the best viewing angle, as it increases the light output and increases display efficiency at normal viewing angles.</p><p><img src="https://oled.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/toled.jpg" alt="toled" width="745" height="877"></p><p>For applications as diverse as architectural windows for home entertainment, retail advertising and illumination, to navigation/warning displays on windshields and heads-up helmet faceshields, TOLED technology can pave the way.</p><ul><li>Transparency: Capable of 70% to 85% transparency when turned off, TOLED pixels are nearly as clear as the glass or plastic substrate on which they are built. When used in an active-matrix OLED configuration, the effective transmission of a TOLED display may, however, be somewhat reduced depending on the resolution of the display and TFT design.</li><li>Bi-directional emission: Typically, the light generated by the TOLED emits from both surfaces. Enhancement films and other optical treatments may be used to direct more of the light in one direction than the other.</li><li>Performance: TOLEDs also offer excellent opto-electronic performance properties, i.e., spectral color emission, luminous efficiency and lifetime – that compare well to those for bottom-emission OLEDs.</li><li> Stacking: Fabricating one OLED on top of another  OLED can be advantageous in terms of improving overall lifetime and also providing a broader range of output color spectrum.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>A rise of data scarcity awareness in analytics has lead to a series of tools that report user behavior with a minimum of collected data. These tools try to hit a sweet-spot of not requiring any user identification (cookies) yet allowing for insights into user behavior. None of these tools would require consent under GDPR (<em>i am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice</em>) and they all (but one) use a time limited identification method such as a hash of ip + user agent + daily random salt.</p><p>Having worked in <a href="https://www.digitalanalyticsassociation.org/">Digital Analytics</a> for more than 10 years, I initially found Simple Analytics and got in touch with its creator Adrian after a discussion on “minimal data” in early 2019 (see below). Since then i’ve found 4 similar tools and tried them all out. Keep reading for more about these Tools, and <a href="https://twitter.com/LukasGrebe">get in touch with me on Twitter (@LukasGrebe)</a> for any feedback!</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tools in alphabetical order</th><th>Pricing in the lowest traffic tier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/lukas-grebe">Fathom</a></td><td>11,67 € / month <em>if billed yearly</em></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a></td><td>5€ / month</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a></td><td>4€ / month <em>if billed yearly</em></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/lukas-grebe">Simple Analytics</a></td><td>9€ / month <em>if billed yearly</em></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/">Netlify Analytics</a></td><td>7,99€ / month</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Netlify Analytics is one of many server-log analytics tools. This one is the Webhosting platform Netlify providing their paying customers a simplified view into their logs</p><p><small>Similar tools i’ve found in the mean time, not coved here: <a href="https://analytics.angelfishstats.com/">https://analytics.angelfishstats.com/</a>, <a href="https://friendly.is/">https://friendly.is/</a>, <a href="https://nibspace.com/">https://nibspace.com</a></small></p><h2 id="implications">Implications</h2><p>A central challenge is tying multiple sessions to a single user without a cookie. No cookie means a big hole in the classic analytics data and a huge set of unknowns when it comes to attribution. These implications are a reason for enhancing or replacing 1990s era server-side log analytics with client-side javascript trackers.<br>However, with a time based salt in identifying a single user and thus explicitly changing IDs to not “track” individual users is new here.</p><h2 id="perspectives">Perspectives</h2><p>Wich of these Tools is <strong>THE BEST</strong> ? As always: what’s best depends on how you define what’s important.</p><p>Lets take a look at these tools in regards to the <a href="https://lukas.grebe.me/digital-analytics/">different areas of digital analytics</a>.</p><h3 id="define">Define</h3><p>„Why measure anything at all?“</p><p>Websites ought to be there for one reason or another. I start the Digital Analytics journey by defining what metrics would be important to look at and reveal more about how visitors are achieving what the website is set out to do!</p><p>Having visitors load your website in their browser is a functional instrument and not the reason for your website to exist. Therefore looking at Page views and Visitors isn’t quite right.</p><p>While Simple Analytics and GoatCounter offer event tracking for arbitrary data points, currently Plausible and Fathom allow configuring goals and showing conversion rates. Plausible allows selecting certain pages or events to be shown as a completed goal. Fathom stands alone (for now) in offering a monetary value.</p><figure><img srcset="https://lukas.grebe.me/assets/images/Screenshot_2020-07-29%20Simple%20Analytics%20-%20Events.png 2x" src="https://lukas.grebe.me/assets/images/Screenshot_2020-07-29%20Simple%20Analytics%20-%20Events.png" alt="Simple Analytics Event analysis"><figcaption>Simple Analytics Event Analysis stands out! You can freely order events on a single page and Simple Analytics will output a conversion rate of the given order.</figcaption></figure><p>With a simple set of customizations, the complexity of defining what needs to be measured seems trivial compared to the classic tool such as Google or Adobe analytics that allow slicing, dicing and drilling down into hundreds of dimensions, Metrics, Segments and Cohorts. But again, simplicity <strong>is</strong> the selling point of these tools:</p><ul><li>“Easy; if you’ve been confused by the myriad of options and flexibility of Google Analytics and Matomo that you don’t need then GoatCounter will be a breath of fresh air.”</li><li>“without deep layers of menus”</li><li>“stop scrolling through pages of reports and collecting gobs of personal data about your visitors, both of which you probably don’t need.”</li></ul><h3 id="capture">Capture</h3><p>Once we’ve defined what we want to measure and why, the second part of the analytics foundation is capturing data and making it accessible in a single-point-of-truth system. This could be your data warehouse or your analytics platform of choice.</p><p>I’ll leave out topics such as tag management, data governance, (data warehouse) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract%2C_transform%2C_load">ETL</a>, solution design reference and other documentation, and let’s look at the data captured:</p><p>Theres <strong>acquisition data</strong> defaulting to Referrer data from the browser and tracking parameters in the URL’s query string. GoatCounter, Simple Analytics and Plausible overwrite the referrer with data from any of the query string parameters <code>ref</code>, <code>source</code> or <code>utm_source</code>. Fathom and Netlify is more conservative in overwriting but Fathom does provide a JavaScript API to change the referrer in a custom page view call.</p><p>I’d like to see this expanded by all tools. Providing a second dimension to the acquisition <code>source</code>, such as <code>creative</code> would be powerful addition for a differentiated analysis. Overwriting the referrer works, but it removes any deeper look for example when the display ad campaign link gets posted to social media.</p><p>Beautiful tidbits: Plausible allows you to see your google search console data right within its UI. If google is the search engine of your target market, this is great as you can see what people search to find your site. Along with Simple Analytics, it also shows you the original tweet instead of <a href="http://t.co/">t.co</a> referrer data.</p><p>As for <strong>behavioral data</strong> - what people do on the site - all tools provide a list of about 4 Dimensions: <code>Content or page viewed</code>, <code>location or country</code>, <code>device type / size</code>, <code>browser</code> and sometimes <code>operating system</code> combined with the two to three Metrics <code>Views</code>, <code>Uniques</code>, and for some tools <code>bounces</code> and <code>time on page</code>.<br>From an Analysts perspective the documentation can be opaque as to how these metrics are calculated and displayed. „Is that 85 phone size <em>visits</em> or <em>views</em> and what <em>is</em> phone size?“, “Do events and Goals extend time on page or are they non interactive?” But it honestly does not matter as the information provided by the data would not change much either way. GoatCounter created a great rundown of the different <a href="https://github.com/zgoat/goatcounter/blob/master/docs/sessions.markdown">„unique“ calculations</a> of each tool.</p><p>The different values for device type / Size are all derived from screen size:</p><ul><li>fathom: phone, desktop, tablet</li><li>goatcounter: phone, large phone and small tablet, tablets and small laptops, computer monitor, computer monitor larger than HD</li><li>plausible: desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile</li><li>simpleanalytics: seems to be broken at point of writing.</li></ul><p>Again two additional tidbits: Netlify Analytics shows you requests that resulted in a 404-not found error and the bandwidth used. Fathom includes free uptime monitoring with alerts via eMail, Slack, Discord, SMS or Telegram Bot if your site goes down. Neat and then you realize how important bot detection is because the uptime Pings show up as thousands of pageviews in netlify analyitcs.</p><p>The <strong>Outcome</strong> category of captured data should reflect the €s earned. Interestingly enough, none of these tools but Fathom provide an explicit tracking of (monetary) values through their goal or event Tracking! I’d love to see this added to the other tools and thanks to this Article, Plausible has <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/issues/256">added it to their issue tracker</a>!</p><h3 id="report-%26-analyse">Report &amp; Analyse</h3><p>Given the cardinality or “size” of the data available, its one page reports all the way down. There’s not much to configure besides the date. GoatCounter, Simple Analytics and Plausible have filtered views for individual pages or goals. GoatCounter and Plausible <a href="https://twitter.com/PlausibleHQ/status/1286590279731077121">now supports a drilldown of referal sources</a>. All tools provide a deep-link to copy &amp; share or bookmark for any report configuration.

It has a higher <a href="https://thedoublethink.com/tuftes-principles-for-visualizing-quantitative-information/">data density and more meaningful ink</a> thanks to showing data on an hourly basis. Though i have to admit that Elon Musk is right in „Things have to look cool if you want people to care“ and frankly plausible and fathom look most professional in their presentation.</p><p>When sharing data with other parties, Fathom and Plausible provide an option to send email reports to any third party or protecting reports with a <del><a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/eigdbwpc/lukas.grebe.me">simple password</a>(hello)</del> and for plausible even an explicit <a href="https://plausible.io/share/SQYCxVdo6kpstJBYuIjRl">shared link</a> that can be revoked. These options are great for sharing data within the organization or external parties. That would be nice to see in other three Tools where you’re stuck with a single set of Login credentials, or a <del><a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/lukas.grebe.me">public link</a></del> to the dashboard.</p><p>Simple Analytics appears to be alone in offering a stats API to create custom dashboards, integrating into other reporting tools, or the like.</p><h4 id="cross-filtering-the-data">Cross-filtering the data</h4><p>I wonder why <strong>none of these tools have implemented <a href="http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/">cross-filtering</a></strong> the data yet! The Use-case is ideal here and would make an amazing drill down into the data set. It’s even available out of the box with <a href="https://vega.github.io/">Vega</a> and other visualization frameworks. I’ve created a little demo of this:</p><section><article><a href="https://vega.github.io/editor/#/gist/681476b574aebd61e468d20726690917/spec.json"><figure><img src="https://lukas.grebe.me/assets/images/crossfilter-3.gif" alt="short clip of cross-filtering two charts"><figcaption>Feel free to Play with this cross-filter on a goatcounter export in the Vega Editor!</figcaption></figure></a></article></section><p>The entire dataset fits in memory and allows for a really smooth analysis. This should be expanded across all dimensions.</p><h3 id="test">Test</h3><p>Essential for a data-driven approach to improvement is a formal hypothesis testing when making changes. The idea is to rule out the influence of external changes on the metrics you’re watching. If the Analytics tool „understands“ testing, analyzing the impact of changes becomes a breeze. I don’t mean a fully fledged A/B testing tool that decides wich variations a visitor sees and all sorts of other things. The only requirement is to have a dimension (just like browser, or referrer) to filter usage data by and thus create a segment for visitors that experienced a specific test variation.</p><p>None of these Tools make that process easy, but it can be done with workarounds.</p><p>Fathom and GoatCounter allow creating a second tracking code for a single site, Plausible and Simple Analytics don’t but you could use event Tracking. If Segmenting for test variations (see above) isn’t an option you need at least 4 numbers: Visits to Variation and Controls, and „Success events“ for both.</p><h3 id="predict">Predict</h3><p>Predicting any metric with these tools is going to be a manual job.

<h3><strong>Wearing a doctoral hat</strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jyu.fi/fi/akateemiset-tapahtumat/promootio/ohjeet/Kulkue_t.jpg" alt="An Academic Procession in the Conferment Degree Ceremony" title="Promootiokulkue">All doctors participating in the Act of Conferment are recommended to wear a doctoral hat. However, it is obligatory only for doctors to be conferred. The hat is used in the day and evening events of the conferment day. In the Act of Conferment, the hat is brought to the auditorium in the left hand, the lyre pointing forward. The hat is put on at the same time with the Conferrer of Degrees. Newly conferred doctors also wear the hat at the Dinner and Ball. For other doctors this is decided separately.</p>
<p>The Conferment of Degrees Ceremony at the University of Jyväskylä also includes a church service. There are no clear rules on using doctoral hats in churches.&nbsp; However, the Conferment of Degrees Committee has decided that all doctors take their hats off during the church service.</p>
<p>The doctoral hat is a symbol of degree and status, and should be handled accordingly. For example, it is not allowed to place the hat upside down on a table. The best place for storing the hat is in a dedicated hat box.</p>
<h3><strong>Getting a doctoral hat</strong></h3>
<p>The hat must fit well on the head. To ensure this, doctoral hats are always tailor-made. All doctor promovendi may purchase the hat directly from a desired manufacturer.</p>

<h3><strong>Hat model and colour&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The Finnish doctoral hat resembles a top hat. A golden emblem is attached to the velvet ribbon of the hat. Traditionally the hat is black, green, red or purple, but different disciplines may have specific colours. The hat colour at the University of Jyväskylä is black, excluding the Faculty of Sport and Health Studies where it is dark blue.</p>
<p>The emblem of the hat is defined carefully for different disciplines and universities. Traditionally the emblem for the doctors of philosophy and psychology at the University of Jyväskylä is a lyre encircled by laurels. Usually hat manufacturers are aware of the emblems of different universities and disciplines.</p>

<h3>Wearing a doctoral sword</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jyu.fi/fi/akateemiset-tapahtumat/promootio/ohjeet/tohtorinmiekka/miekka_miehen_asussa.jpg" alt="Miehen promootioasu ja  miekan kiinnitys, klikkaa kuvaa" title="Miekka miehen asussa">The sword used in the conferment act is the officially certified civilian sword of the independent Republic of Finland. It comes with a scabbard, a black or golden scabbard holder and the golden emblem of the University. The total length of the sword is 87 centimetres, the blade being 75 centimetres. The weight of the sword is 730 grams (1.6 pounds).</p>
<p>The sword is traditionally carried on the left side. Men carry the sword in the scabbard holder, which is attached to a firm loop sewn into trousers. A catch on the holder keeps the sword firmly in its place. <em>(Click the image to enlarge.)</em></p>
<p>Female doctors should also have a sword. In most cases, the sword cannot be directly attached to dresses because the material is not strong enough. For carrying the sword, ladies’ outfits for the conferment day should include a belt or other similar aid that matches the outfit. The sword can be attached creatively, for example, by wearing the belt under the skirt and taking out some of the seam. In a two-piece outfit, the fastening can be hidden under the top. If it is unreasonably difficult to modify the outfit, the sword can also be carried in the left hand.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR: </strong>Querying materialized views, unlike querying tables or logical views, can reduce query costs by maintaining results in memory that are only updated when necessary. To learn more, check out the rest of the post!</p>
<h2><b>The Cost of Querying</b></h2>
<p>Each time you query a database you incur some cost. Your database will parse, validate, plan, optimize, and execute your query, using up wall clock time, CPU time, memory, opportunity cost, and, potentially, actual dollars. As you grow your application, you will likely wonder how you can reduce these costs.</p>
<p>To dig into this, let’s look at an example. Imagine you work at a company that sells widgets. Each time a widget is sold, you record some purchase information in a <code>purchase</code> table that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg" alt="" width="454" height="177" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1024x401.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-768x301.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1536x601.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-2048x802.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1024x401.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-768x301.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-1536x601.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Purchase-1-2048x802.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>With this data, you can answer questions that are critical to your business: what’s our best selling widget? Which widgets need to be shipped today? And, the evergreen question: how much money have we made?</p>
<p>Each of these questions can be answered by querying the <code>purchase</code> table directly. For example, you could calculate your total revenue with the following query:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="107" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1024x242.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-768x182.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1536x363.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-2048x484.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-300x71.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1024x242.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-768x182.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-1536x363.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-1-2048x484.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>When this query is run, your database will scan each row of the <code>purchase</code> table to aggregate the values in the <code>amount</code> column. Your database will have spent <code>X</code> resources to return your result. (As mentioned before, <code>X</code> is comprised of wall clock time, CPU time, memory, opportunity cost, and dollars.)</p>
<p>The good news is you’re happy to pay <code>X</code> because this information is important and valuable to your business. <strong>The bad news is that you will pay <code>X</code> each time</strong> <strong>your query is run</strong>. Because queries against tables and views do not reference previous results, they are forced to completely recalculate their results each time.<b></b></p>
<p>You might be wondering: is this a big deal? If your query is exploratory, ad hoc, or infrequent, it’s probably not. But what if you suddenly needed to calculate total revenue once an hour instead of once a day? Or once a second?</p>

<p>Suddenly, even a small <code>X</code> starts to feel expensive. As your queries are run more frequently, process more data, or perform more complex computation, these costs may even feel prohibitive. So, what can you do instead?</p>
<h2><b>Materialized Views</b></h2>
<p>Unlike queries that calculate their results from tables and views, queries that read from materialized views do not recalculate their results each time. To understand why, let’s create a materialized view together.</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="102" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1024x215.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-768x161.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1536x323.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-2048x430.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-300x63.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1024x215.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-768x161.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-1536x323.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Materialized-view-1-1-2048x430.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>When this statement is executed, your database will run your query once to calculate the result. Then, it will physically store that result in a newly created database object — in our case an object named <code>total_revenue</code>. Now when you query <code>total_revenue</code>, your database will return the results stored in <code>total_revenue</code> without performing any additional computation.</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-300x104.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-300x104.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="208" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-300x104.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-1024x355.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-768x267.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-1536x533.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-2048x711.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-300x104.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-1024x355.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-768x267.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-1536x533.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Query-tr-1-2048x711.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>This means that unlike querying a view directly, you only pay the cost of your query once when creating a materialized view.* Future queries will pay some constant cost <code>1</code> to read from <code>total_revenue</code>, instead of <code>X</code>.</p>
<p>This seems like a perfect solution for our problem, so what’s the catch? Why don’t we use materialized views for everything?</p>
<h2><b>Two Catches*</b></h2>
<p>The first catch is that you pay for materialized views with memory. While materialized views physically storing prior results reduces your query cost from <code>X</code> to <code>1</code>, it also requires memory that was not required to simply query a table or a logical view.</p>
<p>The second, trickier catch surfaces when a new purchase is added to the <code>purchase</code> table. To illustrate, let’s walk through this scenario together.</p>

<p>Noticing that we have a new sale in our <code>purchase</code> table, we query our materialized view for our updated total revenue. But, we get back our old value. What gives?</p>

<p>When we created our materialized view, our database ran our query once to store the results in <code>total_revenue</code>. However, since the query was run&nbsp;<em>before</em> the newest purchase was added to the <code>purchase</code> table, the result calculated and stored in <code>total_revenue</code> does not take this new purchase into account. To update the result to include new purchases, you will have to&nbsp;<strong>refresh</strong> the materialized view. Generally, there are two mechanisms for refreshing materialized views: complete refreshes or incremental refreshes.</p>
<p>Complete refreshes rerun the query underlying a materialized view to completely recalculate and replace the stored results. Just like queries against tables and views, every complete refresh will cost <code>X</code>. To complicate matters, you will have to decide <em>when</em> to perform a refresh: when someone queries the view? Once an hour? Once a week? You will want to choose a cadence that does not force the database to do unnecessary work. For example, you don’t want to pay <code>X</code> recompute <code>total_revenue</code> if there are no new purchases. In real world systems, users will have to choose a refresh schedule that maintains a careful balance between data freshness requirements and acceptable query costs.</p>
<p>By contrast, incremental refreshes keep materialized views up to date by only performing work only on data that has changed. To return to our example, instead of rescanning each row of the <code>purchase</code> table to calculate the sum, an incrementally maintained materialized view would only do the following work:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="214" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-768x365.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1536x730.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-2048x973.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-300x143.jpg 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-768x365.jpg 768w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-1536x730.jpg 1536w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Aug-10-2020-13_14-1-2048x973.jpg 2048w"></p>
<p>This means that instead of paying <code>X</code> to refresh the view, your database will only pay a fraction of <code>X</code> proportional to the size of the changed data. And, because this refresh mechanism is triggered by changes in the underlying data, you can be certain that your database is refreshing your view no more than necessary. In our example, <code>total_revenue</code> will only be updated when a row in the <code>purchase</code> table is inserted, updated, or deleted.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>Creating and maintaining a materialized view can reduce the query costs paid for expensive or frequently run queries. However, the potential cost reduction of a materialized view greatly depends on its underlying refresh mechanism. Only incremental refreshes can reduce the per-refresh cost of maintaining a materialized view while also ensuring that views are updated no more than necessary.</p>
<p>While incremental refreshes are available in a handful of databases, they often come with a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DWHSG/basicmv.htm#GUID-505C24CF-5D56-4820-88AA-2221410950E7">long list of restrictions</a>. At the moment, Materialize is the only system that supports incremental maintained materialized views without restriction.

<p><span>T</span>he evening of June 13, 2020, was like any other for Raya Sharbain: filled with online distractions. Sharbain, a program coordinator at Jordan Open Source Association, was browsing social media when news of an Egyptian woman’s suicide flooded her feeds. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/16/sarah-hegazi-egypt-pride-flag-suicide/">Sarah Hegazi</a>, a lesbian activist who had been imprisoned by Egyptian authorities after waving a rainbow flag at a concert, had taken her own life after a long battle with PTSD. </p>



<p>Two days later, Sharbain, who edits Wikipedia pages in her free time, went to Hegazi’s page. Her last name had been spelled incorrectly, so Sharbain fixed the mistake. She clicked on the Arabic version of the page and noticed the activist’s cause of death was listed as “murder,” even though reputable outlets were reporting it as suicide. Sharbain opened the edit tab once more. Suddenly, the entire page was nominated for deletion by other editors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a collaborative encyclopedia, Wikipedia is technically an open-access platform, but its community of Arabic language editors is an increasing source of controversy. Critics say the fate of Hegazi’s page — which remained deleted at the time of this article’s publication — is part of a greater culture of conservatism that pervades Arabic Wikipedia, making it difficult for Wikipedians to post about subjects seen as taboo in Arab society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The gatekeepers</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Hosted by the California-based <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, Wikipedia relies on volunteer editors, who can apply for administrative authority once they’ve gained the trust of their respective communities. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator">admins</a> effectively function as gatekeepers to Wikipedia posts: they can block or unblock accounts, protect pages from edits, and delete, revive, or rename pages without restriction.</p>



<p>Wikipedia articles exist in more than 300 languages, each with its own community of editors and administrators. For Arabic Wikipedians, editing and posting content can be uniquely challenging. Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, Arabic readers face a huge disparity when it comes to online content. Some estimate that only <a href="https://www.communicateonline.me/in-depth/why-arabic-content-creation-is-a-major-business-opportunity-for-content-creators/">3% of the internet is written</a> in Arabic. Arabic Wikipedia, which averaged some <a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/ar.wikipedia.org">300 million views</a> a month in the first half of this year, exhibits similar disparities. In 2018, Hebrew Wikipedia had <a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/Sitemap.htm">108</a> editors per million speakers. Arabic Wikipedia had two. This lack of manpower has resulted in a smaller group of admins too: while Arabic Wikipedia has <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">26</a> admins, Icelandic, for example, has <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">28</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>In 2018, Hebrew Wikipedia had&nbsp;108&nbsp;editors per million speakers. Arabic Wikipedia had two.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The limited number of Arabic editors and administrators has resulted in an environment that, some critics say, is closed off or even hostile to newcomers who seek to edit and create posts about controversial subjects. Samir El Sharbaty, a Cairo-based brand associate at Wikimedia Foundation, says Arabic Wikipedia suffers from more gender bias than Wikipedia in other languages. “It has a long way to go in order to reach a better level of representation and neutrality,” he says. Afek Ben Chahed, the only woman in the <a href="https://meta.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/Arab_Wikimedians_Committee?fbclid=IwAR02ue2cBQYRR_VhM3eWU5jWwTOeIki4ivfJdyNNdxo_ygUvOzNkSZ2jwJo">Arab Wikimedians Committee</a>, says many of the admins appear to have a conservative or religious bias.</p>



<p>For Sharbain, who has organized multiple edit-a-thons and workshops with Wikipedia and Wikidata across the United Kingdom and Jordan, editing articles about topics that interest her is uniquely satisfying. She likes to create entries for her favorite Arabic alternative bands, upload pictures she’s taken of landscapes or concerts, and edit English Wikipedias about Jordinian politics. She says Hegazi is an important person to document because her story is testament to the brutality of the Egyptian government, which tends not to be well-documented in the Middle East. Including Hegazi in the encyclopedia ensures her legacy.</p>



<h3><strong>Notability criteria&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Hegazi, a 30-year-old software developer, committed suicide after being imprisoned, sexually assaulted, and electrocuted for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/16/sarah-hegazi-egypt-pride-flag-suicide/">three months</a> in an Egyptian prison. Her ordeal began in September 2017 after she waved a rainbow flag during a performance by the Lebanese alternative rock band Mashrou’ Leila, whose frontman is openly gay. The band’s strong stance on sexuality — <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/inside-egypts-lgbt-crackdown-one-bands-story-197835/">their songs openly address gender and politics</a> — has sparked backlash in many Arab countries. Their concert in Cairo marked a turning point: within days, an image of Hegazi smiling with a rainbow flag had circulated on social media, and the<strong> </strong>country’s musicians’ syndicate banned Mashrou’ Leila from entering Egypt. Authorities used the moment to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/30/egypt-stop-anti-lgbt-crackdown-intimidation">launch one of the biggest crackdowns</a> on the country’s LGBTIQ community in years, arresting dozens of concertgoers on “debauchery” charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://madamasr.com/en/2020/06/15/opinion/u/a-year-after-the-rainbow-flag-controversy/">After</a> her release from prison in early 2018, Hegazi lost her job, left her family, and fled to Canada, where she sought asylum. She continued to write about her struggles with PTSD, anxiety, and trauma, but the turmoil of her ordeal weighed on her. “To the world,” Hegazi wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/nadeenhaidar/status/1272285954062123009">in a final letter</a>, “you were cruel to a great extent, but I forgive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharbain, whose hair is short and closely cropped like Hegazi’s, was upset by the deletion of her page, midedit, at first. But when she joined the “talk page,” where volunteer editors discuss issues with articles, she saw editors and admins debating whether Hegazi had warranted an entry to begin with. Sharbain commented that Hegazi met the “notability” criteria, which are among the requirements for individuals to receive biographies on Wikipedia. She initially thought that the discussion was a vote, so she called on her fellow Wikipedian friends to join in (23 voted in favor of keeping the article deleted; 18 voted to republish it), but later she realized that the final decision was made by one administrator. On June 22, a week after Hegazi’s death, an administrator with the username Dr-Taher sent a note: “Delete. Thank you all.”</p>



<p>Now, if you search for “Sarah Hegazi” on Arabic Wikipedia, the site yields no results (though the Arabic-language sidebar of Hegazi’s English Wikipedia page redirects you to a short paragraph about her suicide on a page about LGBTIQ rights in Egypt). For Sharbain and other Wikipedians, it was difficult to ignore editors’ obsession with whether Hegazi was notable enough to merit her own entry in Arabic. Even after Dr-Taher deleted her page, the fight to republish it continued in Facebook Wikipedia groups. Sharbain told <em>Rest of World</em> that when one commenter asked who Hegazi was, “Another editor derisively responded, ‘The atheist who killed herself.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michel Bakni, an administrator and a top editor at Wikipedia, insists that the deletion of Hegazi’s biography had nothing to do with admin bias. Bakni says the matter was simple: she didn’t cross the threshold for notability. As for how Hegazi became eligible for an English Wikipedia post, he notes that each Wikipedia community manages itself; “eligibility” does not mean the same thing for English Wikipedia and its Arabic counterpart.</p>



<p>But the criteria for notability within Arabic Wikipedia remains subjective. Last year, a similar debate among Wikipedians occured after <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1548306/middle-east">Israa Ghareeb</a>, a 21-year-old Palestinian makeup artist from the West Bank, was reportedly murdered by members of her family in an apparent honor killing after posting a story on Instagram with her soon-to-be fiancé. Although thousands protested her murder after the news went viral, admins said she didn’t meet the criteria for a Wikipedia post. And yet <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A_%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%B4">Shady Habash,</a> an Egyptian filmmaker who was imprisoned for mocking Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and died in jail earlier this year, was deemed worthy by admins. Habash’s demise mirrors Hegazi’s: their deaths were the result of the same authoritarian regime, but only one appears on Arabic Wikipedia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Visibility online and offline&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The availability of accurate Arabic LGBTIQ content online, especially for those who are part of the community in these countries, is often a deciding factor in how others view them. “By removing her biography, Wikipedia is erasing what she went through and the reasons that led to her suicide,” says one queer Lebanese woman, who asked to remain anonymous for her safety. But Majd Al-Shihabi, a Tech Exchange Fellow at SMEX, an Arab digital-rights group, says the debate itself is a start. “Wikipedia is about how we understand ourselves as a society,” he says. According to Al-Shihabi, documenting these battles could push the online Arabic-language ecosystem forward.</p>



<p>Arabic Wikipedia admins remain firm in their resolve to keep Hegazi off the site. The debate between editors and admins, which is still visible within Wikipedia’s edits, makes their views on Hegazi’s legacy clear. “Hegazi has no achievements, prizes, or works,” said <a href="https://ar.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A7:%D9%86%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B4_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B0%D9%81/%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9_%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A">one admin</a>. “She’s just a girl who raised a flag at a party, was arrested, became forgotten, then committed suicide.” But even without Arabic Wikipedia, Hegazi’s Wikipedia entry exists in 18 other languages.</p>

                    <p><em><em>This is the </em>second instalment of my<em> 'How I built' trilogy detailing the build process of all 3 of my clusters.</em> Read the first <a href="https://ikarus.sg/how-i-built-octopi">here</a>.</em></p><figure><img src="https://ikarus.sg/content/images/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://ikarus.sg/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png 600w, https://ikarus.sg/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png 1000w, https://ikarus.sg/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png 1600w, https://ikarus.sg/content/images/2020/06/timeline-2-1.png 2362w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Where you are in the cluster timeline</figcaption></figure><h2 id="octopains">Octo<em>pains</em></h2><p>In October 2018, more than a year after <a href="https://ikarus.sg/how-i-built-octopi/">building my first cluster Octopi</a>, I had officially outgrown the cluster. I started noticing the performance bottlenecks started when I tried to run Wordpress on it, where a single page load of a newly installed Wordpress blog takes about <strong>10 seconds!</strong> Nevertheless, all that was unsurprising given the measly single-core 700MHz processor on each node.</p><p>At that point in time, I've graduated from university then and secured a job as a Data Scientist + Full-Stack Engineer at a startup and I thought to myself:</p><blockquote>What better a time to build myself a new cluster?</blockquote><h2 id="kraken">Kraken</h2><p>The second cluster was named <em>Kraken</em>.</p><blockquote>The <strong>kraken</strong> (/ˈkrɑːkən/)[1] is a legendary cephalopod-like sea monster of gigantic size in Scandinavian folklore. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken">Wikipedia</a>)</blockquote><p>The Kraken is basically a much bigger and monstrous octopus, hence the name, symbolizing an evolution of the first cluster. It was built out of 7 Raspberry Pi 3Bs powered by a single USB charger. </p><p>With my first pay check, I had initially intended to <em>finally</em> build a cluster of 8 nodes but once again I was unable to realize this <em>cursed</em> idea. The maximum number of ports on a consumer-grade network switch was 8, enough for 7 nodes and a cable to the router. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

Raspberry Pi 3Bs run on the <em>armv7</em> &nbsp;CPU architecture, which happens to be the current lowest common denominator among Arm processors today. </p><p>Latest Arm processors (<em>arm64</em>) are backward-compatible with all code written and compiled on <em>armv7</em>. In contrast, <em>arm64 </em>processors are not backward-compatible with <em>armv6</em> processors (Raspberry Pi 1 and 2), so they are essentially in the process of being phased out from the community.</p><p>Secondly, this cluster would be perfect for most but the most bandwidth demanding applications, from hosting your own blog, file sync service, media library managers, link-shorteners, note-taking applications and so on. The only time it would not perform as intended is when your application demands heavy sustained writes, such as when encoding videos, given the USB 2.0 bus bottlenecks in the Raspberry Pi 3, which is resolved only in Raspberry Pi 4.</p><p>All in all, building a Raspberry Pi 3 cluster is, in my opinion, the most cost-effective way of learning Docker and clustering in general, and will remain so in the foreseeable future. So if you are just getting into Docker, I'd highly recommend this build.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><p>In my next post in this series, I shall introduce the <em>Leviathan</em> cluster which I have built specifically for high I/O applications, capable of real-time video transcoding and streaming of HEVC -&gt; h264 videos.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love the book Rich Dad Poor Dad. It was my fav growing up. Since then, I've founded several startups, was employee #3 at a $65m VC firm in SF, and realized that there is a similar phenomenon to what Robert Kiyosaki is talking about in Rich Dad Poor Dad currently occurring in Silicon Valley.</p><p>‍</p><p>Let's tastefully call this phenomenon: <strong>Rich Founder Poor Founder.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>The point of entrepreneurship is freedom. Yes it’s to build cool shit and innovate and all that, but at the end of the day the sort of person who becomes an entrepreneur is usually doing it because they want freedom to control their day and work on the things they care about.</p><p>‍</p><p>A lot of people go out and start their first business and try to make it a venture backed startup. That’s the wrong move. That’s like going to the gym and trying to bench 250 lbs on day one. It’s not that you can’t build up to that, it’s just not the right move today. I think the right move is to start a business that can make you $100k+ per year in profit. It doesn’t matter if it can’t scale past that, it’s about building that foundation to give you the freedom to try new things. Fail at those new things and it doesn’t matter as you have that financial foundation. It could be something as simple as a consulting or a services business, or a digital product like a course, newsletter or subscription podcast. Anything that is high margin, simple and enabled by the internet.</p><p>‍</p><p>VC’s may shit on lifestyle businesses but at the end of the day they collect a 2% yearly management fee regardless of their success and typically have a great lifestyle (once their fund size is above $100m AUM).</p><p>‍</p><p>Ask yourself what’s an easier path to wealth and freedom?</p><p>‍</p><p>‍<strong>Path 1: Venture backed startup</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>90% chance of $0.</p><p>‍</p><p>Small personal income until scale, IPO or liquidity event.</p><p>‍</p><p>Massive dilution. Most founders end up owning 5%-20%. $500m market cap = $25m-$100m for founder(s).</p><p>‍</p><p>OR</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Path 2: Lifestyle business</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>50% - 75% chance of success.</p><p>‍</p><p>Pay yourself whatever you want out of profits over time.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you can bootstrap your way to $300k/yr in profit and invest half of that ($150k/yr) at 10%/yr for 20 years = $9.6m + $150k/yr salary to enjoy your life with your family and friends. After 20 years, you can choose to sell that business or automate it and let it ride but with $9.6m invested in a conservative portfolio paying out 5% annually = $480k/year in interest or $40k/mo for you to live off without ever touching the principal nor sacrificing quality of life.</p></div><div><p>‍</p><p><strong>The definition of rich</strong> is having passive income that’s greater than your burn. I’m pretty sure we can all comfortably live off $40k/mo without ever having to leave the house.</p><p>‍</p><p>But wait this isn’t a fair analysis as venture backed startups typically reach scale or a liquidity event in 10 years and you did 20 years for the lifestyle business. Fair, I’m sure after 10 years most of us can comfortably live off $20k ish/mo without ever having to work or touch the principal investment.</p><p>‍</p><p>Most entrepreneurs start with one goal in mind: freedom. If you value freedom, you should have one goal for your first company, and that’s to build a lifestyle business that can produce $100k+/yr of personal income. It can be boring and it doesn’t have to scale. It sets yourself up for the foreseeable future and then you can afford to take big swings. Forget startups. Forget venture capital. Build something that gets you in the game and makes you a living first.‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I think VCs may underestimate the extent to which mainstream entrepreneurship is a key input to outliers and moonshots. So many successful billionaire founders had a “never worry about rent again” moment via an exit in a much more boring business before swinging for a home run.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> — before sending rockets into space and revolutionizing the auto-industry, Elon Musk was broke building Zip2 (online city guides for newspapers) before he netted $22m on the sale. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/how-elon-musk-founded-zip2-with-his-brother-kimbal.html">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Patrick &amp; John Collison</strong> — built Auctimatic: auction management software for small Ebay sellers, and sold it for $5m before going on to found Stripe, valued at $36b. <a href="https://www.startupgrind.com/blog/the-collison-brothers-and-story-behind-the-founding-of-stripe/">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Mark Cuban</strong> — Before building and selling<a href="http://broadcast.com/"> Broadcast.com</a> for $5.7b and buying the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban built a services business called MicroSolutions and sold it for $6m. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong> — now worth $60b, Mike Bloomberg had a nice “never think about rent again” exit at 39 when Salomon was acquired by Phibro in 1981; he received $10 million. Bloomberg said “The Salomon Brothers did me the two greatest favours in my life. They hired me and they fired me.” <a href="https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1277633665099595776">Source</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Daniel Ek</strong> — Spotify isn’t Ek’s first success. Daniel Ek became a self-made millionaire at age 23, before even putting a single thought into Spotify. At 23, Daniel Ek “retired” after he sold his online marketing company Advertigo to Swedish digital marketing firm TradeDoubler in a deal worth $1.25 million.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Alex Tew</strong> — started the <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">Million Dollar Homepage</a> to raise money for his university education. He sold 1 million pixels on a 1000 x 1000 pixel grid on his website for $1 per pixel. He ended up making $1,037,100 USD before founding the billion dollar meditation app, <a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Austin Allred</strong> — co-authored the growth hacking textbook <em>Secret Sauce</em>, which became a best-seller and provided him the personal seed money to build Lambda School, valued over $150m.</p><p>‍</p><p>And countless others: Ev Williams (Blogger), Pincus (freeloader, support.com, tribe), Travis Kalanick (Red Swoosh), Stewart Butterfield (Flickr), Jason Fried &amp; DHH (37 Signals services business) etc.</p><p>‍</p><p>All of these entrepreneurs built more of a lifestyle business or had a smaller liquidity event before they built a rocket (figuratively and literally for Elon). There is no greater security than knowing that no matter what risks you take, you have a business or enough cash in the bank to pay for your livelihood.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you start by building a lifestyle business it will force you to build a product or offer a service that customers actually want. It forces you to create a monetization plan and it forces you to build a real business. By starting a lifestyle business it forces you to create something you’re passionate about and build an actual business that will actually help attract VC if that’s the path you choose to go down.</p><p>‍</p><p>Renowned value investor and Warren Buffett mentor, Ben Graham, once said: “In the short-run, the stock market is a voting machine. But in the long-run, it is a weighing machine.” AKA in the short term the market may value hype and narrative, but in the long term it always values real traction, revenue, earnings and margins.</p><p>‍</p><p>We’re seeing this play out in the venture market today. In the last few years you may have heard startups raising at eyebrow lifting valuations and hiring large masses of employees. But behind the curtain their P&amp;L is fucked! They have little to fuck all for revenue and huge expenses.</p><p>‍</p><p>Founders often get attached to valuations and forget that when they sell the business, the weighing machine is the only thing that matters. The buyer has to have a way to pay themselves back, either via earnings, a future sale or strategic synergies.</p><p>‍</p><p>Your venture valuation is irrelevant. Venture valuations aren’t backed by fundamentals and their funds have been compared to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHUQ7QxS-e4">ponzi scheme</a>. Build a lifestyle business where results, traction, revenue, margins and earnings are the things that matter because at the end of the day, the numbers have to work with the weighing machine.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you’re bootstrapping, you can still take advantage of venture capital by using all the VC subsidized software available on the market.</p><p>‍</p><p>The internet is the greatest leveler of access to entrepreneurship society has ever seen. There is far too much focus on raising venture capital and creating 100–1000x outcomes and not nearly enough on leveraging the internet to empower entrepreneurs to build profitable and sustainable software-enabled lifestyle businesses.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>TL;DR </strong>'Rich Founder' is someone who creates a sustainable 'lifestyle business' with a high probability of success. 'Poor Founder' is someone who thinks they need to raise venture capital, a fancy office, big staff and a bunch of resources to succeed.

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>So, is the case closed? Will we no longer need to think where our application will run anymore? Well, that's not that simple, a whole part of the world is ignored: IoT, smartphones, and all these small gadgets don't run on the same hardware as our laptops and computers.</p>
<p>You might think it's not that much of an issue: websites and other services tend to run on classic Linux servers. However, there are many situations where using a bulky server is not an option :</p>
<ul>
<li>More and more <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>objects need to connect to the Internet</strong>, and often run a Linux kernel. Using the web application we’ve already developed for a server would be ideal. It’s also true for old computers lying around, on which your new 64-bits app won’t run.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed computing at large scale</strong> is a research subject that looks promising: any piece of hardware could be part of a resilient supercomputer. That is the idea behind <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/iot/articles/how-cloud-fog-and-mist-computing-can-work-together" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fog and mist computing</a>, using every small piece of IoT available.</li>
<li>These <strong>IoT chips are more power-efficient</strong>, they can help reduce the overall energy consumption and carbon footprint of our services. Amazon Web Services does propose to use&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/a1/"> </a><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/a1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special EC2 instances</a> with this kind of small machine, reducing the energy consumption and therefore the bill.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the market might change. Apple will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21284960/apple-arm-based-macs-wwdc-2020-report-intel-laptops-desktops-power-efficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announce a shift to its own </a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21284960/apple-arm-based-macs-wwdc-2020-report-intel-laptops-desktops-power-efficiency">&nbsp;ARM</a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21284960/apple-arm-based-macs-wwdc-2020-report-intel-laptops-desktops-power-efficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> processor for his products</a>, abandoning classic x86 CPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, many IoT platforms don’t have the resources to run containers, but there are real use cases where you have a powerful enough machine to run Docker, but still <strong>small enough to fit in your pocket, and energy-efficient</strong>. That's the case of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi</a>, a very small computer, used in many IoT and home-server projects. That's the platform we'll use for this post.</p>
<p>Let's remind the issue: Docker has been made for your everyday computer, which is an x86-64 CPU (more about that in a few paragraphs), but not for small elements of IoT such as the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> which runs on an ARM CPU.</p>


<!--more-->
<h2 id="breaking">The breaking example</h2>
<p>Let's say you want to deploy your great <strong>Python application with docker</strong>. To keep things simple we'll create a simple Python app that just tells the date and time, using an external API (what an amazing <em>SAAS</em> concept). That's probably not very useful, but enough as an example for this post. Anyway, let's call it <strong>pytime</strong>!</p>
<p><span><em>If you don't see any code below, be sure to load the full version of the website, not the AMP !</em></span></p>

<p>That's all! We only use one dependency: <em>requests</em> which is used for the <strong>API call</strong>.</p>

<p>Now let's <strong>create a simple Dockerfile</strong> for it. We'll use the build caching system, installing dependencies first and then adding the source code.</p>

<p>Now, on your computer, you can <strong><code>build</code> and <code>push</code> the app with <code>docker</code></strong>. I assume you're already logged to your docker repository (if not, simply <code>docker login</code> for the default&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.docker.com/"> </a><a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DockerHub</a>).</p>
<p><code>$ docker build -t padok/pytime:v1.0 <br> $ docker push padok/pytime:v1.0</code></p>
<p>It would be better to deploy it on a proper infrastructure such as <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, using <a href="https://www.padok.fr/en/blog/helm-3-commands">Helm</a><a href="https://www.padok.fr/en/blog/helm-3-commands" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> charts</a> for deployments, but let's keep it simple. Let's say we <code>ssh</code> into our server and run the app directly with Docker.</p>
<p>However, here, our server is a <strong>Raspberry Pi v4</strong>, which runs on an ARM CPU (more on that later).</p>
<p><code>$ ssh pi@raspberrypi<br>$ docker run padok/pytime:v1.0<br>Unable to find image 'padok/pytime:v1.0' locally<br>v1.0: Pulling from padok/pytime<br>...<br>Status: Downloaded newer image for padok/pytime:v1.0<br>standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "exec format error"</code></p>
<p>Well, that didn't go well... On your computer or a classic server you shouldn't encounter any issues, however on an ARM processor, for example on a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>, you will encounter a strange error message.</p>
<p><code>standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "exec format error"</code></p>
<p>The error is not very explicit, but with some research, you'll understand that the instructions in the <strong>Docker image are just not supported by the ARM machine</strong>. That would be the case for many IoT projects. That's not what I was expecting for such a simple application. Does Docker lie when it proclaims <em>"Build Once, Run Anywhere!"</em>? Well, it is a bit more complicated, let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="architectures">About CPU architectures</h2>
<p>Before reviewing some Docker features, it is important to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instruction_set_architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPU architectures</a>, also named <strong>instruction sets</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>CPU</strong> can be classified into different categories, depending on how they are designed internally, and therefore how they communicate with the software. Your everyday computer or the server which serves this article will either run on an <strong>Intel</strong> or <strong>AMD</strong> CPU, the market leaders, which both use the same <em>language</em> with the computer: x86. However, a <strong>smartphone or a small IoT object</strong>, which needs to be <strong>power-efficient</strong>, will use <strong>smaller CPUs</strong>, which use a different <em>instruction set</em>, such as <strong>ARM</strong> or <strong>RISC-V</strong>.</p>
<p>This language is an <strong>abstraction of the physical CPU for the software</strong>. This very low-level computer language is the bridge between our high-level human code (a = a + 1) and what happens in reality: <em>fetch the value in a from memory, add 1, save the new value in the a variable's memory address</em>. For example, here is a translation for a C source code to <strong>Assembler</strong> for x86, which is very close to the actual instruction set language.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png" alt="assembler x86" width="800" srcset="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=400&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 400w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 800w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=1200&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 1200w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=1600&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 1600w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=2000&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 2000w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png?width=2400&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-4.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Transforming the intelligible code into Assembler is the <strong>compilation</strong>. For Docker, the analogy will be the <strong>build</strong> step. In the preceding example, we've built an app for the <strong>x86-64</strong> architecture (the 64 bits flavor of x86, also called amd64), and we have tried to run it on an <strong>ARM</strong> CPU, it just cannot function properly!</p>
<p>But are we stuck with using Docker only on big and consuming <strong>x86</strong> CPUs, letting behind a part of the IoT ecosystem? Luckily <strong>Docker handles multiple architectures natively</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="docker">How docker handles multiples architectures</h2>
<p>On the ARM server (the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>), Docker seems to work fine.</p>
<p><code>$ docker run python:3.8.2 python --version<br>Python 3.8.2</code></p>
<p>In fact, if we had used the command docker build on this ARM machine, it would have created an image for this specific CPU architecture. The issue here is that we've created an x86-64 image and tried to use it on an ARM machine. It just cannot work.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=600&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png" alt="docker arm" width="600" srcset="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=300&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 300w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=600&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 600w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=900&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 900w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=1200&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 1200w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 1500w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png?width=1800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>By default, <strong>Docker build and pull the image for the platform it is running on</strong>. On DockerHub, you can explore which platforms are available for which version of the image. For example for&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/python?tab=tags&amp;page=1&amp;name=3.8.2&amp;ordering=-name"> </a><a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/python?tab=tags&amp;page=1&amp;name=3.8.2&amp;ordering=-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener">python:3.8.2</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png" alt="python 3.8.2 image" width="800" srcset="https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=400&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 400w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=800&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 800w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=1200&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 1200w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=1600&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 1600w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=2000&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 2000w, https://www.padok.fr/hs-fs/hubfs/Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png?width=2400&amp;name=Copie%20de%20Article%20-%20Docker%20Multi-architecture-5.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Using the <em>digest</em> column, you can <strong>specify the image you want to pull</strong>. For example, if you want to pull an <em>arm/v7</em> (which is 32 bit) image specifically, you can just type get the specific version with:</p>
<p><code>$ docker pull python@sha256:14984d57dabd5ddb4789a65e5d64965473121c4ded5f8143161fbeb28713eebf</code></p>
<p>Even better, since the previous solution pins the image version in time, disabling security fixes, you can <strong>specify the architecture with a prefix</strong>. For example:</p>
<p><code>$ docker pull arm32v7/python:3.8.2</code></p>
<p>These solutions, either the automatic platform detection or the manual selection allows us to <strong>avoid relying on a complex tagging system</strong> such as <code>myapp:1.3.2-arm</code>.</p>
<p>Here we have a solution. Let's just <strong>build the app directly on the ARM server</strong>. Indeed, it will run correctly on the specific CPU. But we have new issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we've totally <strong>broken our CI/CD process</strong>. No more image registry, you have to launch a new build on all your target devices every time a new version is released. You could install a CI/CD runner directly on the machine but it is limited by the following point.</li>
<li>Secondly, <strong>ARM processors are often slow </strong>and<strong> quite limited in power</strong>. The compilation could strain resources from the main process and takes quite a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to be able to build our app <em>once</em>, on our machine or a CI/CD solution and forget about the hardware it will run on! Luckily, Docker has also a solution for us.</p>
<h2 id="buildx">Multi-architecture builds with Buildx</h2>
<p><strong>Buildx</strong> is an experimental <strong>feature of Docker</strong>, so check that you've got at least <em>Docker 19.03</em> with <span>docker version</span>. Then, you can enable <em>buildx</em> (and other experimental features) for the current shell:</p>
<p><code>$ export DOCKER_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled</code></p>
<p>Now you should be able to run</p>
<p><code>$ docker buildx ls<br>NAME/NODE DRIVER/ENDPOINT STATUS PLATFORMS<br>default * docker<br>default default running linux/amd64, linux/386</code></p>
<p>Here we can see that our current docker <em>builder</em> is able to <strong>construct images two different architectures</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>amd64</strong> which refers to the <strong>x86-64</strong> instruction set, which is the 64-bit version of the mainstream <strong>x86</strong> instruction set. That's the architecture your computer is probably running on. Since <em>AMD</em> first released the 64-bit version, they got the name.</li>
<li><strong>386</strong>, often referred to as i386 (i as in <em>Intel</em>) is the legacy 32-bit version of the <strong>x86</strong> instruction set.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <em>buildx</em> you could compile a 32-bit version of your docker image for an old computer! And it can also works for our exotic ARM CPU.</p>
<p>However, we will need yet another tool for this: <em><strong>qemu</strong></em>, a <em>cross-compilation</em> framework. <strong>Cross-compilation</strong> is compiling software for an architecture B on a computer running on architecture A. For example, compiling for <strong>ARM</strong> on an <strong>amd64</strong> platform. That's exactly what we want! Using complicated Linux functionalities which I won't explain here (if you're interested, read <a href="https://linki.tools/2020/01/cross-arch-reproducibility-using-containers.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this article</a>), we can give <em>buildx</em> some <em><strong>qemu</strong></em> steroids!</p>
<p><code>$ docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes</code></p>
<p><em>It will only work for the current session. If you reboot you'll have to run this command again.</em></p>
<p>Now let's create a new <em>builder</em> with <em>buildx</em>, which will be able to use <em>qemu</em> abilities.</p>
<p><code>$ docker buildx create --name mybuilder --driver docker-container --use</code></p>
<p>Now let's display the available platforms I can build on. We need to <strong><em>bootstrap </em></strong>the builder, i.e. initialize it.</p>
<p><code>$ docker buildx inspect --bootstrap<br>Name: mybuilder<br>Driver: docker-container<p>Nodes:<br>Name: mybuilder0<br>Endpoint: unix:///var/run/docker.sock<br>Status: running<br>Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/riscv64, linux/ppc64le, linux/s390x, linux/386, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6</p></code></p>
<p>We have many more platforms available. If you check on <strong>DockerHub</strong>, you'll see that there is <strong>no base image</strong> for <strong>riscv64</strong>, we'll have to remove it from the list. To …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div>

<h3>Safety and efficacy</h3>
<p>After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic Russian researchers extracted a fragment of genetic material from novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2, which codes information about the structure of the spike S-protein, which forms the virus’ “crown” and is responsible for connection with human cells. They inserted it into a familiar adenovirus vector for delivery into a human cell creating the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>In order to ensure lasting immunity Russian scientists came up with a breakthrough idea to use two different types of adenovirus vectors (rAd26 and rAd5) for the first and second vaccination, boosting the effect of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The use of human adenoviruses as vectors is safe because these viruses, which cause the common cold, are not novel and have been around for thousands of years.</p> </div>

				<p><em> Caroline Rodewig and Garrett McGrath are members of FlightAware's Flight Tracking Wing. As lead for the Predictive Technology Crew, Caroline works to expand the scope and quality of our predictive applications. Garrett is the lead for the Aviation Platform Crew and responsible for the performance, reliability and observability of multi-machine Hyperfeed. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="monitoringhyperfeedthehistoryandchallengesofadistributedsystem">Monitoring Hyperfeed: The History and Challenges of a Distributed System</h2>
<p>The Aviation Platform crew (for an explanation of crews and wings,<a href="https://flightaware.engineering/crews-wings-and-alliances-part-1-the-principles-of-how-we-work/" target="_see this blog post"> see this blog post</a>) revolves around the performance and reliability of Hyperfeed<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Hyperfeed is FlightAware’s core flight tracking engine. Its output powers the company’s most salient offerings: the <a href="https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ABW140" target="_blank"> flight pages</a> on the website, <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/firehose/" target="_blank">Firehose</a>, <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/flightxml/">FlightXML</a>, and <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/premium/">flight alerts</a>. So if Hyperfeed stops working, so does much of FlightAware. Given the impact of a Hyperfeed outage, we need to know immediately if something goes—or might go—wrong so that we can act swiftly and precisely to remedy the situation. For maintaining the requisite accuracy and timeliness of Hyperfeed’s output, we rely heavily on monitoring<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. To that end, we have recently begun adopting Prometheus, a time-series metrics database, and Grafana, a powerful visualization platform. The introduction of these tools marks a significant upgrade and improvement to Hyperfeed’s current monitoring stack. It is hoped that by sharing our experience and the reasons for adoption that we can help inform the decision-making of others in an analogous situation.</p>
<p>Before discussing Prometheus and the many enhancements it brings to our monitoring of Hyperfeed, it helps to provide some context by examining what we currently use and how it has evolved over time. In its current form, Hyperfeed is a distributed system composed of a constellation of more than a dozen components and sub-systems spread across multiple machines for performance and fault-tolerance. Its sub-systems include a number of other well-known services: Postgres, Zookeeper, Kafka, and RabbitMQ. It wasn’t always like this, though. When I started working on Hyperfeed in 2016, it was not distributed; its components all ran on a single machine (this is not strictly true as it also used a Postgres database running on a separate server). Naturally, monitoring at that time was relatively less complex: it had markedly less surface area to cover. We were able to do the job effectively with a combination of custom, in-house tools and a heavy dose of Zabbix.</p>
<p>Our custom monitoring tools mostly consisted of some scripts that followed Hyperfeed’s output and its logging statements looking for problems, e.g., the output has stopped completely, the output is out of date, or an excess number of tracebacks happened. These tools were specific to Hyperfeed and did not generalize well to other software. Zabbix, on the other hand, has been FlightAware’s primary monitoring and alerting framework. It is used throughout the company and not specific to any piece of software. When applied to Hyperfeed, Zabbix monitored some key characteristics of the server running the application such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. Moreover, the aforementioned custom tools fed their data into Zabbix so that they could be used for alerting an engineer if something went haywire. On top of that, Zabbix gave us a basic web interface for viewing the data it collected in a graphical format. Back when Hyperfeed fit snugly on a single server, this sort of monitoring served us well: Zabbix was a one-stop shop for all things monitoring. But as the demands placed on Hyperfeed grew, so did its operational complexity.</p>
<p>Eventually, a single-machine architecture was not enough to handle the increased volume of Hyperfeed’s input, which was precipitated by FlightAware acquiring <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/aireon/" target="_blank">new data sources</a>, and expanding its <a href="https://flightaware.com/adsb/" target="_blank">existing data sources</a>. In order to accommodate this change in scale, it was necessary to distribute Hyperfeed across multiple machines. When this happened, we continued using (and still do use) custom tools and Zabbix for monitoring. Our custom tools, though, and the data we send to Zabbix necessarily expanded, too. Although distributing Hyperfeed across multiple machines was necessary and improved the performance and reliability of the system, it also brought with it new challenges and difficulties, particularly in terms of monitoring<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Given their origin, our custom tools were not designed with a distributed setting in mind. As such, they lacked the ability to easily aggregate data across multiple machines and were somewhat cumbersome to operate as Hyperfeed’s architecture progressed. In addition, Zabbix started creaking and revealing some rough edges as we placed more demands on it. A core issue was that Zabbix does really well at monitoring particular machines but not as well at system or application level monitoring, especially in a context where services can move around from machine to machine as failures occur or as an intentional part of the design. In a distributed setting, it also imposes non-trivial operational burdens, e.g., when adding new monitoring points or spreading the collection load across machines. Moreover, Zabbix combines all monitoring functions into a single monolith rather than the current best practice of loosely coupling monitoring tasks like collecting data, long-term storage, querying data, alerting with deduplication and aggregation, and visualization/dashboarding (for further details on monitoring system best practices, see the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/monitoring/" target="_blank">Google SRE workbook’s monitoring chapter</a>).</p>
<p>As Hyperfeed moved to a distributed architecture, a change driven by business demands and an increased volume of flight tracking data, it became clear that our monitoring tools, while mostly satisfactory in alerting us when something failed in the system, neglected to provide us with many of the other benefits that monitoring can offer. In particular, we were weak in whitebox monitoring and visualization<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>.Whitebox monitoring is especially important for analyzing long-term trends, comparing experimental groups, and in guiding capacity planning and other engineering decision making. Some information can only come from the vantage point provided by whitebox monitoring. For visualization we had Zabbix, but its capabilities there are fairly limited and inflexible. Given all of this, we started looking for a new solution to fill in the gaps in our monitoring approach, something designed for dynamic, distributed systems. We chose Prometheus and Grafana. This combo of tools addresses the shortcomings of our current approach, and also brings with it a number of additional virtues.</p>
<h2 id="upgradingmonitoringwithprometheusandgrafana">Upgrading Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana</h2>
<h3 id="prometheustimeseriesmetrics">Prometheus: Time-Series Metrics</h3>
<p>In an idealized monitoring practice, every event or state of a system is recorded so that it is available if needed: no detail is left out. Unfortunately, this only works in a hypothetical, theoretical scenario since it is impossible to store, process, and work with the quantity of data generated continuously by modern systems. Instead of capturing everything, one must grapple with what to monitor: how to turn the endless torrent of events in a system into something comprehensible, manageable, and actionable. To this end, Prometheus provides time-series metrics, which track aggregations of events in a system over some period of time, where an event refers to anything that might occur and can be quantified or measured. Some example events include a function getting called, CPU usage going up, a web request being made, a client connecting to a service or a cache hit happens.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Fundamentally, the monitoring offered by Prometheus periodically takes a snapshot of some of the events in a system, typically measuring how often or how quickly each event occurred. The value of a snapshot at any given point is often of less interest than its relative value: how the frequency of an event changes over time provides the actionable insight and value of metrics-based monitoring. To make this more concrete, in the case of flight tracking some example time-series metrics of interest might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Departures per second</li>
<li>Arrivals per day</li>
<li>Cancellations per minute</li>
<li>Diversions per hour</li>
<li>Flight plans created per second</li>
<li>Input messages processed per second</li>
<li>Output messages generated per second</li>
<li>99th percentile of the time taken to process an ADS-B position over the last 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in order to keep the amount of data captured manageable, the contents of the input messages that trigger each of these events get aggregated away. With metrics, the rate of departures, for example, are measured throughout the system, but any single departure cannot be investigated. As succinctly summarized by <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-101-collecting-data/" target="_blank">Datadog</a>, metrics provide “the big, broad-stroke measures that can help you quickly answer the most pressing questions about a system’s internal health and performance.“ Metrics can also capture resource utilization, like CPU, memory, or disk, and metadata like code revisions and configuration values. Time-series metrics, despite necessarily omitting a lot of detail, are still quite versatile, yielding practicable monitoring data for critical activities throughout a system.</p>
<h3 id="dataandoperationalmodel">Data and Operational Model</h3>
<p>One of Prometheus’ main selling points is that it provides a powerful and conceptually straightforward data model for extracting metrics from a system of interest and tracking their rate of change over time. Each time-series metric tracked by Prometheus includes the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metric name: a string indicating what the metric is for, e.g., <code>hyperfeed_departures_total</code>.</li>
<li>Help documentation: a string describing what the metric is for or where it comes from.</li>
<li>Metric type: four types are provided, but two of them provide the atomic building blocks of the others. The fundamental types are counters, which can only go up or reset, and gauges, which can be set to any value.</li>
<li>Labels: key-value pairs attaching additional dimensions to the metric. Labels …</li></ul></section></div></article></div></div>

<p>Sixty years ago this week — on August 12, 1960 — Dr. Seuss published what would become his biggest-selling book of all time. Written as the result of a $50 bet between Seuss and his friend and publisher at Random House, Bennett Cerf, the book, by some estimates, has sold north of 200 million copies.*</p>



<p>The book? <em>Green Eggs and Ham.</em></p>



<p>When I discuss <em>Becoming Dr. Seuss </em>with audiences, Seuss fans tell me they have warm memories of this one; it’s the book that taught them how to read, or it’s the first book they received as a gift — or, as grown-ups, it’s a book they can still quote and recite word-for-word. And it <em>is </em>a great book–but it’s an important one, too, both in the Seuss library and in the overall oeuvre of children’s literature. There’s a lot going on between its colorful orange boards, the result of sweat, inspiration, and no small amount of luck. But to truly appreciate how smart, and how important <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> is, we need to go back a few years before its 1960 publication to get some background and some context. </p>

<p>Let’s start, then, by checking in with this May 1954 issue of LIFE magazine (that’s comedic actress Kaye Ballard on the cover, by the way, who was burning up Broadway in the musical <em>The Golden Apple</em> and would later make an appearance on <em>The Muppet Show</em>) which features an article by Pulitzer Prize winning novelist John Hersey titled, “Why Do Students Bog Down on the First ‘R’?” The cover text teases the article as  “Why Can’t My Child Read?” but the gist is the same: namely, Hersey was discouraged by the low rates of childhood literacy in the United States, and placed the blame for children’s lack of interest in reading squarely on the shoulders of the ponderous <em>Dick and Jane </em>standard reading primers on which several generations of children had been raised. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="6313" data-permalink="https://brianjayjones.com/efarm2txsaeescx/" data-orig-file="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg" data-orig-size="594,473" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="efarm2txsaeescx" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=500" src="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=594" alt="" width="282" height="224" srcset="https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=282 282w, https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=564 564w, https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://brianjayjones.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/efarm2txsaeescx.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px"><figcaption>John Hersey</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The real problem, as Hersey saw it, was that Dick and Jane were<em> terrible</em>. The text — with its now-easily lampooned, “Look, Jane, look. See the ball?” syntax — was bad enough, but Hersey thought the artwork was even worse–“insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children,” he railed. No one, he concluded, was interested in reading about Dick and Jane and their lives of quiet desperation. At the very least, suggested Hersey, couldn’t they get Dr. Seuss to illustrate the otherwise turgid text?</p>



<p>They never would get Dr. Seuss to illustrate Dick and Jane; instead, Seuss was approached by William Spaulding, an editor of children’s books at Random House rival Houghton Mifflin, who had read Hersey’s article and begged Dr. Seuss to “write me a story that first graders can’t put down.”</p>



<p>But there was a catch. Putting aside all their other problems, Dick and Jane were at least living their dull lives inside an actual reading primer, operating under a strict educator-approved vocabulary list of about 300 unique words at the first grade reading level. For his book, then, Dr. Seuss would have to play by those same rules, using only the words on the sanctioned reading list. Seuss told Spaulding he’d take the list home and “play with it.”</p>



<p>He played with it for nearly a year. It was, he said later, an “impossible and ridiculous task…I was forbidden to use any words beyond the list. I almost threw the job up.” Eventually, he decided to read through the list one last time, vowing that “if I find two words that rhyme and make sense to me, that’s the title.” Unfortunately,<em> tall </em>and <em>ball</em> were a bust.</p>

<p><em>Cat </em>and <em>hat</em>, however, were not.</p>



<p>After another year of work, Dr. Seuss published <em>The Cat in the Hat</em> in the Spring of 1957.** For <em>Cat</em>, Seuss had used 236 unique words from the word list. (His total word count, with repeated words, is about 1,600.) It was Seuss’ first real blockbuster of a book — the one that permitted him to finally devote himself full-time to writing and drawing books for children. But more importantly, <em>Cat in the Hat </em>is a bestseller with a pedagogy; with its reliance on the officially-sanctioned word list, it’s a book teachers approved of, one parents loved, and one kids actually wanted to read. In 1957, that was a game changer.</p>

<p>Inspired by the huge success of the Cat, Random House created a new imprint called Beginner Books, aimed squarely at beginning readers and which continued to lean on the educator-approved word list. Dr. Seuss was brought in as the imprint’s president and editor–a seat from which he would not only recruit and work with other writers and artists on children’s books (one of the most popular of which was P.D. Eastman’s <em>Go, Dog. Go!</em>) but would also regularly produce his own books under the new logo, featuring the Cat himself.</p>



<p>Among the first books Dr. Seuss produced for the Beginner Books imprint was <em>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish</em>, completed in 1959. <em>One Fish</em> was an experiment for Seuss, as he was deliberately using an even more restrictive word list of short words, and placing the accompanying drawings as close to the text as he possibly could, like so:</p>

<p>It would be the prototype for a new line of books Seuss was already informally calling “Beginner Beginner Books,” aimed at very early readers with limited vocabularies. Soon, there would be a new imprint at Random House, overseen by Seuss, and formally designated with the moniker Bright &amp; Early Books. The Bright &amp; Early Books relied on an approved vocabulary list of only 182 simple words—a little more than half as large as the already restrictive list adhered to by Beginner Books.</p>

<p>Still with me? In 1959, Random House publisher Bennett Cerf approached Dr. Seuss and gleefully pointed out that the new Bright &amp; Early imprint relied on a tight list of 182 words. Then he laid down a playful and very specific challenge: <em>could Dr. Seuss write a book using only 50 of those words?</em> </p>



<p>Cerf bet Dr. Seuss $50 that he couldn’t. </p>



<p>Challenge accepted.</p>



<p>Seuss, who who had agonized and struggled with a broader and less restrictive word list as he worked on <em>The Cat in the Hat, </em>nevertheless rose to the occasion. But it’s probably no coincidence that the resulting book was all about convincing someone to do something they didn’t really want to do.</p>

<p><em>Green Eggs and Ham </em>would be its own kind of misery, requiring Seuss to create complicated charts, checklists, and multiple word counts as he struggled to keep track of the words he was using. He also imposed on himself a requirement to stick with one-syllable words, though he would make an exception for “anywhere,” which was made up of two short words that young readers would know.</p>



<p>Rhyming, too, could be tough with a fifty word restriction. “The agony is terrific at times, and the attribution is horrible,” he said. “If you’re doing it in quatrains and get to the end of four lines and can’t make it work, then it’s like unraveling a sock. You take some of your best stuff and throw it away.”</p>



<p>Dr. Seuss delivered <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> to Cerf at Random House in 1960. He was glad to be done with it, and somewhat nervous about how it would be received.</p>



<p>We all know how it turned out. “The good doctor has scored another triumph,” exclaimed the <em>New York Times</em>, while one reviewer wrote presciently of <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>: “A vocabulary of only fifty words, but they will long be remembered.”</p>

<p>For the rest of his life, Dr. Seuss would find himself at book signings and dinners in his honor where he would be served plates filled with green eggs and ham. “Deplorable stuff,” he said later, “The worst was on a yacht in six-foot seas.”</p>



<p>Generations of readers would look for hidden meanings and metaphors in its text—but for Dr. Seuss, <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> was only ever about one thing: “Cerf bet me fifty bucks I couldn’t write a book using only 50 words,” he said later. “I did it to show I could.”</p>



<p>Oh, and Seuss also said later that Bennett Cerf never paid him his fifty dollars. </p>



<p>Regardless, Happy 60th Birthday to <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>. Thank you, thank you, Sam I Am (and Dr. Seuss!)</p>

<p>* Publishers can be persnickety about releasing sales figures on the record. Total sales for <em>Green Eggs </em>are reported as anywhere from 8 million to 15 million to 200 million.</p>



<p>* * In a trade-off deal, Random House–Dr. Seuss’s normal publisher–permitted Houghton Mifflin to publish the textbook version of <em>Cat in the Hat </em>for schools, while Random House retained the trade rights. As it turned out, few schools bought the textbook version. Random House would make a mint off the Cat; Houghton — where the idea had originated in the first place! — not so much. Random House would eventually acquire the textbook rights back from its rival, and promptly shelve them, preferring to issue only the trade edition.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://reeve.blog/blog/principles/">recently argued</a> that 80% of a product manager’s job is to discover the right product to build and drive organizational alignment. At the same time, ‘product discovery’ is often the most nebulous part of the job. So how&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;great product managers do this? While product discovery will never be easy, I’ll outline a simple yet effective framework that I use.</p>



<p>There are many great books about product discovery. They also tend to be complicated and tricky to reference day-to-day. So over time, I’ve tried to simplify this, and I’ve distilled it down into what I call the “Five P’s.” In my experience, all five have to be defined and considered when deciding what to build:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the mission of your company or product?</li><li><strong>Problem: </strong>What is the customer or user problem we’re solving?</li><li><strong>Pattern:</strong> How many people are impacted by this problem?</li><li><strong>Prose: </strong>What is the narrative for how solving this problem benefits the customer and our business?</li><li><strong>Priority: </strong>How important is this solving this problem vs. other problems on which we could focus?</li></ul>







<p>Your purpose is why your company or product exists, reflected as a mission and strategy. Without this, you’re flying blind. There’s no use in identifying the auto industry’s most common problems if your mission is to create the world’s leading crypto bank:</p>



<ol><li>A <strong>mission</strong> statement is what you’re trying to accomplish. E.g., <em>Plant a billion trees on each continent to offset the world’s carbon emissions. </em>A mission statement should be concise, opinionated, inspiring, and action-oriented (i.e., begin with a verb.)</li><li>A <strong>strategy</strong> is how you’re going to achieve your mission. E.g., <em>Identify suitable land, build irrigation systems, procure seeds and fertilizer, sow seeds by helicopter.</em></li><li><strong>Vision</strong> and mission are easily confused. Think of vision as defining what the world will look like when you’ve achieved your mission.<em> </em>E.g., <em>we’ve offset the world’s carbon emissions by 30%, providing cleaner air to billions of people.</em></li></ol>



<p>Investing time in defining a purpose may seem abstract. Still, it’s critical: Having a clear and compelling mission and strategy inspires a product team and points discovery efforts in the right direction. For product “tracks” within larger companies, the track’s purpose should contribute to the company’s purpose. Boz (VP at Facebook) wrote a great article on mission and strategy <a href="https://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics">here</a>.</p>







<p>The core part of effective product management is identifying pain within the context of your mission and strategy. What problems do your target customers have? Why do people like or not like your product? Are your customers asking for something?</p>



<p>Problems can surface qualitatively or quantitatively:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> This might include user experience research, a customer call series, feature requests from users, input from your team or stakeholders, competitor research, or your own product judgment. To paraphrase <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ablue/">Allen Blue</a>, look for places where your target customers are already “duct-taping” things together.</li><li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> What you’ve identified through studying trends in your metrics. Product managers should study their metrics daily to understand how the product is performing and identify problems and opportunities.</li></ul>



<p>Customers will often tell you the solution, not the problem. They’re trying to be helpful. But well-intentioned customers usually don’t know what’s possible, nor what will work best for your product. Asking the right questions can help identify the problem:</p>



<ul><li>If you get X, what will it help you do?</li><li>What happens if you don’t get X?</li><li>If you don’t get X, how will you achieve Y?</li></ul>



<p>Be careful in situations where there’s a “layer” between you and the user. Suppose the person you’re talking with is an intermediary (e.g., the buyer or someone who administers the product within a company): In this scenario, they may not understand the experience from the end user’s perspective. Be mindful of who is answering your questions.</p>



<p>Finally, while many formal research functions support the discovery process (product marketing, user research, etc.), a deep understanding of the customer can’t be delegated to another function. Great product managers have strong opinions and intuition; this comes from being exposed to raw feedback, e.g., attending customer calls, studying metrics, and talking to users.</p>







<p>Most of the time, product managers are looking for systemic issues that impact a large percentage of your target customers. We can define ‘systemic’ in different ways: The number of customers with a problem, the value of the customers who have the problem (e.g., how much they spend with you), or whether they are uniquely significant (e.g., a prominent “brand name”).</p>



<p>There are going to be situations where solving an isolated problem is the right call. You might choose to build something purely because a critical customer is asking for it. You might prioritize something for a small but essential cohort of users (e.g., power users or promoters). These are fine, but they should be the exception, not the norm.</p>







<p>The word ‘prose’ underscores the importance of looking beyond a singular metric. Don’t get me wrong, moving metrics is crucial, and I spend a lot of time doing just that, but they aren’t exhaustive. Too often, I see product teams focusing on tuning a singular metric without considering the entire ecosystem or whether something is the right long-term investment as part of a broader mission and strategy. </p>



<p>Even worse, product teams may shy away from building a great product because they can’t predict the quantitative impact of building it. <strong>In practice, you often won’t be able to accurately predict the metric impact of shipping a brand new product or making a step-function change.</strong> </p>



<p>Persuasive prose forces product teams to consider both the quantitative and qualitative effects of building something <em>and</em> how it ties to a broader mission and strategy. It underscores the value of having a clear and compelling narrative for understanding:</p>



<ol><li>What the problem is.</li><li>Why the problem should be solved.</li><li>How the problem will be solved.</li><li>The qualitative and quantitative impact of solving the problem.</li><li>How solving the problem contributes to a broader mission and strategy.</li></ol>



<p><strong>I’ll touch on the two main tools I use when working with ‘prose’:</strong></p>



<p><strong>The first you’re probably familiar with, which is the hypothetical external press release, </strong><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html"><strong>popularized by Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The press release explains what the product is, why it exists, and the features and benefits. It’s a compelling articulation of the value that the product delivers to the customer and the market. If it isn’t compelling, you may either not be solving the right problem, or not have the right product to solve it.</p>



<p><strong>But I’m guessing you haven’t heard of the second application of ‘prose’:</strong> The concept is similar, but it’s an <em>internal</em><strong><em> </em></strong>press release. Imagine you’re summarizing the “why,” “what,” and “how” to your CEO. Articulate the problem you’re solving, how it ties to broader mission and strategy, how you’re going to solve it, and the impact that solving it will have on your business. This internal press release will narrate what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and support it with qualitative and quantitative data. And yes, for any significant decision, you should share it! This exercise identifies incongruencies in your logic, and it will also help communicate the value of doing something.</p>







<p>Prioritization is conceptually simple. In practice, it’s harder and often imprecise, a mixture of art and science. Usually, it’s about the cost versus benefit.</p>



<ul><li><strong>First, we want to understand the impact of solving a problem:</strong> How much will it move a given metric? How many customers have asked for this? Will this increase retention? Will it unlock a portion of the market?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Second, we need to have a sense of how much solving it will cost:</strong> How many engineering weeks are required to build the solution? What are the support and marketing costs?</li></ul>



<p>There are many prioritization frameworks, including <a href="https://medium.com/@nimay/inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-impact-confidence-ease-and-gist-5180434e5b15">ICE</a>, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/guides/product-prioritization-techniques-product-managers/">RICE, and many others</a>. Still, I’ve found that they often miss the need for product teams to balance multiple distinct success metrics and “themes” of work. I’ve had success with a slightly augmented version of ICE that I’ve eloquently named <strong>MICE</strong> (Metric, Impact, Confidence, Ease.)</p>



<ul><li><strong>Metric: </strong>What is the importance of the metric that this feature will move? E.g., do we care more about improving activation, or more about retention?</li><li><strong>Impact: </strong>What is the impact of solving this problem based on the pattern you’ve identified?</li><li><strong>Confidence: </strong>What is our confidence in this impact?</li><li><strong>Ease: </strong>How easy is this problem to solve? (An inverse of cost, higher is cheaper.)</li><li>Multiply M*I*C*E, and sort from highest to lowest.</li></ul>



<p>A prioritization framework will give you a way of loosely sorting what you <em>could</em> work on, but it’s a supplement for judgment, not a replacement. “Because the framework said so” isn’t a valid reason for prioritizing something. Prioritization is always a balancing act between data, intuition, and stakeholder alignment.</p>



<p>Always remember that teams are comprised of people, and people are better when they aren’t stretched thin across multiple contexts. Set a theme for the quarter (e.g., we’re going to nail this particular customer type or user persona), and focus on making material progress within that theme, instead of trying to solve a dozen problems for a dozen different customer segments. Great focus yields great results.</p>







<p>Someday, I’ll write a longer piece about driving organizational alignment (which is just a fancy way of saying “getting people to agree that this is the right thing to build”). Still, it’s so important that this article wouldn’t be complete without touching on it.</p>



<p>Organizational alignment has to start early, and often. The mechanics are incredibly variable, but there are a few unavoidable pieces:</p>



<ul><li><strong>1-1 conversations: </strong>Asking a group of 10 people, “what do you think about this?” isn’t how you create alignment and understanding. In my …</li></ul></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<p>For my open source RTL projects, I’ve so far only used 2 Verilog simulators: 
<a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com/">Icarus Verilog</a> and <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.</p>

<p>Icarus Verilog is a traditional event-driven simulator with support for most of the behavioral Verilog constructs that
can be found in complex Verilog testbenches: delays, <code>repeat</code> statements, etc. If you can look past its simulation
speed (it’s <em>very</em> slow), it does the job pretty well, and allows one to stay within a pure Verilog environment just
like you would with commercial tools such as VCS, Modelsim etc.</p>

<p>Verilator is a completely different beast: it’s a cycle based simulator that, with some exceptions, only takes
in synthesizable RTL, removes all notions of time or delays, and simulates from one cycle to the next. Cycle
based simulators are much faster than event driven ones, and Verilator is one of the best in class that
routinely beats commercial simulators. Verilator compiles your Verilog design into a bunch of C++ files and
then into a linkable library. All you need to do is write a C++ wrapper (which can be very small) that
calls the library for each simulation step, and you’re on your way. ZipCPU has <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">a very good Verilator
tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Verilator can be 500x faster than Icarus Verilog. When the simulation time of my projects gets too
long, I usually switch from Icarus to Verilator.</p>

<p>Icarus and Verilator aren’t the only open source Verilog simulators, but they are the most popular by far. And
for good reason: Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HDL_simulators#Free_and_open-source_simulators">lists</a> a number
of alternatives, but one constant between them is the lack of support for modern Verilog features. I’ve
never seen anybody use them…</p>



<p>Yosys is the star of the open source synthesis world. It initially rose to prominence with the release of 
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/">Claire Wolff</a>’s <a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/">Project IceStorm</a>, 
where it’s the synthesis component of an end-to-end open source RTL to bitstream flow for Lattice ICE40 FPGAs.</p>

<p>But Yosys is much more than that.</p>

<p>It’s a Swiss army knife of digital logic manipulation that takes in a digital design through one of its so-called frontends 
(Verilog, blif, json, ilang, even VHDL and SystemVerilog for the commercial version), provides tons of different passes that transform 
the digital logic one way or the other (e.g. flatten a hierarchy, remove redundant logic, map generic gates to 
specific technology gates, check formal equivalence), and a bunch of backends that write the final design in 
some desired format (Verilog, Spice, json, SMT2, etc.)</p>

<p>If you have a blob of synthesizable digital logic and you need to perform some kind of transformation, chances are that Yosys
already supports it.</p>

<p>Yosys’ commands are relatively well documented, but, unfortunately, the documentation snapshots on 
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/documentation.html">the official Yosys website</a> are often woefully behind.</p>

<p>To get the latest and greatest list of commands, it’s best to just compile Yosys and use the <code>help</code> function
from the command line of the tool.</p>

<p><em>The amount of information can be overwhelming (there are a large amount of commands that I don’t quite understand
myself), but, luckily, it’s not necessary to understand most of the commands: in many cases, it’s sufficient to use
ready-made recipes to go from RTL to a synthesized gate-level netlist.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/tree/master/backends/cxxrtl">CXXRTL</a> is a new Yosys backend. It writes out 
the digital logic inside Yosys as a set of C++ classes, one for each remaining module, after performing whichever 
transformation pass you want to apply.</p>

<p>In combination with <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/backends/cxxrtl/cxxrtl.h"><code>cxxrtl.h</code></a>,
a single C++ include file with template classes that implement variable width bitvector arithmetic, the C++ classes become a 
simulation model of the digital design.</p>

<p>Just like with Verilator, the simulation model is cycle-based. And just like Verilator, you need to provide a thin
C++ wrapper that calls these classes to perform a step-by-step simulation.</p>



<p>Going from Verilog to running a simulation is straightforward.</p>

<p>CXXRTL is very new and moving fast. This blog post had to be updated multiple times due to new features being added.</p>

<p>For an up-to-date state of features, it’s best to bring up the CXXRTL manual from within Yosys:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; yosys
...
yosys&gt; help write_cxxrtl

    write_cxxrtl [options] [filename]

Write C++ code that simulates the design. The generated code requires a driver
that instantiates the design, toggles its clock, and interacts with its ports.

The following driver may be used as an example for a design with a single clock
driving rising edge triggered flip-flops:

    #include "top.cc"
...
</code></pre></div></div>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Flexible Black-boxing of Submodules</p>

    <p>This makes it possible to replace any module inside the design hierarchy
  with a behavior model that’s written in C++.</p>

    <p>This can be useful for a variety of reasons during the development process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>VCD Waveform Generation</p>

    <p>A simulator isn’t worth much when it doesn’t support dumping debug waveforms.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/backends/cxxrtl/cxxrtl_vcd.h">VCD waveform writer</a> 
  is only around 200 lines of C++ code and serves as a great example for those who want to write similar 
  tools, such as support for different waveform dump file formats.</p>

    <p>An example is provided below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Design introspection</p>

    <p>Design introspection allows the testbench itself to go through the whole design 
  <em>at run time</em> and discover and interact with all objects that contain a value or state.</p>

    <p>The VCD waveform generation uses this feature to come up with all the storage elements
  (signals, memories) that need to be dumped, but introspection opens up all kinds of other 
  possibilities that are discussed further below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implementation Simplicity</p>

    <p>One of the most attractive points of CXXRTL is the simplicity of the implementation.</p>

    <p>The Yosys backend CXXRTL is small. The generated code is understandable (to a point). The execution 
  model is straightforward. It uses a single bit vector data representation and C++ templates to 
  implement Yosys digital logic primitives.</p>

    <p>It may not have the performance of Verilator (which has seen more than 20 years of
  performance optimizations), but if you had to implement some new feature, like 
  adding support for a new waveform format, it’d be trivial compared to adding that
  to Verilator.</p>

    <p>When writing this blog post, I often needed to dive into the code to clarify some details,
  and other than the complexity that’s inherent to C++ templates, I found the whole
  experience relatively painless.</p>

    <p>I consider this a major plus for an open source project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C API</p>

    <p>For those who can’t use C++ for the testbench wrapper, there is a C API that allows pure
  C to do almost anything you can do with the default C++ interface.</p>

    <p>The simulation model itself still needs to be compiled with C++, but this is useful
  to integrate and link the simulation model into language such a Python (which
  uses C to call foreign libraries).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Automatically benefits from Yosys front-end improvements</p>

    <p>Whenever a new front-end feature gets added to Yosys, CXXRTL benefits from that
  as well.</p>

    <p>SystemVerilog is a good example of this: while the pure open source version of Yosys only
  covers to small subset of SystemVerilog language features, 
  <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/commit/7e83a51fc96495c558a31fc3ca6c1a5ba4764f15">new</a>

    <p>Similarly, the <a href="https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin">ghdl-yosys-plugin</a> project has
  been working towards adding Yosys VHDL support.</p>

    <p>Since all these front-ends compile to the same intermediate data representation that
  is used by CXXRTL, this improved simulation feature support to automatic!</p>

    <p>Once the Yosys gHDL integration stabilize, CXXRTL will be the only open source simulator
  with mixed Verilog/VHDL language support!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simulation Speed</p>

    <p>CXXRTL is orders of magnitude faster than Icarus Verilog.</p>

    <p>But see below…</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Simulation Speed</p>

    <p>My current benchmark is a small VexRiscv CPU running a C program that toggles 3 LEDs.</p>

    <p>In the fastest settings, CXXRTL is about 8x slower than single-threaded Verilator.</p>

    <p>You can find my benchmarking results <a href="https://github.com/tomverbeure/cxxrtl_eval/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.</p>

    <p>One should not rely on just one benchmark, and others have reported simulation speed
  differences that aren’t as large. Verilog coding style differences, or the type of
  logic could play a major role here.</p></li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

			<p>Many people who use Rust for a bit - especially those who like the language but
do not fall in love with it - feel a sense that there must be a smaller,
simpler variation on the same theme which would maybe be a little less
powerful, but would also be much easier to use. I agree with them, but I think
they are almost always wrong about what would need to change. Here are some
notes on where I would start to create that smaller Rust.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-rust-work">What makes Rust work</h2>
<p>People almost always start in precisely the wrong place when they say how they
would change Rust, because they almost always start by saying they would add
garbage collection. This can only come from a place of naive confusion about
what makes Rust work.</p>
<p>Rust works because it enables users to write in an imperative programming
style, which is the mainstream style of programming that most users are
familiar with, while avoiding to an impressive degree the kinds of bugs that
imperative programming is notorious for. As I said once, pure functional
programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but
Rust is an even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
<p>Here are the necessary components of Rust to make imperative programming work
as a paradigm. Shockling few other production-ready imperative languages have
the first of these, and none of them have the others at all (at least, none
have them implemented correctly; C++ has unsafe analogs). Unsurprisingly, the
common names for these concepts are all opaque nonsense:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Algebraic data types”:</strong> Having both “product types” (in Rust <em>structs</em>)
and “sum types” (in Rust <em>enums</em>) is crucial. The language must not have
null, it must instead use an Option wrapper. It must have strong pattern
matching and destructuring facilities, and never insert implicit crashing
branches.</li>
<li><strong>Resource acquisition is initialization:</strong> Objects should manage
conceptual resources like file descriptors and sockets, and have destructors
which clean up resource state when the object goes out of scope. It should be
trivial to be confident the destructor will run when the object goes out of
scope. This necesitates most of ownership, moving, and borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Aliasable XOR mutable:</strong> The default should be that values can be mutated
only if they are not aliased, and there should be no way to introduce
unsynchronized aliased mutation. However, the language should support
mutating values. The only way to get this is the rest of ownership and
borrowing, the distinction between borrows and mutable borrows and the
aliasing rules between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the core, commonly identified “hard part” of Rust - ownership
and borrowing - is essentially applicable for any attempt to make checking the
correctness of an imperative program tractable. So trying to get rid of it
would be missing the real insight of Rust, and not building on the foundations
Rust has laid out.</p>
<p>However, once you get away from that, there is must about Rust that is
<em>circumstantial</em> complexity, only because of Rust’s extensive efforts to
support a low-overhead high-control systems programming use case.</p>
<h2 id="how-rust-could-be-simpler-if-it-werent-a-systems-language">How Rust could be simpler if it weren’t a “systems” language</h2>
<p>The first thing I would do is abandon any guarantee about whether variables are
allocated on the stack or the heap. Rust has to provide users with this sort of
low level control to be viable in all the places that it is, but this is the
singular source of complexity that doesn’t contribute to the benefits of Rust I
described in the previous section. Like Go, the compiler will decide for you if
your variables go on the stack or the heap.</p>
<p>The main way this simplifies things is it allows ownership to be detatched
from representation. An owned, borrowed, and mutably borrowed <code>T</code> would all
share the same representation; they’re just type-level modifiers used to
determine what kind of control you have (an owned <code>T</code> is just a mutably
borrowed <code>T</code> that will drop at the end of this scope). Probably I would also
add a fourth modifier which is shared ownership, probably implemented via
garbage collection. These would have the same semantics as <code>Arc</code>, except that
it would be possible to implement them so that they don’t leak on cycles.</p>
<p>This would not simplify ownership and borrowing in any fundamental way, but I
believe it would eliminate a lot of the confusions people run into as they’re
getting the hang of ownership and borrowing. For example, there could be only
one string type.</p>
<p>The next change would to make trait objects the primary form of polymorphism.
Every trait would be object safe, and casting a type into a trait it implements
would be lightweight and easy because it can be heap-allocated by the compiler
behind the scenes. No more monomorphization (at least, except as an
optimization). Generics would exist only for creating polymorphic container
types, not as the main way of making polymorphic <em>functions</em>.</p>
<p>I would also take Rust’s commitment to concurrency-first and make all the
available primitives threadsafe. No <code>Rc</code>, no <code>Cell</code> and <code>RefCell</code>. Interior
mutability is only allowed through a mutex type, and everything can be moved
across threads. <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> would only exist as some built-in checks on
ownership-related types.</p>
<p>I think closures and arrays/vecs/slices could also be simplified a great deal
by not guaranteeing anything about where they’re allocated, though I haven’t
worked out all the details.</p>
<p>Such a language would almost certainly also use green threads, and have a
simple CSP/actor model like Go does. There’d be no reason to have “zero cost”
futures and async/await like we do in Rust. This would impose a runtime, but
that’s fine - we’re not creating a systems language. I already said earlier
that we’d probably have garbage collection, after all.</p>
<p>And there are also many things I’m not sure about. I’m not sure that basing the
interface polymorphism on Haskell type classes would be the best decision for
this language (though I love it for Rust). I’m not sure what kind of
metaprogramming facilities the language should have (I would <em>not</em> include
macro_rules-style macros without a long iterative design process that ours
did not get.) I’m not sure what I would change about cargo - probably nothing
fundamental, cargo is great.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing I’m unsure about - and the most controversial - is error
handling. I would probably experiment with exceptions if I were making this
language. I believe that all of the big problems with exceptions are solved by
those core benefits of Rust I described initially, which provide strong
guarantees that program state will be correctly cleaned up as a program
crashes, and correctly restored as the crash is halted. I think I would at
least make panicking the normal response to most IO failures. (Even with
exceptions users could still use Result for the kinds of errors exceptions
don’t make sense for).</p>
<p>I would expect this language to have performance characteristics similar to
Java or Go, and to be viable for all the use cases they are (plus on the front
end!) It would introduce some additional complexity in the form of ownership
and borrowing, but would not be nearly the slog for new users that Rust
currently is. And in exchange you would get a language which prevents a huge
class of errors that no other imperative language except Rust helps you with
today.</p>
<p>Finally, if I were creating a non-systems language today, even if I weren’t
taking this advice, I would do this one important additional thing. I would be
careful to design and implement the compiler so that it could be embedded in
different runtimes, and I would have two primary targets: an LLVM based one
creating a standalone binary on the mainstream UNIX and windows OSes, and a
WASM target that would be intended to use the host VM’s runtime for threads,
garbage collection, and so on. This is the best decision anyone creating a new
production-ready language in 2019 could make if they want to see widespread
adoption.</p>
<p>Oh and of course, I would implement this language and its runtime in Rust!</p>

<h2 id="yes-this-means-you-yes-this-means-now">Yes this means you, yes this means now</h2>

<p>The institutions that regulate elections in the US are ancient and under attack from all sides.
This includes everything from districting to polling places to the post office.
I think we should build a decentralized, Twitter-like platform to make election experts ‘uncancelable’ in case of a dispute in the US elections this fall.
The rest of this article is about how,
but this intro section is about why.</p>

<p>First, I saw historian Timothy Snyder’s <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?424912-2/timothy-snyder-discusses-on-tyranny">lecture about how free societies become un-free</a>.
He has a book about this and it’s short, probably shorter than the talk.
Snyder says, again and again throughout, sometimes out loud, sometimes to himself as a reminder, “Yes this means you. Yes this means now.”</p>

<p>The line stuck with me.</p>

<p>Second, I titled this ‘election week’ rather than ‘election night’ because I finally read the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/03/nation/transition-integrity-projects-full-report/">Transition Integrity Project report</a>.
The paper is about a tabletop simulation they ran with a group of experts to game out the season of misinformation that we’ll be in in November.
One of the conclusions is that because of a larger-than-normal amount of mail-in voting, the vote may not be decided in one night.
There may be a lot of uncertainty.</p>

<p>And third, Belarus used police violence against protestors and opposition candidates after a disputed election this week.
The weird thing about it for me is I’m not thinking ‘this wouldn’t happen in America’, but rather ‘this looks a lot like Portland’.</p>

<p>FWIW, here’s what our state dept <a href="https://www.state.gov/presidential-elections-in-belarus/">wrote about Belarus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>detentions of peaceful protesters and journalists marred the process</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup.</p>

<p>In Belarus, the protesters are using out-of-band or mesh networking apps to stay in touch as the state blocks access to social media (<a href="https://twitter.com/franakviacorka/status/1292840766369390595">source tweet</a>).
(Update: they <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/belarus-internet-outage-election/">blocked internet entirely</a> Sunday night, after some possible per-site blocks, and are dubiously blaming it on an external DDOS attack).</p>

<p><img src="https://abe-winter.github.io/assets/belarus-mesh.png" alt="tweet about mesh services used by belarusian protesters"></p>

<p>This article is about whether and how to build similar networks here.
In the case of a disputed election, we may need them – not even to organize protests, but for finding a palatable collective truth.</p>

<h2 id="which-mesh">Which mesh</h2>

<p>I don’t have the technical depth to answer this, but can at least raise some broad questions.</p>

<p><strong>Does it need to survive an internet outage?</strong>
It seems like in Belarus this week, the outages have been site-specific rather than the internet going down entirely.
If we expect decentralized social apps to continue working, running a physical mesh would be overkill.
Example: BitTorrent runs over the internet but uses ad-hoc discovery and network toplogy.
Or <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/04/07/bug-in-tech-for-antipreppers.html">Scuttlebutt</a> is a distributed messaging platform that has some cryptographic verification features built in and can use physical handoffs to route around network problems.</p>

<p>My sense is that <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/">Fediverse / ActivityPub</a> has some cross-node mention and access control features, but doesn’t use a distributed topology for content delivery, i.e. can be blocked by taking down one site.</p>

<p><strong>Should it run on nonstandard hardware?</strong>
This is a major tradeoff.
As I understand the space, the mesh network tools with longer range use the wifi chip rather than bluetooth.
But also, they don’t run on stock iPhones or Android devices.
Asking people to flash their phones is impossible for Apple hardware, and probably a non-standard for Android users.</p>

<p>There are hardware options like GoTenna and random single-board computers with big antennas,
but is there enough of a stock of these?
And I think some of them only have proprietary messaging protocols, they can’t run arbitrary traffic.</p>

<p>Another option is to collect all of people’s old linksys routers and flash those;
it’s a reasonable guess that some % of households has one or more spare wifi boxes.
I suspect wifi routers are the most commonly available flashable wifi hardware.</p>

<h2 id="sneakernet-and-neighbors">Sneakernet and neighbors</h2>

<p>My friends just moved to the suburbs and, as young parents on a block of young parents, the community formation is almost automatic.
They have a shared chat thread for everyone on the block and organize things like over-the-fence meetups and social distance porch drinks.
My point here is that community formation leads to norm formation, and if any kind of shit goes down, the people on this block will be listening to each other for information and interpretation.</p>

<p>One of the ‘things to do’ in the Tim Snyder talk was to shake hands and make eye contact.
It’s scary that one of these things is discouraged or unsafe now,
and the other is hard to do with only half your face visible.</p>

<p>I suspect the IRL isolation caused by lockdown has degraded neighbor-nets in some places,
and the lockdown-driven migration probably hasn’t helped.
(Though my newly-suburban friends migrated post-covid, so I may be wrong here).</p>

<p>Neighbor nets are especially important for an election-week mesh because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mesh networks rely on geography, so you need to have your neighbors on board</li>
  <li>In the case of jamming or other interference, sneakernet can replace a clogged digital network</li>
  <li>Digital information is in some ways less trustworthy than face to face discussion; if the digital information starts to seem weird, people can get together and talk</li>
  <li>In a ‘take to the streets’ outcome, having geographical concentrations of people who are aligned on the facts and on electoral values can suppress violence</li>
</ul>

<p>As this sort of network booted up, I imagine early adopters or node operators organizing sidewalk meet-and-greets to get a sense of each other.</p>

<h2 id="topologies-of-trust">Topologies of trust</h2>

<p>In a provocatively titled <a href="https://themargins.substack.com/p/twitter-george-soros-and-porn">Twitter George Soros and Porn</a> newsletter from this week, this author’s well-read but very offline friends turned to Twitter for covid news because traditional media wasn’t ‘fast’ enough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>he didn’t feel like he was getting reliable information from traditional media and had downloaded Twitter to try to find better information 🤯🤢. COVID is the most fast-moving, earth-shattering, difficult-to-comprehend thing imaginable and he logged onto Twitter for the first time in his life to find information about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was frustrating when he sent me the first Alex Berenson tweet. … Contact tracing is pointless, Sweden is doing it right …</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He downloaded an app and assumed it worked as advertised. As Twitter proclaims on their landing page, they would help you “See what’s happening in the world right now”. … he shaped his idea of reality … with no real background on the underlying dynamics and mechanics of the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Confession time:
I joined twitter this March to get faster information about covid.
And now, 5 months later, I 1000% agree with this newsletter – it takes a while to understand how to read an account or community.</p>

<p>And also that Twitter isn’t vetted.
Nobody claims that it is, but we all have experiences where we realize exactly what that means.
I exited a futures position in March based on a tweet from a Politico journalist that was negative for stocks,
and the author followed up 5 minutes later with something like typo, sorry, left out the ‘not’.</p>

<p>‘Election-week mesh twitter’ won’t be immune to these problems.
But it has some advantages.
As a ‘single-issue’ social network, we can reimagine the blue checkmark and the approach to fact-checking.</p>

<p>Most of the users of this network won’t be publishing.
The ones who are will be carefully selected experts who will declare their area of expertise up-front.
That means, at minimum, there’s reputation risk for a cyber-security expert who is wrong in a big way.</p>

<p>It also means that there may be only 10 cyber-security experts on the thing, and they’ll all be weighing in on the same question.
Readers can build their personal conclusions based on the spread.
Also, they can check each other if they publish information before all the facts are available.</p>

<p>The goal of trust in general is more rapid consensus, at the cost of not being able to verify every claim or interpretation yourself.
Putting together groups of experts can give you a middle ground where you pick from a menu of expert opinions.</p>

<h2 id="truth-finding-vs-organizing-for-action">Truth-finding vs organizing for action</h2>

<p>Why orient this towards finding a consistent view of the truth rather than enabling action in case of an unfair election?</p>

<p>Two reasons:</p>

<p>First, you can’t, or at least shouldn’t, make the decision to protest unless you have the truth.
A fair election that achieves an undesired outcome is the best we can ask for, and the best we can demand.</p>

<p>Second, truth is, or at least should be, something that all sides want in an American election dispute.
Building a resilient, high-tech, grass-roots national institution that achieves this should be a common goal.
If it isn’t, we might as well start the civil war today.</p>

<h2 id="legal-protections-for-mesh-networks">Legal protections for mesh networks</h2>

<p>The TIP paper points out that whoever is currently behind the desk can use the apparatus of power to warp the election outcome.
Here are some ways that could happen and some other ways to protect against this kind of interference.</p>

<p>If the network runs over normal internet, ISPs can be compelled to block it, or to shut down entirely.
Power companies can be compelled to shut down power, although I think that would backfire because it would send people onto the street and force them to build local coalitions.</p>

<p>If the network runs on software that’s in the app store, it can be taken out of the app store by exerting pressure on Apple and Google.
If it’s sideloaded on Android devices, vendors can be pressured to release updates that block it, although I suspect this is harder to do;
it takes between 6 months and never to plumb security updates through the diverse Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>If local wifi or bluetooth is the transport, these things can be jammed, but if it’s done by police or with regulated equipment, this too can be challenged in court.</p>

<p>There needs to be a legal armor …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

These forward estimates (often referred to as consensus estimates) are released by sell-side research analyst who try to follow and model these companies. Investors look at these number relative to the company's enterprise value (EV) to see how "cheap" or "expensive" a company is relative to it's future revenue, whether it's the next-twelve-months or several years in the future.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/2020/08/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/image-1.png 1600w, https://blog.publiccomps.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>EV Multiples from the <a href="https://www.publiccomps.com/tickers?items=ZM+%28Zoom+Video%29%2CCOUP+%28Coupa+Software%29%2CDDOG+%28Datadog%29%2COKTA+%28Okta%29%2CCRWD+%28Crowdstrike%29%2CTWLO+%28Twilio%29%2CAYX+%28Alteryx%29%2CSHOP+%28Shopify%29">Public Comps Dashboard</a> for select companies (August 2020)</figcaption></figure><p>It's an open-secret that these estimates are often lower than actual revenue numbers. These researchers are incentivized to be conservative because overestimating revenue looks worse than underestimating revenue.

alt=""></figure><p>Earnings for high-growth companies <strong>beat analyst estimates by 7% on average </strong>(median 5.7%).<strong> </strong>This is a huge discrepancy on a quarterly basis, and across a year can sum up to &gt; 20% difference. The conservative nature of these estimates downplay the quality and consistency of growth, and will make growth companies look more expansive relative to future revenue when using them.</p><p>Knowing these estimates are consistently off for growth companies, you might ask are there better ways to estimate forward revenue than these expensive analyst estimates?</p><p>While working in VC, I heard of a concept called <em>growth persistence </em>from <a href="https://www.scalevp.com/blog/predictable-growth-decay-in-saas-companies">Scale Venture Partner's blog</a>:</p><blockquote>As a rule of thumb, therefore, <strong>next year's growth rate is likely to be 85% of what this year's was</strong></blockquote><p>For example, if you have a company that grew 50% this year, we can expect it to grow &nbsp;42.5% the next year.</p><p>I often used this concept to estimate forward revenue when I didn't have access to analyst estimates. To generate a <em>growth persistence estimate</em>, I took the growth rate of the corresponding quarter from the previous year , multiplied it by 0.85, and solved for the implied revenue. With the Public Comps data, I can analyze the effectiveness of the growth persistence estimate.</p><p>The median <em>growth persistence</em> (revenue growth / last year revenue growth) in our data is consistent with this rule (85.4%). I then experimented with how accurate the growth persistence estimates were compared to the actual revenue. </p><figure><img

The mean beat was reduced to 1.7% and 4.5% respectively, <strong>while the median actual revenue beats were both &lt; 1%.</strong> It's incredible how much more accurate using this simple rule is over consensus estimates. This rule requires only two data points (previous revenue growth &amp; previous revenue) that you get almost a year before the earnings, while sell-side analyst have months of research up until the earnings release.</p><p>While using analyst estimates is a common practice, it is known that these estimates are conservative, and especially so for high-growth companies. Even simple calculations like the growth persistence estimates have outperformed them. While they are useful data-points for understanding an investment, the buyers &amp; sellers of these assets are often predicting revenue earnings at higher values, and incorporating other <a href="https://blog.publiccomps.com/top-5-saas-metrics/">key SaaS metrics</a> in their decisions.</p><p>When looking at the expensive EV/forward revenue multiples for growth companies, remember it's a little cheaper than meets the eye.</p><p>If you have any questions, feedback, or concerns, feel free to shoot me an email!</p><p>Howard Chen, Public Comps Team</p><p>howard@publiccomps.com</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Chowybear">https://twitter.com/Chowybear</a></p><p><em><em>Like t</em>his analysis<em>? </em>S<em>ubscribe to the </em></em><a href="https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ulp4knn6f9h86d97tq/25h2hohoqn5p8q/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJsaWNjb21wcy5jay5wYWdlLzY4YjQ2NWQwYzk="><em><em>newsletter here</em></em></a><em><em> where we send out investment memos, market maps and analysis on the broader SaaS market.</em></em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The author owns stock directly in AYX, CRWD, TEAM, TWLO, AMZN, FB, DDOG, ESTC, and ZM.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm a happy user of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> both on my private
computers and on my work laptop. I even managed to get through four years of
university with my setup, and only had to bring a Windows machine on some rare
occasions, even though some professors are openly hostile towards a Linux setup.
(It doesn't run Microsoft Project and the real Excel, after all…)</p>
<p>Recently, I got interested in the BSDs, especially in
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and in <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.
Even though OpenBSD with its minimalistic appeal is better suited to my taste,
I'm currently looking at FreeBSD for a couple of reasons. First, I have to
maintain a storage server (a FreeBSD box using ZFS) at work. Second, I've also
built up a storage server at home. FreeBSD gives me the things I need mostly out
of the box: ZFS with redundancy on really cheap hardware. And third, I just like
to learn new things.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to learning new things in my spare time, I'd rather spend
my time on something that will be useful in the long run. I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy
Effect</a> as a guide: Technologies
like Kubernetes, the latest JavaScript framework, or Web Assembly have only been
around for a couple of years, and it's possible that those will undergo major
changes or vanish alltogether as fast as they came. Older technologies <em>that are
still around nowadays</em>, on the other hand, can be expected to be around for many
more years. Examples are the C programming language, various Unix shells, and ‒
FreeBSD. (I also make exceptions to this rule now and then. For example, I
learned Go and Rust in the summers of 2018 and 2019, respectively. Go, which had
its 1.0 release earlier than Rust, proofed to be the more stable choice.)</p>
<p>FreeBSD is now more than 25 years old. Its roots, however, go back to AT&amp;T's
original Unix from the 1970s. (All the code has been replaced or rewritten
since.) Being old is not enough, of course; a technology is only worthwhile
learning if it is still alive. Even though FreeBSD is rarely on the front page
of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, it is still widely used.
<a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2019/fosdem/looney-netflix_and_freebsd/">Netflix</a>
streams videos through FreeBSD systems, and the operating system of the
PlayStation 4, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4_system_software">Orbis
OS</a>, is based on
FreeBSD.</p>
<p>FreeBSD is not only likely to stay around for a long time, it probably also
won't undergo fundmental changes very soon or very often. One example is the
startup system of FreeBSD, which is still based on <code>init</code> and <code>rc</code> scripts.
Ubuntu, on the other side, switched from SysVinit to Upstart in 2006, and again
from Upstart to systemd in 2015. That is one init system to learn for a lifetime
(FreeBSD) vs. three in less than a decade (Ubuntu).</p>
<p>Documentation is another advantage of FreeBSD. Having a system that rarely
introduces breaking changes makes it easier and more worthwile to provide good
documentation. The FreeBSD team not only provides good <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi">manual
pages</a>, but also a well curated
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/">FAQs</a>, a
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/">Wiki</a>, and the very useful
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">Handbook</a>.
FreeBSD material has such a long shelf life so that it is even worthwhile to
print books about that operating system. I'm reading <a href="https://nostarch.com/absfreebsd3">Absolute
FreeBSD</a> now (from front to back, that is).
Michael Warren Lucas, the author of this book, has written <a href="https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product-category/tech/">even more
books</a> on FreeBSD
(and OpenBSD), which are not only useful and of high-quality, but also
well-written and fun to read.</p>
<p>As I started to work with FreeBSD, I suddenly realized what the term
«distribution» is probably supposed to mean: Not just a bunch of software
cobbled together with more or less frequent upgrades, but an entire operating
system that not only provides working software, but also the means to build that
very software on a standard installation. (Such a system is technically
described as <em>self hosting</em>.) A kernel can be compiled and installed with a
single command. Thanks to the ports tree, the packages can be compiled easily
and in a consistent way. I haven't tried <em>all</em> Linux distributions, of course,
but quality standards that high are certainly not the rule in the GNU/Linux
world. (Debian and Arch, the Linux distributions I use the most and know the
best, are still absolutely great operating systems.)</p>

<p>It's safe to say that FreeBSD is a good choice for servers in a Unix
environment. But does it also work well on a desktop computer? And is it even an
option for the kind of desktop I like to run: not GNOE, KDE, or Xfce, but a
minimalistic setup based on <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>, which probably
isn't used by many. Since dwm can only be configured by modifying the <code>config.h</code>
file, I won't be able to use the version from the ports tree. I use my desktop
computer mainly for work (programming, reading, writing, researching information
on the internet) and some entertainment mostly provided through the web browser
(reading, videos).</p>
<p>I generally use mid-range commodity hardware with on-board graphics, so hardware
compatibility should not be an issue. My desktop computer is a small-form Dell
OptiPlex 7040 from 2016 with an Intel Core i5 CPU. I replaced the original 128
TB SSD with a 500 GB model last year, and upgraded the original 8 GB of memory
with a ridiculous amount of 24 GB. (Some RAM bars just happened to lay around
here…) The computer has a WiFi card, of course, but since my router is just next
to my desk, I rather use a stable ethernet connection.</p>
<p>I already tried out OpenBSD once on that computer, and didn't have any issues
getting it to run. So FreeBSD having access to the same code base under the BSD
license is likely to suppport this hardware as well. Let's just try it out!</p>

<p>FreeBSD supports multiple versions at any given point in time. At the time of
this writing, 12.1 and 11.4 are the current versions intended for production.
Let's pick the most recent version 12.1. The <a href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64/ISO-IMAGES/12.1/">download
page</a>
for the <code>amd64</code> architecture offers various options. The compressed
<code>mini-memstick</code> archive weighs the least and provides everything that is needed
for an installation on a computer with internet connection. I download it to my
laptop running Arch Linux, and then verify the checksum:</p>
<pre><code>$ wget https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64\
/ISO-IMAGES/12.1/FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz
$ wget https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64/\
ISO-IMAGES/12.1/CHECKSUM.SHA512-FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64
$ sha512sum -c CHECKSUM.SHA512-FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64 --ignore-missing
FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz: OK
</code></pre>
<p>The archive (389 MBs) needs to be unpacked and is then copied to a USB dongle
(<code>/dev/sda</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ unxz FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz
# dd if=FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M
$ sync
</code></pre>

<p>The BIOS is setup to use UEFI rather than legacy boot. I plug in the USB dongle
and start the FreeBSD installer. These are the settings I use during setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keymap: Swiss-German (<code>ch.kdb</code>)</li>
<li>Hostname: <code>optiplex</code> (I'm not very imaginative when it comes to naming
  things.)</li>
<li>Components: just <code>lib32</code>, <code>ports</code>, and <code>src</code></li>
<li>Network: interface <code>em0</code> with DHCP and IPv4</li>
<li>Mirror: Main Site</li>
<li>Partitioning: Auto (UFS, I'm going to learn about ZFS later) on the entire
  disk <code>ada0</code> using GPT and the following partitions (device, space, type,
  label, mount point):<ul>
<li><code>ada0p1</code>: 200 MB <code>efi</code> boot (no mount point)</li>
<li><code>ada0p2</code>: 24 GB <code>freebsd-swap</code> swap0 (no mount point, size of physical memory)</li>
<li><code>ada0p3</code>: 16 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> root <code>/</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p4</code>: 4 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> temp <code>/tmp</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p5</code>: 4 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> var <code>/var</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p6</code>: 32 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> usr <code>/usr</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p7</code>: 386 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> home <code>/home</code> (remainder of the space)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Root password: I won't tell you, but a strong one!</li>
<li>CMOS clock: UTC</li>
<li>Time Zone: Europe/Switzerland (<code>CEST</code>)</li>
<li>Services: <code>sshd</code>, <code>moused</code>, <code>ntpd</code>, <code>powerd</code>, and <code>dumpdev</code></li>
<li>Security Hardening Options: everything</li>
<li>User: <code>patrick</code> with additional group <code>wheel</code> (to become root), the <code>tcsh</code>
  shell, a strong password, and, otherwise, suggested settings</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be argued if the chosen partition sizes are reasonable. However, it is
always a good idea to use separate <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/var</code> partitions to make sure
that no process can fill up the entire disk. (Using a separate <code>/usr</code> partition
is an issue on Linux nowadays, since the widely used init system systemd
requires access to <code>/usr</code>. On FreeBSD, it is still possible to do so without any
issues.)</p>
<p>Make sure to use <code>efi</code> as the type for the boot partition, not <code>freebsd-boot</code> as
suggested in <em>Absolute FreeBSD</em> (3rd Edition on page 36).</p>

<p>After the installation, I choose to shutdown the system. I unplug my USB dongle
as soon as the screen turns black.</p>
<p>Before the first boot, I have to change my boot options in the BIOS so that the
computer boots from the SSD on which FreeBSD was just installed.</p>
<p>The system boots and even shows my mouse on the terminal! The network is up and
running. However, there is a message warning me that the leapsecond file is
expired. The
<a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/leapseconds-file-expired.56645/post-322290">solution</a> suggested in the FreeBSD Forum</p>
<pre><code># service ntpd onefetch
</code></pre>
<p>fails with a certificate verification error. A <a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=230017">bug
report</a> suggest to
install the package <code>ca_root_nss</code>:</p>
<pre><code># pkg install ca_root_nss
</code></pre>
<p>Which not only installs the package management software, but also solves the
issue above: The warning concerning the leapsecond file doesn't appear after the
next boot. Now that the basic system is up and running, let's tackle the GUI!</p>

<p>Since <em>Absolute FreeBSD</em> doesn't cover graphical user interfaces, I have to
resort to the handbook. In <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/x-install.html">Chapter
5.3</a> it says that the
easiest way to setup the X Window System is to install the <code>xorg</code> package. Since
I prefer a minimalistic setup, I opt for the <code>x11/xorg-minimal</code> package instead:</p>
<pre><code># pkg install x11/xorg-minimal
</code></pre>
<p>This package depends on Python 3.7, Perl 5, and Wayland, among others, and
weighs roughly 1 GB, which is not exactly minimalistic in my opinion. On the
other hand, it is notable that the base setup works without Perl or Python.
(Which <em>is</em> minimalistic.)</p>
<h2>Compiling <code>dwm</code></h2>
<p>Since I like to keep my <code>dwm</code> version up to date, I fetch the sources using
<code>git</code>, which first needs to be installed:</p>
<pre><code># pkg install git
# git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
</code></pre>
<p>A first naive compilation attempt fails:</p>
<pre><code># cd dwm
# make
drw.c:5:10: fatal error: 'X11/Xlib.h' file not found
#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>config.mk</code> file expects the header …</p></div></div>

August 11, 2020 | https://www.maheshblog.in/2020-08-02-beginner-guide-to-start-blog-using-gatsby | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.maheshblog.in/2020-08-02-beginner-guide-to-start-blog-using-gatsby">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, there are numerous options to setup a blog. We have out of box options like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> with thousands of plugins to get started. But nothing beats the satisfaction of building something from scratch for yourself. Advantages include understanding of blog under the hood and flexibility to tailor it to your needs. Bonus is you have a playground to code and test out different ideas, designs and colors.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Need any web browser like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/">Chrome</a> etc</li>
<li>git : code repository : <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>
<li>basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basics first</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> is a static site generator frameworks. It uses React, <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> and basic web languages of HTML, JS and CSS. We don't have to understand GraphQL or React completely to get started but working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS can speed up the progress.</p>
<p>In short, Gatsby takes the code and converts into static site. Once you push code to Github git repository, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> will deploy automatically.</p>
<h2>Get started</h2>
<p>Enough of reading text, lets get started by installing and setting up environment locally. This is one time effort so worthy to get it done initially.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>any text editor (I recommend to install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual studio code</a>)</li>
<li>nodejs : <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a></li>
<li>create a git repo in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></li>
<li>
<p>Preliminary checks to do in command line or shell:</p>
<ul>
<li>is git working?</li>
</ul>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="bash" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">git --version</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<ul>
<li>is npm available?</li>
</ul>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="bash" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">npm -v</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can copy paste the following shell script to get started:</p>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="bash" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
cd gatsby-site
gatsby develop</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<p>or you can follow these instructions from Gatsby quick start in step-by-step: <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start</a></p>
<p>You can hit browser url : <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000</a> to see blog without any changes and push the code to git repository in Github.</p>
<p>Voila! you are one step closer to Gatsby based blog.</p>
<h2>Add firsts</h2>
<p>Gatsby creates pages for each of the posts and pages in the blog. There should be already bunch of sample pages for functioning site. So, you can add new html page in pages folder and it automatically accessible in the site without any other changes</p>
<h3>First page: Contact page</h3>
<p>Create new file: <strong>contact.js</strong> in <strong>pages</strong> folder with following content:</p>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="jsx" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">import React from 'react'
import Layout from '../components/layout'

const ContactPage = ({ data, location }) =&gt; {
	return &lt;Layout location={location}&gt;You can contact at dummy@mail.com&lt;/Layout&gt;
}

export default ContactPage</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<p>You can browse here: <a href="http://localhost:8000/contact">http://localhost:8000/contact</a></p>
<h3>First blog post</h3>
<p>Create new file: <strong>first-post/index.md</strong> with following content:</p>

        <deckgo-highlight-code language="markdown" terminal="carbon">
          <code slot="code">---
title: First blog
date: '2015-05-01T22:12:03.284Z'
description: 'First blog'
---

This is my first post.</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<p>You can browse here: <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a> and search for "First blog" for your post link.</p>
<p>Congratulations! now, you got a working blog and push all changes to Github repo.</p>
<h2>Deploy online using Netlify</h2>
<p>Now lets deploy the blog and make it available online. Lets use Netlify and go ahead with sign up here: <a href="https://app.netlify.com/">https://app.netlify.com/</a></p>
<p>Once you sign up and login, its a straight forward setup to deploy and here is the summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect Github</li>
<li>Pick repository</li>
<li>Leave the default options as they are in Netlify</li>
</ul>
<p>Netlify generates url for your blog and you are all set with auto deployment of blog with any change made to Github repo.</p>
<p>There might be other deployment options for static sites but here are some of the features that I liked in Netlify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Custom domain</li>
<li>Free SSL</li>
</ul>
<p>We can explore on these some other time🙂</p>
<p>Now, you are all set for new working site to add posts and have a blog for yourself.</p>

	<h2>The Full Scoop</h2>
<p>I had the opportunity yesterday to attend a CEO roundtable meeting.&nbsp; This group meeting was unique in that historically it has always met in person, but this time we met virtually.&nbsp; We felt it was still important to gather together, seek advice, and counsel; to drive towards that never ending goal of continuous improvement.&nbsp; Now more than ever, we must make the time to engage and collaborate with strong and able partners.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, a topic that received plenty of attention was COVID-19.&nbsp; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a syndrome called, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).&nbsp; All of our daily routines have been unended, and we are quickly learning we will need to adapt our daily habits to navigate through the upcoming weeks and months.&nbsp; Everyone is working hard to create flexibility for their employees that ensures their health, while we find new and creative ways to responding to the needs of our customers.</p>
<p>One topic that stood out was Attitude.&nbsp; A group member made a wonderful point in stating, "Don' talk about problems, view them as challenges, that you can and will overcome."&nbsp; Now is not the time to slow down, become discouraged, or talk constantly about "problems".&nbsp; Yes we have challenges, but humankind always has been faced with challenges, which when viewed through the proper lens - creates new opportunities for those willing to put in the time, effort and sweat.</p>
<p>Now more than ever is the time to show our employees, customers and vendors that we are willing and able to move through these challenging times.&nbsp; Your resolve as a leader will bring the confidence your team needs to overcome new obstacles, and outshine the competition.&nbsp; These issues will subside, they will be replaced by new challenges, which if we are willing and able to be open minded learners - we will also overcome.&nbsp; Stay positive.</p>

  Real-time data is incredibly valuable and actionable but organizations still face 
  obstacles in their path to real-time analytics. Instant personalization, fraud fighting, 
  support operations, large scale A/B testing— all have requirements beyond what a traditional 
  or cloud data stack can provide. In this talk, Rockset Co-founder and CEO Venkat Venkataramani will show how a real-time A/B experiments system can be built at massive scale in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
  Based on experience from scaling real-time A/B experiments systems at facebook, we find that real-time A/B experiments platforms ideally have the following requirements: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Speed with scalable real-time ingest: This will help product teams make decisions in days instead of weeks. The faster results arrive, the more experiments product teams will run.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to analyze multi-dimensional data: Almost every part of A/B testing analysis involves JOINing the real-time event stream with one or more fact tables such as users, products, devices or experiments data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sub-second queries with interactive slicing &amp; dicing: Product teams need to drill-down and interrogate the data in an interactive fashion to build new hypotheses, constructs better ideas and design follow-up experiments.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Venkat will introduce Rockset, a real-time indexing database in the cloud, and show how its schemaless ingestion, full-featured SQL, and cloud scalability can be used to build a real-time A/B experiments system that meets these requirements.

<![CDATA[The Surprising Value or Catching Up and Getting Ahead]]>

<p>Imagine a race between two people. They are moving at the same exact speed. The only difference is that one of them got a 10-second headstart. That person has the advantage of being ahead the entire race, even though they are doing the exact same thing, moving at the exact same speed. They are always winning while the other person is always losing. Now imagine that race is not a simple sprint or even a marathon, but a race as long as life. This illustrates the unthinkable advantage of getting ahead. It is no harder for the person with the headstart to maintain their lead than it is for the person losing the entire way to maintain the distance they trail behind. In fact, it may in some cases be easier to stay ahead.</p>



<p>Another way to help illustrate this point is to look at the difference between savings and debt. Imagine two people both earn the same breakeven income to cover their same costs of living. The only difference is that one person starts with a little bit of savings and the other person starts with a little bit of debt. This small initial difference in their wealth will not only remain over time — it will actually grow much larger. The first person’s savings work for them, earning them interest over time. The second person’s debt works against them, charging them interest over time. Keep in mind, they are both earning the same income to cover the same costs of living the entire time. In this case, it is significantly easier for the person with the headstart to maintain their advantage than it is for the other person to maintain the amount by which they trail behind. Even if they both do the exact same thing over the long haul, the advantage granted by the initial headstart only increases over time.</p>



<p>This phenomenon applies in a number of other areas as well. Instead of thinking of it as the difference in a competition between two people, one can also think of it as the difference between two possible versions of oneself.</p>



<p>For example, one can lose the weight they want to lose in a relatively short period of time and then maintain a lower weight for years with no more effort than they would have needed to maintain their old heavier weight over time. All else equal, that person can enjoy the benefit of being in better shape for the rest of their life all because they put in some extra work for a short time to get down to their target weight just once.</p>



<p>This is the value of catching up and getting ahead. An early advantage can offer a lead for life. By putting in the short-term work in various areas to catch up and then get ahead, one can stay ahead in all of these areas without any more long-term effort in each, and often with less. This allows them to move on to catching up and getting ahead in other areas. The virtuous cycle continues.</p>



<p>Humans seem hardwired to always be behind. In school, kids do not do all of their assignments a week before they are due. They do them all the night before they are due. Most people tend to focus on not getting too far behind rather than on catching up and getting ahead. They fail to realize that it would often take the same or less effort to maintain a lead as it does the deficit. </p>



<p>Catching up and getting ahead is not necessarily easy, but once it is done, it is just as easy to stay ahead as it would have been to stay where one started. Catching up and getting ahead of wherever one is at the moment takes less time than that over which the benefits of doing so may be enjoyed. Get some leads in life. It is no harder and often easier to stay ahead than it is to stay behind. Why keep losing when you could just as easily keep winning? Catch up. Get ahead.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR;</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I use ad blockers. YouTube flagged my account and devices. I can only watch
around 1 in 4 videos. So I wrote a Telegram bot that receives YouTube URLs and
replies back with the video.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>I use adblockers to have a semi-decent experience on the Internet. I mainly use
UBlock Origin plus some DNS ones. One nice feature of UBlock Origin is that it
does block ads from YouTube videos. On my phone I uninstalled the YouTube app
and watch videos mostly through Firefox.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their algorithms detected that I do not watch their ads so all my
accounts and devices seem flagged. I’m not completely banned, but I can’t see
more than half of the videos.</p>

<p>Before you come tell me I am inmoral for not watching the ads that many creators
need to make a living, let me point some things out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the content I follow I already support via Patreon (I spend around 80
USD bucks a month supporting those people)</li>
<li>Even being a supporter, most of the content gets published exclusively to
YouTube.</li>
<li>A lot of the videos I can’t watch do not even have ads</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I’m not complaining about being flagged. Best case scenario, I come up
with away to workaround their restrictions by building tools which is what I
enjoy doing anyways… worst case scenario, I can’t never ever watch YouTube;
I can live with that.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like when I try to watch a video:</p>

<p><img src="https://cristian.io/you-shall-no-tube.jpg" alt="you shall no tube"></p>

<p>And for videos that I can watch, the comment section displays:</p>

<pre><code>Restricted Mode has hidden comments for this video.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="my-solution-for-now-at-least">My solution (for now at least)</h2>

<p>I noticed that what seems to be blocked are the devices/accounts that I have
used, but the videos are accessible and even downloadable from other other
locations (even from the same network). So this is my plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a Telegram bot that receives YouTube urls</li>
<li>The bot downloads the video (using <code>youtube-dl</code>)</li>
<li>Then the bot replies back with the video attached as a file</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cristian.io/youtube-bot.png" alt="bot shot"></p>

<p><strong>Source code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/casidiablo/youtube-telegram-bot">https://github.com/casidiablo/youtube-telegram-bot</a></p>



<ul>
<li>It’s likely that I will hit file size limits of Telegram. To upload big videos
I might need to split them using <code>ffmpeg</code></li>
<li>I could make it so that the bot subscribes to the channels I follow and
automatically send me those videos.</li>
<li>The code itself of this bot was adapted from another bot I run that, given a
YouTube URL, downloads the video, encodes it in MP3 and publishes it to a
private Podcast feed. I use it to listen to stuff where video is just a
distraction (conferences, speeches, etc.)</li>
<li>I also run another bot that feeds my Plex server with non-YouTube videos
procured from… from nice people out there.</li>
</ul>

Try to picture Abraham Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg address or MLK Jr. giving his “I have a dream” speech... with a slideshow. It’s absurd.</p><p>All business before 1987 was conducted without PowerPoint. No horrendous charts, crappy colors, uneven shapes and poorly aligned text boxes…it existed! And people still succeeded at conveying messages!&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Ask senior colleagues what they did before PPT and they will tell you they actually had to PREPARE for presentations and condense their messages down, rather than create 150 slides for a deck that wouldn’t ever see the light of day again.</p><p>Preparation starts well before the presentation itself. Here are some quick tips:</p><p>1. <strong>Research your audience.</strong> Understand who will be in the room and how the room is physically set up. You don’t want to be caught off guard by someone you didn’t expect to show up, or in a room that was <em>supposed to have</em> a functioning projector but doesn’t. -</p><p>2. <strong>Begin with the end in mind.</strong> If your audience only walks away with ONE message, what would you want it to be? Tie everything you present into that. If it helps, think about a little airplane flying around the room with a banner attached to the tail - what would the banner say that you want everyone to remember?</p><p>3. <strong>Be thoughtful about your use of slides.</strong> People can read, so putting a bunch of text on a slide isn't helpful. Slides should add something to the presentation that an e-mail or hand-out cannot like video, audio, GIFS, etc.</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1585656241287_39527"><div>

GE pays training companies big bucks to work with aspiring executives on developing skills like executive presence, negotiations, finance, and many others.</p><p>One of the most influential sessions I attended was taught by Rob Brown, a world-renowned networking and public speaking expert. He taught us a very simple lesson: to be an effective business executive you must train yourself to speak clearly, simply, and concisely. It's not easy. It takes practice.</p><p>I'll never forget his mantra, which didn't make sense to many of us when he first said it:</p><p><strong>'Why use a policeman in an automobile when a cop in a car will do?'&nbsp;</strong>In other words, why use fancy and excessive words when a much simpler message will work?&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us immediately thought, 'No shit, Rob... GE paid you how much money to tell us not to use fluffy language when we speak?'</p><p>But the idea goes far beyond that. As you can tell from the 'policeman and automobile' line, you have options. Cop in a car is the simplest. A uniformed officer in blue from Montgomery county perched atop his leather seat inside a pearl white cruiser is another. </p><p>Forcing yourself to 'cut the crap' and get to the heart of an idea does many important things:</p><p>1. It forces you to think clearly about the presentation, project, or challenge you are working on and find helpful, simple solutions.</p><p>2. It reduces the risk of miscommunication among colleagues, ESPECIALLY for those who are working remote or are working in a non-native language.</p><p>3. It is actually more impressive, not less, to avoid using buzzwords and corporate jargon.</p><p>Using excessive vocabulary and lengthy sentences does nothing but waste people's valuable time in a meeting that's already running 5 minutes over.</p><p>Here's a challenge: Force yourself not to use the words or phrases 'perspective, at the end of the day, standpoint, synergy, capture, boil the ocean, bandwidth, etc...' for an entire day.&nbsp;</p><p>Encourage your teammates to stop you when you do and make you start over again. See how it goes. I bet it's much more difficult than you thought.</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1585656241287_53309"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>To use the ebay kleinanzeigen api (e.g. with <a href="https://github.com/tejado/ebk-client/">ebk-client</a>) an application username and an application
password is required.
However there are only two options to get this:</p>
<ol>
<li>send a mail to <strong>api@ebay-kleinanzeigen.de</strong> and never get a response or</li>
<li>find the working credentials yourself in applications which must store the
credentials</li>
</ol>
<p>This blog post describes the second approach, however you will have to to the
steps yourself and maybe even learn something as the "answer" is not stored here.
If you are unwilling to follow the steps, you are probably not worthy to use
the ebay kleinanzeigen api.</p>

<div id="getting-the-application">
<h2>Getting the application</h2>
<p>You will have to get the ebay kleinanzeigen apk from somewhere, i chose to
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ebay+kleinanzeigen+apk&amp;ia=web">duckduckgo "ebay kleinanzeigen apk"</a></p>
<p>Download the app and put it in the current working directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="unpacking-the-apk-layers">
<h2>Unpacking the apk layers</h2>
<p>I use <strong>apktool</strong> and <strong>dex2jar</strong> to unpack the apk</p>
<div><pre><span></span>apktool d -r -s eBay_Kleinanzeigen.apk
<span>cd</span> eBay_Kleinanzeigen
d2j-dex2jar ./classes.dex --force
</pre></div>
</div>
<div id="finding-the-credentials">
<h2>Finding the credentials</h2>
<p>Once unpacked we simply have to find the credentials somewhere in the code.</p>
<p>At first we open <strong>./classes-dex2jar.jar</strong> with the java disassembler:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jd-gui ./classes-dex2jar.jar
</pre></div>
<p>and now we can use the search to find the loot:</p>

Imagine if dinner was carted into this room, and four people got half the food. The night would end in violence," Anand Giridharadas told <em>IDEAS</em> host Nahlah Ayed at a public event hosted by <a href="https://www.samaracanada.com/" target="_blank">the Samara Centre for Democracy</a>.</p>  <p>"But somehow you scale it up to the level of the society &nbsp;— millions and millions of people — and you make it money instead of food, and people are like,&nbsp;'Yeah I guess that's okay,'" Giridharadas added.</p>  <p>The journalist and author has been investigating how global elites in the U.S. have been "changing the world" and dominating the news with their efforts. In his book&nbsp;<em>Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World</em>, Giridharadas lays out how the the rich and powerful have been fighting for equality and injustice, branding themselves as socially engaged agents of change and pouring millions — if not trillions — of tax-avoided dollars into social causes.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But, he warns, in all of this good, their role in causing the problems they later seek to solve is obscured.</p>  <p>"If all these people on the top are doing all this nice stuff, but year by year they are increasing their concentration of wealth and power, their monopolies are getting more monopolistic, their tech companies are becoming more abusive of privacy and democracy —&nbsp;not less —&nbsp;if their influence over politics is increasing, not decreasing, then what is all this do-gooding doing?"&nbsp;</p>  <h2>'If only' solutions</h2>  <p>The New York University professor argues that the conventional wisdom out there to solve the world's problems stems from an "if only" approach, suggesting maybe there needs to be more than just one Mark Zuckerberg to fix this.</p>  <p>"If only we had an effective altruism movement, so that when you give money away you could be guided to give it more rationally. If you give it to this NGO, it will have more impact than if you give it to that one. If only Chinese billionaires could be persuaded to donate philanthropically at the same percentage that American billionaires do," he explained.</p>  <p>"If only, if only, if only."</p>  <p>This "if only" solution got Giridharadas thinking about an equal and opposite possibility.</p>  <p>"Maybe all this extraordinary elite helping in our time is how we maintain a system — an architecture of extraordinary elite hoarding," he told Ayed.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>'While you don't have individually the power to dethrone a Mark Zuckerberg, what you do have the power to do ... is to start joining things.

Why should the decisions be left to permitting the rich to decide what's important — a hospital wing, a legal aid centre, a new well in the village? These are decisions that should involve everyone, including elected representatives and governments, Giridharadas argues.</p>  <p>When the rich and powerful not only get involved in change but get into the front row of social change, "they change 'change,'" said the former McKinsey analyst.</p>  <p>"They change what kinds of change are acceptable. They change the discourse we have about change."</p>  <h2>Make democracy</h2>  <p>If the institutions that are set up aren't to be trusted, Giridharadas proposes it's time to build better institutions — this time, from the bottom up.</p>  <p>He sees a possibility to make democracy better by organizing the world differently.</p>  <p>"While you don't have individually the power to dethrone a Mark Zuckerberg, what you do have the power to do — today, tomorrow and the next day — is to start joining things," he told Ayed.</p>  <p>Giridharadas calls on people to join organizations, membership lists and movements that work toward building cross-racial, cross-class coalitions of people — with a goal to create a future that benefits most people.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If we build movements to that effect, I think we can end this age of capital. I think we can usher in the age of reform and I think we can resume the idea of democracy as the place we go to change the world."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>* This episode was produced by Philip Coulter.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Because air flow can’t (easily) be seen, newcomers are tempted to use mental models informed by the visible world to speculate on how it behaves. Unfortunately, this intuition often falls short.</p>
<h2 id="intuition-vs-reality">
  Intuition vs. Reality

<p>Depicted below is how one would expect air to move around a sphere, with the flow behaving like individual particles that bounce off of the surface. This is known as a “bullet model”.
<img src="https://www.worksaero.com/img/BASICS_1/BM.png" alt="Flow_Wrong"></p>
<p>However, even with this basic flow, intuition is unreliable, as the bullet model is incorrect. The object does act as an obstacle, but fluids flow <em>around</em> things, and not at them. The fluid flows around the body because, in a sense, it has ‘advance warning’ that something is coming, so it reacts early and gets out of the way. Below is a more accurate depiction of the flow.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.worksaero.com/img/BASICS_1/RF.png" alt="Flow_Right"></p>
<p>This distinction may seem obvious, but consider that even the father of modern mathematics and physics, Isaac Newton, incorrectly based his theories of aerodynamics on the bullet model.</p>
<p>Correcting this misconception is an important first step in calibrating an instinct for aerodynamics.</p>

<p>The distinction between streamlined &amp; bluff bodies becomes significant when assessing the drag force acting upon each shape. If the streamlined body is used as baseline, the size of the arrows signifies the relative drag force acting on each one:</p>

<p>Where does a car fall on the streamlined/bluff spectrum?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.worksaero.com/img/BASICS_1/CAR_3.png" alt="Car_CFD"></p>
<p>The automobile has exhibited bluff characteristics for much of its existence. In the past, the customer requirements (aesthetics, interior &amp; cargo room, styling, powertrain packaging..etc) were not in line with the design direction needed to minimize drag. However, with evermore stringent regulations mandating higher fuel efficiency, many features of the streamlined body are now adopted by conventional automobiles.</p>

<p>As a result of the increased attention to aerodynamics, modern road cars have impressively low drag coefficients compared to their counterparts from even just two decades ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  The drag coefficient quantifies the amount of resistance a given shape feels, with lower being better.
</blockquote>

<p>Going forward, auto manufacturers are experimenting with novel methods to incorporate even more features of the streamlined body into the automobile form. For example, the Mercedes Concept IAA has a deployable rear tail extension to further taper it’s trailing edge. This results in a flow field remarkably similar to that of the ideal streamlined shape.</p>

  Concluding Thoughts

</h2>
<p>In review, the same general flow pattern of divergence followed by convergence exists around all objects. However, there is a distinction between streamlined and bluff objects, classifications that fall on two opposite ends of the spectrum. Most real world geometries lie somewhere on that gradient, borrowing features from both.</p>
<p>This article speaks to <em>how</em> the flow generally behaves. <a href="https://www.worksaero.com/docs/fundamentals/energy/">Continue to Part II</a>, where the discussion turns to the mechanisms by which a fluid can accumulate and deploy energy, which begins to answer the <em>why</em>.</p>

They go deep into a topic, or more briefly over a bunch of them. Although, as a Software Engineer, I learned a lot from blog posts, tweets, and conference talks, it was books that prepared me for the <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/tech-lead-everything-software-engineers-need-to-know-to-become-a-great-technology-leader">Tech Lead role</a>.</p>
<p>For this article, I created a list of 3 classic books I consider essential for whose transitioning — or desires to transition — to a leadership position in technology.</p>
<p>Books can teach us many things. It’s familiar to us to feel like there’re too many things to learn and too little time to absorb it. We tend to get anxious and overloaded with the content easily. Relax.</p>
<p>Take your time on reading, and take your time practicing it. Theory and practice converge at some point, and you realize you’ve been a leader for quite some time.</p>
<p>It’s been quite a while since their publication. So, you may notice some old stories during your reading. However, I think they are classic, and as any other book in this category, they aged very well.</p>

<p>Start receiving <strong>hand-picked content<br></strong><span>with high quality from <strong>experienced engineering leaders</strong> in your email regularly!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/software-engineering-newsletter">Subscribe to our weekly Newsletter</a></p>

<p>That said, let’s go to the list.</p>
<h2>1. Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</h2>
<p>The book was first published in 1987. The authors, Tom DeMarco and Timothy R. Lister talk about managing people through lots of stories. The stories may sound outdated and unlikely to happen nowadays, but their essence is still valid.</p>
<p>Many things stated by the two authors are kind of obvious, like<em> how expensive the turnover is, that we should include the team in the hiring process and that methodologies are restrictive</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a fantastic opportunity to recapitulate those topics; <strong>some were written more than 30 years ago</strong>.</p>
<p>Peopleware was the first book that I recall to mention the need for a sociological view, not only a technical one over projects and teams. As such, Tom and Timothy’s theories are still valid.</p>
<p>Among the theories, I how they state the importance of peer view (or <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/everything-about-code-review-from-peer-review-to-automated-code-review">Code Review</a>, in our case), and that knowledge workers, like software engineers, are continuously working their soft and hard skills.</p>
<p>The theories go through the traps of <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/how-tech-leads-and-team-leads-can-measure-teams-productivity">software engineering productivity</a>, how office influences how we work, the impact of quality in our work, and much more.</p>
<h2>2. Driving technical change: Why People on Your Team Don’t Act on Good Ideas, and How to Convince Them They Should</h2>
<p>If you’re new on persuasion and influence, the Driving Technical Change book is an excellent start. It’s full of anecdotes that surface how to gain skeptics buy-in for your ideas. It was published in 2010 and written by Terrence Ryan.</p>
<p>The content works pretty well for <em>an introductory approach on how to expose your ideas, find allies, and, most importantly, check whether your proposals are plausible</em>.</p>
<p>The book also lists some <strong>categories of skepticism, which was very valuable to me</strong>. I could better understand how the team responded to my inclinations and how I responded to others. This awareness is an excellent start for those wanting to manage large teams.</p>
<p>I confess the book is not very practical, and that may be a disadvantage against it. However, it was very relevant when I read it for the first time, and I strongly suggest you read this short (~200 pages) book even though it won’t answer all your questions or tell you exactly what to do.</p>
<h2>3. The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</h2>
<p>If you thought Peopleware was old because it was published in the late 80s, well, my next recommendation is 15 years earlier.</p>
<p>The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks was<strong> first published in 1975 (almost 50 years ago!)</strong> and covers <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/software-engineering-newsletter">software engineering and management topics</a>.</p>
<p>The author creates the concept of man-month. It’s the unit for the amount of work of a person in a month. Then, he defends that adding more people to a late project makes it later. It’s known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brook’s law</a>.</p>
<p>It relates to the latest and hottest discussions in the agile world about “coordination costs”: <strong>when you increase the number of people in a group, organizing work gets harder</strong>. Thus, it requires more meetings and management efforts to align everybody, which delays the software development even more.</p>
<p>It’s an inspiring book, a classic one, which, in a certain way, is still modern and worth the reading.</p>

<p>I've seen some people arguing about how software development should be<br>
less "passion" and more science. Others argue about how similar<br>
software development and design is to a craft and how sterile it would<br>
be without consideration for aesthetics and elements of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>If you pay attention to who says it it's easy to notice that both points of view<br>
come from different environments. One person working for a huge company may<br>
be thinking about the benefits of standards and automation and the benefits of formality.</p>
<p>Another person is talking from a different place and looking at software as a means of expression and focused on the creative characteristics of the medium. Starting from an idea and quickly move to crystallization, without formalities is what drives a lot of people to work on software.</p>
<p>Even if both perspectives seem distant, they share something in common.<br>
They both start from the experience of the people doing the work.</p>
<p>We can't ignore the fact that the experience of creating software is very different<br>
if it's for a big organization, for a small group, or as an open-source project<br>
separated from any deadline or commercial incentive.</p>
<p>A relevant quote from <a href="https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/08/07/pedagogy-in-the-trade-changing-emphasis/">GeePaw Hill</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no valid formal method for making and shipping software. If there were, humans would not be programming, computers would. Software making is irremediably, permanently, thoroughly, and happily dependent on individual humans using judgment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't it interesting that even with the lack of structure, some of the core tools we use every day<br>
have emerged from Open Source and not from the big companies with the money to use formal, math-based methods of creating software?</p>
<p>It's true that the lack of structure and opportunity for self-expression in Open Source is not a good fit for some areas where formal methods are required, so here we should recognize that there's not a unique "software development" culture, and get used to having different cultures that naturally emerge to tackle different problems. We have a problem with obsolete titles like "backend/frontend developer" that do not reflect the reality of what people do nowdays.</p>
<p>I'm aware that this discussion comes from the desire to transform software development into a more predictable activity and the idea that removing human judgment from the equation should get us closer to that. Take for example ehe way NASA develops its space ship software. It's a very extreme process when just a line of code may need weeks of discussion and evaluation. It's an exceptional process because its usage and failure treshold has very specific constraints and consequences.  The culture that emerged from those probelms is very specific too and not easily transferable to other environments. Focusing on the set of code that runs inside a space ship is a very specific and exceptional use case but I'm sure there are millions of lines of code of the supporting tools, administrative and operational stuff that is still used by NASA employees and is not developed in the same way. Different problems with different failure and experimentation thresholds.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see more new cultures develop inside the "software development sphere". Some excentric methodologies may arise that are a good fit to create a certain family of tools or serve some economic interest.<br>
Again, Open Source is very interesting because of its lack of coordination and structure. It doesn't mind deadlines, and for lots of authors, it's not directly tied to commercial incentives.</p>
<p>We could keep going and expand these ideas but the key point is that "software development" will keep growing in different directions at the same time, producing different cultures that are defined more from the problems the authors are trying to solve. The title "software developer" is starting to look like an imprecise definition of what some people do and the new roles should take into account the "culture" defined by the ideas/problems/innovations the group or individual is working on  The opposite of a "unified theory of software development" is what's currently happening. This leaves us with more questions, like what can an information worker do to better adapt to this and what companies can do about it, how to define the new roles and why fluidity instead of fixed labels is key, but I'll leave those ideas for another time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After months of work, I am ecstatic to finally announce <strong>Bevy Engine</strong>!</p>
<p>Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine and app framework built in Rust. It is <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">free and open-source</a> forever!</p>
<p>It has the following design goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Capable</b>: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set</li>
<li><b>Simple</b>: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users</li>
<li><b>Data Focused</b>: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm </li>
<li><b>Modular</b>: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like</li>
<li><b>Fast</b>: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel</li>
<li><b>Productive</b>: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy has a number of features that I think set it apart from other engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bevy ECS</b>: A custom Entity Component System with unrivaled usability and blisteringly-fast performance</li>
<li><b>Render Graphs</b>: Easily build your own multi-threaded render pipelines using Render Graph nodes</li>
<li><b>Bevy UI</b>: A custom ECS-driven UI framework built specifically for Bevy</li>
<li><b>Productive Compile Times</b>: Expect changes to compile in ~0.8-3.0 seconds with the "fast compiles" config</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has many features most people expect from a modern, general purpose engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross Platform</b>: Windows, MacOS, and Linux (with planned support for mobile and web)</li>
<li><b>3D</b>: Lights, meshes, textures, MSAA, and GLTF loading</li>
<li><b>Sprites</b>: Render individual images as sprites, render from sprite sheets, and dynamically generate new sprite sheets</li>
<li><b>Assets</b>: An extensible, event driven asset system that loads assets asynchronously in background threads</li>
<li><b>Scenes</b>: Save ECS Worlds to human-readable scene files and load scene files into ECS Worlds</li>
<li><b>Plugins</b>: All engine and app features are implemented as modular plugins</li>
<li><b>Sound</b>: Load audio files as assets and play them from within systems</li>
<li><b>Multiple Render Backends</b>: Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal (with more on the way thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu</a>)</li>
<li><b>Data Driven Shaders</b>: Easily bind ECS components directly to shader uniforms</li>
<li><b>Hot Asset Reloading</b>: Automatically reload changes to assets at runtime without recompiles or restarts</li>
<li><b>Events</b>: Efficiently consume and produce Events from within ECS systems</li>
<li><b>Properties</b>: Dynamically get and set component fields using a string version of their names</li>
<li><b>Hierarchical Transforms</b>: Create parent-child relationships between entities that propagate Transforms down the hierarchy </li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, Bevy is still in the very early stages. I consider it to be in the "prototyping" phase: features are missing, APIs will change, and documentation is sparse. <span>I don't yet recommend using Bevy in serious projects unless you are willing to deal with gaps and instability</span>.</p>
<p>Hopefully at this point you are either (1) jazzed about Bevy or (2) not reading anymore. If you want to dive in right now, <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">The Bevy Book</a> is the best place to get started. You can also keep reading to find out what the current state of Bevy is and where we'd like to take it.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note to the reader</strong>: in this article you will find text formatted like this: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_render/latest/bevy_render/texture/struct.Texture.html"><code>Texture</code>
</a></p>
<p>This formatting indicates that the text is a Rust type that links to API documentation. I encourage you to click on anything that seems interesting to you!</p>
<h2 id="bevy-apps">Bevy Apps</h2>
<p>First, lets see what a Bevy App actually looks like. The simplest App looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thats it! This App pulls in no features and literally does nothing. Running the program would just immediately terminate. We can make it a little more interesting by doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_default_plugins</span><span>()
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> adds all of the features you probably expect from a game engine: a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, input, etc</p>
<p>You can also register the default <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_app/latest/bevy_app/trait.Plugin.html"><code>Plugins</code>
</a> manually like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>CorePlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>InputPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>WindowPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>RenderPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>UiPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        </span><span>/* more plugins here ... omitted for brevity */
        </span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And of course you can also create your own plugins. In fact, all engine and game logic is built using plugins. Hopefully now you understand what we mean by modular: you are free to add/remove plugins based on your project's unique needs. However I expect that most people will stick to <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> for simplicity, at least initially. </p>
<h2 id="bevy-ecs">Bevy ECS</h2>
<p>All Bevy engine and game logic is built on top of a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a> (or ECS for short). Entity Component Systems are a software paradigm that involves breaking data up into Components. Entities are unique ids assigned to groups of Components. For example, one entity might might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component, whereas another entity might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>UI</code> component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a <code>movement</code> system that runs on all entities with a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>The ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components.</p>
<p>Unlike other Rust ECS implementations, which require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Components</b>: normal Rust structs</li>
<li><b>Systems</b>: normal Rust functions</li>
<li><b>Entities</b>: a type containing a unique integer</li>
</ul>
<p>There are already plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rW7ALyHaas">great introductions</a> to the ECS paradigm, so I'll leave "getting up to speed on ECS" as an exercise for the reader and skip right to what makes Bevy's ECS so special:</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>I'm going to make a wild (and unverifiable) claim here: Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS <em>in existence</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>struct </span><span>Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);
</span><span>struct </span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);

</span><span>// this system spawns entities with the Position and Velocity components
</span><span>fn </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands</span><span>) {</span><span>
    commands
        </span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),))
        .</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>2.0</span><span>),));
}

</span><span>// this system runs on each entity with a Position and Velocity component
</span><span>fn </span><span>movement</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>position</span><span>: </span><span>Mut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Position</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>velocity</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>) {</span><span>
    position</span><span>.</span><span>0 </span><span>+=</span><span> velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>;
}

</span><span>// the app entry point. hopefully you recognize it from the examples above!
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_startup_system</span><span>(</span><span>setup</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>movement</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That is a complete self-contained Bevy app with automatic parallel system scheduling and global change detection. In my opinion, you <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs/blob/master/examples/basic.rs">won't</a> find <a href="https://github.com/TomGillen/legion">any</a> ECS <a href="https://github.com/leudz/shipyard/blob/master/bunny_demo/src/systems.rs">with</a> better <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/ECSSamples/Assets/HelloCube">clarity</a> or ergonomics. Building games (and engines) involves writing a large number of systems, so I heavily invested in making ECS code easy to write <em>and</em> easy to read.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>One of the reasons the ECS paradigm is so popular is that it has the potential to make game logic <em>super</em> fast, primarily for these two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Iteration Speed</b>: Components are packed tightly together to optimize for cache-locality, which makes iterating over them blazing fast</li>
<li><b>Parallelism</b>: Systems declare read/write dependencies, which enables automatic and efficient lock-free parallel scheduling</li>
</ol>
<p>Bevy ECS does both of these things about as well as it can. According to the popular <code>ecs_bench</code> benchmark, Bevy ECS is the fastest Rust ECS by a pretty wide margin:</p>
<h4 id="system-iteration-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">System Iteration (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_iter.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<h4 id="world-setup-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">World Setup (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_build.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<p>Note that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a single threaded benchmark, so it doesn't illustrate the multi-threading capabilities of these framework. And as always, please be aware that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a micro benchmark and it doesn't illustrate the performance of a complex game. There is a lot of nuance in the ECS performance space and each of the ECS implementations above will perform differently under different workloads. </p>
<p>I have pushed my version of <code>ecs_bench</code> <a href="https://github.com/cart/ecs_bench">here</a> if anyone wants to double-check my methodology. For some reasonable amount of time I will post updates here if anyone reports a problem or my results are not (on average) reproducible.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Now you might be thinking "Ok @cart, so Bevy ECS has great performance and ergonomics, but <em>surely</em> this means you had to compromise on features!"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Today we’re announcing that <a href="http://parabola.io/">Parabola</a> has raised an $8m Series A led by Matrix Partners, bringing our total raised to just over $10m. Ilya Sukhar from Matrix is joining our board, and we're grateful for participation from Thrive Capital, Elad Gil, AngelPad, Merus Capital, Abstract Ventures, and individual investors.</p><p>We’re also announcing our Shopify integration and focus on helping ecommerce companies (including companies that are newly doing business online) navigate unprecedented times. But before we talk about what that means, let’s start with how we got here.</p><h3>Unequal access to technology</h3><blockquote>“The future is already here, it just isn’t evenly distributed yet.” — William Gibson</blockquote><p>I've always had a productive and positive relationship with technology. Due in large part to luck and circumstance, I learned how to code when I was young and was able to express my creativity through customizing and creating things in the digital world. But most of my friends, relatives, and peers didn’t have the same experience.</p><p>Today, there are two very different kinds of computer users: those who manually operate a computer via much drudgery and those who program computers to do work for them. Most of the benefits have accrued to those who can program a computer.</p><p>We were promised that the Digital Revolution would free us from this manual drudgery so we could unleash our innate creativity and curiosity. However, instead of being empowered, for many the forward march of technology has been a loss of agency. But all hope is not lost — we just need to more evenly distribute the future.</p><h3>Repetitive, manual work</h3><p>Through a journey that took me out of the world of engineering and into the worlds of both finance and ecommerce, I discovered entire industries built around analytical and creative people stuck doing repetitive, manual work in spreadsheets.</p><p>From the marketing analyst compiling yesterday's attribution metrics to the operations team manually refunding returned orders, manual processes were holding these businesses together.</p><p>It wasn’t that they didn’t want new technology. The real problem was that new technology wasn’t being built for the way they work.</p><h3>Parabola</h3><p>It turns out I was far from the only person who cared about this problem. I'm privileged to be joined by a phenomenal team of likeminded people who are similarly driven to help more evenly distribute the future.</p><p>At Parabola, we come to work every day armed with the belief that everyone has the ability to be amazingly analytical, curious, and creative. Unfortunately (even tragically), most people have never been given the tools and encouragement to unleash their ingenuity.</p><p>But what if they were? Every great marketer could try their idea without waiting for engineering resources. Every operations person could solve a problem once and then automate it for the future. Everyone with an interesting insight could build something to test it. In short, the world would have a lot less mundane work and a lot more cool stuff.</p><p>We're building a drag-and-drop productivity tool that lets everyone translate what they want to do into instructions for a computer to do it for them. With a library of customizable, prebuilt steps, you can use Parabola to automate your previously repetitive, manual data tasks with an easy, step-by-step approach. We also have a library of ready-to-use recipes imbued with the subject matter expertise of industry experts to make it even easier to get started and know you're doing things the right way.</p><figure id="w-node-6ab50f968817-9c9ca267"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d9bdcad630fbe7a7468a9d8/5f326dd74ee81a7834df3635_step-by-step.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>We’re just getting started</h3><p>With tens of thousands of users across many thousands of companies, we’ve seen people build incredible things with Parabola. We treasure every story we hear of users building flows in Parabola to take over their manual tasks, freeing up time for more strategic/creative work and achieving huge career growth in the process.</p><p>With the new money, we’re particularly focused on making Parabola easier to use without compromising on its power. With our new Shopify integration, we’re increasingly delivering on that promise for our ecommerce users who are scrambling to shift offline processes online and rapidly scale their operations to meet demand in a time of COVID. But we believe all knowledge workers can benefit immensely from the version of Parabola we’re building towards.</p><p>If you’re excited about this being the last day you do that same manual process in Excel, then welcome to the future. Our support team is ready to help you get set up today at <a href="http://parabola.io/">parabola.io</a>.</p><p>If you’re excited about helping us deliver this ambitious mission, we’ll need a lot more help so we’d love to hear from you. We’re currently hiring across a variety of roles for people with extreme product passion who are looking for a place they can be rewarded for doing the best work they’ve ever done.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <div>
        <article lang="en">
          
          <p>This post lays out an overview of the guiding principles driving much of the
work behind the main parts of the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/">Arcan Project</a>. For
those unaware, Arcan is presented as something as uncommon as a ‘desktop
engine’. The grand claim is that modifying and understanding the entirety of
your desktop should be ‘patching scripts’ level easy if we rework current
popular abstractions and adjust the division of labour.</p>

<p>The principles themselves link together to tell a large chunk of the vision of
the ‘divergent desktop’; a story that has been slowly getting its shape over
many years, greatly influenced by a number of publicly documented experiments
as well as seminal works such as Von Neumann’s “The Computer and the Brain”,
Norbert Weiner’s “The Human use of Human Beings”, Ian Hacking on “Representing
and Intervening”, Jaron Lanier’s trilogy on what the future may hold in store,
as well as the nowadays less digestible amalgamation of +Fravia’s Search Lores.</p>

<p>The overview is quite a long read in its own right, and full versions of each
principle will be added as individual articles over time – If the contents in
the sections here comes off as a bit dense and hard to ingest, fret not! They
are more teasers or appetisers, the full course meal will have better pacing
and technical depth.</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience, here are navigational links to the individual
sections:</p>

  <li><a href="#p12">Simplicity Is Systemic</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="backstory-and-motivation">Backstory and Motivation</h2>

<p>The Arcan project, at its core, is rooted in assumption that the ‘desktop’ way
of interfacing with computing is inching towards its last of breaths, and
rewriting X11 or JSONifying STDOUT won’t provide much more air than for a final
gasp.</p>

<p>The upside is that this may well turn out to be something positive that
provides opportunity for radical simplification and restructuring of the myriad
of technologies that make out the Rube Goldbergian contraption that is the ‘modern’
desktop.</p>

<p>The first non-academic presentation (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=07nqZIFRDJg">video</a>)
on the Arcan project had a terse, technical-overview style to it, with very little
in terms of motivation or actual intended direction.</p>

<p>The reason for that was that I wanted to keep the attention and focus on “what it is”
rather than “what will it ever be used for”, and carefully note who tries to fill
in the cryptic blank spaces, and with what. This was predicated on the belief
that honest dissemination is done by first demonstrating the feasibility and
soundness of the fundamentals of the tech in isolation; flowery visions,
soap-boxing and sociopolitical annotation are best left deferred to separate
stages should the underlying tech be sufficiently coherent and robust.</p>

<p>It is not, however, some vacuous perspective of the technology as living a life
disjunct from the social consequences of its application, but having that as
the goto default mental model for any fledgling utterances is as much of a
fool’s errand as thinking that it should never be viewed through the optics of
an abstract larger social organism.</p>

<p>The basic motivation for <em>all</em> of this is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am of humble needs and wants: I want to expand my agency, security, safety and quality of experience in regards to all things that computing touch. The largest obstacle to that expansion, right now, is the chaos and complexity of user-space, the dependency creep towards an online ‘service-space’, the peering eyes this ‘service space’ uses to study and repackage some naive interpretation of ‘you’, and how this service space is being used to mutate social- and critical- infrastructure towards something wholly frightening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a personal level, I have coded and experimented with virtually everything
computing since the days of the venerable C-64 (divide it by two, flip it over,
that’s 23) – viruses, anti-viruses; drm protections, cracks; database
engines; operating system kernels; cheats, bots and anti-cheats; emulators
(both interpreter dance and JITterbug); demos; games; parsers for more
formats than I can remember; exploits as well as mitigations. I have worked in
academia, government, military-industrial, fortune-500 as well as fledgling
startups, and got the scars and theses to prove it. The ‘left to observe’ list
has grown rather short over the years.</p>

<p>During this time, the evolution of the capabilities of the devices themselves
have exceeded all expectactions and is nothing short of spectacular. The
hardware and software lockout which plagued the early days is, relatively
speaking, minor; access to both capable devices and deep technical information
has become absolutely stellar, overwhelmingly so. The days of begging companies
for scraps of hardware; scraping public libraries and dumpsters for slices of
information; for quid-pro-quo trading of hacker ‘secrets’ and basic software
building blocks (‘warez’) are mostly faint memories. Hopefully they will remain
as such in spite of troubling signs up ahead.</p>

<p>The counterweight to this positive development is that things have become complex
to the degree that a thorough and deep understanding, <em>preconditions</em> to responsible
control and agency, is a hard thing to come by, and an even harder thing to fight
for. Just add more dependencies and layers! Get it to market! Cash out! Build a
community! Become its figurehead! Sell the community! Pass the plate! Don’t forget
to Like Comment and Subscribe! Oh and this message was sponsored by yet another
pointless VPN from a provider you can’t trust but somehow protects you from a
network you don’t trust. With such words the once so tiny tech snowball continues
its merry way down the mountain towards the village.</p>

<p>No matter the outcome, I have more things on the immediate ‘todo’ in terms of
creative things alone – than I have hours left to live, regardless of how many
those turn out to be. That is a pleasant mental image to fall back on in times of
gloom and doom.</p>

<p>My dedication to this project and the tens of thousands of invested hours has
been described as both ‘a labour of love’ as well as the more colloquial
‘fucking insane’, though personally, I view it as an act of necessity.</p>

<p>Many a times the journey has felt like digging out of a prison using the
collarbone of a fallen mate as a makeshift shovel, fuelled by the vapours of
some faint hope that there is a relatively more free world waiting within
reach, and that the proverbial roses I can smell are not just a hallucinogenic
side effect from some invisible gas deposit that this old canary has stumbled
upon.</p>

<p>The motivation is not all some evolutionary struggle for freedom. The rest
comes from bitter anger, even resentment, towards the dominant status quo and
the trajectory that computing interfaces as a whole is moving along; pandering
to trivial attention grabbing nonsense (‘engagement’) rather than crafting
sharper tools that can claw at the delicious problems that the future holds in
store.</p>

<h2 id="principle-1-professionals-first">Principle 1: Professionals First</h2>


<p>The traditional desktop is a compromise of interests, with the more recent bias
being towards appealing to a supposed ‘mainstream’ audience. This made sense
from an economical growth standpoint within the kinetics of the peculiar brand
of capitalism at the time; the previous demographic was already hooked on the
computing drug - being ‘users’ after all.</p>

<p>The thing nowadays is that the load-bearing mainstream audience is opting out at
a rapid rate and for good reason; smartphones, tablets, digital ‘assistants’,
gaming consoles and so on are all chopping up the generic ‘desktop’ into more
controlled corporate thiefdoms.</p>

<p>Many of the past compromises that were made in order to accomodate this wider
and less experienced audience are also unnecessarily restricting agency,
precision and and efficiency for those (‘the professional’) who possess both a
stronger mental model of computing, and a vested interest in its advancement.</p>

<p>It makes little sense to try and convince your grandmother that she needs a
Free! Open-Source! desktop, and it is a farce, bordering on self-harm, to still
use that scenario as part of some requirement specification for the future.</p>

<p>That aside, the ‘professional’ here is not meant as a vain appeal to exclusionary
hacker elitism – before the numbers of those within such lines dip towards that
of past ‘biker freedom’ seekers such as radio ‘amateurs’, circuit benders and
BBS operators. The ‘professional’ is acknowledging that there is a large number
(millions) of key individuals in a wide gamut of professions that are currenty
wasting much of their time and talents thanks to misguided attempts at software
ergonomics that will try and make due with what the web can give them, but they
should not have to.</p>

<p><em>Revisit past workflows, put the professional first.</em></p>


<h2 id="principle-2-diversify-experience">Principle 2: Diversify Experience</h2>

<p>A long standing maxim in computing is that of ‘mechanism, not policy’. From
a user experience perspective, it is rooted in the assumption that the user
is both willing- and capable- of leveraging mechanisms and configure them into
their own sets of policies. This has largely failed in the ‘desktop’ sense,
and very much stagnated in the command-line processing one.</p>

<p>There are many possible reasons for this, and one likely culprit on a high
level is the marketing gospel of ‘it just works’. This is a rhetoric which
strongly favours a ‘brand identity’ preset of strict policies and aesthetics
at the desktop level and beyond. Its implementation allows for little to no
accessible layering in between the opaqueness of a UI element such as a
‘button’ and the set of actions the idea of it ‘working’ represents.</p>

<p>This turns into a problem when your personal expectations of what ‘just works’
happens to clash with those of …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div id="resource"><h2>10 best practices to secure Kubernetes</h2><p>‍</p><p>Over the last couple of years, Kubernetes has become all the rage and it is now the most popular container orchestration and scheduling clustered system.&nbsp; In this article, we will cover the top 10 things you should look out for when pushing Kubernetes configurations from development through your deployment process. Our recommendations come from real-world experience with Kubernetes configurations that made it to production but should never have.</p><p>‍</p><h2>1. Warning: If a service load balancer is enabled</h2><p>‍</p><p>In a service definition if you make it a “type: LoadBalancer,” then the cloud you are on will create a load balancer for you.&nbsp; In AWS this is an ELB (external by default) and in GCP this is a LoadBalancer (external). &nbsp;All too often though, it’s a security risk since you are exposing something onto the internet with few to no security controls. There is at least one external load balancer that handles the services you want to expose to the Internet and everything routes into that.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When getting PR with this type should be flagged and reviewed.</p><p>kind: Service
<br>
apiVersion: v1
<br>
metadata:
<br>
	name: my-service
<br>
spec:
<br>
  selector:
    <br>
    app: MyApp
  <br>
  ports:
  <br>
  - protocol: TCP
    <br>
    port: 80
    <br>
    targetPort: 9376
    <br>
  clusterIP: 10.0.171.239
  <br>
  loadBalancerIP: 78.11.24.19
  <br>
  type: LoadBalancer</p><p>Anytime the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer">“type: LoadBalancer”</a> line changes, it should be flagged and&nbsp;someone - a DevOps Engineer perhaps - should review for verification and approval.</p><h2>2. Warning: If a service exposes a NodePort</h2><p>‍</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/kubernetes-nodeport-vs-loadbalancer-vs-ingress-when-should-i-use-what-922f010849e0">“Service: NodePort”</a>, will open a port on all of the nodes where it can be reached by the network external to the cluster. This exposes the cluster to a security risk. Caution should be taken when making this decision. Just like type LoadBalancer, it is really easy to do because many tutorials direct you to do it for ease of use reasons.&nbsp; Even a lot of helm / stable charts do this by default to make it “easy” for you to reach the application.<br></p><p>apiVersion: v1
<br>
kind: Service
<br>
metadata:
<br>
  name: [my-nodeport-service]
  <br>
  labels:
  <br>
    [my-label-key]: [my-label-value]
    <br>
spec:
<br>
  selector:
  <br>
    [my-selector-key]: [my-selector-value]
    <br>
  type: NodePort // This sets the “type”
  <br>
  ports:
  <br>
   - port: 8081
   <br>
     nodePort: 31514</p><p>‍</p><h2>3. Enable the ‘readiness probe’ on a deployment</h2><p>‍</p><p>A “readiness” probe should&nbsp; be defined in any deployment. This is simply a signal to inform Kubernetes when to put this pod behind the load balancer and when to put this service behind the proxy to serve traffic.&nbsp; If you put an application behind the load balancer before it is ready, then a user can reach this pod but will not get the expected response of a healthy server. &nbsp;This rule is here to give an alert to the pod developer that <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/#define-readiness-probes">the readiness probe</a> should be enabled.</p><p>‍</p><h2>4. Enable ‘liveness probe’ on a deployment</h2><p>‍</p><p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/#define-a-liveness-http-request">The liveness probe</a> is just as important as the readiness probe.&nbsp; The liveness probe lets Kubernetes know if the pod is in a healthy state and if it isn’t healthy, Kubernetes should restart it.&nbsp; This is done via a simple check, such as getting an HTTP 200ok on some endpoint or a more complex check based on some bash commands. &nbsp;Either way, it is important - and very handy - to let Kubernetes know when the application isn’t working and needs to be restarted.<br></p><div><p>
livenessProbe:
			<br>
      httpGet:
      <br>
        path: /healthz
        <br>
        port: 8080
        <br>
      initialDelaySeconds: 3
      <br>
      periodSeconds: 3
      <br></p></div><p>‍<br></p><h2>5. Enable CPU/Mem requests and limits not set on a deployment</h2><p>‍</p><p>The container(s) in a deployment should automatically requests the CPU and memory resources that it needs and define it for the system. This prevents the pod from being starved of resources, and also prevents CPU/Mem from consuming all of the resources on a node.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>resources:
<br>
      requests:
      <br>
        memory: "64Mi"
        <br>
        cpu: "250m"
        <br>
      limits:
      <br>
        memory: "128Mi"
        <br>
        cpu: "500m"</p><p>‍</p><h2>6. Control the container images deployed into your cluster</h2><p>‍</p><p>Your company may be more or less stringent on where the binaries come from, depending on their policy on third-party binaries. If you are pulling common images that organizations use - like the official nginx, MySQL, or Redis - your organization might want to build it from source and/or rehost the image internally instead of pulling from Docker Hub. </p><p>The reason is that the images stored in Docker Hub can change if someone pushes the same image and tag to it.&nbsp; That means what you get from pulling the same image and tag may be different from one day to another, causing confusion. Additionally, the difference could be something malicious that could compromise your infrastructure and application. To mitigate these risks, you can either build the image from the source and host it in your own repository, or push the same images into your repository.&nbsp;</p><p>If your organization hosts some or all of your container images, you should apply this rule to flag any image not coming from your organization and flag it for someone to approve.</p><p>apiVersion: v1
<br>
kind: Pod
<br>
metadata:
<br>
  labels:
  <br>
    test: liveness
    <br>
  name: liveness-http
  <br>
spec:
<br>
  containers:
  <br>
  - name: liveness
  <br>
    image: some-random-image-i-found-on-the-internet:v1.0</p><p>‍</p><h2>7. Apply Network Policy to your Deployments</h2><p>‍</p><p>Applying Security Groups policies to your VMs or your Kubernetes worker nodes are considered essential to security. We should do the same with Kubernetes workloads.</p><p>The best practice is to limit inbound and outbound traffic to only what you need so you don’t accidentally expose unwanted services on the outbound.&nbsp; Kubernetes has Network Policy functionality that's equivalent to Security Groups. All resources should have <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#the-networkpolicy-resource">Network Policy rules</a> associated with their deployments.<br></p><p>For every deployment set, there should be a network policy file or the following resource:<br></p><p>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
<br>
kind: NetworkPolicy</p><p>If you want to get super fancy with it, you can match up the ports list to those outlined in the deployments pods exposed list and/or the service port list.<br></p><p>ports:
<br>
   - protocol: TCP
   <br>
     port: 6379
     <br></p><p>Ideally, these would all match so that the developers know that everything reconciles and the network policy doesn't list a port that is not used by the service or pod.<br></p><p>Also make sure that you provisioned your cluster with network plugin (CNI) that supports network policies.</p><h2>8. Flag any service account changes&nbsp;</h2><p>‍</p><p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/">Service accounts</a> provide an identity mapped to some set of Kubernetes API server access permissions for a pod to use.&nbsp; When these items change, it should be flagged for review. &nbsp;These might be very minor changes that are easily overlooked, but have big ramifications on security and API server&nbsp;access. &nbsp;When these items are changed, the right persons should be notified to review the changes before it is allowed to merge.<br></p><p>If you see this type of change, flag it:<br></p><p>apiVersion: v1
<br>
kind: ServiceAccount
<br></p><p>If a service account name changes, flag it:<br></p><p>apiVersion: v1 
<br>
 kind: Pod | Deployment | Daemonset | Statefulset | rs | rc 
 <br>
 metadata:  
 <br>
  name: my-pod 
  <br>
 spec:  
 <br>
  serviceAccountName: build-robot</p><h2>9. Flag When RBAC rules change</h2><p>‍</p><p>The principle of least privilege is something your security team will be bugging you about. It's a compelling reason to get your RBAC configuration right. This is something that requires an overall review, starting with subjects that can create resources like Deployments or Pods in general or read sensitive resources like Secrets.<br></p><p>The challenging part, is to understand when Role (or ClusterRole) resources does not add privileges over time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Such change is definitely something that should be flagged for a review.<br></p><p>For example: Changing verbs: ["get"]&nbsp; to verbs: [“*”] is a significant change.<br></p><p>Check out these <a href="https://github.com/uruddarraju/kubernetes-rbac-policies/blob/master/README.md">sample RBAC policies</a> to get started.</p><h2>10. Flag when Pod ‘toleration’ to run on the master nodes is added</h2><p>‍</p><p>The Kubernetes master nodes are the control nodes of the entire cluster.&nbsp; Therefore, only certain items should be permitted to run on these nodes. To effectively limit what can run on these nodes, taints are placed on the nodes to specify items that <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/">tolerate&nbsp;the taint</a> can run on them. However, this does not preclude anyone from using these taints on their pods to run on the master nodes.<br></p><p>If you encounter the toleration below on a Pod specification in one of your deployment resources, and your cluster is self-managed, it should be flagged for review:<br></p><p>node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>The above 10 best practices should always be implemented before running deployments in order to mitigate security risks and ensure operational excellence. There are tools that could help you do that effectively, including <a href="https://www.alcide.io/">Alcide</a> and Datree. </p><p>Alcide's <a href="https://www.alcide.io/kubernetes-advisor">Kubernetes Advisor</a> audits your Kubernetes cluster, nodes and pods configuration to make sure that the cluster is tuned and runs according to security best practices. </p><p>Datree allows you to check Kubernetes configuration files early on during development - when code is committed to source control - to ensure these practices and your other development standards are adopted.</p><p>‍<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/rmpr/atbswp">atbswp</a>: Automate The Boring Stuff With Python (yes like the book) is a multi platform, open source clone of tinytask, and for those who don’t know it, 
the core feature of the software is to allow the users to record their mouse and keyboard actions and reproduce them identically as many times as they want.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0jjSgX5FYk"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/L0jjSgX5FYk/0.jpg" alt="atbswp quick demo"></a></p>


<p>The rest of this post discusses what atbswp is, why it was built, and miscellaneous things related to the project.</p>


<p>atbswp is the result of frustration with tinytask which is not available natively on Unix like systems. With tinytask being discontinued now, the position shifted from multiplatform, 
FOSS clone, to only alternative. The most important thing about atbswp is avoiding feature creep, the software is pretty simple as it and we want to keep it that way.</p>


<p>Many features of tinytask are already present in the current pre-alpha version of atbswp, the one that have not been yet replicated are compile to an executable for the host platform 
and set a replay speed, which are on the roadmap and will be the main focus for the next development. Behind the scenes, atbswp uses a Python file so the power users can always modify
it to their taste.</p>


<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui">pyautogui</a> : Used for the replay feature</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput">pynput</a>: to record user input</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller">PyInstaller</a>: to bundles the application into a single package</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">poetry</a>: to publish on PyPI</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/">wxPython</a>: for the GUI</li>
</ul>


<p>atbswp is pretty usable as it is. Although this is a pre-alpha release, it’s stable enough to be used daily, I use it to automate various task and almost all of my demos.</p>

<p>If you want up to date news about atbswp, <a href="https://hostux.social/@rmpr">follow me on Mastodon</a> to be notified about releases and blog posts like this, or you can join the 
community on <a href="https://t.me/atbswp">Telegram</a>, atbswp’s <a href="https://github.com/rmpr/atbswp">source code</a> is available on Github, you can try it now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><picture id="hero-thumbnail">
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/blog/central%20manage.webp" type="image/webp"></picture><p><h2>Published on Jul 31, 2020</h2></p></section><p>Let’s discuss an extremely common anti-pattern I’ve noticed with teams that are
relatively new to containers/cloud-native/kubernetes, etc. More so than when
building traditional monoliths, cloud-native applications can be incredibly
complex and, as a result, need a relatively sophisticated development
environment. Unfortunately, this need often isn’t evident at the beginning of
the cloud-native journey. Development environments are an afterthought – a
cumbersome, heavy, brittle drag on productivity.</p><p>The best teams treat development environments as a priority and devote
significant time to perfecting them. In doing so, they end up with
development environments that “just work” for every developer, not just those
who are experienced with containers and Kubernetes. For these teams, every
developer has a fast, easy-to-use development environment that works for every
developer every time.</p><h2 id="whats-a-development-environment">What’s a development environment?</h2><p>Before we go further, let’s get on the same page about what we mean by a
development environment in this context. When working with cloud-native
applications, each service depends on numerous containers, serverless
functions, and cloud services to operate. For this post, a development
environment is a sandbox in which developers can run their code and
dependencies for testing. It’s not the IDE, compiler, debugger, or any of those
other tools.</p><h2 id="sound-familiar">Sound Familiar?</h2><p>You’re working on a new project or planning to modernize an old one. The team
has read all about the whiz-bang nifty new cloud-native technologies, like
containers, Kubernetes, etc. So, you decide to take the plunge and build a
cloud-native app.</p><p>The team realizes that a core group of SREs will be necessary to get
everything running in a scalable, reliable, and automated setup. DevOps
engineers are hired/trained and get to work. They setup up Kubernetes, CI/CD,
monitoring, logging, and all of the other tools we’ve learned are critical for
a modern application.</p><p>Everyone knows that it’s the SRE team’s job to get all of this stuff up and
running. However, development environments aren’t top of mind. The SRE team
considers it their duty to focus on production and CI/CD – Development is the
developer’s job. At the same time, the developers think it’s their job to
deliver application features, not to maintain infrastructure. It’s not really
anyone’s responsibility to focus on developer experience before CI/CD, so it’s
neglected.</p><div><div><h2 id="why-cloud-native-kills-developer-productivityhttpskeldaiowhitepaper"><a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Why Cloud Native kills developer productivity</a></h2><p>Making the switch to microservices but think it’s too good to be true? Or you already made the switch but you’re starting to notice that local development is harder than it used to be. You’re not alone. <a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Read more of this whitepaper</a></p></div><picture>
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.webp" type="image/webp"><img data-src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png" alt="img" src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png"></picture></div><p>Unfortunately, an ad hoc approach to development environments tends to emerge.
Whenever there’s a new service, whatever developer happens to be working on it,
realizes they need some way to boot their dependencies and test their code.
They Google around and figure that Docker Compose is a reasonable way to do
this. They copy and paste some example, tweak through trial and error until
it’s working, and move on. The quality fo this initial compose file ranges
widely depending on the DevOps knowledge of the engineer who happened to write
it. Sometimes it’s pretty solid; sometimes, it’s brittle and slow.</p><p>Worse, this process repeats. Every time there’s a new service, it gets a new
git repository, and some new engineer finds themselves writing a compose file.
Perhaps this new file is copied from an existing project. Perhaps it’s
developed from scratch. Either way, now we have two compose files that need to
be maintained and updated as the app changes over time. This process repeats
and repeats until all services have their own ever so slightly different
configuration files that are a nightmare to maintain.</p><p>As a result of this (all too common) process. We see several typical issues:</p><ul><li>Development environments are unmanageable. They spread across dozens of repositories in dozens of subtly different copy-and-pasted docker-compose files. Keeping these up to date in a fast-changing application is impossible.</li><li>Development environments are incomplete. They only deal with containers because they are the easiest for an individual developer to get up and running with docker-compose. Everything else developers need to test (serverless functions, databases, specialty cloud services) requires manual effort.</li><li>Developers waste time focusing on things that aren’t their specialization. Just as most backend engineers can’t CSS their way out of a paper bag, there’s no reason for every frontend/AI/data engineer to be experts on the current DevOps trends. Developers shouldn’t spend time configuring and debugging development environments — they should spend time building features.</li></ul><h2 id="managed-development-environments">Managed Development Environments</h2><p>So how do we avoid this all-too-common scenario? The good news is that it’s not particularly challenging to do so if you’re intentional and proactive. The best teams tend to follow a couple of principles to ensure a great experience.</p><p><strong>Clear Responsibility</strong>:</p><p>There’s a team that is explicitly responsible for providing development
environments for all developers. That team can be the SRE team, or a
dedicated developer productivity team. The key is that it’s someone’s job to
focus on this issue. Furthermore, that person is likely someone with a large
amount of DevOps expertise that will produce better outcomes more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Central Management</strong>:</p><p>The development environment must be managed centrally by the team responsible for it. A single git repository contains all of the configuration and scripts necessary for a developer to get going. When the DevEnv team changes something, they do so once in that central repository, and all developers benefit. Furthermore, typically, the development environments run in a centrally managed cluster in the cloud. As a result, it’s easy for the DevEnv team to ensure things work consistently for everyone, and debug problems when they do arise.</p><p><strong>Full Automation</strong>:</p><p>Their development environments are fully automated. A single command brings up everything a developer needs to test their code. Developers don’t need to do nearly any manual setup work beyond the code changes they’re actively working on.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Achieving these goals isn’t easy. It requires a significant and sustained investment from the DevEnv team, and buy-in from developers and management to succeed. However, while the cost can be significant, it’s small relative to the wasted time and effort saved by giving every developer a fast environment that just works every time. At <a href="https://kelda.io/">Kelda</a>, we’re working hard to make this dream attainable for every developer.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blimp/docs/sign-up-try-blimp/">Try Blimp</a> to see how you can improve development speed</p><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blog/how-docker-stores-registry-credentials/">Read more about Docker internals</a> – see how registry credentials are stored.</p><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blog/docker-volumes-for-development/">Tutorial: How to Use Docker Volumes to Code Faster</a></p><hr><p>By: Ethan Jackson</p></div></div>]]>

August 11, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days GDB is the go-to development/debugging tool of many embedded Rust developers.
We think there's room for complementary tools that could provide a better development workflow and improve productivity.
In this blog post we'll share our vision for great embedded Rust tooling and share info about the tools we have been building.</p>

<p>This is an early preview of our tool <code>binfmt</code>, which is the first tool included in our <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/knurling-rs/">knurling</a> project. It is available for preview and usage today for <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">sponsors</a> of the knurling-rs efforts, and will be made public in the future, when we feel the tool is ready for general availabilty (think "0.7" release or so).</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying out an early version of <code>binfmt</code>, you can become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">Knurling-rs sponsor</a> today!</p>



<p>GDB main features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>breakpoints: halting execution once a certain part of the program is reached</li>
  <li>inspecting variables</li>
  <li>inspecting memory</li>
  <li>inspecting registers</li>
  <li>printing stack backtraces, which are function call stacks but in reverse.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are great <em>post-mortem</em> features meant for debugging issues like stack overflows, hardware fault exceptions (e.g. invalid instruction), memory corruption and ABI mismatch in function calls.</p>

<p>If you are writing an application in pure safe Rust, however, it's very unlikely you'll encounter these issues except perhaps for checked stack overflows.
During development your debugging questions will be more along the lines of: how has this register changed in response to that event? which steps brought the state machine to this particular state?
GDB features do not directly answer these questions but well placed <em>logs statements</em> do.</p>



<p>GDB operates under a "stop the world" model: run until a breakpoint, inspect things, move to the next breakpoint.
This model is not a great fit for embedded applications, which usually are reactive (need to respond to external events) and time sensitive in nature.
It is particularly problematic in applications that involve communication with other machines like USB, Ethernet and radio protocols (BLE, 802.15.4, etc.).
Halting the device often results in a breakdown of the communication which leaves no room for 'continuing the program'.</p>

<p>For these long live evented applications logging is more appropriate.
With logging you are not constrained to snapshots; instead you get the full story of your program.
Logging can quickly answer questions about the control flow of your program.
Not to mention that you can also print registers and data structures in a custom format.</p>

<p>So we think a first additional tool in the embedded toolbox is logging.</p>

<h2 id="logging-is-expensive">"Logging is expensive!"</h2>

<p>"Formatting is CPU expensive and storing strings in the device can use significant amounts of Flash" is probably what you are thinking.
I agree that <code>core::fmt</code> and anything that uses it, like the <code>log</code> crate, is not a great fit for resource constrained devices.
I have built programs with <code>log</code> and formatting indeed takes significant resources.
Let's look at the program size breakdown of the "Hello, world" program we used in <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">our latest embedded Rust workshop</a>.</p>

<p>First, this is what the program prints to the host console:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>DEBUG:dk -- Initializing the board
DEBUG:dk -- Clocks configured
DEBUG:dk -- RTC started
DEBUG:dk -- I/O pins have been configured for digital output
DEBUG:dk -- Radio initialized and configured
INFO:hello -- Hello, world!
(..)
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the breakdown of the <code>.text</code> section by function:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The <code>.text</code> section contains all the functions in the program</p>
</blockquote>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo bloat <span>-n10</span> <span>--bin</span> hello
<span>File  .text   Size      Crate Name
</span><span>0.8%  13.4% 1.3KiB        std &lt;char as core::fmt::Debug&gt;</span>::fmt
<span>0.6%  10.0%   964B      hello hello::__cortex_m_rt_main
0.5%   7.9%   768B        std core::str::slice_error_fail
0.5%   7.9%   766B        std core::fmt::Formatter::pad
0.4%   6.3%   610B        std core::fmt::Formatter::pad_integral
0.4%   6.2%   604B        std core::fmt::num::&lt;...
0.3%   4.8%   466B        std core::fmt::write
0.2%   3.9%   382B        std &lt;core::fmt::builders::PadAdapter as ...
0.2%   3.1%   302B        std core::slice::memchr::memchr
0.2%   2.6%   252B        std core::fmt::num::imp::&lt; ...
(..)
6.1% 100.0% 9.5KiB            .text section size
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Formatting functions are among the largest functions in the program according to <code>cargo-bloat</code> and formatting functions in the top 10 take more than 45% of <code>.text</code> (~4.5 KB).
In contrast, the <code>main</code> function (the application logic) is 10% of the total program size.
Having logging take ~50% of your program sounds not promising at all even if you are only including logs in development builds.</p>

<p><code>cargo-bloat</code> only reports the size of <code>.text</code>.
Strings are stored in <code>.rodata</code> so let's see how much space logging strings are taking using <code>cargo-size</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> hello <span>--</span> <span>-A</span>
<span>hello  :
section              size        addr
(..)
.text                9680       0x100
.rodata              4540      0x26d0
(..)
</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>.rodata</code> is 4.5 KB, about half the size of <code>.text</code>.
Also not great.</p>

<h2 id="making-logging-very-cheap">Making logging very cheap</h2>

<p>The first step towards making logging pervasive in embedded code is to make it cheap.
To this end we have been working on a logging framework called <code>binfmt</code>:</p>



<p>Below is the <code>cargo-bloat</code> output of a minimal <code>async</code> USB application that exposes a fully working HID interface and uses <code>binfmt</code> for logging (program output shown in the video above).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo bloat <span>-n20</span> <span>--bin</span> hid
<span>File  .text   Size     Crate Name
2.9%  56.0% 4.6KiB       hal USBD
0.3%   6.6%   548B [Unknown] main
0.3%   5.3%   440B       hal POWER
0.1%   2.6%   216B       hal RTC0
0.1%   2.4%   200B       hal hal::usbd::start_epin2
0.1%   2.1%   176B       hal hal::usbd::start_epin0
0.1%   1.9%   160B       hal hal::usbd::EVENTCAUSE
(..)
0.0%   0.7%    58B       hal binfmt::binWrite::write_sym
0.0%   0.7%    56B       hal binfmt::binWrite::leb128_write
0.0%   0.6%    52B       hal semidap::log
5.2% 100.0% 8.2KiB           .text section size
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In contrast to the <code>hello</code> example, which uses the <code>log</code> crate, now logging functions are at the bottom of the top 20 largest functions reported by <code>cargo-bloat</code>.</p>

<p>And if we look at the <code>.rodata</code> section we now see that it's minimal.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> hid
<span>hid  :
(..)
section              size        addr
.rodata                 4  0x20003250
.text                8364  0x20003254
(..)
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What's more the program size (<code>.text + .rodata</code>) of <code>hid</code> (8 KB) is ~60% of <code>hello</code> (14 KB) and packs way more functionality (USB &amp; an async executor).</p>

<p>As for the difference in runtime work we clocked <code>binfmt::info!("x={}", 42)</code> to be in the order of a few microseconds whereas <code>log::info!()</code> took ~60 microseconds or so.
I must admit this comparison is sort-of apples to oranges because it's possible to construct (absurd) edge cases that make the ratio 100:1 or higher.</p>



<p>We also think it's important to erase the gap between <code>std</code> and <code>no_std</code> applications.
<code>no_std</code> applications usually are executed using third-party subcommands; this makes them feel not first-class.
Ideally, <code>cargo run</code> should Just Work with <code>no_std</code> applications.
That's why we have created a <em>custom Cargo runner</em> that lets you run <code>cargo-run</code> embedded applications.</p>

<p>With this custom Cargo runner you can, for example, use the standard <code>todo!</code> as a placeholder for code that you have not yet written.
Take for instance this piece of <code>no_std</code> USB code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>handle_standard_request</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>:</span> <span>usb</span><span>::</span><span>StandardRequest</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binfmt</span><span>::</span><span>debug!</span><span>(</span><span>"request: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>req</span><span>);</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>req</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>usb</span><span>::</span><span>StandardRequest</span><span>::</span><span>GetDescriptor</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>descriptor</span><span>,</span>
            <span>length</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>match</span> <span>descriptor</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>Descriptor</span><span>::</span><span>DeviceQualifier</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>todo!</span><span>(),</span>
                <span>// .. omitted other cases ..</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>},</span>
        <span>// .. omitted other cases ..</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can execute <code>cargo run</code> to run your embedded program on the target device.
No new Cargo subcommand with new flags to learn; just the built-in <code>cargo-run</code> subcommand you are familiar with.
Then the output would look like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo run
<span>(..)
0.255_560s DEBUG request: GetDescriptor { descriptor: Device, ..
+.000_010s INFO  EPIN0: sending 18B of data

   9: 0x2003d594 - Reset

</span><span>$</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$?</span>
<span>134
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You would get all these detailed <code>binfmt</code> logs but that wouldn't be all.
Upon hitting a panic you would get <em>a stack backtrace</em>; just like the one you would get from a program linked to <code>std</code>.
What's more you also get the non-zero exit code from <code>cargo run</code> when you hit a panic.</p>

<h2 id="unit-testing-on-stable">Unit testing on stable</h2>

<p>Being able to run <code>no_std</code> programs like this enables <code>cargo-test</code>-like unit testing of <code>no_std</code> code <em>on the device</em>.</p>

<p>The only extra required ingredient is a <code>no_std</code> <code>exit</code> function that terminates the <code>cargo-run</code> process with an exit-code equal to 0.
With that you could, for example, write your tests in the <code>src/bin</code> folder.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// src/bin/usb-enumeration.rs</span>
<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_std</span><span>]</span>

<span>#[entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"usb-enumeration: started"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>set_timeout</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>::</span><span>from_secs</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>));</span>
    <span>block_until_enumeration_completes</span><span>();</span>
    <span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"usb-enumeration: passed"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// exit-code == 0</span>
    <span>exit</span><span>();</span> <span>// enumeration completed!</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[interrupt(binds</span> <span>=</span> <span>TIMER0)]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>timeout</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// exit-code != 0</span>
    <span>panic!</span><span>(</span><span>"USB enumeration didn't complete within expected time"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now running your unit tests would amount to running all the binaries in <code>src/bin</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo run <span>--bin</span> …</code></pre></div></div></div>

</span><span size="7">Medawar's Hypothesis on Mammal Aging</span></p>
  
  <p><b>Summary:</b> Medawar's hypothesis contended that 
  beyond a particular age the <b><a href="http://www.programmed-aging.org/evolutionary_benefit.pdf">
  evolutionary benefit</a></b> of a longer life span in mammals was negligible. 
  This species-specific age was greater than and proportional to the age at 
  which the species was first capable of reproduction. Therefore aging has 
  negligible evolutionary effect in mammals.</p>
  
  <p>
  <img src="http://www.programmed-aging.org/theories/Peter_Brian_Medawar.jpg" alt="Peter Medawar --- Wikipedia" width="140" height="198">Sir Peter Medawar<!--[if supportFields]> 
  <![endif]-->
  (1915 – 1987) was a noted British professor of zoology and anatomy at the 
  University of London who won the Nobel Prize in medicine (1960) for his work 
  on acquired immunological tolerances. In Medawar’s 1952 paper, <i>An Unsolved 
  Problem of Biology, </i>(originally presented as a lecture at University 
  College London) he presented an ingenious theory, which, in effect, combines 
  the properties of the accumulation of damage theories with Weismann<!--[if supportFields]><![endif]-->’s 
  evolved characteristic<!--[if supportFields]> <![endif]-->theory.</p>
  
  <p>Medawar<!--[if supportFields]> <![endif]-->suggested that the force of natural selection decreases once an 
  organism reaches an age where it has had some opportunity to reproduce. If, 
  for example, some trait of an animal tended to be fatal prior to puberty<!--[if supportFields]><![endif]-->, 
  that trait would be very strongly selected against because most animals having 
  that trait would die before having any progeny and would therefore not pass 
  their adverse trait to descendents. </p>
  
  <p>If, on the other hand, an animal had a trait which caused 
  a fatal effect only after the animal had reached sexual maturity, survived to 
  least one mating season, mated, had progeny, and nurtured and protected those 
  progeny long enough for them to become self sufficient (assuming it is an 
  animal that nurtures and protects young), the effect of that trait on fitness 
  would be relatively insignificant. The negative trait would only affect the 
  animal’s ability to survive yet longer and have subsequent descendents. Such a 
  trait would apparently only weakly affect fitness. Aging seemed to fit this 
  description.</p>
  
  <p>Medawar proposed that 
  even if an animal did not age, that is, did not have an increased probability 
  of death as a function of age, the numbers 
  of adult animals of any given age would decrease exponentially because of 
  deaths due to other causes such as predators, environmental conditions, etc. 
  Some constant percentage of the animals of any given age would be killed in 
  any given time period. As a metaphor, he used the random breaking and 
  replacing of test tubes. If, in a lab with hundreds of test tubes, when a test 
  tube is broken it is replaced with a new (age = 0) test tube, then after a 
  while the number of test tubes of a given age in the test tube population will 
  decline exponentially with age. Figure 4 shows the kind of survivor’s curve 
  (number as a function of age) that would be expected for the test tubes (or 
  ageless animals) as presented in Medawar’s paper. This behavior is known as an
  <i>exponential decline</i> and is characterized as having a <i>half-life</i>. 
  If half of the animals die in four years (as shown here), then half of the 
  remaining half will die in another four years, and so forth. Very old animals 
  would be very rare even in a non-aging species.</p>

  <p>The number of progeny any given non-aging animal would 
  produce was assumed by Medawar to increase linearly with age. An ageless 
  animal would tend statistically to have the same number of progeny every year 
  from puberty to death. The total number of progeny (on average) produced by 
  animals, as a function of their age, would therefore look like Figure 5 in 
  which total descendents produced by an animal are zero until puberty and then 
  increase with age. Puberty is shown here as occurring at age 6. It is assumed 
  that reproductive vigor in an ageless animal would not change with age. (We 
  could have assumed that general reproductive effectiveness and aging were 
  different, independent phenomena. However, an evolved characteristic that 
  causes a decline in reproductive effectiveness has the same problems with 
  Darwin’s mechanics as aging and the same arguments, pro and con, apply.)</p>

  <p>If we multiply the number of progeny produced by animals 
  of a given age by the number of animals at that age we can determine the <i>
  reproductive effect</i> contributed by each age group or <i>cohort</i>. Since 
  the number of animals is exponentially decreasing with age and the number of 
  progeny is only linearly increasing with age, the reproductive effect<!--[if supportFields]>
  <![endif]-->of older animals (and therefore their apparent evolutionary 
  impact) declines. Graphically, this would look like Figure 6 in which 
  reproductive effect rises from zero at puberty to a maximum and then declines.</p>

  <p>These curves, Figures 4-6, represent the <i>traditional 
  model</i><!--[if supportFields]> <![endif]-->of a non-aging species. Medawar’s 
  paper was almost entirely devoted to the development of this model.</p>
  
  <p>You will note that there are no numbers specified on the 
  vertical axes of Figures 5 and 6. Some species, subject to high death rates 
  due to predators or other cause would need a correspondingly high birth rate 
  to survive. Other species would need a lower birth rate.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="_Toc228594167">Problems with Medawar's Hypothesis</a></h2>
  
  <p>Medawar's hypothesis depends on the idea that the 
  evolutionary importance of individuals in a non-aging population declines with 
  calendar age and that therefore natural selection allows the existence of 
  progressively more negative traits with age, up to and including “death of old 
  age.” This idea, the traditional model, is based on a very important 
  assumption, namely, that the evolutionary contribution of each individual 
  animal can be accurately described by “reproductive effect” as described 
  graphically in figure 6.</p>
  
  <p>You will recall that figure 6 reflects the combined 
  effect of the reproductive contribution we could expect from individual 
  animals (figure 5) and the rate at which we could expect the non-aging animals 
  to die off (figure 4). Because the population of older animals declines more 
  rapidly with calendar age than the reproductive contribution of older 
  individuals increases with calendar age, the net effect (figure 6) is that 
  evolutionary importance declines with calendar age beyond some point that 
  varies with age of sexual maturity. This traditional model of a non-aging 
  species is over-simplified and ignores a number of important characteristics 
  of actual animals, all of which tend to increase the evolutionary importance 
  of <i>older</i> animals. </p>
  
  <p>First, the characteristics of Medawar’s test tubes (and 
  non-aging animals) were presumed to be constant and did not change with the 
  age of the test tube. However, the characteristics of actual non-aging animals 
  would change greatly with calendar age, at least between puberty and 
  “maturity.”</p>
  
  <p>Suppose we had a group of prehistoric 15-year-old humans 
  and another group of 20-year-olds. According to the reproductive effect 
  concept, these two populations are equivalent and have the same evolutionary 
  importance. In actuality, the 20-year-olds are superior with regard to 
  essentially any survival characteristic. They are stronger, faster, and 
  smarter. They would win in any competitive situation. It is obvious that a 
  20-year-old has a greater chance for survival than a 15-year-old, everything 
  else being equal. Therefore, death rates would nominally tend to decline with 
  calendar age in the interval between 15 and 20 as opposed to remaining 
  constant as proposed by the traditional model. (In actual animals, still 
  additional complexity such as protection-of-young might affect this.)</p>
  
  <p>There is a more profound difficulty. The curve of figure 
  6 assumes that ten young individuals each producing one descendent have the 
  same evolutionary importance as one older individual producing ten 
  descendents. Because they are more mature, the 20-year-olds more fully exhibit
  <i>adult</i> survival characteristics. A case could therefore be made that a 
  single 20-year-old has more evolutionary importance than any number of 
  15-year-olds. The reproductive effect concept does not take into account this 
  “maturity factor.”</p>
  
  <p>This is the same argument made against Weismann’s theory. 
  Natural selection can not operate relative to a characteristic that is not 
  expressed. Adult characteristics are not fully expressed in juveniles. 
  Therefore, adults are required in order to evolve adult characteristics. 
  Evolutionary importance is not the same as reproductive effect.</p>
  
  <p>Second, the individuals in the population of Medawar’s 
  test tubes were presumed to be identical and have identical characteristics. 
  The characteristics of actual animals <i>vary</i>. More specifically their 
  characteristics regarding capacity for survival vary. Therefore, their 
  probability of survival varies. </p>
  
  <p>The traditional model as shown in figure 4 assumes that 
  the probability of death for an ageless animal is a constant, independent of 
  calendar age. That is, older animals are just as likely to die in any given 
  time period as younger animals. While true for test tubes, this idea is 
  incompatible with the theory of natural selection. According to Darwin, 
  animals that are more fit are less likely to die than animals that are less 
  fit. Therefore, in any given time period, more of the less fit animals in a 
  population would die. At the end of the period, the surviving animals would 
  therefore, on average, be <i>more fit</i> than at the beginning of the period. 
  In other words, average fitness of a non-aging population cohort <i>increases</i> 
  with calendar age. Because older animals are more fit, they are also less 
  likely to die relative to younger animals. The probability of death therefore
  <i>decreases</i> with calendar age in a non-aging population. Figure 4 
  therefore <i>does not</i> accurately represent the relative prevalence of 
  older individuals in a …</p></div></div>

The story goes: you want more than one person in your business to have domain knowledge because they might get hit by a bus! Your business would lose all that experience and expertise in one tragic accident. The premise in isolation sounds ridiculous, but mitigating the “bus factor” is serious business.</p><p>Everything gets a lot easier if you select the right software and framework, primarily if you use Ruby on Rails. Rails itself is a full-stack framework that has a best practice for every piece of a web application. If you are committed to doing things “the Rails way,” you cut the total cost of ownership by A LOT. “Staying on the Rails” makes any new developer productive almost immediately (and will keep them “out of the weeds”). Sticking to the standards evangelized by the community and adding proper documentation (possibly in the form of useful tests) makes onboarding a breeze, which creates more productive developers, which makes hiring more accessible, which reduces your “bus factor.” <br></p><p>The only guaranteed way to save money is to spend it on reducing your “bus factor”. By investing in making the code of your application more straightforward and easier to understand, you make it easier to add developers and reduce the future occurrence of bugs. You’ll make working on your code more enjoyable (reducing the likelihood your developers will want to leave), and possibly most importantly: reduce the barriers (time/money) to building new features. If you haven’t been keeping an eye on this, and find yourself in a position to hire someone, then these tasks will be their first job <strong>every time you hire</strong>.<br></p><p>Thankfully, I have no personal experience with a colleague getting hit by a bus, but I know a few that have been hired by Netflix. Remember to look both ways before crossing a street and never underestimate the amount of money the FAANGs have to poach your talent. It is effortless to lose good talent. When (not if) your developer leaves to make $500k+ a year in the valley, you’ll be in a much better position with a lower bus factor to quickly fill the gap and keep moving forward.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After months of work, I am ecstatic to finally announce <strong>Bevy Engine</strong>!</p>
<p>Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine and app framework built in Rust. It is <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">free and open-source</a> forever!</p>
<p>It has the following design goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Capable</b>: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set</li>
<li><b>Simple</b>: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users</li>
<li><b>Data Focused</b>: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm </li>
<li><b>Modular</b>: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like</li>
<li><b>Fast</b>: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel</li>
<li><b>Productive</b>: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy has a number of features that I think set it apart from other engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bevy ECS</b>: A custom Entity Component System with unrivaled usability and blisteringly-fast performance</li>
<li><b>Render Graphs</b>: Easily build your own multi-threaded render pipelines using Render Graph nodes</li>
<li><b>Bevy UI</b>: A custom ECS-driven UI framework built specifically for Bevy</li>
<li><b>Productive Compile Times</b>: Expect changes to compile in ~0.8-3.0 seconds with the "fast compiles" config</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has many features most people expect from a modern, general purpose engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross Platform</b>: Windows, MacOS, and Linux (with planned support for mobile and web)</li>
<li><b>3D</b>: Lights, meshes, textures, MSAA, and GLTF loading</li>
<li><b>Sprites</b>: Render individual images as sprites, render from sprite sheets, and dynamically generate new sprite sheets</li>
<li><b>Assets</b>: An extensible, event driven asset system that loads assets asynchronously in background threads</li>
<li><b>Scenes</b>: Save ECS Worlds to human-readable scene files and load scene files into ECS Worlds</li>
<li><b>Plugins</b>: All engine and app features are implemented as modular plugins</li>
<li><b>Sound</b>: Load audio files as assets and play them from within systems</li>
<li><b>Multiple Render Backends</b>: Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal (with more on the way thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu</a>)</li>
<li><b>Data Driven Shaders</b>: Easily bind ECS components directly to shader uniforms</li>
<li><b>Hot Asset Reloading</b>: Automatically reload changes to assets at runtime without recompiles or restarts</li>
<li><b>Events</b>: Efficiently consume and produce Events from within ECS systems</li>
<li><b>Properties</b>: Dynamically get and set component fields using a string version of their names</li>
<li><b>Hierarchical Transforms</b>: Create parent-child relationships between entities that propagate Transforms down the hierarchy </li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, Bevy is still in the very early stages. I consider it to be in the "prototyping" phase: features are missing, APIs will change, and documentation is sparse. <span>I don't yet recommend using Bevy in serious projects unless you are willing to deal with gaps and instability</span>.</p>
<p>Hopefully at this point you are either (1) jazzed about Bevy or (2) not reading anymore. If you want to dive in right now, <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">The Bevy Book</a> is the best place to get started. You can also keep reading to find out what the current state of Bevy is and where we'd like to take it.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note to the reader</strong>: in this article you will find text formatted like this: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_render/latest/bevy_render/texture/struct.Texture.html"><code>Texture</code>
</a></p>
<p>This formatting indicates that the text is a Rust type that links to API documentation. I encourage you to click on anything that seems interesting to you!</p>
<h2 id="bevy-apps">Bevy Apps</h2>
<p>First, lets see what a Bevy App actually looks like. The simplest App looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thats it! This App pulls in no features and literally does nothing. Running the program would just immediately terminate. We can make it a little more interesting by doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_default_plugins</span><span>()
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> adds all of the features you probably expect from a game engine: a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, input, etc</p>
<p>You can also register the default <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_app/latest/bevy_app/trait.Plugin.html"><code>Plugins</code>
</a> manually like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>CorePlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())

        </span><span>/* more plugins here ... omitted for brevity */
        </span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And of course you can also create your own plugins. In fact, all engine and game logic is built using plugins. Hopefully now you understand what we mean by modular: you are free to add/remove plugins based on your project's unique needs. However I expect that most people will stick to <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> for simplicity, at least initially. </p>
<h2 id="bevy-ecs">Bevy ECS</h2>
<p>All Bevy engine and game logic is built on top of a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a> (or ECS for short). Entity Component Systems are a software paradigm that involves breaking data up into Components. Entities are unique ids assigned to groups of Components. For example, one entity might might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component, whereas another entity might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>UI</code> component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a <code>movement</code> system that runs on all entities with a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>The ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components.</p>
<p>Unlike other Rust ECS implementations, which require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Components</b>: normal Rust structs</li>
<li><b>Systems</b>: normal Rust functions</li>
<li><b>Entities</b>: a type containing a unique integer</li>
</ul>
<p>There are already plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rW7ALyHaas">great introductions</a> to the ECS paradigm, so I'll leave "getting up to speed on ECS" as an exercise for the reader and skip right to what makes Bevy's ECS so special:</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>I'm going to make a wild (and unverifiable) claim here: Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS <em>in existence</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>struct </span><span>Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);
</span><span>struct </span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);

</span><span>// this system spawns entities with the Position and Velocity components
</span><span>fn </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands</span><span>) {</span><span>
    commands
        </span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),))
        .</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>2.0</span><span>),));
}

</span><span>// this system runs on each entity with a Position and Velocity component
</span><span>fn </span><span>movement</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>position</span><span>: </span><span>Mut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Position</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>velocity</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>) {</span><span>
    position</span><span>.</span><span>0 </span><span>+=</span><span> velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>;
}

</span><span>// the app entry point. hopefully you recognize it from the examples above!
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_startup_system</span><span>(</span><span>setup</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>movement</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That is a complete self-contained Bevy app with automatic parallel system scheduling and global change detection. In my opinion, you <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs/blob/master/examples/basic.rs">won't</a> find <a href="https://github.com/TomGillen/legion">any</a> ECS <a href="https://github.com/leudz/shipyard/blob/master/bunny_demo/src/systems.rs">with</a> better <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/ECSSamples/Assets/HelloCube">clarity</a> or ergonomics. Building games (and engines) involves writing a large number of systems, so I heavily invested in making ECS code easy to write <em>and</em> easy to read.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>One of the reasons the ECS paradigm is so popular is that it has the potential to make game logic <em>super</em> fast, primarily for these two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Iteration Speed</b>: Components are packed tightly together to optimize for cache-locality, which makes iterating over them blazing fast</li>
<li><b>Parallelism</b>: Systems declare read/write dependencies, which enables automatic and efficient lock-free parallel scheduling</li>
</ol>
<p>Bevy ECS does both of these things about as well as it can. According to the popular <code>ecs_bench</code> benchmark, Bevy ECS is the fastest Rust ECS by a pretty wide margin:</p>
<h4 id="system-iteration-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">System Iteration (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_iter.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<h4 id="world-setup-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">World Setup (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_build.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<p>Note that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a single threaded benchmark, so it doesn't illustrate the multi-threading capabilities of these framework. And as always, please be aware that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a micro benchmark and it doesn't illustrate the performance of a complex game. There is a lot of nuance in the ECS performance space and each of the ECS implementations above will perform differently under different workloads. </p>
<p>I have pushed my version of <code>ecs_bench</code> <a href="https://github.com/cart/ecs_bench">here</a> if anyone wants to double-check my methodology. For some reasonable amount of time I will post updates here if anyone reports a problem or my results are not (on average) reproducible.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Now you might be thinking "Ok @cart, so Bevy ECS has great performance and ergonomics, but <em>surely</em> this means you had to compromise on features!"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_53b"><div><p>Data Science and storytelling are inseparable. And the bridge between the two is data.</p><p>I had talked about storytelling in my article about <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/data-science/business-analyst-data-scientist-ecosystem/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Analyst/Data Scientist learnings</a> but thought it would be better to elaborate more about the storytelling part.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Imagine you are a data science executive in an organization. You would be responsible for building machine learning models and analyzing data using statistical techniques to achieve business goals. There will come a time when you will have to present your work to the stakeholders of your project. In a corporate setup, a project has a mix of technical and business stakeholders. Explaining everything to this mixed audience can get tricky. For example –</p><ul><li>How do you explain the complex model building process to a non-technical stakeholder?</li><li>Is it possible to translate model parameters to business actionables and recommendations?</li><li>Is there some way to address this gap?</li></ul><h2>Storytelling to the rescue!</h2><p>Not sure how? Let me explain!</p><p>Data science and machine learning are technical in nature. In other words, it involves complex mathematical computations and methodologies, alongside its implementation in R or python. Hence, intuitively, machine learning models may not be interpretable by a person who does not have a relevant background. Such people might not be able to understand model complexity, computation time, and other model parameters. They may be driven by business goals. They might be more inquisitive about how the model impacts the company’s top-line. Or how well it reflects in numbers on a corporate level.</p><p>In all such situations, there arises a need for a data scientist to assume the role of a storyteller. A data scientist has to make sure that the complex mathematical model yields a fruitful takeaway for every stakeholder involved in the project. They should understand it irrespective of their background in machine learning. Hence, the art of storytelling becomes paramount. Storytelling for data science professionals has the following advantages –&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Helps the stakeholders better understand the value addition of the model</li><li>Increases retention: humans are trained to remember stories better</li><li>Creates a series of logically connected business points leading to the ultimate outcome</li><li>Invokes participation, generates interest</li></ol><p>I will be honest, I have experienced similar situations. Situations where I had to present a solution to a set of stakeholders with varying levels of expertise in machine learning and data science algorithms. After experimenting with different storytelling formats, I would like to tell you about the one which I prefer the most.</p><h2>How can I improve my storytelling skills?</h2><p>I like to call my method of storytelling the “<strong>What-Why-How</strong>” format.</p><p>To understand the framework better, consider the following scenario –&nbsp;</p><p>John was working on a project to predict employee attrition in the organization for over a month. Today is D-day. He is in the meeting room with all the stakeholders involved in the project. After exchanging pleasantries, he starts the presentation.&nbsp;</p><p>“<em>Good afternoon everyone. The data provided to us exhibit non-linear behavior. Hence, we have created a machine learning model called Support Vector Machines with an RBF kernel in python. After doing a grid search for hyperparameters, we were able to estimate that the model performs best with C=1 and gamma = 0.1. The accuracy of the model is 95%</em>”</p><p>There is a silence for 5 seconds. Moreover, some of the stakeholders look confused.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as a data scientist, achieving 95% accuracy should have made everyone happy.&nbsp;</p><h3>What went wrong?</h3><p>Well, John did not realize that the meeting does not have only technical stakeholders. There are stakeholders from the finance and human resources department of the organization as well. He needed to translate his model into a language that the finance and human resources stakeholders could understand.</p><h3>The “What-Why-How” framework</h3><p>The <strong>What-Why-How framework</strong> helps you break down the business problem into 3 parts.</p><ul><li>What was the business problem?</li><li>Why did we want to address that business problem?</li><li>How did we solve the problem (followed by its impact and recommendations)</li></ul><p>Once we are able to translate the project in the above framework, we facilitate –</p><ul><li>A better understanding of the business problem</li><li>Its impact</li><li>Efficacy of the suggested solution</li></ul><p>Consequently, there is an actionable takeaway for every stakeholder that they can implement. (Each machine learning model should always be followed by a set of recommendations for the stakeholders)</p><p>For better understanding, let us try and break the attrition problem into the <strong>What-Why-How framework</strong>.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>What is the problem?</strong></td><td><strong>Why to address it?</strong></td><td><strong>How can we solve it?</strong></td></tr><tr><td>High employee attrition rate in the organisation</td><td><br>1: High investment for the organisation to hire a new employee<br>2: Leads to lowering of employee moral</td><td>1: Machine learning models to estimate what factors contribute the most to attrition<br>2: Helps the human resource department to make informed data decision based on employee feedback</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Some of the insights that John could have presented to the stakeholders are –</p><ul><li>Employees that have stayed in the organization for more than 2 years are less likely to leave</li><li>High average overtime leads to high attrition</li><li>Employees who left did not receive any promotion in the last 2 years</li></ul><p>When the model presents such insights to the human resource stakeholders, they will have a set of actionable insights based on which they can take subsequent actions. Hence, rather than telling them that the model accuracy was 95% with a given set of hyperparameters, John could have told them how the model will impact the organization as a whole. This would have resonated with the stakeholders. They would have related to it better.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In the present scenario, where the technology advancements have made the model building process quick and easy, it has become essential for a data science professional to upskill themselves with the trend. What machines have not been able to do till now, is to make stories out of the data. To create a series of logically connected events to engage with the stakeholders. There is a need to cohesively bind business acumen the data science skills. Hence, every data science professional or an enthusiast should focus on building stories out of the data, not just models.</p><p>I would like to end this article by saying – Do not just be a data scientist, be a storyteller.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this article. Until next time, keep learning!</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-10035"><div><div><div><h2>Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.10 to 2.4.44 vulnerable to remote IP spoofing and bluffer overflow attacks</h2><p>Multiple vulnerabilities in Apache servers can be used by potential hackers to remotely trigger IP spoofing and buffer overflow attacks. Apache Server is the open-source HTTP web server for UNIX, Microsoft Windows, among other platforms, developed by Apache Foundation and used by many top websites.</p><p>Apache servers are vulnerable to as many as four vulnerabilities that can be successfully exploited for IP spoofing and buffer overflow attacks. These attacks can be used by the remote hackers to get complete control of the webserver hosted by Apache HTTP servers versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.44.</p><p>The first of the vulnerabilities is the limit error in the module&nbsp;od_proxy_uwsgi<em>.</em> This vulnerability has been issued a unique identifier, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11984"><strong>CVE-2020-11984</strong></a>, and has a CVSS score of &nbsp;7.7/10. The flaw is known as Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’) and can be used by potential hackers to remotely execute arbitrary code. Hackers can use the limit error in the Apache server module od_proxy_uwsgi and generate buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution on the target system.</p><p>Apache HTTP server running on version 2.4.32 to 2.4.44 are vulnerable to this flaw.</p><p>The second vulnerability has been issued a unique identifier, <strong><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11993">CVE-2020-11993</a>, </strong>and has a CVSS score of 6.5/10. The flaw resides in the way Apache servers inadequately manage application resources when processing HTTP/2 requests with trace/debug enabled, causing concurrent use of memory pools. Potential hackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted requests to the Apache server to launch denial of service <strong>(DoS)</strong> attacks.</p><p>Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43&nbsp; are vulnerable to this flaw. Configuring the LogLevel of mod_http2 above “info” will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.</p><p>The next one is <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9490"><strong>CVE-2020-9490</strong></a>&nbsp;vulnerability which exists due to insufficient validation of user-provided entries when processing the Cache-Digest header in the HTTP/2 request. Remote hackers can send a specially crafted value to the Apache server for the ‘Cache-Digest’ header in an HTTP/2 request. This would result in a DoS attack and cause a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterward. The flaw affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43 and has a CVSS&nbsp;score of 6.5/10.</p><p>The final vulnerability in Apache servers is an input validation error and has been issued a unique identifier, <strong><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11985">CVE-2020-11985</a>&nbsp;</strong>with a CVSS score of 5.7/10. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in an Apache server. A remote attacker can spoof the user’s IP address when proxying using mod_remoteip and mod_rewrite.&nbsp; As result the fake IP address will be displayed in logs and will be passed to PHP scripts.&nbsp;Depending on web application functionality this vulnerability can be used to bypass authorization checks based on IP addresses.</p><p>This vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions from 2.4.1 to 2.4.23.

<p><em>2020 has hit many publishers hard. Nonetheless, there are ways to re-group and minimize the damage.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>As the April 2020 <a href="https://www.iab.com/insights/coronavirus-ad-revenue-impact-sell-side/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">study by IAB</a> unveiled, the majority of publishers expect their digital ad revenue to decrease in 2020, due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, subsequent lockdown and economic crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, in the light of uncertainty of how the events would unfold, most brands have either cancelled or postponed their online advertising campaigns, cutting their marketing budgets to the minimum until things improve, especially in the video ad segment. More importantly, widely-applied blacklisting practices have also taken a huge toll on the editorial publishing niche.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, now that Q3 is already here, the digital advertising industry is seemingly starting to re-group and slowly recover after the first aftershocks. According to the latest <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/08/10/emarketer-us-b2b-digital-ad-spend-soars-226" target="_blank">eMarketer </a>study, for instance, the B2B digital ad spend is surging over 20%, especially in the tech, healthcare and financial sectors, and is likely to exceed $8 000 000 000 in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, undoubtedly, means new revenue opportunities&nbsp; for publishers are being unlocked, as long as they’re willing to embrace these.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Check out the AdPlayer.Pro tips on how to monetize editorial content more efficiently in 2020.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Leverage your Audience &amp; Increase Subscriptions&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Now is definitely the right time and place to analyze your audience not only in terms of demographics, but also their subscription intent. While hiding the COVID19-related news behind the paywall isn’t perceived as the best practice, finding content creatives your readers will eagerly pay for, on a regular basis is a key. These may imply launching engaging webinars, offering insightful research, sharing on-topic podcasts, but the list of options may vary.</p>



<p>In this respect, you might even consider integrating <a href="https://adplayer.pro/solutions/rewarded">rewarded video ads on your web properties</a> to monetize audience segments, who can’t or aren’t willing to apply for a paid subscription at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Strengthen your Reputation by Mitigating IVT</strong></h4>



<p>It’s essential that you familiarize yourself with your traffic sources and patterns, and review them on a regular basis to identify unusual or suspicious activities in a timely manner.</p>



<p>In this respect, if you’re working with a third-party ad verification vendor, it’s possible to drill down to more detail on particular domains or IPs being the source of IVT, if any.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may happen so that anti-fraud software falsely flags genuine traffic as IVT, if it’s impossible to identify its source. In this case, you need to contact your ad verification provider directly to resolve the issue.</p>



<p>In addition, it’s vital to ensure the proper ad tag integration, so that video ad creative isn’t overlapping the main webpage content.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Leverage Direct Partnerships</strong></h4>



<p>If you’re facing programmatic ad revenue downfall, consider extending your monetization practices by partnering directly with brand advertisers (small or mid-sized companies) in your specific niche or some of the currently hot verticals, like the financial, pharmaceutical, or tech.</p>



<h4><strong>A/B Test Outstream Video Ads on Mobile Web</strong></h4>



<p>Outstream advertising has been on the rise over the past years, and if you have been reluctant to integrate <a href="https://blog.adplayer.pro/2017/10/02/publisher-opportunity-outstream-ads/">outstream video ads</a> on your website, it’s time for a change.</p>



<p>Namely, since the smartphone/tablet traffic on mobile websites has soared in 2020, try experimenting with various <a href="https://adplayer.pro/solutions">outstream video ad formats</a> on mobile web, conducting a/b tests to select the most efficient ad placements. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>This article based on the talk I gave on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4a7aJa__aE" target="_blank">Cocoaheads Kyiv #15</a> in 2019. It’s an overview of how to inject custom code into iOS Simulator with <code>simctl</code>. 
All code examples written in Objective-C.</p>

<hr>

<p>When building products for engineers, you should always consider a “flow” factor. You don’t want to be yet another distraction. So when we were building <a href="https://flawlessapp.io/" target="_blank">Flawless App</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> we started with Xcode &amp; iOS Simulator integrations. Flawless App is a tool to compare iOS app design &amp; implementation in real-time, search for visual bugs, and prevent regressions. It was important to connect to iOS Simulator and overlay design with different filters. Almost as it was a default Simulator’s feature.</p>

<p>Surely there was no official documentation to make this happen. iOS Simulator was never a platform to build on top of. After numerous trials and errors, I found a way to inject our code into Simulator as the “plugin”. It was practically a dynamic library, loaded into one of iOS’s native processes.</p>

<p>Here is our today’s agenda.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intro to <code>simctl</code>. What is it about, and how does it work?</li>
  <li>Method swizzling. Modify code you don’t own.</li>
  <li>Building dynamic iOS libraries.</li>
  <li>Injecting library into Simulator.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="intro-to-simctl">Intro to simctl</h3>
<p>The <code>simctl</code> is a command-line tool that comes bundled with Xcode. It allows basic interactions with the iOS Simulator. To access <code>simctl</code> directly, run the following script in the terminal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl

Command line utility to control the Simulator
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>xcrun</code> is another command-line tool which makes it easier to run all kind of scripts in Xcode. If you’re curious, you can find a <code>simctl</code> at <em>Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/simctl</em></p>

<p>Important note: Simulator isn’t an Emulator. Practically Simulator is a macOS application. All its active processes are accessible from macOS. You can simply type <code>SpringBoard</code> in Activity Monitor and see its details.</p>

<p>I encourage anyone to dive deeper into the <code>simctl</code> documentation. Highly recommend <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10647/" target="_blank">WWDC 2020: Become a Simulator expert</a> session or <a href="https://nshipster.com/simctl/" target="_blank">simctl overview by NSHipster</a> as an introduction. Even without injecting anything into Simulator, using <code>simctl</code> can go a long way.</p>

<p>However, let’s focus on our original task. Here is a few important commands that will come handy later:</p>

<h4 id="simctl-list">simctl list</h4>
<p>As the name suggests, <code>simctl list</code> returns a list of Simulators. If you want to interact with a specific iOS Simulator, you’d need to know its UDID.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl list -j [devices|devicetypes|runtimes|pairs]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-j</code> parameter sets the output to be formatted as JSON. Below is an output example, an array of runtimes, installed devices, and their details.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"devices"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.watchOS-5-2"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
      </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"state"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Shutdown"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"isAvailable"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"name"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Apple Watch Series 2 - 38mm"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"udid"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"3159F9D3-694F-44C6-A471-BD7856B5CF47"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"availabilityError"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"runtime profile not found"</span><span>
      </span><span>},</span><span>
      </span><span>...</span><span>
    </span><span>],</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Knowing UDID you can then interact with a specific Simulator. For example, shutdown a certain device from the command-line</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl shutdown 3159F9D3-694F-44C6-A471-BD7856B5CF47
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally to UDID <code>simctl</code> gives you alias <code>booted</code> to interact with active Simulator. This alias should be used cautiously though. Since Xcode 9 the user can launch many Simulators simultaneously. In such a situation, <code>booted</code> alias forwards the request to the last active Simulator.</p>

<h4 id="simctl-spawn">simctl spawn</h4>
<p>The <code>spawn</code> is one of those commands that make iOS Simulator plugins a reality. In simple words, <code>spawn</code> is launching certain processes/scripts in the system. Following the path below you can find various internal scripts/tools bundled with iOS Simulator Runtime.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/usr/....
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those tools include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>log</code> – a tool to interact with internal iOS Simulator logs.</li>
  <li><code>leaks</code> – a tool to inspect a process for possible memory leaks.</li>
  <li><code>malloc_history</code> – a tool to display allocation histories for the selected process.</li>
</ul>

<p>To launch any of those tools simply type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl spawn booted &lt;NAME OF THE TOOL&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What’s more important is that now you also have access to <code>launchctl</code>. This is a service that manages all the daemons, scripts, and apps in the system.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun simctl spawn booted launchctl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="method-swizzling">Method swizzling</h3>
<p>Another handy tool in our arsenal is method swizzling. Put it simply, swizzling means replacing the implementation of code you don’t have direct access. I should mention though swizzling isn’t a requirement for Simulator plugins. However, most of the time changing system behavior can unlock great possibilities.</p>

<p>Under the hood the concept of method swizzling based on Objective-C runtime. I’m not going to dig deep into the topic now. This can easily become a separate article. Instead, let’s get to minimal swizzling knowledge for our needs.</p>

<p>Starting with some basic terminology. Each class has a so-called dispatch-table. This table maps which selector corresponds with function/implementation. Each row in dispatch-table defines <code>Method</code>, <code>Selector</code>, and <code>IMP</code>. Let’s say we have the following example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@interface</span> <span>HelloRuntime</span><span>:</span> <span>NSObject</span> 
<span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>hello</span><span>:(</span><span>NSString</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>text</span><span>;</span>
<span>@end</span>

<span>@implementation</span> <span>HelloRuntime</span>
<span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>hello</span><span>:(</span><span>NSString</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>text</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>NSLog</span><span>(</span><span>@"Hello, %@!"</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>@end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, a simplified representation of dispatch-table would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[ Method: "hello" ] → [ Selector: @selector(hello:) ] → [ IMP: NSLog(@"Hello, %@!", text) ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As an example, let’s say we want to replace the implementation of <code>hello:</code> method to always print the same string in <code>NSLog()</code>. Here comes Objective-C Runtime. It allows us to change dispatch-table during the execution. So to replace the implementation of <code>hello:</code> we simply need to add a new dispatch-table record with Original Selector mapping to our alternate implementation, and Selector of alternate method mapping to the original implementation. This is done to prevent the breaking chain of calls. When replacing implementation you can’t easily tell whether any other methods depend on the original method being called at the right time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>alt_hello</span><span>:(</span><span>NSString</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>text</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>[</span><span>self</span> <span>alt_hello</span><span>:</span><span>@"Hello, Injection!"</span><span>]</span>

	<span>// DO NOT CALL original [hello:] here as it will lead to infinite loop</span>
	<span>// [self hello:@"Hello, Injection!"];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The basic setup is ready. Now let’s change the dispatch-table records with Objective-C runtime. 
First and foremost, all swizzling operations better execute as soon as class loads itself into memory. This way we can avoid having instances with different dispatch-tables. There is a convenient static method <code>load</code> for it. Additionally, to ensure we modify dispatch-table only once we’ll be using <code>dispatch_once</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>load</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>static</span> <span>dispatch_once_t</span> <span>onceToken</span><span>;</span>
	<span>dispatch_once</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>onceToken</span><span>,</span> <span>^</span><span>{</span>
		<span>...</span>
	<span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, we’d need to get the Class of interest. So runtime would know which dispatch-table we try to modify.<br>
Then get Selectors for original and alternative methods. Having those in place we can easily switch implementations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>load</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>static</span> <span>dispatch_once_t</span> <span>onceToken</span><span>;</span>
	<span>dispatch_once</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>onceToken</span><span>,</span> <span>^</span><span>{</span>    
		<span>Class</span> <span>class</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>self</span> <span>class</span><span>];</span>

		<span>SEL</span> <span>originalSelector</span> <span>=</span> <span>@selector</span><span>(</span><span>hello</span><span>:</span><span>);</span>
		<span>SEL</span> <span>swizzledSelector</span> <span>=</span> <span>@selector</span><span>(</span><span>alt_hello</span><span>:</span><span>);</span>

		<span>Method</span> <span>originalMethod</span> <span>=</span> <span>class_getInstanceMethod</span><span>(</span><span>class</span><span>,</span> <span>originalSelector</span><span>);</span>
		<span>Method</span> <span>swizzledMethod</span> <span>=</span> <span>class_getInstanceMethod</span><span>(</span><span>class</span><span>,</span> <span>swizzledSelector</span><span>);</span>

		<span>method_exchangeImplementations</span><span>(</span><span>originalMethod</span><span>,</span> <span>swizzledMethod</span><span>);</span>
	<span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So here we have it. Whenever the system calls <code>hello:</code>, an alternative implementation of <code>alt_hello:</code> runs. And whenever <code>alt_hello:</code> gets called – original implementation of <code>hello:</code> is executed.</p>

<h3 id="building-dynamic-ios-libraries">Building dynamic iOS libraries</h3>
<p>iOS Simulator plugins are technically just dynamic libraries. Those libraries are being injected into a specific process before it starts. The basic property of dynamic libraries is that they can be loaded on demand. Unlike the static libraries that have to be loaded during the application start only.</p>

<p>Another core difference, the static library has to be present inside the executable. Obviously, the actual executable becomes bigger &amp; slower to load. Dynamic libraries stored in executable as references. So the code from dynamic library loads from a specified location in the system.</p>

<p>Whenever the system starts application it loads code and resources into the memory. In the meantime, the system also starts a dynamic loader (<code>dyld</code> in macOS) for this new process. Then dynamic loader searches for necessary libraries per reference. It uses environment variables to know where to search for libraries. There are several variables available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> – dynamic loader tries to search for libraries specified here before looking for system libraries.</li>
  <li><code>DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH</code>– this is the second path dynamic loader considers. In case there were no libraries found in <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.</li>
  <li><code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> – libraries at this path will be loaded before those specified by the application. That means libraries at that path are temporary. Because they will be available only as a part of the current session.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last variable is the one of interest for us. It’s temporary. You don’t want to break iOS Simulator forever because of your plugin, do you?</p>

<h3 id="injecting-library-into-simulator">Injecting library into Simulator</h3>
<p>Sadly Xcode doesn’t have a template for iOS dynamic library. In this case, .framework would be overkill. 
So let’s create a new project using the macOS dynamic library template. Then simply adjust Build Settings according to screenshots below.</p>



<p>Next, let’s create a new <em>Main.m</em> file to define a starting point for our library. There are multiple ways how you can do this for the plugin. The first way is to define the construction method which will be called automatically, the second is to leverage <code>load</code> method. 
In this case, let’s stick to the construction method approach. The GCC and Clang support constructor and destructor attribute defined as <code>__attribute__((constructor)…</code></p></div></div>

<p>Hello dear readers,</p>
<p>Today’s article is about some experiments I’ve been doing with Tekton CI/CD + Prometheus.</p>
<p>Continuous Integration and Deployment is becoming more and more a hot topic - everyone wants a 100% automated, flawless, fast, code integration, and deployments. </p>
<p><strong>But how can a team or a company achieve that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usually</strong> is a step-by-step process and not a ready-to-install solution (if there’s one though, please tell me !! ;) ).</p>
<p>For that reason, metrics will help you to keep track of your CI/CD improvements and to understand what needs to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Luckily, if you are using <strong>Tekton</strong>, there are some very useful metrics by default.</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldn’t find enough documentation on the metrics exposed by Tekton. However, after a few experiments, I came up with a list of what (in my opinion) are the most valuable metrics.</p>
<p>The demo I’ve prepared uses Prometheus as a backend to collect and display metrics, but note that others backends (such as StackDriver/Cloud Monitoring) are supported too. </p>
<h3>Tekton CI/CD: Useful Indicators</h3>

<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tekton_taskrun_count{status="failed"} * 100 / ignoring(status) tekton_taskrun_count{status="success"} &gt; 15</code></pre></div>
<h4>Monitor the Tekton Controller</h4>
<p>The 2 metrics below are more likely to expose issues related to K8s rather than Tekton:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tekton_workqueue_adds_total -&gt; 
It’s the number of required actions per unit time. 
A high value could indicate problems in the cluster of some of the nodes.

------

tekton_workqueue_depth -&gt; 
It’s the number of actions waiting in the queue to be performed. 
It should remain in low values.</code></pre></div>
<p>These are very basic examples, and there’s other cool stuff that you can do with these indicators. You could, for example, monitor how many pods/resources have been allocated into a project, how much time users are wasting in retries, how many seconds are wasted on latency, pods latency, Workqueues and so on!</p>
<p>Measuring pipelines is, in my opinion, something that every company who wants to move towards a data-driven mindset should do.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;How to setup Tekton to use Prometheus</h3>
<p>As stated before, Tekton comes with Prometheus as default backend. The user just needs to ensure that metrics are enabled on the Tekton configuration.</p>
<p>Inside the namespace where the Tekton Pipeline Controller is installed, there is a configmap called “observability” or “tekton…-observability”. Inside that configmap, there’s the configuration that will then be used by Knative/Tekton Controller to expose metrics.</p>
<p>The observability configuration is explained here:
<a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/edc453934a183d44fde739dc24d6ca6b25cdeb6b/config/config-observability.yaml">https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/edc453934a183d44fde739dc24d6ca6b25cdeb6b/config/config-observability.yaml</a></p>
<p>Once Tekton is configured, the only bit missing is the related Service Monitor to allow the Prometheus Operator to scrape the exposed metrics!</p>
<p>The service monitor configuration should look like:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  annotations:
    meta.helm.sh/release-name: prometheus-operator-1595779515-custom-sm

  labels:

    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm

    release: prometheus-operator-1595779515
  name: prometheus-operator-159577-tekton-pipeline-controller
  namespace: tekton-demo

      app.kubernetes.io/instance: tekton-pipeline-1593528871
      app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    path: /metrics
    interval: 15s</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s all from me, hope you enjoyed today’s article :)</p>

<p>By <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbed">Ryan Bednar</a></strong> (CEO of <a href="https://www.rankscience.com/">RankScience</a>)</p>
<p><span>Last week on July 29, 2020, the CEOs of the most powerful tech companies in the world—including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple—were called in to testify in front of the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The event was widely considered to be mostly political theater, a performance act for Congress to look like they’re hard on Big Tech. But the tech titans took it seriously, knowing the one thing that actually determines whether antitrust legislation moves forward: how each company fares in the court of public opinion. The company taking the most heat from both Democrats and Republicans was, without a doubt, Google. They’re also the company that’s most likely to be regulated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The antitrust case against Google is the most straightforward of any of the big tech companies. Google started out as an almost benevolent index of the world wide web, showing users ten blue, unbiased links for whatever users were searching for. But over the years, Google has steadily favored showing their own products above organic search results, even when their own products arguably aren’t as good. Rand Fishkin </span><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/google-in-2020-from-everyones-search-engine-to-everyones-competitor/"><span>says that</span></a><span> in 2020, Google has gone “from everyone’s search engine to everyone’s competitor.”</span></p>
<p><span>As the founder of an SEO company, </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/"><span>RankScience</span></a><span>, and as someone who’s been working in growth and digital marketing for more than a decade, I’ve had a front-row seat to watch Google devour screen real estate to feature its own products. From my point of view, Google is squeezing businesses more than ever and the game is increasingly rigged in Google’s favor. Small and local businesses have almost no chance at succeeding with SEO because they don’t have the budget or resources for it. To make things worse, so much screen real estate is now taken up by Google’s own products, small businesses have no choice but to pay Google for search traffic. Even if users are searching directly for a business’s name, Google controls the appearance and experience of interacting with that business.</span></p>
<p><span>Local restaurants, for example, are forced to use Google’s partner ChowNow in order to have convenient “Order Pickup” or “Order Delivery” buttons in search results for their own name, which charges an added hefty fee to the restaurant for each order, hurting their already thin margins. During the global pandemic, this is an incredibly predatory shakedown. No small business should be forced to use Google’s preferred ordering mechanism, and pay a tax to Google, simply to allow a customer to search for their business. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Ben Thompson of Stratechery wrote a great post summarizing the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">antitrust issues each tech behemoth has</a>, yet highlights his issues with Google’s position: “Google’s anticompetitive behavior is relatively clear…the company consistently favors its own properties in search results, particularly ‘above-the-fold’…that is, results that are not actually search results but which seek to answer the user’s query directly.” A few examples:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM.png" alt="ben thompson stratechery google antitrust regulation issues" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM.png 419w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px"></p>
<p><span>Take a look below at how Google-owned YouTube results take up the vast majority of the screen on a simple video search. Other competing video products like Vimeo or Twitch don’t get the same visual treatment or preference in search results. You can barely see the first organic search result for this query:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-929x1024.png" alt="google YouTube video search results" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-929x1024.png 929w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-272x300.png 272w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-768x847.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-600x662.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px"></p>

<p><span>The problem gets even worse when we’re talking about more lucrative search categories, like flight search or finding a hotel. On the flight search example below (which also includes a Covid-19 travel warning), Google Ads and Google’s own Flights product take up the entire screen, any organic search results pushed below the fold. When searching for “hotels near cape may, nj” the actual organic search results were almost two pages below the fold. How many users do you think scroll that far, instead of clicking on Google’s products?</span></p>

<p><span>Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other companies have been complaining about unfair treatment by Google </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/technology/yelp-google-european-union-antitrust.html"><span>for years</span></a><span>, but left unfettered, Google is only going to continue to expand their own products into more search categories over time. The list of companies with grievances against Google is growing. The landscape for businesses to compete in search is increasingly competitive, and the companies who succeed in search over the long-run are using advanced tactics like SEO A/B testing and NLP content optimization, which the average business can’t afford.</span></p>
<p><span>On a recent episode of the </span><a href="https://www.allinpodcast.co/"><span>All-In Podcast</span></a><span>, Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya, and esteemed guests engage in a rigorous and detailed debate about Big Tech antitrust and censorship (I recommend </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Ewtt593ZsFT5QXJSB97wR?si=Ej5Bx4UMRwqrU4ruSog06w"><span>giving it a listen</span></a><span> if you haven’t, as it covers the strongest arguments both for and against Big Tech regulation). Chamath says what I think most people don’t want to admit:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>The internet is now a pervasive and critical part of human infrastructure. As such, there needs to be people that regulate and manage the internet</b><span>—the same way that the FAA manages and regulates planes, and wind turbines, etc.… Let’s take aviation [for example], it’s impossible for you to go into your garage and build a plane that takes people from point A to point B. Take agriculture [for example], it’s impossible for you to build up a farm and supply it to Safeway, without any checks and balances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are very specific kinds of businesses and business models that should be overseen. The first and most important thing is a body [that] oversees the collection of user data and privacy and identification. The second one is essentially something that tears the fig leaf off of internet companies and says, you know what, you are the equivalent of a publisher and a platform, some weird hybrid that we didn’t think could exist when we wrote these rules, so we’re now going to adapt these rules. If you think about it, nobody is happy with the internet publishers today. The left thinks that it skews right, the right thinks it skews left—everybody is confused. Nobody gets what they want and somebody has to step in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You go to a movie and it tells you who can go to the movie or not. You buy an album and it tells you whether there’s explicit lyrics or not. Before you turn on the TV, there’s some rating agency that tells you whether your kid should be watching with you. My point is: what is the equivalent version here? We all need to think about what it is, but for there to be nothing is crazy.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Google search is fundamentally the gateway to the internet for the majority of people and an arbiter of truth in our digital age. Google has a </span><a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/"><span>dominant market monopoly position</span></a><span>, a treasure trove of sensitive information on hundreds of millions of users. It’s incentivized to return value to shareholders and extract more value from search over time, which is at odds with doing right by businesses and citizens. Their business model doesn’t require them to act in the long-term interest of businesses and citizens, and because they have a monopoly on a utility that’s become essential to our day-to-day lives, the only solution is for the government to enforce guidelines on fair behavior within search.</span></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> We recently raised 1,5M euros from LocalGlobe, Seedcamp, Kima &amp; Tiny.vc. This funding will allow us to focus on building a community of early adopters &amp; contributors around our open search engine <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch">MeiliSearch</a>.</p><p>We are still at the very beginning of our open source adventure and we are thrilled to see that more and more people believe in this project. This is our first fundraise and it means the world for the Meili team 🎉</p><h3 id="meili-got-funded-">Meili got funded!</h3><p>Meili SAS (the company) was created in November of 2018 with the idea of building an alternative to existing search engine APIs like Algolia. After some successes and failures as a team and company, we decided to raise some money to keep focus on building MeiliSearch and its ecosystem.</p><p>We believe that an exceptionalsearch experience on websites and applications should be the norm, not an exclusive feature. Thus we are building the most straightforward technology for developers to offer state-of-the-art search to their users, scaling from the tiniest of operations all the way up to enterprise.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.meilisearch.com/content/images/2020/08/david-armstrong-srpE-a5W418-unsplash.jpg"></figure><h2 id="how-we-got-there">How we got there</h2><p>MeiliSearch has been open source since the <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/open-source-or-not/">earliest days</a> of its development. As developers, we made our project accessible on GitHub from day one but without the idea of being an "open source company". First and foremost we set out to make a simpler alternative to Algolia for smaller businesses who needed something more developer-friendly and affordable.</p><p>After describing our project to many developers, we quickly realize that one of the main differences from Algolia was that MeiliSearch is open source. Still we weren't using open source as a force.</p><p>In late 2019, after some substantial discussion within the team, we decided to <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/to-open-source-and-beyond/">fully commit to orienting the business around open source</a>. We could not quietly bootstrap anymore since we decided to build a community around our project to get feedback and contributions from external developers. </p><p>We wrote our <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-beta-release/">Beta release blog post</a> for MeiliSearch in November of 2019. Since then we have been working hard at making MeiliSearch the new obvious choice for developers when it comes to building a search box.</p><p>Charlotte, who joined us in August of 2019, did an incredible job of directing the writing and making of our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> while Clémentine, who joined us one month later, took charge of developing the <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs and integrations</a> to ease the use of MeiliSearch.</p><h2 id="fundraise">Fundraise</h2><p>In late 2019 we began to meet with investors because we knew we wouldn't be able to develop the business without help from industry veterans.</p><div><p>The first key meeting that we had was with <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis from Kima</a> who helped us make our pitch understandable to VCs. Alexis was presented to us as <code>THE investor who understand tech</code> in Paris. Not only did he understood what we wanted to build, he also did an amazing job at introing us to relevant funds regarding our stage &amp; business 😁 </p><p> Then from meeting to meeting we met the different persons we are now working with: <a href="https://twitter.com/mishmashkautsan?lang=en">Mish</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/knightwebb/?originalSubdomain=uk">Louis</a> from <a href="https://localglobe.vc/">LocalGlobe</a> as lead investor, <a href="https://twitter.com/siahouchangnia?lang=en">Sia</a> from <a href="https://seedcamp.com/">SeedCamp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis</a> from <a href="https://www.kimaventures.com/">Kima</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/pmoe?lang=en">Philipp</a> from <a href="https://www.tiny.vc/">Tiny.vc</a>.</p></div><p>The deal we made with the VCs is that we develop the community and the usage around MeiliSearch while we better understand the use-cases of our search engine. From there we will be able to generate revenue. <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-open-business-plan-v0-1/">Our business plan is publicly available</a> as a iteratively developed document.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><h3 id="core-features">Core features</h3><p>We made an <a href="https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/projects/2">open roadmap on GitHub</a>, and we will publish more roadmap communications in the coming weeks to get better feedback on what developers need in a search engine API.</p><p>There are some features that we know we need to build in order to be competitive as a search engine backend (basic analytics and authorization system 🚧) that are already planned. We are also discussing with developers &amp; companies to gain more insight on features that should be game-changers in the enterprise search industry!</p><h3 id="integrations-documentation">Integrations &amp; Documentation</h3><p>All of this work around MeiliSearch would not make any sense if MeiliSearch is not used. To ease the integration of MeiliSearch we are building different <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs</a> in different languages and improving our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> every week. </p><p>We want anyone to be able to integrate MeiliSearch in any common programming environment in less than 5 minutes. Today, with our most mature front- and back-end libraries you should be able to setup a proof-of-concept in less than an hour. We are hard at work shaving off those remaining 55 minutes to get where we want to be.</p><h3 id="open-source-values">Open source &amp; values</h3><p>As we learn to build a commercial open source software company, we are thriving for transparency on everything we do. To raise awareness around open source sustainability, Erlend is publishing a podcast called <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/value-in-open-1-posthog/">Value in Open</a>. We already have our first episode released, and the second one should follow shortly 😁</p><figure><img src="https://blog.meilisearch.com/content/images/2020/08/kelly-sikkema-XX2WTbLr3r8-unsplash-1.jpg"></figure><p><br>We are delighted and excited about the future of MeiliSearch 😁 if you want to reach us for anything, <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/resources/contact.html">please feel free to do so</a>!</p>

<p>Dramatic title, I know, but lately I've had a few people ask me what extensions I use, and through sharing my list I've learnt of even better ones, so what better way to amplify these positive effects than to leverage the internet? 😛</p><p>Without further ado, let's jump into it.</p><h3 id="privacy-badger-ublock-origin"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp">Privacy Badger</a> + <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">UBlock Origin</a></h3><p>Let's block all the ads! Sites look cleaner, load waayy faster, and pry less. These are the first extensions I install on <em>any</em> browser. </p><h3 id="nano-defender"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en">Nano Defender</a></h3><p>Let's block all the anti-adblockers! Many sites these days will try to get you to turn off your adblocker, but once you set up <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en">Nano Defender</a>, you'll no longer have to deal with that. Note: To use alongside Ublock Origin, I had to go through a <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin">few extra steps</a> first.</p><h3 id="hover-unpaywall-bypass-paywalls"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok/related">Hover</a> + <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en">Unpaywall</a>/ ByPass Paywalls</h3><p>Let's block all the login/paywalls! Are you starting to see a pattern here? 😛 The web can be full of thrash sometimes. With <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok">Hover</a> &amp; <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en">Unpaywall</a>, I can say goodbye to Medium and journal paywalls. If you're a fan of open source and have an extra minute to spend, check out this <a href="https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome">extension</a> instead.</p><h3 id="shut-up"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shut-up-comment-blocker/oklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfim?hl=en">Shut Up</a></h3><p>Sometimes when I'm consuming content, I'll be tempted to see what others are saying about it. That's... not always good. Let these xkcd comics illustrate my point:</p><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/youtube.png" alt="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/youtube.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/listen_to_yourself.png" alt="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/listen_to_yourself.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.maskys.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png"></figure><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shut-up-comment-blocker/oklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfim?hl=en">Shut Up</a> disables comments everywhere. When I trust a platform's audience enough to read the unfiltered outputs from their brains, I enable comments for just that site. Sometimes I turn it back off immediately 💀</p><h3 id="reader-mode"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/llimhhconnjiflfimocjggfjdlmlhblm?hl=en">Reader Mode</a></h3><p>Occasionally, even after all these purges, the content on a site will still be ridiculously hard to read- sometimes because they used a funky font and set the size to 8px, or sometimes because there are a million other article suggestions, plus three sidebars, plus an obnoxious navigation header that never goes away.

<p>UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are often confused. I’ve heard the phrase “I can’t use this, it looks like garbage.” many times and it’s always bothered me. I recently had the opposite experience when I bought a brand spanking new Sonos Playbar. People loved this sound bar for its audio quality, but also claimed it was extremely difficult to set up. I consider myself to be a tech savvy person, and thought there would be no way I’d have difficult setting this thing up. Oh boy… I was completely wrong.</p>



<p>When I first purchased it I was extremely excited to set it up. The unboxing was great and the app was beautiful. I thought to myself, “Maybe the reviews I read were old and no longer valid. Maybe Sonos figured their stuff out and fixed all of the setup issues.” With how nice the app looked, so simplistic and modern, I thought that surely they wouldn’t have put this much effort into the UI and left the setup experience on the back burner. Well, that’s exactly what they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problems started the moment I tried to connect my phone to the Playbar. This sound bar has WiFi, yet it couldn’t connect to my WiFi (I tried multiple times, rebooted, etc). I had to physically connect it to my router only to get a few steps further and then not work again. I tried the steps over and over again with no success. It was such a frustrating experience. I factory reset the dang thing several times and started from scratch each time. At my <strong>wit’s</strong> end, I was ready to call my dad who was also excited about me getting it and tell him that I’m going to return it because it just doesn’t work. I decided to try one more time and voila! Finally it worked!</p>



<p>This was my first impression of owning a Sonos Playbar. It was a horror story that left a sour taste in my mouth. Now that I have it set up and it’s working and sounds amazing (and I mean really amazing) that sour taste is fading away, but there were moments that I was considering returning it.</p>



<p>This is a problem with a lot of software. A good UI does <strong>NOT</strong> fix a bad UX. There are many apps that are considered beautiful but extremely difficult to use. There is a trend towards software developers becoming more full stack and end to end. Software developers design UIs, UX, code the front end, back end, work on maintaining the app, etc. I love this for the breadth of knowledge it teaches us and the experience it gives us for when we want to create our own apps. But at the same time, it has many new software developers focusing a lot on beauty and leaving UX to suffer. With all of the latest design trends and beautiful looking apps, of course new developers want their apps to be beautiful.</p>



<p>Look at websites like Facebook and Reddit. Until recently they had very outdated UIs but people still used them because of the value they offered and how easy they were to use. People’s grandmas and grandpas use Facebook because the user experience is frictionless enough for them. Luckily, these days there are a variety of front end UI frameworks that handle almost all the UI work for you allowing you to focus on the UX. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank">Material-UI</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://get.foundation/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> are just a few of the amazing frameworks out there.</p>



<p>Basically, what I’m trying to say is that more emphasis needs to be put on user experience than the UI (ideally you put a lot of emphasis on both). I feel a great app can be ruined or even killed behind a bad UX. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:dominik@nerdstack.io">dominik@nerdstack.io</a> if you have a different opinion, any questions, or just want to chat.</p>

    <p>I guard my favorite sketches until I can work on a good story. Yet I acknowledge I won't ever find the time to write stories for all of them. Stories serve to describe how I experienced a given location, person, or object, or to elaborate a concept that lightly relates to a featured drawing.</p>
<p>Always timestamped, illustrations evoke memories of sketched <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/time-place-and-people">artifacts, places, and people</a>. However, when removed from their surrounding context, drawings act as timeless, platonic abstractions.</p>
<p><a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/the-windy-road-to-korakonisi">The windy road to Korakonisi</a> brings me back to a one-off drive around Zakynthos with Aziz and Mikela. <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/coronavirus">We are out of face masks</a> teleports me to a conversation with Sanjay from Paris to Toronto in times when few people wore face masks around. But floating sketches of my Hatefjäll IKEA office chair make me think of the <em>idea</em> of this chair and not about a particular moment in time in which I was using it. What color is this chair? Is it comfortable? Is it adjustable?</p>
<p>Whereas a contextualized sketch is imbued with memories of the time and place in which it was sketched, a sketch of an item without context sparks thoughts of the item itself, not about the moment in which you sketched it (except when the item itself is representative of a salient event or moment in time).</p>
<p>A similar effect can be achieved documenting memorable events and abstract ideas with other mediums.</p>
<p>I'm repeatedly surprised by the power of drawings, texts, videos, photos, audio notes, and smells for memory reactivation.</p>

<p>Fred is on your team. He takes 5 times longer to build a feature than anyone else. When asked what’s the hold up, Fred responds that he’s tweaking a class definition or adding some out of scope automation instead of just building the dang thing that the ticket says to build. Fred drives the team nuts, and he often gets called a gold plater, or unproductive, or slow. </p>



<p>But in my experience, Fred isn’t slow at all. He’s just as productive as everyone else, but he’s solving different problems than the ones he was asked to solve.</p>



<p><strong>Fred is more interested in providing value to other developers than to users.</strong> </p>



<p>Your team probably pushes back on that. Fred’s feedback (if he gets any at all, which is a topic for another post) is that he needs to work on his velocity and get through his tickets faster. In other words, you’re telling him to stop doing the thing that he loves. He can’t just change his interest, so the best case scenario is that he’ll push hard for a few months on the boring stuff until he burns out and quits, or falls back into his old habits.</p>



<p>Maybe Fred doesn’t need to change. Maybe he’s just <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/331248">in the wrong seat</a>. What if the team leaned into what gets Fred excited? If he doesn’t care about providing value to users, but loves providing value to his fellow developers, then could that be his full time job? His responsibilities could include:</p>



<ul><li>Automating anything that can possibly be automated</li><li>Making local environments run faster and smoother</li><li>Refactoring and managing tech debt</li><li>Quick and thorough code review</li><li>Streamlining the deploy process</li><li>Writing missing automated tests</li></ul>



<p>Doesn’t it seem powerful, to have a person on your team completely dedicated to helping other developers be as productive as they can be? Imagine reaching out to Fred the second you had code ready for review, or when a build fails and you aren’t sure why, or when your can’t figure out why your debugger stopped debugging, or when you notice that some function over here basically does the same thing as some other function over there. </p>



<p>He loves that stuff, and he’s probably really good at it, because as they say, “being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points”. So maybe try letting him do it?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/53bde489c28f22db0ca85d16d348e36b6af44214/7bc7c/images/everyday-design.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>There’s a secret code embedded in every app, website, and interface you use. Underneath your fingers is a hidden world traveled by the interface designers, caught up in a war between the complexities of technology and the breakneck evolution of user needs. These designers speak cryptically in neologisms (squircle, sharrow, neumorphism) and food-themed shibboleths (hamburger menu or meatball menu? Candy bar or toast?).</p>
<p>Their code is made of things called affordances. Those fluent in the language of affordances possess an intuitive and powerful understanding of how design works.</p>
<p>So let’s take a trip into the depths of interface design and shine a light on affordances. We’ll study them, explore how they work, and see how they define our digital tools. Bringing affordances out of the shadows can lead to clearer conversations about design, no matter if you’re a veteran designer or a casual user.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-affordances">The history of affordances</h2>
<p>In 1988, Don Norman published a book called <em>The Design of Everyday Things.</em> At the time, Norman was transitioning from a career in cognitive science and psychology to one in technology&nbsp;— he was one of the first people to write about “human-centered design,” an approach to technology that focuses on human biology and psychology to create functional software and hardware. <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> was the genesis of many of these ideas, including one he called “affordances.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Norman’s explorations of usability design, human-centered-design, and universal design all serve as the foundation of modern digital product design. But it’s the concept of affordances that has taken on a life all its own. Designers have taken the original definition and transformed it slightly: today, designers use “affordances” to mean “properties of objects which show users the actions they can take.”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Here’s an example of an affordance in the real world:</p>
<p>A handle on a door is an affordance: it indicates that the door should be pulled. A flat, rectangular plate on a door is an affordance indicating that it should be pushed.</p>
<p>Norman would say that a handle or a plate is a <em>good affordance</em>, because of its relationship to the person who is using the door. A plate on a door begs to be pushed. Without edges or round parts to grab, the natural way&nbsp;— the only way&nbsp;— of interacting with it is to push. A good door handle, on the other hand, is located right where your arm naturally falls when reaching for the door. The radius of the handle is the right size to give you a good grip. It’s located on the side of the door opposite the hinge, so the door isn’t too hard to open.</p>
<p>Some doors don’t have good affordances. To make up for the confusion, there’s a “PUSH” or “PULL” sign. The sign doesn’t take advantage of the way our bodies instinctively interact with the door; it’s only helpful to people with good vision, who happen to be paying attention, or aren’t in too much of a hurry.</p>
<p>So, a good affordance takes advantage of some natural interaction between a thing and its user. Something that’s supposed to be used with your hands ought to be hand-shaped (and ambidextrous!). If something has visual feedback mechanisms, those mechanisms should be at eye level. Things arranged in physical space&nbsp;— like a row of lights, or a set of stovetop burners&nbsp;— should have their controls arranged in a corresponding way.</p>
<p>But we don’t always have a physical relationship to the tools we use.</p>
<p>Our phones, laptops, tablets, watches, and earbuds have so many functions that many interactions are digital by default. What does a good affordance look like in the digital world? If good affordances are ones that suit the nature of the interaction, what happens when the interactions are finger (or mouse pointer) on a flat, glass surface?</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-of-affordances">The evolution of affordances</h2>
<p>Designers of early computers had to figure out what good digital affordances looked like. Most built clues into interfaces based on familiar physical objects: things stored in your computer’s memory are called files, and files are grouped into folders. How do you use a real-world folder? You open it. So, we can easily find the right command for accessing our digital folders because it’s labeled “open.” These affordances have been around for more than 70 years.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Some designers had to reckon with entirely new functions, ones that didn’t have any real-world equivalent. For instance, how do you represent a hyperlink&nbsp;— a piece of text that fluidly joins two documents together? Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, had to figure it out. He chose a blue underline. But there’s no reason why blue means “link”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the first WWW client&nbsp;… used just underline to represent [a] link, as it was a spare emphasis form which isn’t used much in real documents. Blue came in as browsers went color&nbsp;— I don’t remember which was the first to use blue.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the early days of the web, hundreds of affordances were coined this way. The URL for a page goes at the top. Text appears in a vertically scrolling column. A dropdown menu has a downward-pointing triangle next to it. Your mouse cursor is a slanted triangle with a tail, and when you hover over a link it looks like Mickey Mouse’s glove.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of these affordances don’t have any relationship to the physical characteristics of the interaction they mediate. But remove them from a website, application, or interface, and users get disoriented, frustrated, and unproductive.</p>
<p>This is a second way of thinking about good affordances: instead of being useful because they are natural, some affordances are useful because they’re norms. Designers employ commonly recognized icons, patterns, labels, and layouts to make it easy for new users to find and utilize functionality. As Jakob Nielsen puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. Design for patterns for which users are accustomed.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This circular definition underscores how important it is for digital interface designers to understand affordances. In fact, how a designer sees, uses, understands, and breaks the rules of affordances is a telling sign of their experience and abilities.</p>
<h2 id="how-designers-use-affordances">How designers use affordances</h2>
<p>Early in a designer’s career, they’ll <strong>use affordances</strong> even without knowing. That’s how I got started in design: I copied other designer’s work as a starting point, instead of starting from scratch. I had no idea why certain elements worked the way they did&nbsp;— but by emulating more experienced designers, I could take a shortcut past my lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>But design enough of the same kind of thing&nbsp;— t-shirts, band posters, MySpace pages&nbsp;— and you’ll start to recognize common elements. <strong>Recognizing affordances</strong> might not come with a detailed understanding of the <em>why</em>, but at least many inexperienced designers can identify the <em>what</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding affordances</strong> comes from a place of curiosity. This means questioning affordances&nbsp;— why are links blue? Why is most text left-aligned? Why are user avatars usually cropped into circles? Sometimes the answers to these questions are rooted in psychology, biology, anthropology, or technology.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>But affordances sometimes exist for no obvious reason. As I use the same affordances over and over, I think, “is this really the right way to do things?” As the internet enters its fourth or fifth decade,<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> many designers are <strong>abandoning affordances</strong> once taken for granted. Google, for example, is in the middle of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-kill-url-first-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a battle to kill the URL</a>, one of the few remaining affordances that distinguish a web page from an app.</p>
<p>Finally, as old affordances are being left behind, designers are <strong>inventing new affordances</strong> to take their place. Small touchscreens have become the dominant mode of interaction with digital interfaces,<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup> and designers created new ways of indicating functionality. The “hamburger” menu is one example: three horizontal lines indicates where to tap to expand a menu, something only required on small screens where some elements have to be hidden.</p>
<figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/722ac6cacbdd4e5bfdc4f43a6db10fb634bb846b/9cfa1/images/everyday-design-1.jpg" alt="A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu"><figcaption>A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="affordances-everywhere">Affordances everywhere</h2>
<p>Understanding the correct application of affordances is one of the most fundamental jobs of designers of functional things. This won’t change anytime soon: as long as we’re interacting with the world around us, designers will need to maintain a mental library of affordances.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Affordances are the hidden language of interface design. Using affordances wrong can stunt a company’s growth, as Snapchat famously discovered.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup> Using them right has returns in <a href="https://articles.uie.com/three_hund_million_button/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millions</a>, <a href="https://articles.uie.com/beyond_ux_tipping_point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions</a>, and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/intranet-usability-the-trillion-dollar-question/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trillions</a> of dollars.</p>
<p>For that reason, affordances are, and will always be, the things of everyday design.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WebAssembly (wasm) allows code written in languages other than JavaScript to run on browsers. If you haven’t been paying attention, all the major browsers support wasm and <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">globally more than 90% of users</a> have browsers that can run wasm.</p>
<p>Since Rust compiles to wasm, is it possible to build SPAs (Single Page Applications) purely in Rust and without writing a single line of JavaScript? The short answer is YES! Read on to learn more or visit the <a href="https://rustmart-yew.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo site</a> if you can’t contain your excitement!</p>
<p>We’ll be building a simple ecommerce site called “RustMart” that will have 2 pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>HomePage - list all the products that the customer can add to cart</li>
<li>ProductDetailPage - show the product details when a product card is clicked</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m using this example as it tests the minimal set of capabilities required to build modern SPAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate between multiple pages without page reload</li>
<li>Make network requests without page reload</li>
<li>Ability to reuse UI components across multiple pages</li>
<li>Update components in different layers of the UI hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setup"><a href="#Setup" title="Setup"></a>Setup</h2><p>Follow this <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> to install Rust if you haven’t done so already.</p>
<p>Install these Rust tools:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo install wasm-pack          # Compile Rust to Wasm and generate JS interop code
$ cargo install cargo-make         # Task runner
$ cargo install simple-http-server # Simple server to serve assets</code></pre>
<p>Create a new project:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new --lib rustmart &amp;&amp; cd rustmart</code></pre>
<p>We’ll be using the <a href="https://yew.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Yew</code></a> library to build UI components. Let’s add this and wasm dependencies to <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
yew = "0.17"
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"</code></pre>
<p>Create a new file named <code>Makefile.toml</code> and add this:</p>
<pre><code>[tasks.build]
command = "wasm-pack"
args = ["build", "--dev", "--target", "web", "--out-name", "wasm", "--out-dir", "./static"]
watch = { ignore_pattern = "static/*" }

[tasks.serve]
command = "simple-http-server"
args = ["-i", "./static/", "-p", "3000", "--nocache", "--try-file", "./static/index.html"]</code></pre>
<p>Start the build task:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo make build</code></pre>
<p>If you’re new to Rust, I’ve written some <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/tags/Rust-Beginners/">guides for beginners</a> which will help you follow this post better.</p>
<h2 id="Hello-World"><a href="#Hello-World" title="Hello World"></a>Hello World</h2><p>Let’s start with a simple “hello world” example:</p>

<p>Lot of things going on but you can see that we’re creating a new component named “Hello” that renders <code>&lt;span&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;</code> into the DOM. We’ll learn more about Yew components later.</p>
<p>Start the serve task in a new terminal and load <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your browser</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo make serve</code></pre>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/image-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It works!! It’s only “hello world” but this is fully written in Rust.</p>
<p>Let’s learn about components and other SPA concepts before proceeding further.</p>
<h2 id="Thinking-in-Components"><a href="#Thinking-in-Components" title="Thinking in Components"></a>Thinking in Components</h2><p>Building UIs by composing components and passing data in a unidirectional way is a paradigm shift in the frontend world. It’s a huge improvement in the way we reason about UI and it’s very hard to go back to imperative DOM manipulation once you get used to this.</p>
<p>A <code>Component</code> in libraries like React, Vue, Yew, Flutter etc have these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to be composed into bigger components</li>
<li><code>Props</code> - Pass data and callbacks from that component to its child components.</li>
<li><code>State</code> - Manipulate state local to that component.</li>
<li><code>AppState</code> - Manipulate global state.</li>
<li>Listen to lifecycle events like “Instantiated”, “Mounted in DOM” etc</li>
<li>Perform side effects like fetching remote data, manipulating localstorage etc</li>
</ul>
<p>A component gets updated (re-rendered) when one of the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parent component is re-rendered</li>
<li><code>Props</code> changes</li>
<li><code>State</code> changes</li>
<li><code>AppState</code> changes</li>
</ul>
<p>So, instead of imperatively updating the UI when user interaction, network requests etc happen, we update the data (Props, State, AppState) and the UI is updated based on this data. This what someone means when they say “UI is a function of state”.</p>
<p>The exact details differ across different libraries but this should give you a general idea. If you’re new to this, this way of thinking might take sometime to “click” and get used to.</p>
<h2 id="HomePage"><a href="#HomePage" title="HomePage"></a>HomePage</h2><p>Let’s build the HomePage first. We’ll be building the HomePage as a monolithic component and later decompose it into smaller reusable components.</p>
<p>Let’s create the following files:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>use</span> yew<span>:</span><span>:</span>prelude<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> Home <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> Component <span>for</span> Home <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> Message <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        Self <span>{</span><span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> _<span>:</span> Self<span>:</span><span>:</span>Message<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> ShouldRender <span>{</span>
        <span>true</span>

        <span>html!</span> <span>{</span> <span>&lt;</span>span<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>"Home Sweet Home!"</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>span<span>&gt;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>mod</span> home<span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> home<span>:</span><span>:</span>Home<span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s update the <code>src/lib.rs</code> to import the HomePage component:</p>
<pre><code>  // src/lib.rs
<span>+ mod pages;</span>

<span>+ use pages::Home;</span>
  use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>- struct Hello {}</span>

<span>- impl Component for Hello {</span>
<span>-     type Message = ();</span>
<span>-     type Properties = ();</span>

<span>-     fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {</span>
<span>-         Self {}</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn update(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Message) -&gt; ShouldRender {</span>
<span>-         true</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn change(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Properties) -&gt; ShouldRender {</span>
<span>-         true</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html {</span>
<span>-         html! { &lt;span&gt;{"Hello World!"}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
<span>-     }</span>
<span>- }</span>

  #[wasm_bindgen(start)]
  pub fn run_app() {
<span>-   App::&lt;Hello&gt;::new().mount_to_body();</span>
<span>+   App::&lt;Home&gt;::new().mount_to_body();</span>
  }</code></pre>
<p>Now, you should see “Home Sweet Home!” instead of “Hello World!” rendered in your browser.</p>
<p>Let’s start designing the <code>State</code> of this component:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to store a list of products retrieved from server</li>
<li>Store the products the user has added to cart</li>
</ul>
<p>We create a simple struct to hold the <code>Product</code> details:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Product <span>{</span>
    name<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    description<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    image<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    price<span>:</span> f64<span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We then create a new struct <code>State</code> with field called <code>products</code> to hold the products from server:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> State <span>{</span>
    products<span>:</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>Product<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s the full list of changes in the HomePage component:</p>
<pre><code>  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>+ struct Product {</span>
<span>+     id: i32,</span>
<span>+     name: String,</span>
<span>+     description: String,</span>
<span>+     image: String,</span>
<span>+     price: f64,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

<span>+ struct State {</span>
<span>+     products: Vec&lt;Product&gt;,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

<span>- pub struct Home {}</span>
<span>+ pub struct Home {</span>
<span>+     state: State,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

  impl Component for Home {
      type Message = ();
      type Properties = ();

      fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {
<span>+       let products: Vec&lt;Product&gt; = vec![</span>
<span>+           Product {</span>
<span>+               id: 1,</span>
<span>+               name: "Apple".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               description: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               image: "/products/apple.png".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               price: 3.65,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+           Product {</span>
<span>+               id: 2,</span>
<span>+               name: "Banana".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               description: "An old banana leaf was once young and green".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               image: "/products/banana.png".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               price: 7.99,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+       ];</span>

<span>-       Self {}</span>
<span>+       Self {</span>
<span>+           state: State {</span>
<span>+               products,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+       }</span>
      }

      fn update(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Message) -&gt; ShouldRender {
          true
      }

      fn change(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Properties) -&gt; ShouldRender {
          true
      }

      fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html {
<span>+        let products: Vec&lt;Html&gt; = self</span>
<span>+            .state</span>
<span>+            .products</span>
<span>+            .iter()</span>
<span>+            .map(|product: &amp;Product| {</span>
<span>+                html! {</span>
<span>+                  &lt;div&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;img src={&amp;product.image}/&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;div&gt;{&amp;product.name}&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;div&gt;{"$"}{&amp;product.price}&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                }</span>
<span>+            })</span>
<span>+            .collect();</span>
<span>+</span>
<span>+        html! { &lt;span&gt;{products}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
<span>-        html! { &lt;span&gt;{"Home!"}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
      }
  }</code></pre>
<p>The <code>create</code> lifecycle method is invoked when the component is created and this is where we set the initial state. For the time being, we’ve created a mock list of products and assigned it to the <code>products</code> inside the state as initial value. Later, we’ll fetch this list using network request.</p>
<p>The <code>view</code> lifecycle method is invoked when the component is rendered. Here we’ve iterated over <code>products</code> inside state to generate product cards. If you’re familiar with React, this is same as the <code>render</code> method and the <code>html!</code> macro is similar to <code>JSX</code>.</p>
<p>Save some random images as <code>static/products/apple.png</code> and <code>static/products/banana.png</code> and you’ll get this UI:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/image-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s implement the “add to cart” functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>We keep track of all products added to cart in a new state field called <code>cart_products</code></li>
<li>We render a “add to cart” button for each product</li>
<li>Add logic to update the <code>cart_products</code> state when “add to cart” button is clicked</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>+ #[derive(Clone)]</span>
  struct Product {
      id: i32,
      name: String,
      description: String,
      image: String,
      price: f64,
  }

<span>+ struct CartProduct {</span>
<span>+     product: Product,</span>
<span>+     quantity: i32,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

  struct State {
      products: Vec&lt;Product&gt;,
<span>+     cart_products: Vec&lt;CartProduct&gt;,</span>
  }

  pub struct Home {
      …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>B J Fogg is a Stanford professor who came up with a simple model of behavior that helps us understand why we take action or not take action at any given moment.</p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model"><p>According to FBM, there are three things we need to do something:</p><ul><li>Motivation</li><li>Ability</li><li>Trigger</li></ul><p>The key is that we need to have all three at the same time in order to act.</p><p>Since our problem is procrastination, we'll focus on how we fail at each one of these.</p><h2>Motivation X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_motivation.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no motivation"><p>Sometimes we have the ability to do something, and even have a trigger like a time window and a to-do item, but we don't feel motivated.</p><p>We stare at a list of tasks, and stare, and stare, and none of them seem particularly exciting.</p><p>So we do something else - procrastinate.</p><p>The thing is,&nbsp;<strong>motivation doesn't come out of the blue.</strong></p><p>We often have a fantasy in our heads of ourselves, sitting down to work, feeling inspired and tearing into work with a smile on our faces.</p><p>That's often not how it goes.</p><p>On the days when we don't feel motivated,&nbsp;<strong>we need to build motivation.</strong></p><h3>How to build motivation</h3><p>We feel motivated when we viscerally feel how an action is&nbsp;<strong>meaningful, or valuable</strong>&nbsp;to us and when we&nbsp;<strong>believe we can</strong>&nbsp;take it (we'll get to this in the next part).</p><p>Therefore, we don't feel motivated when we don't see the meaning or value hiding behind a to-do item.</p><p>What to do about it then?</p><p><strong>Remind yourself of the why.</strong></p><p>There probably was a reason why you wrote down a task or got one assigned to you.</p><p>Was it to help you learn something?        Was it to make you money?        Was it to help someone?</p><p>Take a task you're putting off, and try to remember in vivid detail why you thought you needed to do it.</p><p>The important part is not only to know the reason, but to feel it, to get excited about it. How to do that? Link the task to a personal goal that you want to achieve. Attach exciting reasons to the task.</p><p><em>Write a thesis</em>&nbsp;  - not motivating.</p><p>Write a thesis to successfully complete a degree and do cutting-edge research.<br>Write a thesis to deepen your understanding of a subject and get recognized by others in your field.<br>Write a thesis to help others see things more clearly and make progress.</p><p><strong>Add personal, meaningful reasons to the tasks that you put off. Make yourself remember why you took them on.</strong></p><h2>Ability X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_ability.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no ability"><p>Sometimes we feel motivated, but every task on our plate seems just too darn hard, like standing at the foot of 5 different mountains in the Himalayas and having to decide which one to climb.</p><p>When everything seems hard, it's easy to succumb to procrastination and check email, or social media, or play games. All those actions are much easier than&nbsp;<em>work.</em></p><p>But when&nbsp;<strong>we're finally done with our procrastination, we'll often find that our work hasn't gotten any easier while we procrastinated.</strong>&nbsp;In fact, it seems even harder.</p><p>That's clearly not a good cycle.</p><p>Instead of avoiding anything hard, let's&nbsp;<strong>turn down the difficulty dial by focusing on small steps.</strong></p><p>You probably can't climb the whole mountain at once, but you can ascend a few hundred feet.        You probably can't write a whole thesis at once, but you can write 5 paragraphs.        You probably can't build a business at once, but you can write a blog post, or design a prototype, or contact 10 prospects.</p><p>In short, you need to&nbsp;<strong>break it down</strong>&nbsp;into pieces you are able to complete.</p><h3>How to break work down</h3><p>With mental work, it's often not obvious what all the things we need to do are.</p><p>We need to identify them, to list them.</p><p>If you need to create a presentation, you'll need to research the topic, find images, create the slides, and rehearse. Those are 4 distinct types of activity, 4 smaller pieces that you can take on, one by one.</p><p>When you break down work into parts, it becomes clearer what you feel you can or cannot do.</p><p><strong>Identify the distinct parts that form the whole.</strong></p><p>But even when you identify the parts, they can still intimidate you and seem too hard in their own right. What to do then?</p><p><strong>Create a simple timeline.</strong></p><p>We aren't naturally good at planning work through time. We don't look at a task like "Create a sales report" and see a detailed calendar in our heads with all the tasks neatly organized.</p><p>But we can learn to do that. How?</p><p>We just need a simple timeline.</p><p>It doesn't have to be complicated.</p><ol><li>Start with the due date.</li><li>Go back day by day (or week by week) and write down what you'd like to have done by then, until you arrive at today.</li><li>Put this timeline where you'll see it (remember: out of sight, out of mind).</li><li>Start working on the first piece of the puzzle.</li></ol><p>You might have a 20 slide presentation you'll be delivering 10 days from now.</p><p><em>Day 10</em>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Rehearse 3x and deliver presentation</li></ul><p><em>Day 9</em></p><ul><li>Add finishing touches</li><li>List sources</li></ul><p>...</p><p><em>Day 5</em></p><ul><li>Create first 10 slides</li></ul><p><em>Day 3</em></p><ul><li>Write out the main points</li></ul><p><em>Day 2</em></p><ul><li>Read through the materials</li></ul><p><em>Day 1</em></p><ul><li>Make a list of at least 10 articles and other resources to use</li></ul><p>Even a simple, bulleted timeline like this can make a large project more manageable and ensure that you have the time to learn what you need to do to be able to accomplish your mission.</p><h2>Trigger X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_trigger.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no trigger"><p>And sometimes, we feel motivated and able, but we don't know where to start - we're missing a trigger.</p><p>Professional athletes have a coach. Coach is the person who says what to do, and when. Their job is about motivating, cultivating ability, and giving triggers.</p><p>Now do this, now that, now this here, now rest. There's a tight, minute-by-minute plan.</p><p>As a result, the athletes know exactly what to focus on at any given moment.</p><p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<strong>modern work often doesn't have a built-in trigger.</strong></p><p>A professor doesn't tell you when to research, when to write an outline, when to start writing, when to stop writing, when to edit... there are no stopwatches, only vague directions and loooong time windows (days, weeks, months - not minutes).</p><p>As a result,&nbsp;<strong><em>we</em>&nbsp;have to make the decision to start—we have to trigger ourselves into action.</strong></p><p>In effect, we often leave the trigger to circumstance - we start working just before a deadline because we suddenly understand that if we don't start RIGHT NOW, we won't make it. Deadline becomes the only trigger we obey.</p><p>But that doesn't make for a consistent work ethic and healthy work-related confidence.</p><h2>How to add a trigger</h2><p>The key to an effective trigger is a sense of&nbsp;<em>I'm supposed to be doing this, right now.</em></p><p>The timeline exercise from the previous section can help with the first part - identifying a concrete task that will be triggered. However, a timeline doesn't provide us with a&nbsp;<em>cue.</em></p><p>We need to&nbsp;<strong>create a cue.</strong></p><p>One moment that can be used as a trigger is sitting down to work.&nbsp;<strong>When you sit down to work, you can take your to-do list and give yourself 5-15 minutes to decide which task to start with.</strong>&nbsp;If you don't know after the time has passed, pick one at random.<br>Cue #1: sitting down to work = time to find the first task.<br>Cue #2: time limit ends = time to work.</p><p>Another cue takes a little foresight and preparation.</p><p><strong>At the end of one work day, determine where you want to start the next day and put it into your calendar.</strong></p><p>Want to start writing a doc for your teammate? Put it on your calendar at 9–9:30AM, add a reminder and a link to the doc.</p><p>Want to start with a brainstorm? Take a sheet of paper, write the topic in its center, and put it on your desk so that it's the first thing you see tomorrow morning.</p><p>Want to start by looking up flights for a business trip? Download a picture of a plane and make it your wallpaper.</p><p>You can be as creative as you want, but the main point is this:<br><strong>define a specific task to do, at a specific place, at a specific moment in time - and make sure you can't miss the cue.</strong></p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model"><p>That's it.</p><p>Build up your motivation by reinforcing personal, meaningful reasons to do something.</p><p>Break down complex tasks into simple parts and plan them through time by creating a simple timeline.</p><p>And define a concrete trigger that will help you start your work.</p><br><hr><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-stop-procrastinating-by-using-the-fogg-behavior-model-part-2">Read How to stop procrastinating by using the Fogg Behavior Model - Part 2 here</a></p></article></div>]]>

To do this, we’ll use a common dataset — the MNIST dataset—and a standard deep learning task—image classification</p><p id="08c0">The goal here is to walk through an example that will illustrate the processes involved in building a convolutional neural network.

This is important because the shape will be needed by the convolution layer. We’ll use this shape later to reshape the size of the input data.</p><pre><span id="2997">x_train.shape</span><span id="9e48">(60000, 28, 28)</span></pre><p id="c58b">We kick off by initializing the <strong>sequential</strong> model. Then we pass in our layers as a list. The first layer is the <strong>reshape</strong> layer for changing the shape of the input data. We already know that each image has a size of 28 by 28. We also pass 1 to the reshape layer to ensure that the input data has a single color channel.</p><p id="320f">Next, we create the convolution layer. This layer takes in a couple of parameters:</p><ul><li id="9f47"><strong><em>filters</em></strong> — the number of output filters in the convolution, i.e the number of feature detectors. 32 is a common number of feature detectors used.</li><li id="266b"><strong><em>kernel_size</em></strong> — the dimensions of the feature detector matrix. This is the width and height of the convolution window.</li><li id="95d7"><strong><em>input_shape</em></strong> — the shape of the input data. Since we included a reshape layer, we don’t need to pass this.</li><li id="a1c3"><strong><em>activation</em></strong> — the activation function to be uses. The <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReLu activation function</a> is a common choice.</li></ul><p id="9830">The next item on the list is to add the<strong> pooling layer.</strong> In this step, the size of the <strong>feature map</strong> is reduced by taking the maximum value during the pooling process. 2 by 2 is a commonly-used pool size. This will reduce the size of the feature map while maintaining the most important features needed to identify the digits.</p><p id="d2e9">After that, we <strong>flatten</strong> the feature maps. This will convert the<strong> </strong>feature maps into a single column.</p><p id="ecea">The results obtained above are then passed to the <strong>dense layer</strong>. The parameters passed to this layer are the number of neurons and the activation function. In this case, those are 128 and ReLu, respectively.</p><p id="f796">Finally, we created our <strong>output layer</strong>. 10 is used here, because our dataset has 10 classes. We’ll use the <strong>softmax activation function </strong>because<strong> </strong>classes are mutually exclusive—an image can’t be, for example, classified as numbers 0 and 1 at the same time. If the case was otherwise, we’d use the <strong>sigmoid activation function</strong>.</p><pre><span id="88d8">model = Sequential([</span><span id="e17a">Reshape((28, 28, 1)),</span><span id="5886">Conv2D(filters=64,kernel_size=(3,3),activation=’relu’),</span><span id="c4ed">MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),</span><span id="c5bd">Flatten(),</span><span id="e185">Dense(128, activation=’relu’),</span><span id="7053">Dense(10, activation=’softmax’)</span><span id="99ce">])</span></pre><h2 id="fa74">Compiling the Network</h2><p id="8a88">We now need to apply <strong>gradient descent</strong> to the number. This is done at the compile stage. We pass the following parameters:</p><ul><li id="4091"><em>optimizer</em> — the type of gradient descent to use; in this case, we’ll use stochastic gradient descent</li><li id="24ca"><em>loss</em> — the cost function to use. We use <code>sparse_categorical_crossentropy</code><em> </em>because the classes are integer-encoded. Had we performed one-hot encoding, we’d have to use the categorical cross-entropy loss function.</li><li id="6fd9"><em>metrics</em> — the evaluation metrics to monitor; in this case, accuracy</li></ul><pre><span id="f23b">model.compile(optimizer=’sgd’,</span><span id="1b59">loss=’sparse_categorical_crossentropy’,</span><span id="d899">metrics=[‘accuracy’,])</span></pre><p id="3cb4">Next, we fit the training set to the network. <code>epochs</code> is the number of rounds the data will pass through the network. <code>validation_data</code> is the test dataset that will be used to evalutate the performance of the model during training.</p><pre><span id="f3be">model.fit(x=x_train,y=y_train,epochs=5,validation_data=validation_data)</span></pre><h2 id="404d">Evaluating the Network</h2><p id="ced8">We can now check the performance of the network. We do so using the <code>evaluate</code> function, passing in the test set. The first item in the result produced is the <code>loss</code>, and the second is the <code>accuracy</code>.</p><pre><span id="b542">model.evaluate(x_test,y_test)<br>313/313 [==============================] - 2s 8ms/step - loss: 0.1116 - accuracy: 0.9668<br>[0.1115519180893898, 0.9667999744415283]</span></pre><h2 id="c6d5">Checking the Predictions</h2><p id="e655">Let’s now see if our network is able to correctly identify a digit. We kick off by making predictions:</p><pre><span id="6043">predictions = model.predict(x_test)</span></pre><p id="8d16">For example, let’s check the digit at index 2 in the test set.</p><pre><span id="c8b9">image = x_test[2]</span><span id="7b62">fig = plt.figure</span><span id="0430">plt.imshow(image, cmap=’gray’)</span><span id="7e5e">plt.show()</span></pre><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/572/1*vy7T15w06LOIc9MC98RVYA.png" width="286" height="247" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*vy7T15w06LOIc9MC98RVYA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/572/1*vy7T15w06LOIc9MC98RVYA.png 286w" sizes="286px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*vy7T15w06LOIc9MC98RVYA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="a0d4">This is clearly the digit one.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-d9ec1b9bae718486f906"><div><p>There is only one rule of accounting club: “Cash is King”. At least that is what Ted Green, my high school business teacher, would tell me. Ted, the spitting image of Gene Wilder, would say things like, “You’re not going to Penn State, but State Penn” or “Forget Yale, how about jail?”. I always looked forward to hearing his pithy comments of the day. However, the one that stuck with me is, “Cash is King”.</p><p>It seems like such an obvious statement. But it’s one that many people forget — especially when it comes to social media. God, I hate comments like, “Followers are the new currency.” Try to pay for dinner with your followers. Let me know how it goes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Not All Audiences Are Equals</strong></p><p>Yes, building an audience makes you money. The larger your audience, the more money you make. But all audiences aren’t equal. This is especially true when it comes to TikTok.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, TikTok rocks! My iPhone tells me I spend 48 minutes a day on the app. Lately, my feed consists of people dancing to Taylor Swift. The words Marry Me Juliet are seared into my head (you only understand that reference if you use TikTok).</p><p>But !00,000 followers on YouTube are more valuable than 100,000 followers on TikTok. Let me explain why.</p><p><strong>Monetization for Creators</strong></p><p>At the moment, there are only two ways to directly monetize on TikTok:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Payment through the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362060/tiktok-creators-fund-recipients-david-dobrik-brittany-tomlinson-youtube-adsense" target="_blank">TikTok Creator Fund</a></p></li><li><p>Gifts from fans during live videos</p></li></ol><p>Many creators do monetize indirectly through their audience — for example, merchandise, affiliate links and brand partnerships.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube monetization is more robust. YouTube offers creators five direct ways to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/product-features/monetization/#merch-shelf" target="_blank">monetize their audience</a>:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Advertising</p></li><li><p>Channel Memberships — monthly subscription for member-only channels</p></li><li><p>Super Chat and Super Stickers — gifts during live streams</p></li><li><p>Merch shelf — buy official merchandise from the creator through YouTube</p></li><li><p>Subscriptions — YouTube creators earn money from YouTube Premium subscribers based on watch time</p></li></ol><p>This is in addition to other indirect monetization options available to creators.&nbsp;</p><p>A side by side comparison already shows that YouTube is the exceptional platform. It’s deeper than just the monetization options on the surface. It also boils down to user engagement.</p><p><strong>YouTube vs TikTok — User Experience</strong></p><p>When I use TikTok, I‘m only on the For You page. Yes, I follow people, but I have never gone to the Following tab. I think that the majority of users focus on the For You page.</p><p>For TikTok, this user experience gives new content creators hope. Someone with zero followers can go viral overnight. The problem is that building a loyal community is next to impossible. You are constantly vying to make the For You Page.</p><p>This is in contrast to YouTube’s experience. YouTube encourages content creators to build a community. It prioritizes users to watch the people they follow over people they don’t follow. Yes, it’s harder to find newer content on YouTube, but the experience centers around the community.&nbsp;</p><p>This makes monetization better in the long-run on YouTube. YouTube encourages consumption of the content creators you follow while TikTok encourages consumption-based on your interest.</p><p>TikTok is like a parasite for most content creators. Its algorithm makes TikTok money at the expense of creators.</p><p>I write all of this knowing that it’s probably irrelevant. TikTok will be banned in the United States. Even if it’s purchased the algorithm, that drives it, will be forever changed. If anything, I hope the lesson you learn by reading this is that followers don’t equal monetization. Yes, TikTok drives engagement, but it doesn’t build community for content creators. Thus, depriving TikTok creators of maximizing their earning potential. So always remember: “Cash is King.”</p><p><em>Thanks to </em><a href="https://twitter.com/jakemcgraw?lang=en"><em>Jake McGraw</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSinger"><em>Adam Singer</em></a><em> for their thoughts on this essay.</em></p><p><em>This post was inspired by my podcast with Brian Bosche, TikTok Influencer.

This idea took root and, over the years, we've gradually started tackling the surrounding challenges, such as:</p><ul><li><p>a fast and reliable build system much needed in front-end development, </p></li><li><p>various JS interop features that spawned an ecosystem of well typed libraries,</p></li><li><p>a production-ready standard library,</p></li><li><p>and recently, a fresh, solid syntax.</p></li></ul><p>These developments have attracted many people into our community. But one bigger challenge persisted: newcomers dropped out at the sheer amount of extra incongruent tools and learning overhead from having to understand OCaml concepts, Reason concepts, and BuckleScript's own concepts. Take, for example, what's required to make a ReasonReact app:</p><ul><li><p>Knowledge of React.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of JS.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of ReasonReact's specific idioms (that we've tried hard to keep to a minimum).</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of OCaml idioms, on top of which BuckleScript is built.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of BuckleScript's JS interop and the build system.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of the Reason syntax.</p></li></ul><p>Ironically, the more documentation we pile up, the more mental overhead newcomers suffered. During the various BuckleScript &amp; Reason meetups, we've frequently seen folks' enthusiasm crushed at the sheer prospect of making a web app while keeping 5+ tabs' worth of documentations open. This was discouraging, both for said eager developers and for us maintainers. </p><p>The adoption barrier is real, and it's about time we finally solve it.</p><p>Today, we'll start to truly unify the various BuckleScript-related projects under a single name: ReScript. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>The compiler, the build system and the syntax unified and shipping under a single install. Likewise for future efforts such as editor plugin.</p></li><li><p>A single documentation site which covers the above: <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescript-lang.org</a>.</p></li><li><p>Streamlined communication through said website, a <a href="https://forum.rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new dedicated forum</a> and a new <a href="http://twitter.com/rescriptlang" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>.</p></li><li><p>The renaming of various tools, always in a backward-compatible way.</p></li></ul><p>In short, all JS-related tools are now called ReScript. Previously, due to the messy situation, most real-world BuckleScript adoption came from a few heroic community members suffering through the technical and social risk of spreading our tech to their coworkers. From today onward, you can simply tell to your coworkers: "this is ReScript", and point to them a clear starting point instead of sending them to various incompatible sources, with a risk of losing goodwill and credibility.</p><p>It's worth emphasizing that while this rebranding seems to be very disruptive, in reality it's mostly a bunch of name changes for the same tech. To reiterate our stance on existing userland code:</p><ul><li><p>Please read our <a href="https://reasonml.org/blog/a-note-on-bucklescripts-future-commitments" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> on backward compatibility with pure OCaml &amp; Reason syntax.</p></li><li><p>The current Reason website will keep existing, with proper redirects to our new one when relevant. Existing Reason-to-JS users' code keep working, as per above post. Reason itself will continue tackling the parts BuckleScript didn't tackle before, such as native.</p></li><li><p>The various BuckleScript binaries will keep working. Instead of renaming those, we'd create new binaries instead.</p></li><li><p>The BuckleScript docs will redirect to the new site without breaking links.</p></li></ul><p>Thank you for your support and keep shipping. A brighter future awaits us!</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>The ReScript team (Bob, Cheng, Cristiano, Maxim, Patrick, Ricky).</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I mentioned in an earlier post&nbsp;about <a href="https://www.michaelfasani.com/2020/a-change-is-coming/">my intention to learn more about the AWS&nbsp;eco-system</a>, as I plan to take a more hands-on approach to my personal DevOps needs. I am pleased to say that I am super happy with the learning progress I have made in the past few&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<h2 id="tldr----omit-in-toc---"><a href="#tldr----omit-in-toc---" aria-label="tldr    omit in toc    permalink"></a>TL;DR <!-- omit in toc --></h2>
<p>I have outlined the steps I took to automatically build, deploy and host this Gatsby blog on AWS. I have created my perfect continuous integration and continuous deployment process, which I am sharing here with&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>To make changes to my site, I open a pull-request to the main branch on GitHub. I can preview the branch changes using Gatsby Cloud before merging. To complete the process, I merge the branch into main, and the changes are automatically deployed to my Amazon S3 bucket and distributed to all 216 points of presence (PoPs) on the AWS CloudFront&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>Now I have an almost&nbsp;perfect <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lighthouse score</a> from any location and a fast, highly secure, highly available&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>My site runs under the www subdomain, and I wrote a 301 serverless redirect function to route all traffic there, which is the perfect scenario for a solid SEO&nbsp;strategy.</p>
<p>During this process, I gained exposure&nbsp;to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gatsby Cloud</a> for building my Gatsby site and the&nbsp;following <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS services</a> for hosting&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There are multiple options to consider when hosting a Gatsby&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>I took reference from the following pages on&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gatsbyjs.org</a> site, but I feel like these guides are a little short on the details in some places, so I made this a step-by-step&nbsp;guide.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/s3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deploying Gatsby Sites to S3 +&nbsp;Cloudfront</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/s3/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Getting started with Gatsby Cloud and&nbsp;S3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You may want to swap out various sections of this guide with your own preferences. Perhaps you prefer to use a different process to build your site or have a more complex 301 redirect strategy. I have tried to separate the content into logical sections, but because of the nature of a build system, this is not easy. I have tried to explain when and why I have done things to make this guide more&nbsp;useful.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-set-up-gatsby-cloud"><a href="#step-1-set-up-gatsby-cloud" aria-label="step 1 set up gatsby cloud permalink"></a>Step 1: Set up Gatsby&nbsp;Cloud</h2>
<p>Gatsby Cloud is free for personal projects and single-purpose sites. If you only plan to build a single repository you can continue to use it for free with up to 100 real-time edits per month, the free tier will probably work for most personal&nbsp;sites.</p>
<p>If you plan to host several sites, you should consider the first pay tier on Gatsby Cloud is currently $19 per month which would enable 250 real-time edits per&nbsp;month.</p>
<p>Another point to note is that Gatsby Cloud currently only works with GitHub hosted repositories. They plan to add more soon (GitLab, Bitbucket,&nbsp;Google).</p>
<h3 id="connect-github-to-gatsby-cloud"><a href="#connect-github-to-gatsby-cloud" aria-label="connect github to gatsby cloud permalink"></a>Connect GitHub to Gatsby&nbsp;Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.gatsbyjs.com</a>.</li>
<li>Sign up with your GitHub&nbsp;account.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Add a site&nbsp;+</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong><em>Organization</em></strong>, <strong><em>Repository</em></strong> and <strong><em>Branch</em></strong> you wish to&nbsp;build.</li>
<li>Skip or&nbsp;Add <strong><em>Integrations</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Create site</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your site will start building to the Gatsby staging servers, assuming the build is successful you will now be able to view it on a Gatsby staging URL (eg:&nbsp;https://build-random-string.gtsb.io).</p>
<p>To learn more about Gatsby Cloud&nbsp;and <strong>Data Source (CMS)&nbsp;Integrations</strong> check out&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gatsby Cloud Docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="adding-password-protection-to-the-gatsby-staging-environment"><a href="#adding-password-protection-to-the-gatsby-staging-environment" aria-label="adding password protection to the gatsby staging environment permalink"></a>Adding password protection to the Gatsby staging&nbsp;environment</h3>
<p>A neat feature of Gatsby Cloud is the preview environment, you can add password protection to keep the staging environment private. It could be great for showing changes to clients before pushing them&nbsp;live.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong><em>Site Settings &gt; General &gt; Access&nbsp;Control</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Edit</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong><em>Password Protected</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a password in&nbsp;the <strong><em>Preview Password</em></strong> field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now your Gatsby Cloud site staging URL will be password&nbsp;protected.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-set-up-an-amazon-s3-bucket"><a href="#step-2-set-up-an-amazon-s3-bucket" aria-label="step 2 set up an amazon s3 bucket permalink"></a>Step 2: Set up an Amazon S3&nbsp;bucket</h2>
<p>We will need to do several things to prepare an S3 bucket for Gatsby Cloud to deploy too. We will create a&nbsp;new <strong>IAM User</strong> and a&nbsp;new <strong>S3 bucket</strong>.</p>
<p>Gatsby Cloud will need the following bits of information from AWS.&nbsp;An <strong>Access Key ID</strong>, <strong>Secret Access Key</strong> and&nbsp;an <strong>S3 Bucket Name</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-new-iam-user"><a href="#create-a-new-iam-user" aria-label="create a new iam user permalink"></a>Create a new IAM&nbsp;User</h3>
<p>In the AWS Management Console go to&nbsp;the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Identity and Access Management&nbsp;(IAM)</a> service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a&nbsp;new <strong><em>IAM User</em></strong> called <strong><em>GatsbyCloudAmazonS3FullAccess</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Give the&nbsp;user <strong><em>Programmatic access</em></strong>.</li>
<li>For the user permissions choose to&nbsp;manually <strong><em>Attach existing policies&nbsp;directly</em></strong> and search for and&nbsp;select <strong><em>AmazonS3FullAccess</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the wizard and make a note of&nbsp;the <strong>Access key ID</strong> and <strong>Secret access key</strong> when you are&nbsp;finished.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-new-s3-bucket"><a href="#create-a-new-s3-bucket" aria-label="create a new s3 bucket permalink"></a>Create a new S3&nbsp;bucket</h3>
<p>In the <strong>AWS Management Console</strong> go to&nbsp;the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a> service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new S3 bucket with a unique&nbsp;name.</li>
<li>Tag the bucket to track&nbsp;costs.</li>
<li>Allow public access by&nbsp;un-checking <strong><em>Block all public&nbsp;access</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Check <strong><em>Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists&nbsp;(ACLs)</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Check <strong><em>Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists&nbsp;(ACLs)</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enable-the-s3-bucket-for-static-website-hosting"><a href="#enable-the-s3-bucket-for-static-website-hosting" aria-label="enable the s3 bucket for static website hosting permalink"></a>Enable the S3 bucket for static website&nbsp;hosting</h3>
<p>After creating the bucket we need to enable&nbsp;the <strong>Static website hosting</strong> feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the newly created bucket&nbsp;name.</li>
<li>Go to&nbsp;the <strong><em>Properties Tab</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Then enable <strong><em>Static website hosting</em></strong> and&nbsp;choose <strong><em>Use this bucket to host a&nbsp;website</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter <strong><em>index.html</em></strong> for the Index&nbsp;document.</li>
<li>Enter <strong><em>404.html</em></strong> for the Error&nbsp;document.</li>
<li>Save your changes and make a note of&nbsp;the <strong>endpoint</strong>, you can use this address to test your site after your first deployment. If you visit the URL now, you should see&nbsp;a <strong>403 Forbidden</strong> page</li>
</ul>
<p>You can review this document for additional information&nbsp;about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/EnableWebsiteHosting.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hosting static sites on Amazon&nbsp;S3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="set-permissions-on-the-new-s3-bucket"><a href="#set-permissions-on-the-new-s3-bucket" aria-label="set permissions on the new s3 bucket permalink"></a>Set permissions on the new S3&nbsp;bucket</h3>
<p>To enable public access to the S3 bucket we need to change the bucket&nbsp;policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to&nbsp;the <strong><em>permissions Tab</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Ensure you have&nbsp;cleared <strong><em>Block all public&nbsp;access</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong><em>Bucket policy</em></strong> enter the following configuration JSON and&nbsp;exchange <strong>example-name</strong> under&nbsp;the <strong>Resource</strong> section to be the unique name of your S3&nbsp;bucket:</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="json" data-index="0"><code><span><span><span>{</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>Version</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>2012-10-17</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span></span>

<span><span><span>        ]</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>    }]</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>After setting the above policy, if you revisit the S3 bucket endpoint URL, you should now see&nbsp;a <strong>404 Not Found</strong> page.</p>
<p>You can review this document for additional information&nbsp;about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteAccessPermissionsReqd.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Setting permissions for website&nbsp;access</a>.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-connect-gatsby-cloud-to-amazon-s3"><a href="#step-3-connect-gatsby-cloud-to-amazon-s3" aria-label="step 3 connect gatsby cloud to amazon s3 permalink"></a>Step 3: Connect Gatsby Cloud to Amazon&nbsp;S3</h2>
<p>Now we can go back to the Gatsby Cloud platform and connect the build to the newly created S3&nbsp;bucket.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong><em>Site Settings &gt; Integrations &gt;&nbsp;Hosting</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Locate <strong><em>AWS S3 Integration</em></strong> in the list of Hosting integrations and&nbsp;click <strong><em>Connect</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your&nbsp;IAM <strong><em>Access Key ID</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your&nbsp;IAM <strong><em>Secret Access Key</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your&nbsp;S3 <strong><em>Bucket Name</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After pressing save, it will trigger a new deployment. If everything goes as expected, you should wait a few moments for the deployment to complete. Once complete you can now visit your S3 URL endpoint from earlier, and you should now see your Gatsby site deployed on the AWS bucket endpoint&nbsp;address.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-set-up-amazon-cloudfront-cdn"><a href="#step-4-set-up-amazon-cloudfront-cdn" aria-label="step 4 set up amazon cloudfront cdn permalink"></a>Step 4: Set up Amazon CloudFront&nbsp;CDN</h2>
<p>You will probably want also to set up AWS CloudFront, which is Amazon's content delivery network (CDN). There are two reasons for&nbsp;this:</p>
<p>The first reason is that S3 buckets can't be configured to serve content over HTTPS to custom domains because Amazon S3 uses an SSL wildcard&nbsp;certificate.</p>
<p>The second reason is that using a CDN to distribute your static assets means your site speed will be impressive from most countries, not just countries close to where you hosted the new S3 bucket. (The CloudFront network has 216 points of presence&nbsp;(PoPs)).</p>
<h3 id="create-a-new-ssl-certificate-for-your-domain-name"><a href="#create-a-new-ssl-certificate-for-your-domain-name" aria-label="create a new ssl certificate for your domain name permalink"></a>Create a new SSL certificate for your domain&nbsp;name</h3>
<p>In the <strong>AWS Management Console</strong> go to&nbsp;the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS Certificate Manager&nbsp;(ACM)</a> service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong><em>Request a certificate</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your <strong><em>Domain name</em></strong>, I&nbsp;entered <strong><em>michaelfasani.com</em></strong> and I entered&nbsp;an <strong><em>Additional name</em></strong> as <strong><em>www.michaelfasani.com</em></strong> (I read some people seem to be having various issues with HTTPS in this kind of S3 setup and I believe the problem is from not specifying the www address as an additional name. You should add all the subdomains you want to work&nbsp;with).</li>
<li>Then choose to validate the certificate with&nbsp;either <strong><em>DNS validation</em></strong> or <strong><em>Email validation</em></strong> and follow the next steps for either&nbsp;choice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="create-a-new-cloudfront-distribution"><a href="#create-a-new-cloudfront-distribution" aria-label="create a new cloudfront distribution permalink"></a>Create a new CloudFront&nbsp;distribution</h3>
<p>In the <strong>AWS Management Console</strong> go to&nbsp;the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon CloudFront</a> service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong><em>Create Distribution</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong><em>Web</em></strong> and&nbsp;click <strong><em>Get Started</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Paste your S3 domain URL in&nbsp;the <strong><em>Origin Domain Name</em></strong>…</li></ul></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vue-next (Vue 3) has been out for a while. It is now under release candidate stage which means there won't be big changes on the open APIs. Good to see that Vue has already been stabilized and ready to waltz into our projects.</p><p>I have to say that Vue 2 is already amazing enough. But with Vue 3's new features, it's likely to upgrade our projects to an upper level. I guess the most thrilling feature in Vue 3 would be the composition APIs. Evan You himself mentioned that the composition APIs are inspired by the React hooks. Even though the two APIs hooks and compositions are a lot alike, but from the code base they are completely different. Let's not discuss which is better or promising because I don't really think either framework outraces another.</p><p>In all, it's so happy to see that Vue can also do what React does.

"Filters" is Deprecated(Removed)</a></h2><p>I think a lot of people think that <code>filters</code> is maybe an awesome feature of Vue.js. It indeed works well in Vue's template engine. (For example, data formatting / calculation etc).</p><p>Let's see how Vue 3 doc explains why <code>filters</code> is removed:</p><blockquote><p>While this seems like a convenience, it requires a custom syntax that breaks the assumption of expressions inside of curly braces being "just JavaScript," which has both learning and implementation costs.</p></blockquote><p>I believe it's nothing bad for development without the <code>filters</code>, even though it may cost you extra time on migrating to Vue 3. In my projects, the appearance of <code>filters</code> is pretty a rare case since I could replace such functionality with a <code>method</code> or <code>computed</code> easily. Because in my opinion, <code>method</code> / <code>computed</code> has higher readability than the <code>filters</code>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

		<p>Each time I have created an Android image I have found something new. Google Assistant and Android Auto were results of Nougat and Oreo, and the changes I found in Google Assistant were a result of Android Pie. Android 10 is no exception. While poking around the OS during the data generation period I found Google’s Digital Wellbeing app was tracking how many times I unlocked the test phone each day, which led me to ask “what else was it tracking?” As it turns out, quite a bit. I shared this information with Alexis Brignoni (more on that later) and got to work on some test data after I <a href="https://thebinaryhick.blog/2020/02/15/android-10-image-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created the Android 10 image</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Wellbeing is not new. It was introduced to the Pixel line in Android 9, and slowly rolled out to non-Pixel phones. While not present on every Android device, it is required on newer devices. As of September 3, 2019, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/google-now-requires-all-android-devices-to-have-a-digital-wellbeing-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google is requiring Digital Wellbeing-like capabilities on all phones that either launch with or upgrade to Android 9 or 10</a>. This is baked into the Google Mobile Services contract, so OEMs who want to use Google services and apps on their handsets will have to comply. Basically, this means while the specific Digital Wellbeing app is not required, tracking certain activities and making that information available to the user is, so it is possible OEMs may implement their own solutions in order to comply. However, it is more likely they will just use Digital Wellbeing. The point is that regardless of which option OEMs choose, the data will be there…somewhere, and in some fashion.</p>
<p>Google wants users to be able to make informed decisions about their digital well being. In order to do this, users need to know how much time they are spending on their phones and how they are using them. Sometimes examiners and investigators need to know that same information in order to make informed decisions during an investigation. Digital Wellbeing can help with both.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI_vzeKA_Zg&amp;list=PLfouvuAjspTo6pWGP7otkE6SZ3QQ0b-RD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica Hyde</a> (@B1N2H3X), <a href="https://abrignoni.blogspot.com/2019/02/android-usagestats-xml-parser.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexis Brignoni</a> (@AlexisBrignoni), and <a href="https://www.swiftforensics.com/2020/01/usagestats-on-android-10-q.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yogesh Khatri</a> (@SwiftForensics) have done a lot of great work on Usage Stats in Android and how they can be used to track user activity. My hope for this blog post is that it takes their work one step further.</p>
<h2>Visually Speaking</h2>
<p>Digital Wellbeing is a dashboard for the usage data it collects, and it is fairly easy to navigate. It can be accessed from the Android Settings app. Figure 1 shows the landing page for the app.</p>

<p>The part that is of interest here is the top portion, “Your Digital Wellbeing tools.” As you can see the device is tracking the number of unlocks and the amount of notifications received (red box). You can also see the chart that shows the amount of time I spent on the phone at that particular point in the day; I took the screenshot early in the morning, so I had only been on the phone for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Tapping in the middle of the blue circle brings me to the page seen in Figure 2, which is tracking the amount of time I have been active on my screen. The area in the red box is a drop down menu. The other two choices are “Notifications Received” (Figure 3) and “Times Opened” (Figure 4).</p>

<p>At the bottom of Figures 2-4, you can see how the total amount of time breaks down for each app. Figure 4 is a bit misleading, though. The top of the screen is tracking the number of times the phone has been opened and the number of times each app has been opened is detailed at the bottom.</p>
<p>That’s it. This app has other capabilities, but from an investigative standpoint these are the ones to pay attention to.</p>
<h2>Forensically Speaking</h2>
<p>To generate test data, I wiped my Pixel 3, flashed it with a clean install of Android 10 (January 2020 patch level), and then rooted it with Magisk. When setting up the phone I took all of the defaults. I did not do anything to the Digital Wellbeing app just so I could see what the default data collection looked like, and I imagine most users will do the same as they probably do not care about this feature. I installed two apps from the Google Play Store, Line and WhatsApp, and generated some test data with them along with some default apps.</p>
<p>The best way to forensically describe Digital Wellbeing is “Usage Stats on steroids.” While this is great for Android, it is not quite as thorough as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mac4n6.com/blog/2018/8/5/knowledge-is-power-using-the-knowledgecdb-database-on-macos-and-ios-to-determine-precise-user-and-application-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS’s knowledgeC,</a>&nbsp;and it is definiately no where near as “clean” as knowledgeC. &nbsp;However, examining it is straight forward for two reasons: 1, it is a SQLite database, and 2, it uses the same event type codes as Usage Stats, which are <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/UsageEvents.Event" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well documented on the Android developer site</a>. In theory, one could merely extract the database, run a quick SQL query, export to CSV, and sort by time. Voila, you have yourself a timeline, right? Well, not quite.</p>
<p>Before we get to the database, let’s take a quick look at where it is stored. The Digital Wellbeing database is aptly named “<em>app_usage</em>” and is in the path <strong>/data/data/com.google.android.apps.wellbeing/databases</strong>. &nbsp;See Figure 5.</p>

<p>This table is simple. Here the timestamps can be seen (in Unix Epoch) along with the event codes for what the app did (column type). Again, these codes are the same as those in Usage Stats, but in Android 10 (API 29) two have been renamed, five new ones have been introduced, and one is not even documented. The codes I have observed in the table are as follows:</p>
<p>1 = ACTIVITY_RESUMED (Formerly MOVE_TO_FOREGROUND)<br>
2 = ACTIVITY_PAUSED (Formerly MOVE_TO_BACKGROUND)<br>
12 = Notification (not documented on the Android Developer site)<br>
18 = KEYGUARD_HIDDEN (indicative of a device unlock-added in Android 9)<br>
19 = FOREGROUND_SERVICE_START (new)<br>
20 = FORGROUND_SERVICE_STOP (new)<br>
23 = ACTIVITY_STOPPED (new)<br>
26 = DEVICE_SHUTDOWN (new)<br>
27 = DEVICE_STARTUP (new)</p>
<p>Some of the names are descriptive enough, but for those that are not you can read about them by visiting the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/UsageEvents.Event" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Developers page</a>.</p>
<p>The values in the column <em>package_id</em> refer to the values <em>_id</em> in the table <strong>packages</strong> (Figure 7).</p>

<p>To help decipher this, I have color coded some lines. The orange rows indicate when my device locked, with the package ending in “nexuslauncher” stopping (activity type 23). The next event that shows up is just over two hours later (green rows). In the next two rows (green) you can see nexuslauncher resume (activity type 1), and then the package android appears with the activity type 18 (device unlock). I had locked the phone at 13:32, and then woke it at 15:40 and unlocked it.</p>
<p>The next thing I did a minute later was change the wallpaper. I long-pressed on the home screen and went to the wallpaper gallery. You can see that nexuslauncher paused and then stopped (yellow rows) and then the package ending in “wallpaper” resumed-paused-stopped-resumed (cycled), which is shown in the blue rows. Once I chose my wallpaper I went back to the homescreen (white row), and then the wallpaper package stopped (red rows) since I was done with it.</p>
<p>Looking at the <em>Human Readable Time</em> column you will see that this entire series of actions occur within a minute and a half of each other, and some of those occur at the same second. In that case the sorting is done by the column “<em>_id</em>.” Interestingly enough, I did not find where the values in the <em>_id</em> column were not in chronological order. Not to say that it could not happen, but that I did not find it.</p>
<p>Figure 10 is my next example.</p>

<p>In this figure I had been using the Android Messages app (orange row), and hit the home button to go back to the home screen (blue boxes). I left the phone alone and let the screen timeout on its own (timeout setting was 5 minutes). The phone sat dormant until I unlocked it which took me to the home screen (green rows). I then opened the Line app and started typing (yellow and grey rows).</p>
<p>The red rows are interesting. They all have event ID’s of 12, and they were all written to the database while I was not using the phone (I had left it on my desk with no interaction for over a day). I went back and checked my notes and compared them and this output versus what was in the Digital Wellbeing Notifications dashboard, and, as it turns out, event ID 12 denotes a notification. The thing to note is it could be a notification you can see or <em>cannot</em> see. For example, I had numerous entries for <strong>com.android.providers.downloads</strong>, however, I have nothing in my notes that indicate I received a notification for that. It is possible Google Play Store downloaded updates in the background and I never saw them (remember I took the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Cloud accounts are usually seen as machinery, humming away 24/7, working all the time to fulfill a business need. This is certainly true for production applications, but most workloads are not like this. A developer goes to an office in the morning, works until late afternoon then goes home. When he is not working, the account just sits there, doing practically nothing.</p> <p>And this happens for longer periods of time too. Someone might be working on a project then moves to another one just to come back to the first one months later.</p> <p>The problem is that these inactive accounts still have all the power of a normal account, and they significantly increase the attack surface. It doesn’t matter if an account is unused for months if a misplaced access key leads that it starts mining Bitcoin.</p> <p>It would be better to inactivate AWS accounts when they are not needed. Fortunately, it is possible with service control policies.</p> <div> <div> <div> <p><small>Shameless plug</small></p><div> <div> <p><img sizes="150px" integrity="sha256-WQF8nZ8/5i9yYsT55IpUy24SgBvH65jOuQBt+1zNP0U=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/80fbfe-405b6a9c03d36452d3900d73fd4bda5868a74e5997d190c09b4d1ef96a0e1ddb.png" srcset="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/27de8a-405b6a9c03d36452d3900d73fd4bda5868a74e5997d190c09b4d1ef96a0e1ddb.png 150w, https://advancedweb.hu/assets/3c3744-88dfc30ea21c62fec449c6f3b6d2c746617af8536ccc421cdcc69c024b28e85f.png 300w, https://advancedweb.hu/assets/fbbfcc-d33b95f6785dadb8457af3ba54ac043b360b3e81778b529c8756539679d35b71.png 450w, https://advancedweb.hu/assets/cbbc51-8341d403719fee0fe6444294a0270a6ac14dd5288422fe3f237d7b11af9b77bc.png 225w"> </p> <p> <h5>Join our mailing list and get a free guide of 5 tips to make an AWS account more secure</h5> </p> <!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->  <!--End mc_embed_signup--> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="scp">SCP</h2> <p>Service control policies (SCPs) <strong>allow outside control over the account</strong>. Because of this, this is the most powerful policy type in AWS as there is no way around them, even the root user is limited. When an SCP is in place there is no way to remove it or negate its effect without accessing the master account.</p> <p>The SCP is a feature of AWS Organizations which is the service that allows creating multiple accounts without going through the usual process of registration. With Organizations, you can create a new account programmatically and it allows managing hundreds and thousands of accounts.</p> <p>The account that has billing information filled in is called the <em>master account</em>. This is the one you created the traditional way and charges your bank card. The accounts created using Organizations are called <em>member accounts</em>. These are dependent on the master account for billing.</p> <p>Organizations allow the master account to attach SCPs to member accounts to limit what they can do. These are IAM policies that are evaluated before anything else in the policy evaluation logic. With SCPs an account can be limited in which regions it can use resources, what services it can use, and even what resources it can not delete or modify.</p> <p>Without access to the master account these policies can not be changed or removed. This makes SCPs a great tool to enforce limitations in an account. The master account can not be limited by an SCP.</p> <h2 id="lockdown-policy">Lockdown policy</h2> <p>To prevent an account from being used an SCP that denies everything can be used:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

Using the <em>master account</em>, use this call:</p> <div><div><pre><code>aws organizations attach-policy <span>--target-id</span> &lt;account <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>--policy-id</span> &lt;policy <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This attaches the policy and that prevents anything from happening inside the account. No new instances can be run, no information can be queried about any resource inside it, even Lambda functions that are already added won’t work. Here is how the IAM console looks like with an admin account:</p> <p><img integrity="sha256-lfXU2SbYtvswrUw8NOlQzMbS6kibv7LP61PRxeSIGSM=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/lock_account_with_scp/iam-95f5d4d926d8b6fb30ad4c3c34e950ccc6d2ea489bbfb2cfeb53d1c5e4881923.png"></p> <p>And the best thing is that these restrictions also apply to the root user. In practice, as long as this policy is attached the account is unusable in any ways.</p> <h3 id="unlock">Unlock</h3> <p>To unlock the account and get back to normal all you need to do is detach the policy with the master account:</p> <div><div><pre><code>aws organizations detach-policy <span>--target-id</span> &lt;account <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>--policy-id</span> &lt;policy <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="auto-unlock-and-lock-script">Auto unlock and lock script</h2> <p>Let’s bring this a step further! With some scripting it is possible to unlock the account for a shell session and auto-lock it when the session ends. Effectively, this setup minimizes the time the account is usable to when it’s needed which is perfect for a development account.</p> <p>Here’s a simple script to achieve that:</p> <div><div><pre><code>aws organizations detach-policy <span>--target-id</span> <span>$ACCOUNTID</span> <span>--policy-id</span> <span>$POLICYID</span> <span>||</span> <span>true

</span><span>AWS_PROFILE</span><span>=</span>sandbox <span>AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG</span><span>=</span>1 zsh

aws organizations attach-policy <span>--target-id</span> <span>$ACCOUNTID</span> <span>--policy-id</span> <span>$POLICYID</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>It unlocks the account then starts <code>zsh</code>. When the shell finishes by typing <code>exit</code>, the account gets locked automatically. Furthermore, it sets the <code>AWS_PROFILE</code> environment variable so that AWS CLI calls inside the shell session go to the member account. The <code>AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG</code> is needed for the AWS SDK to support the profile setting.</p> <p>A corresponding profile can be configured for the AWS CLI:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>[profile sandbox]</span>
<span>role_arn</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;role arn&gt;</span>
<span>source_profile</span><span>=</span><span>default</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The above setting works when you have a user specified in the credentials file. But in my case it used the <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code>, the <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>, and the <code>AWS_SESSION_TOKEN</code> environment variables and this setup does not play well with profiles. When both the keys and the profile is set in the environment the former takes precedence and that prevents the jump into the account.</p> <p>The solution is to create a temporary credentials file and unset the keys from the environment:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>CRED_FILE</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>mktemp</span><span>)</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"[default]</span><span>\n</span><span>aws_access_key_id=</span><span>$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>\n</span><span>aws_secret_access_key=</span><span>$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>\n</span><span>aws_session_token=</span><span>$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>$CRED_FILE</span>

aws organizations detach-policy <span>--target-id</span> <span>$ACCOUNTID</span> <span>--policy-id</span> <span>$POLICYID</span> <span>||</span> <span>true</span>

<span>(</span>
	<span>unset </span>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

Since steel’s decline more than 30 years ago, the Mon Valley community has suffered from chronic disinvestment.</p>  <p>“When you look at what changed, it was the community aspect of it. It’s like, let’s get back to relying on one another and building up ourselves,” Reyes says as traffic rolls through Braddock’s commercial district, a sparse collection of businesses scattered among empty storefronts and vacant lots.</p>  <p>Reyes is the director of Neighbors Helping Neighbors, a grassroots group that links volunteers with people who need services such as a car ride or home repair. The goal, Reyes says, is to establish an “alternative economy.”</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg" alt="As director of the grassroots group Neighbors Helping Neighbors, Jona Reyes has helped to build a network of about 200 residents who can offer and solicit services such as car rides or home repairs.

About five years ago, involveMINT developed a digital currency, called “time credits,” to share with people who invest their time in the community. The East Liberty-based venture initially focused its efforts in Pittsburgh’s Hazelwood neighborhood. But by working with Neighbors Helping Neighbors, the group hopes to begin circulating time credits in and around Braddock.</p>  <p>So far, involveMINT and Neighbors Helping Neighbors have enlisted about 10 local businesses to accept the credits as payment. While the units <a href="https://www.theselc.org/community-currencies-faq">are considered taxable earnings</a>, they reflect a deeper contribution to the community, said involveMINT executive director Dan Little.</p>  <p>“Money is scarce in the communities that arguably would need it most,”&nbsp; Little noted of the lack of funding in places like Braddock. “So the idea is [that] by having an alternative currency, you’re creating an alternative channel for commerce to happen, when that money is not available.”</p>  <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6595.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6595.jpg" alt="Dan Little, executive director of involveMINT, began to develop time credits as an alternative form of currency in 2015.

The idea <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2006/02/11/local-currencies-ithaca_cz_el_money06_0214local.html#eb379bf5b4cd">grew especially popular during the Great Depression</a>, when market failures dried up the supply of cash in circulation. Propronents say alternative currencies help to stimulate local economies by encouraging firms and residents to do business with others who participate in their community's homegrown currency system.</p>  <p>Little added that COVID-19, and the economic turmoil it has caused, further underscore the value of reducing communities’ reliance on dollars.</p>  <p>Although the federal government has <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center#eligibility">distributed coronavirus stimulus payments to qualifying households</a>, Little noted, “for many people, that barely covers rent … And with local businesses, we know that they have seen a tremendous decrease in revenue.”</p>  <p>By using time credits created, or minted, by involveMINT, Little said, businesses can establish a new source of revenue, and use those funds to buy more supplies locally. Little noted that the coronavirus pandemic has revealed the fragility of global supply chains.</p>  <p>“[The new currency] may not be a panacea. It’s not going to pay for everything. But it’s going to get [users] some access to things that are local,” Little said.</p>  <p><strong>‘It will help to unify the community’</strong></p>  <p>COVID-19 prompted Neighbors Helping Neighbors and involveMINT to launch a grocery delivery service as one option for earning time credits. The program aims to help those who are vulnerable to the disease and, thus, should avoid stores.</p>  <p>Retiree Cynthia Underwood is one of several community members who have signed up to make deliveries. Her clients include seniors such as Myrtle Walker, who’s physically unable to go down stairs. In fact, when Underwood makes a delivery, the 72-year-old drops a key from her second-floor apartment window so that Underwood can let herself in.</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/myrtle_walker_2.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/myrtle_walker_2.jpg" alt="Braddock resident Myrtle Walker relies on an oxygen generator to manage her lung disease.

Grow Pittsburgh’s director of farm education, Denele Hughson, said time credits are rooted in the same philosophy as her organization, which strives to empower communities like Braddock to draw on existing assets to cultivate their own food economies.</p>  <p>Hughson noted that her organization can use the time credits to buy compost from the local company Worm Return. And she said Grow Pittsburgh will use the units to pay for a few additional hours of work at its urban farm.</p>  <p>“Someone who’s just looking to volunteer for a few hours a week, and in exchange for that they actually get something tangible that they can use it on&nbsp;– I think that would be amazing,” Hughson said.</p>  <p><strong>‘Funny money?’</strong></p> <p>The success of any currency, including the dollar, depends on whether people trust it. And whether they trust it depends on how much they see others use it.</p>  <p>Circulation has been a challenge for local currencies elsewhere. In Ithaca, N.Y., for example, a currency called Ithaca HOURS went defunct after about two decades. Erik Lehmann was the last person to chair the Ithaca HOURS board.</p>  <p>“Towards the end, it was basically like a coupon,” he said of the HOURS. “It wasn’t a full currency. Most vendors that accepted it didn’t accept it at full face value.”</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg" alt="Grow Pittsburgh is one of about 10 local organizations that have agreed to accept time credits as payment.

While at one time about 300 businesses had signed up to accept the HOURS, Lehamann said, “There weren’t the Wegman’s and the big banks and the big landlords."</p>  <p>In Philadelphia, a local currency called Equal Dollars <a href="https://generocity.org/philly/2014/07/14/equal-dollars-alternative-currency-out-of-circulation-after-19-years/">faced a similar hurdle</a>, though it too had been in circulation for about 20 years. Former Equal Dollars director Deneene Brockington said, because most businesses had nowhere to spend Equal Dollars, they simply donated them to charities of their choosing.</p>  <p>“That kind of resonated with some people and some local businesses: They got to participate in something local and then donate to a community organization that then was able to use those dollars as a way to thank their people for community service,” Brockington said.</p>  <p>Equal Dollars ultimately dissolved in 2014 because, Brockington said, the nonprofit that ran it, Resources for Human Development, decided to stop funding the program. Brockington noted that staffers like her, who managed the Equal Dollars program, still needed to be paid in U.S. dollars. After all, they couldn't use alternative currency to pay their bills.</p>  <p>Scott Morris, who is leading an effort to launch a new currency in Ithaca, called Ithacash, has also struggled to secure funding for personnel. He said it's a necessary expense, to ensure that professionals can educate people and businesses on how to use the units, recruit more participants into the network, and manage the complexities associated with sustaining that network.</p>  <p>"The business model has never been easy to deal with because it’s like, ‘Look, we’re making our own money, and so you should pay us some regular money for it.’ And [potential funders] are just going to be like, ‘Well, this is the real money. Why do you want my real money for your funny money?’” Morris said.</p>  <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg" alt="Neighbors Helping Neighbors and involveMINT receive some donations for their grocery delivery service from Dorothy Gey's food distribution site in Braddock.

It’s like … let’s see what the community can do to help itself.”</p> </div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>#100DaysOfCode</code> is a great engagement to refresh some of the concepts that are basic, but extremely important.  Today, I spent time on refreshing my memory on JavaScript's equality operators and methods. Thought, why not to write about it?</p>
<p>Traditionally JavaScript provides 2 special operators for equality comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>==</code> for Abstract Equality Comparison which performs a loose equality between the operands.</li>
<li><code>===</code> for Strict Equality Comparison which performs a strict equality between the operands.</li>
</ul>
<p>With ES6, we have one more way to perform the <code>Same-value equality</code> using <code>Object.is</code> method. In this article, we will get deeper in understanding the usage, impact and use-cases of all of them.</p>

<p>Abstract equality comparison(aka, loose equality comparison) compares two values for equality, after converting both the values into a common type. In this type of comparison, <code>type coercion</code> is performed by JavaScript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us understand this with an example. Consider two different animals from the type Rodent, i.e, hamsters and guinea pigs. I have no doubts that, the equality comparison with <code>==</code> is going to return <code>true</code> by coercing their type to rodent.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597131508222/pQgOeyb0E.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>In programming,</p>
<pre><code><span>true</span> == <span>1</span> 
<span>'0'</span> == <span>0</span> 
[<span>9</span>, <span>2</span>] == <span>'9,2'</span> 
<span>""</span> == <span>0</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>You would find the <code>==</code> operator strange, if you are new to the JavaScript and holding your experiences of value comparisons from another programming language. </p>
<p>That's not all. The <code>==</code> operator also has an evil sister called, <code>!=</code>. It does just the opposite comparison of two values to check if they are not equal. However, just like <code>==</code>, it also does a type conversion which leads to confusions.</p>

<p>With strict equality comparison, guinea pigs and hamsters are not equal as, <code>===</code> compares two values for equality. Neither of the values are implicitly converted(coerced) to some other value before being compared. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Strict Equality Comparison, If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code><span>true</span> === <span>1</span> 
<span>'0'</span> === <span>0</span> 
[<span>9</span>, <span>2</span>] === <span>'9,2'</span> 
<span>""</span> === <span>0</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>===</code> also has an angel sister called, <code>!==</code> which helps in finding if two values are strictly not equal. We should be using the strict type(<code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>) comparison over the loose type(<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>) comparison <strong>almost</strong> always. </p>
<p>But why almost? Why not always?</p>
<p>The <code>===</code> handles <code>NaN</code>, <code>-0</code>, and <code>+0</code> bit differently.</p>
<pre><code><span>NaN</span> === <span>NaN</span> 
+<span>0</span> === <span>-0</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>Strict equality treats <code>NaN</code> as unequal to every other value, including itself. It also doesn't care about the difference between +0 and -0. Now for some situations, these differences may matter and the strict equality may fail there.</p>

<p>With ES6, we have a new way to determine if the two values are same.</p>
<pre><code><span>Object</span>.is(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>null</span>, <span>null</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>undefined</span>, <span>undefined</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>true</span>, <span>1</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(+<span>0</span>, <span>-0</span>) 
<span>Object</span>.is(<span>NaN</span>, <span>NaN</span>) 
</code></pre>
<p>From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is">MDN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two values are the same if one of the following holds:</p>
<ul>
<li>both undefined</li>
<li>both null<ul>
<li>both true or both false</li>
<li>both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order</li>
<li>both the same object (means both object have same reference)</li>
<li>both numbers and</li>
<li>both <code>+0</code></li>
<li>both <code>-0</code></li>
<li>both <code>NaN</code></li>
<li>or both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us try answering couple of questions based on the concepts we have learned so far,</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-think-the-output-is-false-in-all-the-cases-">Why do you think, the output is <code>false</code> in all the cases?</h3>
<pre><code><span>let</span> obj1 = {name: <span>'GreenRoots'</span>};
<span>let</span> obj2 = {name: <span>'GreenRoots'</span>};

obj1 == obj2 
obj1 === obj2 
<span>Object</span>.is(obj1, obj2); 
</code></pre>
<p>It is because, JavaScript has five primitive data types that are <code>passed by value</code>: Boolean, String, Number, null, and undefined.</p>
<p>Rest of the data types are called non-primitives and those are mostly Objects(yes, including Array, Function and Object itself). These non-primitives types are <code>passed by reference</code>.</p>
<p>Hence both obj1 and obj2 above holds the value as the different memory locations that they are created on. Hence the comparison will be <code>false</code> always.</p>
<p>Here is an article that shows the Object reference concepts visual way,</p>

<h3 id="do-you-think-the-object-is-comparison-result-really-matters-over-">Do you think the <code>Object.is</code> comparison result really matters over <code>===</code>?</h3>
<p>Yes it does. React uses <code>Object.is</code> algorithm to compare the state.  Find a great explanation of it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/swlh/using-es6-map-with-react-state-hooks-800b91eedd5f">in this article</a> by Avinash Ega.</p>

<p>Here is a comparison chart with sample values compared using, <code>==</code>, <code>===</code> and <code>Object.is</code>:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Achievement gap is a major problem plaguing education systems in America. It refers to the disparity in academic performance or educational attainment between different groups of students based on socioeconomic status, race, or gender.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a clear difference in schooling and learning opportunities for students based on wealth. There is even a term known as “90-10 gap” – so called because it compares students in the 90th and 10th percentiles of family wealth – and it equals about a 4-year difference in learning (Reardon, 2011).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although efforts are being made to bridge the gap at national and local levels, children from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds are still falling behind their peers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortunately, education technology is helping to close the achievement gap by becoming an ally to teachers. This is not just a gut instinct either – <a href="https://www.thetechedvocate.org/can-digital-equity-close-achievement-gap/">research from Standford University</a> has found that technology can help boost test scores for low-income students when used correctly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This post is going to look at exactly how Edtech can play a significant role in closing the achievement gap in America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Using Edtech the right way – to complement class learning</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technology in the classroom is not a cure-all in itself, its value lies in the way it is used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Low-income schools typically use technology in a “drill and kill” approach, where students are presented with the information they are expected to memorize and are later tested on. The results of this kind of approach are less than favorable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technology is not a replacement for good old classroom tutoring. However, combining technology with teacher training can prove to be very effective.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a case in point, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858416673968">two-year study</a> was conducted in Maine to find the efficiency of using an online homework tool along with classroom learning for seventh graders. The results showed that end-of-year standardized test results were boosted 80% over the anticipated performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further, students who were below the median on the previous year’s state math test gained the equivalent of over two years of learning in a single year. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Self-paced Edtech is good, but it’s better in the hands of the teachers</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Self-paced education technology can be great for students. However, it can actually make the achievement gap worse, because typically high-performing students progress quickly while underperforming students are left behind, as found by a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2013-31551-001/">Duke University study</a>. This is simply counterproductive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A better way to improve results and close the achievement gap is to give teachers effective Edtech tools that empower them to better focus their time and resources. This will allow them to give more attention to students that need more help, which will then make self-paced learning more positive for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Edtech is most effective when it aligns to curriculum</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the biggest concerns among teachers regarding Edtech tools is that often they don’t align with the curriculum set by their school district. So even if the tool is a good learning companion, it is not preparing students for what ultimately matters: the standards tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What teachers need to look out for are Edtech tools that are created with this in mind. Georgia Test Prep is a tool specifically designed to be aligned with <a href="https://georgiatestprep.com/">Georgia school curriculums</a>. It is made in Georgia, by Georgia teachers, especially for Georgia students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While currently Georgia Test Prep is aimed towards parents, we are in the process of developing a solution specifically for the teachers of Georgia that will help them support their students to greatly improve their math and ELA Skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Edtech can make life easier for teachers</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teachers have their plates full at all times. Further burdening them with having to check assessment tests in the digital age is completely unnecessary.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edtech solutions can reduce teacher workload with automated marking and sophisticated reporting. They can help lift the burden of these administrative tasks, thereby freeing up more of their time to spend with their students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember, the results of an Edtech tool for underprivileged students is only as good as the teacher training they receive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The achievement gap in America today is the result of a complex set of multiple factors, and it isn’t going to be bridged overnight. But educators are taking steps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edtech providers are helping in this process too. What they need to do next is to listen to school districts to understand their pain points and curriculum requirements, and modify their offering to cater to individual school district demands. They may need to pay particular attention to the needs of low-income students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edtech has a lot of potential in the digital age to help students from all socioeconomic backgrounds get the help they need to excel. It will take the right application of Edtech to release that potential.</p>

However, it’s easy to be trapped by <a href="https://zepel.io/features/sprints/">sprints</a> and <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/daily-scrum-standup/">daily standup meetings</a>, and assume that your team is agile.</p><p>A siloed organization looks a lot like this:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png" alt="Example structure of siloed teams in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 2064w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example structure of how siloed teams look like</figcaption></figure><p>For most teams, a siloed structure consists of:</p><ul><li>a dedicate team for the app that involves building all the customer-facing functionalities,</li><li>an operations team that’s responsible for infrastructure and security, and sometimes</li><li>internal tools team that builds special tools for internal use.</li></ul><p><strong>The common problems you’ll encounter in this type of team structure are:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>App team vs Operations team:</strong> Both teams can end up becoming frustrated when server allocation becomes a bottleneck for deployment. This is especially common in a fast-growing organization with high customer demand and tight deadlines.<br></li><li><strong>Language barriers:</strong> This can often be seen between all the teams especially if one of them uses a specific language that the other can’t ingest easily. Too much time gets spent on trivial problems and forces teams to employ “<em>workarounds</em>” too often.<br></li><li><strong>Nobody is held accountable for tech debts:</strong> The app team continues to build features as the product manager prioritizes them based on customer requests. But very little importance is given to tech debts and bugs. This hinders the progress of the overall business as the end customer’s experience gets impacted.</li></ol><p><strong>What is the root cause for the problems in a siloed agile team?</strong></p><p>If you look at any organization that has a siloed team structure, you’ll notice the team has a departmental structure. They usually have a set of rigid responsibilities that doesn’t leave any room for cross-functional collaboration.</p><p>This rigid departmental structure can lead to incomplete infrastructure, a steady stream of bugs reported by customers, and functionality gaps that each team thought the other was working on.</p><p>Once your team notices all these problems, they’ll be under immense pressure to perform as quickly as possible because the reported bugs never seem to end. This desire to hit due dates will lead to fewer risks being taken.</p><hr><h2 id="team-structure-2-matrix-teams">Team Structure #2: Matrix Teams</h2><p>As a result of trying to improve the siloed structure, teams end up with a matrix-like team structure.</p><p>This is how a matrix agile team structure looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png" alt="Example of matrix team structure in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 1042w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Example of matrix team structure in agile software development</figcaption></figure><p>This agile teams structure includes:</p><ul><li>Multiple product teams, each with web developers, backend engineers, UI and UX person, and a scrum master.</li><li>A maintenance team that takes ownership of all services in production and ensured all bugs get squished as they came up.</li><li>An operations team that handles all infrastructure related requests.</li></ul><p>In first glance, you’d think this is a step in the right direction. After all, it solves the majority of the problems a siloed team had.</p><p>There’s a separate team in place that takes ownership of all the debts, product teams can move quickly and ship features faster, and developers worked close to each other with shared goals.</p><p><strong>However, there are still some hidden issues you’ll run into with this team structure.</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Getting maintenance team charged up and rally around a common goal becomes harder</strong>. At the end of the day, nobody wants their entire job to be just about the maintenance of someone else’s work.<br></li><li>Since the maintenance team worked on someone else’s work, they will first <strong>have to identify whose work they are fixing</strong> in case they needed help trying to understand the code.<br></li><li>Since everything falls on the maintenance teams in terms of maintaining quality and fixing bugs, it can lead to a <strong>lack of ownership of the quality of code within the product teams</strong>.<br></li><li>With several product teams cranking out one feature after another, <strong>the burden on a single operations team is high</strong>. If not handled carefully, this can lead to infrastructure shortages and higher wait times for product teams to ship.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="team-structure-3-squads-tribes">Team Structure #3: Squads &amp; Tribes</h2><p>You’ve probably heard of the squads and tribe team structure after it was popularized by the folks at Spotify.</p><p>For context, a squad is a group of cross-functional people working together on common product functionality and have one long-term mission. A tribe is a group of squads. If you haven't already, check out their in-depth video about this <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/">over here</a>.</p><p>Here’s how it looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png" alt="Example of Spotify's Squad + Tribe team structure in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png 1327w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Example of Spotify's Squad + Tribe team structure in agile software development</figcaption></figure><p>This model enables each squad and tribe to own their roadmap, their code, and their development process. <strong>Here are some advantages of this model over the others:</strong></p><ul><li>It removes the dependency and the need for a maintenance team. Each squad owns their code from feature request to build, deploy, and bug fixes.</li><li>The need for reporting to multiple members is removed since every member works in close proximity to each other with shared goals.</li><li>The role of operations squad is to enable the squads with relevant tools to self-serve and self-deploy. This allows the teams to ship often and make it a routine.</li><li>Infrastructure alerts and needs can be handled by relevant squads themselves since they’re equipped with all the knowledge already and can resolve issues faster.</li></ul><p>Like a scrum team, this model is focussed on being self-organized. This exposes the major disadvantage with this structure — it assumes collaboration as a core competency in members with little to no oversight.</p><p>Besides, when you don’t give it enough thought and consideration, the Spotify model can quickly become the matrix structure with members reporting to multiple people.</p><hr><h2 id="learning-from-the-mistakes-of-other-agile-team-structures">Learning from the mistakes of other agile team structures</h2><p>Of course, there is no silver bullet. However, you can follow some key principles when it comes to building an agile team and putting together a team structure.</p><p><strong>1. Remove or minimize dependencies between teams</strong></p><p>The more dependencies you have between teams, the more processes you’ll have put in place. The can lead to increased wait times, missed deadlines, and frustrations.</p><p>If you begin to see an increase in dependencies between two teams working on critical functions, you should try to empower the team with tools or even consider combining the teams into a squad or a tribe.</p><p><strong>2. Optimize for understanding instead of processes</strong></p><p>When things go sideways or “<em>it doesn’t feel right</em>”, most teams look to impose rigid processes and optimize every interaction. This comes from the assumption that everyone is an expert when it comes to collaboration.</p><p>Instead, it’s better to optimize for understanding. Every person has a unique way of working and grasp information at different levels. Enabling your team to understand all the information at their disposal and the goal needed to achieve can help your team deliver a higher quality of work.</p><p><strong>3. Alignment is essential if you want to give autonomy</strong></p><p>Every team wants autonomy to work the way they want to. It promotes creativity and enables them to do better work. However, autonomy requires greater alignment towards the priorities. And it requires accountability to delivering value in short increments.</p><p><strong>4. Loosely define roles, but hold them accountable to a goal</strong></p><p>The first instinct for growing teams is to define strict roles &amp; responsibilities. It starts with the goal of holding each member accountable.</p><p>Instead of defining strict roles, define them loosely. Often, strict definition brings rigidity and narrows down the team’s focus on one solution. By loosely defining the role, but holding them accountable, it brings flexibility into how they approach problems. And it can lead to long-term wins.</p><hr><p>Forming an agile software development team structure is hard. Your could be using any <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/">free kanban software</a> or the most <a href="https://zepel.io/solutions/scrum/">sophisticated scrum tool</a>. But without the right team structure that brings together the strengths of your teammates, you'll always end up saying “<em>it doesn't feel right</em>”.</p><p>Of course, you can’t get it right in one shot. You’ll have to experiment a bit, make a few mistakes, and learn a little extra about your team along the way.</p><p>If you’ve been doing this for some time and you’d like to share your knowledge, tweet to us <a href="https://twitter.com/getzepel/">@GetZepel</a>. We’d love to hear your approach!</p>

<p>This JavaScript demo application visualizes in detailed steps, how a text string is encoded into a QR Code barcode symbol. The content of this page essentially explains and justifies how my <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library">QR Code generator library</a> works internally.</p>

<h2>User input</h2>


<h2>QR Code output</h2>

<h2>Step-by-step process</h2>
<p id="show-hide-steps">Show/hide each step: </p>
<section>
	<h3>0. Analyze Unicode characters</h3>
	<p>Number of code points in the input text string: <span id="num-code-points"></span></p>
	<p>Details of each character:</p>
	<table id="character-analysis">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th><abbr title="Index in input string">Index</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="The character itself">Char</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Unicode code point value in hexadecimal">CP hex</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Encodable in numeric mode">NM</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Encodable in alphanumeric mode">AM</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Encodable in byte mode">BM</abbr></th>
				<th><abbr title="Encodable in kanji mode">KM</abbr></th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Can every character be encoded in:</p>
	<table id="character-mode-summary">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Mode</th>
				<th>Encodable</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Chosen segment mode to encode all characters: <span id="chosen-segment-mode"></span></p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>1. Create data segment</h3>
	<p>Convert each character to bits. For numeric and alphanumeric modes, consecutive characters are grouped together before being encoded into bits. For byte mode, a character produces either 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits.</p>
	<table id="data-segment-chars">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Index</th>
				<th>Char</th>
				<th>Values (hex)</th>
				<th>Value</th>
				<th>Combined</th>
				<th>Bits</th>
			</tr>

	<p>The created single segment:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Mode: <span id="segment-mode"></span></li>
		<li>Count: <span id="segment-count"></span></li>
		<li>Data: <span id="segment-data"></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>(This demo program always creates a single segment for simplicity. But it is possible to <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/optimal-text-segmentation-for-qr-codes">segment the text optimally</a> to minimize the total bit length.)</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>2. Fit to version number</h3>
	<p>Total bit length needed to represent the list of segments, depending on version:</p>
	<table id="segment-size">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Range</th>
				<th>Num bits</th>
				<th>Num codewords</th>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Version 27 ~ 40</td>

	</table>
	<p>(Note: A codeword is defined as 8 bits, also known as a byte.)</p>
	<p>QR Code capacity of data codewords per version and error correction level, and whether the data fits:</p>
	<table id="codewords-per-version">

		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Chosen version number: <span id="chosen-version"></span></p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>3. Concatenate segments, add padding, make codewords</h3>
	<p>Join a variety of bit strings together:</p>
	<table id="segment-and-padding-bits">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Item</th>
				<th>Bit data</th>
				<th><abbr title="Number of">Num</abbr> bits</th>
				<th><abbr title="Cumulative number of">Sum</abbr> bits</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The segment mode is always a 4-bit field.</p></li>
		<li><p>The character count’s field width depends on the mode and version.</p></li>
		<li><p>The terminator is normally four “0” bits, but fewer if the data codeword capacity is reached.</p></li>
		<li><p>The bit padding is between zero to seven “0” bits, to fill all unused bits in the last byte.</p></li>
		<li><p>The byte padding consists of alternating hex <span>EC</span> and <span>11</span> until the capacity is reached.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p id="full-bitstream">The entire sequence of data bits: <span></span></p>
	<p>The entire sequence of data codeword bytes (by splitting the bit stream 8 bits at a time) (displayed in hexadecimal): <span id="all-data-codewords"></span></p>

	<h3>4. Split blocks, add ECC, interleave</h3>
	<p>Statistics about all blocks:</p>
	<table id="block-stats">
		<tbody>
			<tr><td>Number of data codewords:      </td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>Number of blocks:              </td><td></td></tr>

			<tr><td>Number of short blocks:        </td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td>Number of long blocks:         </td><td></td></tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Split the sequence of data codewords (green) into short and long blocks; then for each block, compute the ECC codewords (blue) and append them to the end of the block:</p>
	<table id="blocks-and-ecc">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th rowspan="2" colspan="2"></th>
				<th>Block index</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody></tbody>
	</table>
	<p>(Note: The math behind computing the Reed-Solomon error correction codes is omitted because it is long, tedious, and not very interesting.)</p>
	<p>The final sequence of codewords formed by interleaving data/ECC codewords from different blocks: <span id="interleaved-codewords"></span></p>
	<p id="final-bit-sequence">The final sequence of bits to draw in the zig-zag scan: <span></span></p>

	<h3>6. Draw codewords and remainder</h3>
	<p>Compute the zig-zag scan (which starts from the bottom right corner) to visit all unfilled modules (i.e. skipping function modules):</p>
	<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" id="zig-zag-scan"></svg>

<p>If you are someone like me who spends hours and hours a day typing then you
might be interested in investing in learning how to properly type, more
precisely on learning how to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch-type</a>.
My story begins 2 years ago when I saw one person typing so fluently and elegantly with almost no effort, focusing on
the result and not the process that it triggered in me to start noting how
badly I was typing and how badly many others were typing.</p>
<p>The problem is that almost all people are a self-taught typist and everyone
with their technique, this technique is usually correlated with inefficiency,
and sometimes speed. I saw many people typing very fast with only 4 fingers, which
in result makes more noise by jumping from one letter to another very fast but
on that particular keyboard, on another keyboard they would struggle because
the muscle memory doesn’t recognize a different keyboard. And it makes so much
harder improving the speed when not using all of your fingers.</p>
<p>I had the same problem as the majority of people, and I wasn’t recognizing it.
For years I would use 4-6 fingers and always from time to time I would
take a look at the keyboard for a specific character or a letter. The right
hand would type the keys on the left side and opposite. That was my typing
technique.</p>
<p>So I started doing some research and got to know better how touch-typing works.
Luckily the web is full of touch-typing resources and training websites, that
I settled for <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">TypingClub</a>. The website is full of exercises and statistics
on your writing progress in beautiful UI that it satisfies all of my nerdy
requirements, and it’s completely free or supports the services and get some
additional features with as little as 7.50 euros a month.</p>

part was creating a practicing routing and trying to touch-type as much as
possible. That is easier said than done. The beggining was painful, I was slow at
work and I was wasting a lot of my concentration on typing. My fingers were
feeling tired and sometimes in pain, they have never done anything like that.
Changing the muscle memory and rewiring my brain after many years to something
almost unknown was getting into my way.</p>
<p>So I decided to make a switch from an <a href="https://amzn.to/31H9Qgc">Apple keyboard</a> to a mechanical keyboard.
And I got the idea that if I get a keyboard with the blank keycaps I would be
obligated to learn to touch-type and forget about looking at the keyboard. The
idea was promising but also scary for the scenarios like typing a password,
typing with one hand.. so again I did some research! And many people confirmed
my idea and I decided to follow it.</p>
<p>Finding a good keyboard that would last and endure a lot typing was my initial
idea, but there aren’t many keyboards with blank keycaps unless you customize
it. So the list came down to these candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3acp0On">Das Keyboard 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3kBK9WP">Filco Ninja Majestouch-2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2XQ3Mkj">Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB) Professional2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Filco keyboard is a little different than the other two, by having the keycaps
printed on the bottom side instead on top. This would work better in cases like
typing a password or typing anything with one hand. For someone who doesn’t
want to go extreme this is a good solution.</p>
<p>All of these keyboards are exceptionally good, but having already had
experience with MX Cherry switches, I decided to give a try to Topre
switches with an HHKB. It’s more Vim-style orianted by having no arrow keys
with a clean and minimal design.</p>

and the school to deep dive into this. At the begging I was struggling, but
a keyboard like this pushes you to learn a proper fingers placement on the
home row and unlink all the habits of looking down for a key. It took time
and a lot of practice but it paid off. Today I type comfortably on a blank
keyboard with the average speed of 70-90 wpm and I’m still improving. It is
a huge productivity boost.</p>

<p>I didn’t know that my next project will turn into a nudity platform and a home for spammers. But it did happen while I wasn’t paying attention. And here are the details.</p>



<p>For the next 5/10 years, I’ve decided that my mission will be: “<strong>Can a Moroccan build an online business and make a living from Morocco?</strong>“. I currently launch multiple projects and give them some time to take off. My blog <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>, my jobs board <a href="https://okjob.io/">okjob.io</a>, and other projects are all examples of this. The project I’m talking about today, was also serving the same purpose in theory, but it was a flop.</p>



<p>That project is <a href="https://mylink.fyi/">mylink.fyi</a>, a personal and unique link for all your other links. I built it during my weekends given I already have a full-time job and it took me two months approximately. It’s like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">linktree</a> and other competitors, but I tried to make it different. No ads, no logo, a clean interface, a 100% score in performance… My idea was: take a competitor product, remove all features you don’t need, and make it crazy fast. You have a 14 days free trial to test it out, but you need to upgrade your account afterwards.</p>



<p>I launched it in February 2020 with a completely different identity. I took my name, and thus my followers and my authority, out of the equation. <strong>I wanted to replicate “someone starting from scratch” as close as possible</strong>. I did use the service for my links (and <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>‘s links) but I never advertised the service on my personal account. You can see the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mylink-fyi">Product Hunt</a> launch, and the imaginary <a href="https://twitter.com/HamidNekcha">Twitter account</a> I created.</p>



<p>Given how I built the app, I optimized it in a way I’ll only pay hosting fees when the site is having a lot of traffic. Like 1M+ visits per month. So I forgot about it, and kept an eye on the bills I get. Two weeks after launch, I had 100 users. No premium account.</p>



<p>Three months went by with 0$ bills. But in June, I received <strong>my non-zero bill</strong>, it’s exciting the app is taking off! I logged to Firebase (the infrastructure I’m using) and found a total of 1000 users! Wow, that’s a lot.</p>



<p>I took a look at the emails, and quickly saw that something was off. I’ve seen multiple accounts with the same email structure, something like emily123@gmail.com, emily456@gmail.com… I knew something isn’t right given there is a lot of them. So I decided to take a closer look and see the links they are sharing.</p>



<p>That’s when I discovered <strong>they were sharing porn and nudes links</strong>. These links aren’t permitted on social media, so they used mylink.fyi to “shadow” them. For these platforms, they are mylink.fyi links. But once you visit it, you’ll see a link for the banned site. <strong>There were hundreds of accounts doing this</strong>. And new ones get created every day. Once the trial period is over, they create a new email, a new account, and then repeat the same process. Oups!</p>



<p>I decided to remove all my links from the platform given it’s probably known for “porn and nudes” now. I logged to Instagram, and got a weird message: “<strong>Your profile link is not working</strong>“. I didn’t know what that means, but once I visited my profile, I’ve seen I can’t click on the mylink.fyi link. Wow, what’s that? I visited my other profile, and got the same message and the same problem! I later discovered that Instagram banned all mylink.fyi links from the platform. A customer also confirmed to me via email that Snapchat started blocking links. Heh, I’m banned by Instagram and Snapchat! From all scenarios I had in mind, <strong>this is not something I prepared for</strong>.</p>



<p>The first thing I tried is reducing the trial period from 14 days to 5 days. I was hoping I’ll make them stop. But nothing changed, I can’t outplay them. Damn it! Other solutions include: requiring credit cards for trial periods, ban all adult content from the platform… But they all require me to put extra effort in the project. And I don’t have time for that.</p>



<p>I disabled signups on mylink.fyi for now, and after all trials reach their end, I’ll take the service off. If you’re interested in acquiring the domain name, and/or the app, <a href="https://elazzabi.com/contact/">let’s talk</a>.</p>



<p><strong>That’s it for your daily dose of weird Internet anecdotes.</strong></p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Not only is layout shift annoying and a bad user experience, it's now part of Google's Core Web Vitals which will become a ranking factor for Google Search in 2021.</p>
    <p>Lighthouse is a great tool for identifying your Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score, but it's not so great for quickly visualising what's actually changing on a page. The Layout Shift GIF Generator allows you to quickly see which elements are moving around in the viewport and return your CLS metric.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Device Information</h3>
        <p>The tool is able to check both a desktop and a mobile viewport.</p><p><em>- The desktop viewport is a standard 1920x1080 resolution.</em></p>
        <p><em>- The mobile viewport is the Nexus 5X profile from Lighthouse.</em></p>
        <p>Both the CPU and the network are throttled simulating a good 3G network.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Command Line Tool</h3>
    <p>The command line tool can be installed directly from <a href="https://github.com/workeffortwaste/layout-shift-gif">GitHub</a> using NPM.</p>
    <pre>npm install -g workeffortwaste/layout-shift-gif</pre>
    <p>Once installed the tool can be used as per the following example.</p>
    <pre>layout-shift-gif --url https://blacklivesmatter.com/ --device mobile --output layout-shift.gif</pre>
    <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <h3>1.0.0</h3>
    <p>- All the changes.</p>

    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <p>- If there is a lot of vertical movement on a page it can be difficult to discern which elements have shifted.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="django-views-the-right-way">

<p>Welcome to my opinionated guide on how to write views in Django!</p>
<p>It is the result of mistakes made and lessons learned in a range of
Django and Python projects over 15+ years.</p>
<p>It has also been prompted by the fact that “Class Based Views” (CBVs from now
on) seem to have become the default way to teach and learn Django views in some
circles, to the point that some are even scared to write “Function Based Views”
(FBVs).</p>
<p>Perhaps worst of all, some official Django documentation has <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/class-based-views/mixins/">well-intentioned
advise that will help to continue the torture of mixins</a>, but
without actually killing you and putting you out of your misery. (After a bit of
“git blaming” it turns out that I’m <a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/c4c7fbcc0d9264beb931b45969fc0d8d655c4f83">credited</a>
in the commit log for that page. I hate it when that happens…)</p>
<p>So, in view of all this, here I am to save the day, and show you The Right Way
:-)</p>
<p>The essential part of this guide is very short, because FBVs are very easy and
simple. In fact, the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial03/">Django tutorial for views</a> already has all you
need to know. Just read that, and skip the bits about CBVs, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>But if you want a different take on the same things, this guide might be for
you. I’ve also added extra bits for common tasks and patterns in FBVs for which
CBVs are often suggested as the solution. I have a few aims:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I want to show how simple and easy views can be.</p></li>
<li><p>I want you to be freed from learning a whole stack of additional APIs that
were only making your life harder (and teaching you bad patterns).</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of learning a bunch of Django specific APIs, I want to cover much more
transferable knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HTTP principles</p></li>
<li><p>General OOP/multi-paradigm programming principles</p></li>
<li><p>General Python techniques</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are some other goodies along the way, like how to type-check all the
URL parameters to your view functions.</p>
<p>Each page is composed of <strong>two parts</strong>, which have <strong>two different audiences</strong>.</p>
<p>First, the business — the <strong>what and how</strong>: a short, definitive guide to The
Right Way. As a less experienced developer, either in general or in terms of
knowledge of Django, this part is all you need. Since this guide is not intended
to be reference documentation, I’ll include various links to the official Django
reference docs. All example code can be found in full in the <a href="https://github.com/spookylukey/django-views-the-right-way/tree/master/code">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Second, discussion — the <strong>why</strong>: a longer, in-depth explanation of why everyone
else who tells you differently is wrong :-). It’s targeted at slightly more
experienced developers, and especially those who are responsible for teaching
other people, or making decisions about the patterns used in a code base. These
discussion sections are really about general programming principles, and how
they apply in Python and Django.</p>
<p>So let’s go!</p>

<p>Something missing? This guide is a <strong>work in progress</strong>, and no matter how much
I add it probably always will be! If you have requests for things to include,
you could file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/spookylukey/django-views-the-right-way">GitHub</a>.</p>
</div><div id="caveats-and-disclaimers-etc">

<ol>
<li><p>Yes, there may in fact be more than one Right Way. But not in this guide!</p></li>
<li><p>I’m assuming you are writing a ‘classic’ web app or web site — in which
most of your pages are server-side rendered HTML, with perhaps some Javascript
loaded onto those pages, as opposed to a site where your server mostly sends
data (e.g. JSON) to a client-side Javascript web app that puts the pages together.</p></li>
<li><p>My comments mainly apply to the CBVs that come with Django. Specifically,
many of my criticisms don’t apply to Django Rest Framework, the Django admin
(which uses a form of CBV), and possibly other implementations. See later
discussion on this.</p></li>
<li><p>Although I’m a Django core dev, I’m not speaking for all the Django
developers. I was actually around when CBVs were first being added to Django,
and even involved in the design of them a bit, and at the time didn’t see the
things I’m expressing now. So please understand my criticisms as a form of
“learning process debate”, rather than as attacks!</p></li>

August 11, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/urql-graphql-client/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/urql-graphql-client/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Universal React Query Library (URQL) is a highly customizable GraphQL client, exposed as a set of React components by <a href="https://formidable.com/">Formidable</a>, aiming to become a lightweight alternative that would uphold the principal values of the GraphQL protocol &amp; SDL.</p>
<p>Currently, the most popular client libraries come with large API footprints. URQL’s  main goal is to simplify some of the most popular aspects arising when using GraphQL by providing:</p>
<h3>1. The Declarative Queries</h3>
<p>URQL Client internally manages the lifetime and updates for query &amp; mutation operations in the background:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a cache invalidates their results you may receive updated data,</li>
<li>when your app stops being interested in results URQL will teardown the operation (it will stop requesting new data, stop updating results)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. The abstracted caching</h3>
<p>Caching is handled &amp; customizable with so-called Exchanges. The default <code>cacheExchange</code> offers basic cache implementation that will avoid sending the same requests to a GraphQL API repeatedly by caching the result of each query. For more complex cases containing data interdependencies, URQL offers normalized caching provided by <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/tree/main/exchanges/graphcache"><code>@urql/exchange-graphcache</code></a> package.</p>
<h3>3. The central point of extensibility and integration with GraphQL API</h3>
<p>URQL provides <code>Exchanges</code> to abstract how the Client interacts with frameworks, GraphQL API, or your app. URQL’s  <code>Exchanges</code> have access to all operations and all results (the concept is very similar to middlewares in Redux). The core package’s default behaviors are implemented using Exchanges as both operations as their results are treated as a stream of events:</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Built to be easy to use</strong> -  URQL prioritizes usability and adaptability aiming to be the first-choice pick for both, newcomers as well as GraphQL power-users,</li>
<li><strong>Performant and functional</strong> - Lightweight &amp; powerful GraphQL client, easy to use with React, Preact, and Svelte, makes URQL a great alternative to other bulky GraphQL clients.</li>
<li><strong>Logical default behavior and caching</strong> - URQL enables you to use GraphQL in your apps out of the box without complex configurations, large API overhead, and all that fuss.</li>
<li><strong>Easily extensible</strong> - one of the most interesting concepts presented in URQL are <em>Exchanges</em>. They are a kind of middleware that will help you change how you fetch, cache, or subscribe to data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>The method <code>createClient</code> creates the GraphQL client which requires providing API’s URL as a bare minimum. This Client will manage all your operations. To make it work in React &amp; Preact provide it via the Context API with the help of the <code>Provider</code> export.</p>
<div data-language="react"><pre><code>import { createClient, Provider } from 'urql';
const client = createClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql',
});
const App = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Provider value={client}&gt;
    &lt;YourRoutes /&gt;
  &lt;/Provider&gt;
);</code></pre></div>

<p>Statistics and charts can be tricky and they are often used to push a certain point-of-view. However, with some critical thinking and basic school-level mathematics, we are all capable of understanding what the data means. We do not need to be scientists, mathematicians or subject-matter experts to come to sensible and informed conclusions.</p>
<p>Let’s strip away the frightening news headlines and look at what the evidence shows us.</p>
<h2>Table of contents</h2>

<div><div>
<h2 id="key-facts">Five key facts</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/dr-scott-atlas/">Dr. Scott W.&nbsp;Atlas</a>, we now have enough data to be sure of five key facts about COVID-19:</p>
<ol><li>The overwhelming majority of people do not have any significant risk of dying from COVID-19.</li><li>Protecting older, at-risk people eliminates hospital overcrowding.</li><li>Vital population immunity is prevented by total isolation policies, prolonging the problem.</li><li>People are dying because other medical care is not getting done due to hypothetical projections.</li><li>We have a clearly defined population at risk who can be protected with targeted measures.</li></ol>
</div></div>
<p><em><a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/dr-scott-atlas/">Dr. Scott Atlas</a> is the David and Joan Traitel Senior Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution and the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center.</em></p>
<div><div>
<h2 id="mostly-harmless">Harmless to most people</h2>
<p>Public Health England, on their <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/covid-19-is-no-longer-considered-a-high-consequence-infectious-disease-public-health-england/">21 March 2020 update</a> for High consequence infectious diseases (HCID), stated, <em>“As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease in the UK.”</em> If COVID-19 is not a high consequence infectious disease, why was the UK thrown into uncharted territory without debate?</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Nevertheless, despite spending weeks on lock-down; after destroying our economy and businesses; after causing mass unemployment; after inflicting unimaginable suffering to the entire nation, the UK Government again admitted that coronavirus is completely harmless to most people.</p>
<p>On the 11 May 2020 Downing Street Press Briefing, the UK’s Chief Medical Officer, <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/professor-chris-whitty/">Professor Chris Whitty</a>, confirmed:</p>
<p><em>“Most people will not get this virus at all. Of those who get symptoms, the vast majority will have a mild or moderate disease. The great majority of people, even in the highest risk groups, will not die.”</em></p>

<h3 id="infection-fatality-rate">Infection fatality rate</h3>
<p>Multiple studies have found that COVID-19 has an infection <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/mortality-rate/">fatality rate</a> of between 0.02% and 0.8%.</p>
<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate#Terminology" target="_blank">infection fatality rate</a> (IFR) is an estimated death rate in all those who have been infected with a disease. This includes those who have been found to be infected (called ‘cases’), as well as those who were undetected, either because they have not been tested or are not showing symptoms.</p>
<p>The <em>case fatality rate</em>, on the other hand, is the measure of deaths among <em>diagnosed</em> cases. The <em>mortality rate</em> is the number of deaths in a specific population, such as the population of the United Kingdom, over a period of time.</p>
<p>The IFR tends to give a better overall mortality for non-experts and therefore is <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-published-research-data-on-covid-19-infection-fatality-rates-medrxiv/">increasingly being used</a> by policy-makers.</p>
<h2 id="covid19-flu">Comparison with flu</h2>
<p>During the start of the <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/hysteria/">COVID-19 panic</a>, we constantly heard the media and politicians saying that <a href="#inproportion">comparing</a> COVID-19 with <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/influenza/">flu</a> is irresponsible. Apparently, COVID-19 is so deadly and spreads so quickly that governments needed to impose <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/at-stake/#civil-liberties">unprecedented control</a> over society in order to fight it.</p>
<p>In contrast, this is what epidemiologists, microbiologists and researchers have been telling us:</p>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul><li>We should tackle COVID-19 just as we currently do with <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/influenza/">seasonal influenza</a>. Sick people should stay at home, the vulnerable should be protected but the healthy should get on with their lives as normal.</li><li>COVID-19 is deadly for vulnerable people but anyone at risk from COVID-19 is also at serious risk from flu. Even the common cold may have a <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/mortality-rate/">death rate</a> as high <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/studies-show-6-death-rates-from-common-cold-in-risk-groups-nih/">as 6% in risk groups</a>. </li><li>In some countries COVID-19 may have a lower <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/mortality-rate/">mortality rate</a> than flu.</li><li>Cases for COVID-19 are not increasing exponentially. Instead, we are seeing an ‘explosion in <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/testing/">testing</a>‘ for COVID-19.</li><li>The <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/statistics/">high death rates</a> in some countries are due counterproductive <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/treatment/">treatment methods</a>, such as intubation and the use of steroids.</li><li>Some level of social distancing is helpful but a general lock-down and house arrest of the entire population will prove to be a disaster.</li></ul>
</div></div>
<p>Here is what no-one, even officially approved mainstream sources, appears to dispute: <strong><em>in at least 80% cases, the virus produces either no symptoms or a mild cold-like illness</em></strong>.</p>
<div><div>
<h2 id="lockdown">Flawed evidence for lock-down</h2>
<p>Countries have taken different approaches and there is <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/lockdown/">no evidence that lockdowns</a> have reduced COVID-19 deaths. Inaccurate testing and inconsistent reporting methods is a big problem. We also have no evidence that <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/at-stake/#nhs">our NHS</a> would have faced any greater strain when compared to previous flu seasons. In fact, the medical systems of most countries are stretched every flu season.</p>
<p>In the UK, we are told that a lock-down is needed to ‘flatten the curve’. This was based on unfounded assumptions and <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/imperial-college/">flawed Imperial College models</a> that predicted half a million deaths from COVID-19. The report that lead to the lock-down was retracted days after release, with the number scaled down first to 20,000 and then to just over 6,000. <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/professor-neil-ferguson">Professor Neil Ferguson</a>, the author of the report, has a <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/neil-ferguson-the-scientist-who-convinced-boris-johnson-of-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-criticised-in-past-for-flawed-research-the-telegraph/">track record of failed predictions</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the lockdown was still enforced. Our entire county has been shut down, millions have been made <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/at-stake/#economy">unemployed and businesses are ruined</a> due to flawed models and bad advice.</p>
<h3 id="nonlockdown-lockdown">Non-lockdown vs Lockdown</h3>
<p>The graph below, from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/" target="_blank">UK Column</a> news, compares the deaths and cases, between non-lockdown (left) and lockdown (right) countries. A similar chart compares non-lockdown (left) and lockdown (right) states in the US.</p>
<p>We can see that in general, areas that have implemented lockdown have higher death rates.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> These charts are outdated. The death numbers have changed and Mexico moved into lockdown after the chart was compiled (see visitor comment <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/evidence/#comment-63">16 May 2020</a>). They have been left to illustrate the differences between lockdown and non-lockdown areas around April. However, we will update the charts when new versions are available. </em></p>

Morgan</a> Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy, released around 20 May 2020, supports the argument that lockdowns did not help stop the spread of the virus. The<em> J.P. Morgan figure 1</em> chart shows that many US states saw a lower rate of transmission after lockdowns were ended. <em>J.P. Morgan figure 2</em> shows that most countries saw their infection rates fall after lockdown.</p>
<h3 id="lockdown-deaths">Deaths caused by the lockdown</h3>
<p>Alistair Haimes, a data professional who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thecritic.co.uk/author/alistair-haimes/" target="_blank">writes for The Critic</a>, posted the chart below showing weekly deaths at home registered with the Office for National Statistics. The majority of these do not have COVID-19 mentioned in the death certificate. It shows a disproportionate number of deaths at home over the 5-year average, indicating that these are likely to have been <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/collateral-damage/">caused by the lockdown</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, the InProportion2 project released the following chart showing the proportion of weekly deaths due to COVID-19 in the context of total deaths during the 1999/2000 flu season. The blue bars show the 2020 lockdown deaths <em>not attributed to COVID-19</em>. Interestingly, the <em>fewer</em> people died during the April 2020 peak than in January 2000.</p>

<h3 id="flawed-modelling-code">Buggy modelling code</h3>
<p>Code reviews of the <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/imperial-college/">Imperial College modelling software</a> written by <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/professor-neil-ferguson">Professor Ferguson</a> began to appear in early May 2020. The <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/code-review+imperial-college+errors/">comments from professional programmers were scathing</a>. They found it badly written, full of bugs and produced random results. One reviewer went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“This Ferguson Model is such a joke it is either an outright fraud, or it is the most inept piece of programming I may have ever seen in my life.”</em></p><cite><a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/i-have-reviewed-fergusons-code-its-a-joke/">Martin Armstrong</a>, 8 May 2020</cite></blockquote>
<p>There is only one reasonable conclusion we can draw from both the lockdown’s results and the code reviews: the British Government’s decision to lock down the country was based on bogus numbers.</p>

<p><em>Social distancing</em> is a term that has recently gained popularity as the main way to defeat COVID-19. It includes measures ranging from spaced queues at the supermarket to complete lockdown of cities and countries. In this context, we do not equate social distancing with the <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/pandemics/">historically proven</a> practice of protecting vulnerable people from flu-like viruses by isolating them from risk.</p>
<p>What is the scientific rationale for COVID-19 style social distancing?</p>
</div></div>

<div>
<p><a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/no-scientific-proof-social-distancing-prevents-spread-of-covid-19-professor-joel-hay-usc/">According to Professor Joel Hay</a>, PhD Health Economist at University of Southern California, there is no scientific proof that <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/social-distancing/">social distancing</a> prevents the spread of coronavirus. He advocates that we should “do what we always do”: isolate the frail and sick but don’t isolate the young and healthy. According to Professor Hay, <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/herd-immunity/">herd immunity</a> is how we’ve solved the problem in the past. Social distancing is destroying millions of lives and killing more people than it saves.</p>

<h3 id="two-metre-rule">Two metre rule</h3>
<p>The social distancing rules adopted by different countries is arbitrary and has no scientific basis. Different countries use different rules ranging from the <a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/who/">WHO</a>‘s recommended three feet (just under one metre) in Sweden and Austria, 1.5 metres in Germany and The Netherlands, to two metres in the UK and US.</p>
<p>Robert Dingwall from the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) said Britain’s two meter rule was ‘<a href="https://evidencenotfear.com/government-adviser-says-social-distancing-rule-guidelines-on-keeping-apart-was-conjured-out-of-nowhere-daily-mail/">conjured up out of nowhere</a>’ because the government didn’t trust the public to keep 1 metre apart.

August 11, 2020 | https://blog.liteflow.com/2020/08/11/how-to-create-todo-list-apps/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.liteflow.com/2020/08/11/how-to-create-todo-list-apps/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">#</a> Introduction</h2> <p>To-do list apps are typical examples of applications to learn a new framework or a new tool. They are a great way to learn something new without focusing on a complicated use case, yet having something interesting enough for people to start a real project. This tutorial will follow the long list of tutorials that you can find <a href="http://todomvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and focus on the synchronization of data with a Liteflow <a href="https://blog.liteflow.com/_posts/en/2020-08-05-reactive-database-feature.html">database</a>, <a href="https://blog.liteflow.com/_posts/en/2020-05-22-http-endpoint-trigger-feature.html">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://blog.liteflow.com/_posts/en/2020-07-24-email-feature.html">email</a> service.</p> <p>Our to-do list app will have multiple features. At the end of this tutorial, we will be able to visualize our to-dos, edit them, and delete them. All of this synchronized on a server without having to maintain any Backend application using Liteflow.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.liteflow.com/assets/img/todo.411d20c9.png" alt="To-do App"></p> <h2 id="create-the-ui-and-the-interactions-of-the-to-do-list-app"><a href="#create-the-ui-and-the-interactions-of-the-to-do-list-app">#</a> Create the UI and the interactions of the to-do list app</h2> <p>For this step, I will reuse an existing to-do application frontend and will use the one using <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/todomvc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vuejs</a>.</p> <p>First, create the following <code>index.html</code> file containing the user interface (UI) and the interactions for our application (e.g., create a to-do, mark a to-do as done/undone, remove a to-do).</p> <p>You can now open your <code>index.html</code> file in your browser to visualize your to-do list app.</p> <p>To add features in our application, we will create processes. These processes handle your application's business logic and can be used as an API or connected to any service's event.</p> <p>We will add 5 features in our application:</p> <ul><li><a href="#add-a-todo">Add a todo</a></li> <li><a href="#list-the-todos">List the todos</a></li> <li><a href="#update-a-todo">Update a todo</a> (mark is as done/undone)</li> <li><a href="#delete-a-todo">Delete a todo</a></li> <li><a href="#notify-when-a-todo-is-done">Notify when a todo is done</a></li></ul> <h2 id="add-a-to-do"><a href="#add-a-to-do">#</a> Add a to-do</h2> <p>The first feature we will implement is to add a new to-do and create an API for this creation of to-do using a process. For that, we are using the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/http.html#request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP request</a> trigger and the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Database create</a> task.</p> <p>The data are stored in the <code>todos</code> collection based on the data sent over the API.</p> <p>Let's create a <code>create.yml</code> file with the following:</p> <p>Then we can deploy this process using the <code>liteflow deploy</code> command. It will generate a unique endpoint to trigger this process that the to-do will use.</p> <p>Once this process is deployed, you can update your <code>index.html</code> file by updating the <code>addTodo</code> function (line 60) with the following code:</p> <p>The <code>addTodo</code> function now saves a new to-do in the database by triggering the process <code>create-todo</code> with an HTTP POST request.</p> <p>You can now create to-dos and visualize them directly in the <a href="https://console.liteflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database page</a> of your project on the console.</p> <h2 id="list-the-to-dos"><a href="#list-the-to-dos">#</a> List the to-dos</h2> <p>Your application accepts to publish new to-dos, but when you refresh the page, everything is gone. This is because it doesn't get the to-dos when the application loads. Let's fix this by creating a process that will query the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database</a> and return the list of to-dos in the collection <code>todos</code>.</p> <p>Create a new file <code>fetch-todos.yml</code> with the following content:</p> <p>Deploy the process using the command <code>liteflow deploy</code> to get the endpoint for this process.</p> <p>Then, update the <code>fetch</code> method to get the data and populate the to-dos in the application.</p> <p>Refresh your application. All your to-dos should be loaded and you can still add new to-dos.</p> <h2 id="update-a-to-do"><a href="#update-a-to-do">#</a> Update a to-do</h2> <p>We now need a way to update our to-dos. We can apply the same principle as the <code>create-todo</code> process, but this time with the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database update</a> task.</p> <p>Create a new file <code>update-todo.yml</code> with the following content:</p> <p>Deploy the process using the command <code>liteflow deploy</code> to get the endpoint for this process.</p> <p>You can then update your <code>updateTodoStatus</code> function with the endpoint given while deploying your process.</p> <h2 id="delete-a-to-do"><a href="#delete-a-to-do">#</a> Delete a to-do</h2> <p>Let's create our last feature accessible via the UI, deleting a to-do.
Sometime when a to-do is done or was created by mistake, we need a way to delete it. We again apply the same principle using this time the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#delete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Database delete</a> task.</p> <p>Create a new file <code>delete-todo.yml</code> with the following content:</p> <p>Deploy the process using the command <code>liteflow deploy</code> to get the endpoint for this process.</p> <p>And, finally, update our <code>removeTodo</code> function with the endpoint created while deploying.</p> <p>Congratulation, now your application is fully functional with your UI, and all your data are stored in a private database with custom APIs to access it.</p> <h2 id="notify-when-a-to-do-is-done"><a href="#notify-when-a-to-do-is-done">#</a> Notify when a to-do is done</h2> <p>Let's now implement a notification when a to-do is done. We want to send an email to an email address every time a to-do is marked as done.</p> <p>To do that, we can use the Database feature to react to any changes in the data using the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/database.html#onupdated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>onUpdated</code></a> event.</p> <p>The process will do the following:
Every time a data is updated, filter to keep only the item from the <code>todo</code> collection, and the value of <code>completed</code> is <code>true</code>. Then, send an email using the <a href="https://docs.liteflow.com/services/email.html#send" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email send</a> task.</p> <p>Create a new file <code>notify-todo.yml</code> with the following content (don't forget to replace <code>__REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL__</code> with your email):</p> <p>You can now deploy this process and mark a to-do as done. After a few seconds, you should receive an email notifying you that a task has just been completed.</p> <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h2> <p>In this tutorial, we have seen the following things:</p> <ul><li><strong>How to store, query, update and delete data without having to set up any database</strong></li> <li><strong>How to create APIs to access these data without having to create any server</strong></li> <li><strong>How to connect our frontend to these APIs</strong></li> <li><strong>How to run background jobs that react to the database to send email without setting up any email provider</strong></li></ul> <p><em>Of course, this is a basic example of what you can do in the context of to-do list apps, but you can build anything you want using these features.</em></p> <p>We would love to hear your feedback regarding this tutorial, and your experience with the creation of your to-do list app with Liteflow. Don't hesitate to share it with us in the comment section below.</p> <h3 id="bonus"><a href="#bonus">#</a> Bonus</h3> <p>Did you know that you can also <strong>deploy in one click</strong> your to-do list app on Liteflow in just a few seconds?

<h2>UPDATE</h2>



<p>It has been brought to my attention that there was a mistake by an entry level employee. </p>



<p>So the Revenue Department itself was supposed to get all the NOCs required by going to all those offices, but an entry level employee forgot to add my file to the list of NA’s to be done.</p>



<p>So now I have been told that all the NOC’s will be taken care of by the Revenue Department, Collector Office. </p>



<p>If any legal fees need to be paid, I will be informed by the Collector office (without me requiring to go to every office) and everything will be done in less than 2 months.</p>



<p>I am thankful to everyone for sharing my experience far and wide. But now my experience stands cleared and so does this post. </p>



<p>A lot of people have helped reach this post to very very high-in-the-hierarchy people in the state and central government as well as major national political parties. I am really very thankful to everyone.</p>



<p>I will try again in a few months and keep surveying the experience of people who get their NA done. Thank you again for all the co-operation.</p>



<p>I am also writing a post about “the real process required to obtain the NA permission”. I will try to get the higher authorities from the Collector office to record a video stating the actual procedure required and will publish such article soon.</p>



<p>Again Thank You Very Much.</p>



<p>I have removed the original post. I will update with next steps soon. </p>

            <!-- content --><p>In 2020, Arm is making rapid advancements in the server space well beyond what we have seen in recent years. Aside from the obvious hardware advancements (which we will get into later in this article), the biggest piece of the puzzle here is arguably the software ecosystem maturity. Many workloads can now more or less seamlessly transition from running on traditional x86 hardware to running on Armv8 metal. In this article, we are going to explore the Arm opportunity at cloud service providers or CSPs.<span id="more-45868"></span></p>
<p><em>Note on naming conventions: throughout this article, we will use x86 as a shorthand for x86_64, which is also known as amd64. In this context, it means traditional, Intel-compatible hardware. Armv8 stands for the – relatively – new Arm architecture, outed by Arm Holdings in 2011, and also capable of 64-bit memory addressing. Armv8 is also sometimes known as AArch64 or arm64. We need to keep things simple and standardize.</em></p>
<h2>Arm software ecosystem maturity</h2>
<p>Hardware and software engineers often see their jobs as different, but in order to bring about new architecture, better software means better investment in hardware and better hardware means more are willing to invest in software. Having an Arm server hardware discussion necessarily means that we need to discuss the software side. Indeed, that has been perhaps the most visible area of advancement over the past half-decade.</p>
<p>Arm’s software ecosystem has not hit an x86 level of maturity despite what many of its promoters argue. In many cases there may still be a bit a software engineering required, like tweaking compilation flags or container configuration files. In turn, these small tweaks often mean incremental testing effort. As a result, swapping from x86 to Arm has a switching cost. It may be a small cost, but the swap is usually non-zero. While closed source software is another story, open-source software underpinning popular workloads at CSPs, is rapidly gaining maturity. For example nginx a popular web server has done a great job developing its Arm solution.</p>

<p>Armv8 software maturity has come a long way in the last few years. All popular Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora, Centos, and OpenSUSE now offer an Armv8 spin just as naturally as they offer a traditional x86 spin. This was not the case a few years ago. We have already covered this topic <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/arm-neoverse-n-e-tech-day/">in February of last year</a> when Arm launched its Neoverse line of server CPU cores. Other vendors are moving this direction as well as we are seen even legacy platforms such as <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/vmware-esxi-64-bit-arm-support-announced/">VMware ESXi venture to 64-bit Arm support</a>.</p>
<p>A second very important milestone in the Arm software ecosystem came last year when NVIDIA <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-announces-arm-support-for-gpu-accelerated-computing/">announced</a> support for CUDA-on-Arm at SC19. This was essentially a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-cuda-on-arm-becoming-a-reality/">very potent signal</a> sent to all the industry that Armv8 was soon to be considered on par with x86 for running GPU-accelerated workloads. AI is a pioneering workload, in the field. NVIDIA offering its full AI stack on Arm to build parity with x86 is a big deal since it is an offering for the future of compute, not the past.</p>
<h2>New Armv8 hardware changes the game</h2>
<p>Even though having software that ‘just works’ is essential, one also needs hardware. And in this regard, the Arm world certainly does not disappoint and is as vibrant as ever. Three main actors stand out: Ampere Computing, Marvell, and Amazon’s AWS. (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/huawei-kunpeng-920-64-core-arm-server-cpu/">Huawei</a> in China as well, although we are going to set that aside for now.) You will of course immediately note that if the first two are CPU vendors, the third one is a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) or a traditional Intel Xeon customer.</p>
<p>Ampere Computing has already had its 7nm <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-80-arm-cores-for-cloud/">Altra</a> sampling for a few months now. As a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-q80-30-in-action-at-ampere-hq/">reminder</a>, it is certainly a solid 2P capable offering on paper, with up to 80 <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/arm-neoverse-n-e-tech-day/">N1 cores</a> at up to 3.3Ghz, 8 DDR4-3200 channels, and 128 PCIe Gen4 lanes (192 in a 2P configuration), all for a TDP of up to 250W. Ampere Computing has already announced next year’s follow up, the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-max-targets-a-128-core-arm-cpu-shipping-in-2021/">Altra Max</a>, which stays on 7nm and pushes the core count to 128. 2022 will see the company outing its 5nm Siryn follow-up.</p>

<p>Marvell, for its part, finalized its acquisition of Cavium in 2018, has arguably been the first Arm CPU vendor to properly enter the data center market, and we have covered the ThunderX2 <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx2-review-benchmarks-real-arm-server-option/">extensively</a> since its 2018 launch and the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx-micro-benchmarks-enterprise-arm-developers-need-machines/">ThunderX</a> before it. Marvell’s counterpart to the Ampere Altra is the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/marvell-thunderx3-arm-server-cpu-with-768-threads-in-2020/">ThunderX3</a>, to become available this year. It is also a 2P capable 7nm part with eight DDR4-3200 channels but limited to 64 PCIe Gen 4 lanes per CPU (128 in a 2P configuration.) Where it differs greatly from Ampere’s offering is in the choices of CPU cores. Instead of going for “off the shelf” Arm N1 cores, Marvell is using custom Arm cores, offering 4-way Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT). The ThunderX3 will be offered with up to 96 cores (and thus 384 threads) per socket. This is a big differentiating point for Marvell. Just like everyone else, Marvell has a roadmap, and a ThunderX4 is slated for 2022. It will likely be a 5nm part.</p>

<p>And then there is Amazon. Having bought the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/exclusive-gigabyte-annapurna-labs-arm-storage-server-benchmarks/">Anapurna Labs</a> CPU design house in 2015, and after testing the waters with a first-generation <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/putting-aws-graviton-its-arm-cpu-performance-in-context/">Graviton</a> at the end of 2018 (and selling its Arm chips for applications such as <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ubiquiti-unifi-usw-leaf-overview-not-review-48x-25gbe-6x-100gbe-switch/">switches</a>), Amazon announced the general availability of its <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/aws-graviton2-64-core-arm-cpu-heightens-war-of-intel-betrayal/">Graviton2 based instances</a> in March of 2020. Just like the Ampere Altra, the Gaviton2 is also a Neoverse N1 based design, manufactured at 7nm. It is a single socket design, offering 64 cores, 8 DDR4-3200 channels, and 64 PCIe Gen 4 lanes. The fact that AWS decided to build its own CPUs is important because a traditional Xeon/ x86 customer is now taking that in house. It also allows software development to happen at a more rapid pace by showing strong backing for Arm infrastructure, offering it to a wide array of customers. The industry is changing, and long gone are the days when only hardware vendors could decide its fate.</p>

<p>(1)&nbsp; Ampere’s <a href="https://amperecomputing.com/altra/">documentation</a> calls this “sustained turbo”, but presumably this can be treated as a kind of base clock, as all cores should be able to sustain said clock while fully loaded. To be confirmed in STH testing.</p>
<p>(2) These specifications are to be confirmed as the chips become commercially available and may change as the parts transform into shipping products.</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, a few things come to mind. First of all, the industry as a whole seems to be settling on a few “standard” specifications. Each of these three chips comes equipped with a memory controller supporting eight channels of DDR4, just like AMD’s EPYC line and Intel’s upcoming 10nm <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake</a> Xeon line. Likewise, 250W+ seems to be to the new upper bound for acceptable maximum TDP per socket. A quick look at AMD’s and Intel’s 2020 shipping and roadmap offerings confirms this. Arm chips are looking to keep core counts high and TDPs low.</p>

<p>Amazon designed the Graviton only for internal use, it is a simpler design focused on 1P operation. Note that Ampere Computing and Marvell opted for different solutions enabling 2P operation: Ampere uses 32 (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cxl-may-have-just-won-as-amd-joins-cxl/">CCIX</a> enabled) PCIe Gen4 lanes per processor to enable communications between the two sockets, whereas Marvell uses a dedicated interface. Enabling 2P operation complicates the design quite a bit, and as it does not have to cater to any CPU buyer’s needs but its own, Amazon went for simplicity here. This may of course change with a future generation. It also, in some ways, validates AMD’s vision for single-socket EPYC.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to explore this decision of off-the-shelf or custom Arm CPU cores.</p>

<p>GitHub pages are a great place to host the Demos and Personal Sites. But, often, you need to publish it by yourself.</p><p>Github Actions is a new Continuous Integration and Deployment solution from Github.</p><p>You can use GitHub Actions to deploy to GitHub pages on different events like</p><ul><li>Push to the main branch</li><li>New Release created</li><li>etc</li></ul><hr><p>Let's take React app for an example.</p><p>Let's make a simple app with Create React App to list latest posts from dev.to</p><p>The main idea is of having a GitHub Action to build the app and deploy on GitHub pages.</p><p>Let's initialize new app with CRA and add a new component named <code>Posts</code> and <code>Post</code></p><pre><code>npx create-react-app dev-news

cd dev-news # change dir to dev-news

mkdir src/components # create components dir in src

touch src/components/Posts.js \
 src/components/Post.js # create Posts.js &amp; Post.js Files

code . # open VSCode</code></pre><p>And following are the components to show the list of the posts; I’m putting some barebones of the Component code:</p><pre><code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
const devTo = 'https://dev.to/api/articles'

const Post = ({post}) =&gt; (
  &lt;a href={post.url} key={post.id} className="post"&gt;
    &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;img src={post.social_image} alt={post.title} /&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{post.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{post.description}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
)

const Posts = () =&gt; {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([])
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    fetch(devTo).then(r=&gt; r.json()).then(setPosts)
  }, [])

  return posts.map(post =&gt; &lt;Post post={post} /&gt;)
}

export default Posts
</code></pre><p>And it will look like the following</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/time2hack/image/upload/q_auto:good,f_auto/dev.to-posts.png" alt="dev.to-posts"></figure><p>Now, we will deploy above on the GitHub pages.

git add . # stage all changes
git commit -m "🚀 init" # commit the staged changes

git remote add origin <a href="https://time2hack.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="25424c5165424c514d50470b464a48">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:time2hack/dev.to.git
git push -u origin master # push master to the origin
</code></pre><p>Now let’s make a directory with the name <code>.github</code> and <code>workflows</code> inside <code>.github</code>.</p><p>Inside the <code>workflows</code> directory, we can create workflows which will run the GitHub actions.</p><p>As we want to publish to GitHub pages, we will name our workflow file <code>publish.yaml</code></p><p>Now in this file, we need to write some actions/commands that need to run in specific order to publish on the GitHub pages</p><p>Following will be the contents of our <code>publish.yaml</code> file:</p><pre><code>name: github-pages

	<div>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There is a lot of praise for weekly reviews. There is noticeably less doing of weekly reviews, even among the people doing the praising. It’s a very hard habit to keep up. We could spend a lot of time diving into why that is and how to fix it in a systematic way… or I could tell you how I use <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">PredictionBook</a> to get many of the promised benefits of weekly reviews without any willpower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a nutshell, when I find myself making a choice about how to spend time or money that’s dependent on some expectation, I write out the expectation as a prediction (with % likelihood) in PredictionBook, which then automatically prompts me to evaluate the prediction at a date I set. This has so many benefits I’m struggling to figure out where to start. If I had to sum them up in a phrase, it would be “more contact with reality”. But to expand on that…</p>

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Q0ozB77P5ESZiGHUbcOOwEKmLkOnfe6DrHZJsRiJyWH8izn9qVWP2qO1dqem9SQO5si1RFMZ8UjhfGFKSqJkg8zcjvuo4g5_agcJ9Z610wSw-8WxabmUknYTMaXcEylDiS9WJL3Z" width="286" height="190"><figcaption>What contact with reality may look like</figcaption></figure>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Making the prediction forces me to assess my anticipated outcomes and do an expected value calculation. This in turn forces me to be explicit about what I value, and how I will know if I got it. It also makes it explicit when I’m doing something because I expect the median or modal outcome to be good, vs. when I’m doing it for the long tail of unlikely but super good outcomes. It also gives me a chance to say “huh, that EV is not competitive” and do something else.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Evaluating the prompt gives me more information on how my plans are working out. <a href="https://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/159979927467/satisfaction-and-progress-in-open-ended-work">Andy Matuschak</a> talks about the dilemma of knowledge work, where you can’t make a plan for success but leaving things open ended often leads nowhere. His solution to this is to give himself unstructured time, but then look back and see if it worked out the way he wanted, and if it didn’t, do something different next time. Predictions provide a really natural, lightweight prompt for this reflection.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes I withdraw a question for being poorly phrased- often when my answer makes the decision sound “bad” but I feel like it was actually “good”, or vice versa. This is an easy way to notice I was wrong about what I valued and look for what is actually driving my decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then there are the framing benefits. It’s easier to view something as an experiment if you’re explicitly writing down “5% chance of success”, which makes failure feel less bad. I didn’t fail to make something work, I executed the correct algorithm and it failed to produce results this particular time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Making an explicit prediction and writing it down closes open loops in my head, freeing RAM for other things.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s helpful to notice when the habit doesn’t trigger. For example, I have a meeting planned today (when I’m writing this) that I just “didn’t feel inspired” to make a prediction for. When I looked closer I realized that’s because I was kind of eh on this meeting but felt obliged to take it, and was avoiding that fact. I don’t know how this is going to work out because I’m choosing to work on this blog post before tackling that, but I still credit the prediction habit with noticing, which is the first step towards better choices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also it seems like this might make my predictions more accurate, which has all kinds of applications. But to be honest that’s not what’s reinforcing this.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p dir="ltr">So we’re on the same page, here are some sample predictions, and the decisions that rested on them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Reading Pavlov and his School will lead to behavior change in the area of learning or sleep (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Should I buy a physical copy of Pavlov and his School and spend the time to read it?</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Talking with my friend Jane on 8/1 will be energizing (95%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I take a call with Jane?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Bob the recruiter will describe a job that I am at all capable of and interested in doing (3%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I take a call with Bob?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">I will judge the seminar on 7/28 will be worth the interruption of flow (40%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I spend money and time on this seminar?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Sam will finish task Y by 7/31 (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">No immediate decision riding on this one, but it sure seems useful to calibrate on how well I can predict a project partner’s productivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">I will play with an Oculus Quest at least an hour a week (98%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy a Quest?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">California will catch fire to the point I need to keep my windows closed (95%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy an air conditioner?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Company Z will offer me at least an hour of work (15%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">No immediate decision</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Supplement S will improve my sleep to the point I don’t need a nap (3%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy and use supplement S?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p dir="ltr">If I were starting from scratch, here are the instructions I would want to receive (many of which I did receive, from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raemon">Raemon</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create an account on <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">PredictionBook.com</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Go to Settings to correct your time zone and set your prediction default to “visible to creator” rather than “visible to public” (unless you’d like them to be public by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create a handful of predictions that will resolve over the next week (PredictionBook will e-mail you when they should be resolved).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The goal is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Quickly get feedback about how this feels for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Get yourself in the habit of making and resolving predictions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">When making predictions, try to hone in on things that are decision-relevant to you; that you would do something different based on if the prediction was true or not.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create a link to <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/new">https://predictionbook.com/predictions/new</a> in your browser so you can access it easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As you take more actions based on predictions (implicit or explicit), notice that you are doing so, and register the predictions in PredictionBook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Resolve predictions as you are prompted to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">After a week or two, check in with yourself and how you feel about the project. For calibration: I found creating the initial predictions kind of a pain but by a week in the project was naturally rewarding and required no will power on my part.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This should take &lt; 30 minutes, and it should take &lt; 45 minutes total to get a good sense of whether this is working for you.</p>

<h3>Why Does This Work?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve been thinking a lot about flow and distraction recently. One thing I’ve noticed is that it takes an awful long time, measured in hours, to get into the mindset for certain tasks. Those tasks then feel amazing, unless I’m pulled out of them prematurely, which hurts (and makes it take even longer to get into the next time). There’s a lot of implications of this that I’ll hopefully get to in some other post; the relevance here is that I think weekly reviews might be one of those tasks that requires a lot of time to get into the required headspace and hurts to leave prematurely. This makes them costly- much more costly then I would have estimated before I learned to bill tasks for their prep time. It’s also something of an all or nothing task- doing 50% of your weekly review does not get you nearly 50% of the benefits of a full weekly review.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But predictions, both making and evaluating, integrate into my life pretty naturally most of the time, and scale gracefully. Writing them up can take as little as 15 seconds, and when it takes longer, it’s because I’ve discovered something important I need to work out. Doing this fits in naturally with the process of making plans, so I don’t need to spend time getting into the right head space. Evaluating them is usually trivial- and if it’s not, it’s highlighting a problem with my models.</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
<p dir="ltr">“I will enjoy X” is very rarely the right prediction for me to make, because enjoyment is a tricky thing for me. I don’t like admitting I didn’t enjoy something, and sometimes I will burn a lot of energy trying to make something enjoyable, which can be a bad decision even if it works. My equivalent is “X will be energizing”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When trying to create predictions, think about what you’ll be spending money and time on in the next week. How do you think those things are going to go? What outcomes would make you change your decision?</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p dir="ltr">My original inspiration for this experiment, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jL7uDE5oH4HddYq4u/raemon-s-scratchpad?commentId=nuWrC9MxrgsjjS69W">Raemon</a>, hasn’t gotten the benefits I describe. He’s more focused on improving his prediction calibration and accuracy, and so far hasn’t done as much decision-relevant predictions. I’ve encouraged him to try it my way and hopefully he’ll comment after he’s spent a few weeks on that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PredictionBook is pleasantly lightweight but it’s already a little cluttered with predictions. If I really do solidify this habit I may need to find or create a better system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve been doing this for about a month. People have kept up weekly reviews for longer before letting them fall by the wayside. I’m writing this up now because the act of solidifying a habit makes me worse at writing about it. I’ve set a reminder for 12/1 to write an update.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raemon">Raemon</a> for pushing me to a better version this post and for initiating the experiment in the first place.</p>

But have you ever wondered how that happens?</p><p>In our new "Inside the Cockpit" series here on the Duffel blog, we'll take you behind the scenes of the travel industry so you can see how it really works.</p><p>In this post, you'll learn what has to happen to bring you your flight search results at lightning speed.</p><h2 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h2><figure><img src="https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-07-23_at_12.42.47--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-07-23_at_12.42.47--1-.png 600w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-07-23_at_12.42.47--1-.png 1000w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-07-23_at_12.42.47--1-.png 1494w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Imagine that you search for flights from New York John F Kennedy (<code>JFK</code>) to San Francisco (<code>SFO</code>) on 29th August.</p><p>To find your flights, the search engine (sometimes called a “pricing engine” or “shopping engine”) has to cleverly combine together three kinds of data:</p><ul><li>Schedules</li><li>Fares</li><li>Availability</li></ul><p>Let’s look at these, one by one, to understand what they are and how they work. We’ll then talk about the hard part: combining them together to build the search results you see on your screen</p><h2 id="schedules">Schedules</h2><p>Schedules describe when and where an airline plans to fly.</p><p>This isn’t just a list of individual flights. Schedules are structured with a start date and an end date, and then the days of the week when the flight is set to operate.</p><figure><img src="https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png 600w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png 1000w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png 1600w, https://duffel.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-02_at_17.46.50--1-.png 1972w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example of American Airlines' schedule</figcaption></figure><p>For example, an entry in American Airlines’ schedules might say something like this:</p><blockquote>We’re going to run a flight from JFK to SFO on Mondays, Fridays and Sundays between 1st August and 31st August 2020. We’ll call this flight AA2305, and we’ll use an Airbus A321 to operate it.</blockquote><p>Airlines distribute their schedules through industry data providers, who then make them available to other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers. <a href="https://www.oag.com/">OAG</a> and <a href="https://www.cirium.com/">Cirium</a> are the leaders in this space.</p><p>This isn’t just static data which changes infrequently - airlines generally update their schedules at least once a day, and there are about 800 scheduled airlines for the data providers to work with.</p><h2 id="fares">Fares</h2><p>A fare describes a price at which an airline is willing to sell seats on a particular flight, and the rules (sometimes known as "conditions") that go with that price.</p><p>A fare from American Airlines might look something like this:</p><blockquote>We’re willing to sell seats on our flights AA2305 and AA2307 for $200, as long as there is space in booking class N. However, you must book your seat as part of a return, you’ll have to stay in San Francisco for a Saturday night, and we won’t give you any refund if you want to cancel.</blockquote><p>A fare has a name, called a “fare basis code”. A fare basis code is a short set of letters and numbers - for example <code>NVAKZNM3</code>.</p><p>Fares are made up of rules which describe who is eligible for them, what flights they can be used for, and restrictions on how they can be sold or used. Examples of fare rules could include:</p><ul><li>You must fly via Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>)</li><li>You can change flights, but only if you pay a $50 penalty</li><li>You can't have a "stopover" overnight on your journey</li></ul><p>The full fare rules for a fare can easily be thousands of words long - you can see the real-life fare rules for the American Airlines fare <code>NVAKZNM3</code> <a href="https://gist.github.com/timrogers/ef7a0070d29ea1ffa5d925184e7a4887">here</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the most important fare rules can be described in a structured way which a computer can understand, allowing a search engine to work out what fares match your search without a human reading through manually.</p><p>Airlines file their fares in an industry directory run by <a href="https://www.atpco.net/">ATPCO</a>, which other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers can subscribe to. Each airline can change their pricing by refiling fares many times a day. All in all, ATPCO processes more than 10 million fare updates per day.</p><p>Airlines offer many fares for the same flight at the same time, since a traveller won’t always want the cheapest, most restrictive option. For example, you might want a checked bag, or the ability to change your flights free of charge.</p><h2 id="availability">Availability</h2><p>Airlines don’t just say “this flight has seats available” or “this flight doesn’t have seats available”.</p><p>Airlines want to make as much money as they can from their metal boxes flying through the sky, so they want to sell some seats cheaply, but hold some seats back for travellers who are willing to pay more.</p><p>A flight is broken into different “booking classes”, sometimes known as “reservation booking designators” (RBDs). These are letters of the alphabet, so a flight can be split into 26 different buckets: <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, etc..</p><p>A fare points to a specific booking class. The example fare we looked at above, <code>NVAKZNM3</code>, is for the booking class <code>N</code>. Usually, the first character of the fare basis code is the booking class.</p><p>Each booking class on a flight can have different availability. For example, imagine that American Airlines uses the booking classes <code>N</code>, <code>V</code> and <code>Y</code> for economy.</p><p>They might use <code>N</code> for the most restrictive economy fares, <code>Y</code> for the most flexible ones and <code>V</code> for ones in the middle. Being able to control availability for each booking class means that “cheap economy” can be sold out, but there can still be “expensive economy” seats left.</p><p>Airlines don’t “publish” their availability. To know the latest, up-to-the-minute availability, you have to go to the airline’s passenger service system (PSS). Popular passenger service systems include <a href="https://amadeus.com/en/industries/airlines/altea-suite">Amadeus Altéa</a>, <a href="https://www.sabreairlinesolutions.com/home/software_solutions/customer_sales_service/">Sabre Sonic</a> and <a href="https://www.navitaire.com/new-skies-reservation-system">Navitaire New Skies</a>.</p><h2 id="putting-this-all-together">Putting this all together</h2><p>To find results for a simple search, a flight search engine has to combine together schedules, fares and availability.</p><p>There is only a small number of flight searches engines on the market. Most travel sellers use the search built into the global distribution system (GDS) they use (for example <a href="https://amadeus.com/">Amadeus</a>, <a href="https://www.sabre.com/">Sabre</a> or <a href="https://www.travelport.com/">Travelport</a>). But there are competitors: airlines and larger sellers often use search solutions from providers like <a href="https://www.itasoftware.com/">ITA Software by Google</a> and <a href="https://pros.com/">PROS</a>.</p><p>Flight search is very complex, and it requires a lot of computer power.</p><p>The first step is to identify possible routings. For our trip from New York to San Francisco, there are tens of thousands of reasonable options if we take into account connecting flights and the full range of available airlines.</p><p>At the simple end, we could take a direct flight, <code>AA2305</code>. But we could also fly with Alaska Airlines on <code>AS17</code>, <code>AS398</code> and <code>AS3311</code>, connecting in Seattle (<code>SEA</code>) and Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>).</p><p>For each of those routings, the search engine needs to work out what fares are applicable, checking all of the rules.</p><p>There can be hundreds or thousands of potentially relevant fares to check per airline, especially given that there can be many different ways to apply fares to a set of flights.</p><p>If we take our example above with Alaska Airlines, you’d fly from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, then <code>SEA-LAX</code> and finally <code>LAX-SFO</code>. In terms of fares, this could be structured as:</p><ul><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SFO</code></li><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, and then a one-way from <code>SEA-SFO</code></li><li>Three one-ways: <code>JFK-SEA</code>, <code>SEA-LAX</code> <code>LAX-SFO</code></li><li>…</li></ul><p>If we’re booking a round trip, this gets even more complex.</p><p>Once you’ve combined the schedules and fares, you’ll have a series of “priced itineraries” - for example:</p><blockquote>You can fly on AA2305 direct from JFK to SFO for $200, using fare NVAKZNM3, as long as booking class N is available</blockquote><p>The final step is to bring availability into the picture. You’ll probably find that a lot of your priced itineraries are not available because one or more of the booking classes you need are full.</p><p>The end result is a series of search results — or what we call "offers" in the Duffel API.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>When you search for flights, a flight search engine has to combine schedules, fares and availability to generate your search results.</p><p>To do this, it has to consider hundreds of millions of options (at least!), turning them into a relatively small number of valid, relevant combinations. And all of that in just a couple of seconds!</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597054012512/yOWZ6zJsl.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Have you ever met someone who kept apologising for every question or favour they asked? Perhaps you are that person and you can hear yourself saying "sorry" over and over again for basic and normal requests which really don't need an apology. It is annoying for everyone involved and usually, the person apologising is just in <em>such</em> a habit of doing it that a gentle "No need to apologise" or even "Please stop apologising" won't actually lead to any change.</p>
<p>I heard a great tip a few years ago which could help you escape this annoying habit, and lead to better relationships with colleagues, friends, and superiors. This tip helps avoid a <strong>weird power dynamic</strong> where you put yourself in the position of someone begging or being needy, and changes it into a collaborative, positive space. In my opinion, it not only helps others respect you more, but leads to you respecting yourself more.</p>
<h2 id="replace-sorry-with-thank-you-">Replace 'sorry' with 'thank you'</h2>
<p>We know that replacing bad habits is easier than removing them completely, so every time you feel the urge to apologise for something unnecessarily, try to rephrase it as a thank you. This puts you in a better headspace, but people also feel a lot more comfortable accepting thanks than accepting unnecessary apologies. As said, it also turns a generally negative feeling and frames it positively. You're still showing gratitude without begging forgiveness for an everyday request.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Instead of</td><td>Try</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sorry for the inconvenience</td><td>Thank you for your time</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sorry you had to wait so long</td><td>Thank you for your patience</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sorry to ask, but...</td><td>Thanks for seeing me, would you mind telling me...</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>You helped me so much, sorry</td><td>Thank you for helping me so much</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These are just a few examples. For me, "thank you for your time" was the most valuable and easy to implement in a variety of situations. </p>
<p><strong>If you try to utilise this technique in your everyday life, you'll see that not only do people respond a lot better to your requests and explanations, but you'll also walk away feeling more like you collaborated, rather than grovelled.</strong></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> This advice does not apply for when you truly should apologise. If you hurt someone (even accidentally) or do someone wrong, you should apologise. The above is only applicable when you are in the unfortunate habit of apologising for normal requests.</p>

These frameworks create a window which GoLang can inject HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the UI.</p><p id="c60c">But I don’t want to write JavaScript(!) and deal with all the complexities that comes with it like npm, webpack, typescript… Fortunately, I can just compile GoLang to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly</a> (WASM) and use that in place of JavaScript. WASM is a binary format that can be executed natively in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most modern browsers</a>. <em>My </em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/a-web-app-using-bazel-golang-wasm-and-proto-c020914f4341"><em>previous post</em></a><em> showed how to build a WASM web-app with the Bazel.</em></p><p id="14af">Also, using WASM in a desktop app (as opposed to a web app) dodges two of its main downsides:</p><ol><li id="a01f"><strong>Large WASM binaries</strong> (especially from GoLang): these take a long time to send over the network increasing loading times. In a desktop app the binary isn’t transferred over the network, so less overhead.</li><li id="c65b"><strong>Browser incompatibility: </strong>Some WebAssembly methods are unavailable in browsers and older browsers are not supported at all. In a desktop app the “browser” is controlled (Chrome for Lorca and Safari for webview), so no compatibility issues.</li></ol><p id="382a">Let’s get started and build the app.</p><h2 id="ad5c">The Main Desktop App</h2><p id="04fb">First, I want to sketch out the <code>main</code> function for the app:</p><pre><span id="49df">func main() {<br> // Create the Data URI of index.html<br> url := fmt.Sprintf(<br>  "data:text/html,%s", <br>  url.PathEscape(assets.INDEX_HTML)<br> )</span><span id="6f7e"> // Create Lorca UI<br> ui, _ := lorca.New(url, "", 600, 200)<br> defer ui.Close()</span><span id="7141"> // Create a JS function that returns the WASM binary in base64 <br> ui.Bind("getWASM", func() string { return assets.WASM_BIN })</span><span id="4a42"> // Initialize the wasm_exec.js script<br> ui.Eval(assets.WASM_EXEC_JS)</span><span id="77ea"> // Call the initial JS functions to load the WASM<br> ui.Eval(assets.INIT_JS)</span><span id="cbed"> &lt;-ui.Done()<br>}</span></pre><p id="6eb4"><em>Note: the core difference between with webview, is using </em><code><em>Init</em></code><em> instead of </em><code><em>Eval</em></code></p><p id="062d">This app will start a Chrome window then:</p><ol><li id="9913">load the webpage with HTML <code>assets.INDEX_HTML</code></li><li id="79c2">define a function <code>getWASM</code> that is a promise of <code>assets.WASM_BIN</code>, the WASM binary as a base64 encoded string</li><li id="c64f">load the JS GoLang WASM library <code>assets.WASM_EXEC_JS</code> copied from <code>$(go env <strong>GOROOT</strong>)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js</code></li><li id="7f2e">load the JS initialization script <code>assets.INIT_JS</code></li></ol><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1676/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png" width="838" height="287" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*tezB3wIacBS6kH32xAxeqw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ce8d">This is pretty simple example Lorca app, it is basically the demo example. The main complication is the <code>assets</code> package and how it can be created. This is where Bazel comes in.</p><h2 id="74f4">Embedding Files in GoLang Binary using Bazel</h2><p id="8571"><em>Note: an easier way to do this was pointed out to me using the </em><code><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/fbbbfde2dff5072fe118b369a699d456ec756b0c/go/extras.rst#id3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>go_embed_data</em></a></code><em> rule, better to use that.</em></p><p id="9249">The <code>assets</code> package contains the HTML, JS and WASM files as string constants. There are GoLang tools like <a href="https://github.com/markbates/pkger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pkger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go-bindata</a> to do this, but we can keep this simple with a Bazel rule in <code>to_go_constant.bzl</code>:</p><pre><span id="aace">def to_go_constant(name, package, constant, file, base64 = False):<br> pkgStr = '&lt;(echo "package %s")' % package<br> conStr = '&lt;(echo "const %s string = \`")' % constant<br> suffix = '&lt;(echo "\`")'<br> genGo = 'cat %s %s - %s ' % (pkgStr, conStr, suffix)</span><span id="56aa">if base64:<br>  printContents = 'cat $(SRCS) | base64'<br> else:<br>  printContents = 'cat $(SRCS)'</span><span id="8c11">native.genrule(<br>  name = name,<br>  srcs = [file],<br>  outs = [name + ".go"],<br>  cmd =  printContents + ' | ' + genGo + '&gt; $@'<br> )</span></pre><p id="e3d4">This rule uses <code>cat</code> to take a <code>file</code> and output a <code>.go</code> file with the <code>package</code> and <code>const</code> defined.

This example injects a <code>Hello World</code> <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag into the body:</p><pre><span id="a864">package main</span><span id="bd53">import (<br> "fmt"<br> "syscall/js"<br>)</span><span id="8acd">func main() {<br> fmt.Println("Hello World")</span><span id="b814"> document := js.Global().Get("document")<br> p := document.Call("createElement", "p")<br> p.Set("innerHTML", "Hello World")<br> document.Get("body").Call("appendChild", p)<br>}</span></pre><p id="7de3">The <code>go_binary</code> rule for this just needs <code>goos="js"</code> and <code>goarch="wasm"</code> for its output to be a WASM binary, e.g.:</p><pre><span id="d208">go_binary(<br>    name = "wasm",<br>    embed = [":go_default_library"],<br>    goarch = "wasm",<br>    goos = "js",<br>    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],<br>)</span></pre><p id="f178">The output of this rule is used to above to create the <code>WASM_BIN</code> constant above.</p><h2 id="71cd">Initializing the App</h2><p id="8bd2"><code>assets.INIT_JS</code> is built from <code>init.js:</code></p><pre><span id="7b05">loadWebASM = () =&gt; {<br> const go = new Go();<br> getWASM().then( (b64) =&gt; {<br>   // Decode and convert to ArrayBuffer<br>   buf = Uint8Array.from(atob(b64), c =&gt; c.charCodeAt(0)).buffer<br>   return WebAssembly.instantiate(buf, go.importObject)<br> }).then((result) =&gt; {<br>    go.run(result.instance);<br>  }).catch((err) =&gt; {<br>    console.error("loading wasm failed: " + err);<br>  });<br>}</span><span id="e6cf">loadWebASM()</span></pre><p id="c227">This code takes the <code>WASM_BIN</code> promised by <code>getWASM</code>, then decodes and converts it to an ArrayBuffer.

This also makes it easy to convert other WASM apps to desktop applications, e.g. I converted the WASM app at <a href="https://github.com/olivewind/go-webassembly-canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/olivewind/go-webassembly-canvas</a> to a desktop application with minimal effort:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/998/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png" width="499" height="502" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/998/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png 499w" sizes="499px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SR_WdfWLKkNX_nFAEc2Kdw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><h2 id="5c7c">Conclusion</h2><p id="80dd">There are many libraries and tools written in GoLang that could use a nice user interface, e.g. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terraform</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker</a> (just off the top of my head). A web app does not fit their requirements very well since they are editing local files and talking to local daemons. The alternative is then to reimplement or bind their API and integrations to another language which is complicated, error prone and a lot of work. A method of building pure GoLang desktop applications makes a lot of sense for these kinds of tools.</p><p id="93db">This approach can pretty quickly create a distributable, single executable, desktop application with minimal external dependencies. An app that can reuse many GoLang libraries and tools that have already been built. I suppose the worst part of this approach is that it throws away years of development on JavaScript tools like React and Vue. But that just means I have to write more Go to reimplement them, so it isn’t that bad :)</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>This guide covers timeless ideas that are helpful to keep in mind while working with
systems where performance matters. Many of these ideas are fairly “durable”
and will apply regardless of what hardware, programming language, operating
system, or decade you are working in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for follow-up articles that will drill into hardware and
more Rust-specific techniques.</p>

<p>Skip to the <a href="#contents">table of contents</a> if you don’t like intros.</p>

<p>There’s some foul language in here. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast</li>
  <li>only do things that are necessary for correctness and safety</li>
  <li>your engineers will burn out, leave your team, and relentlessly shit talk you
if they don’t make their code pretty and low-friction to work with</li>
  <li>align all latency-throughput queuing positions for everything in the
serial dependency graph, or you will get worst-of-all-worlds
latency-throughput behavior, increasing latency and lowering throughput</li>
  <li>if something necessary can be done in the background without blocking,
queue it up for eventual batch processing to improve cache performance</li>
  <li>look at allocation lifetime using DHAT, avoid short-lived allocations
and ensure that long-lived allocations employ time-space trade-offs
that consume plentiful resources instead of scarce ones where possible</li>
  <li>seriously, it’s always your fault if your engineers quit.</li>
  <li>performance happens naturally when engineers love the codebase and they
are aware of which parts of the system can be sped up</li>
  <li>before wasting time optimizing things that don’t matter, we can easily test
whether optimizing could be useful at all by adding delays or deleting
relevant code to see what the impact of infinite optimization would be</li>
  <li>by default your machine will randomly change your cpu frequency, yank
processes across cores and sockets, and generally make measurements
deceptive and non-reproducible. we can control this behavior. if you
don’t account for this behavior, your measurements are not sound justifications
for code changes</li>
  <li>wait, why does an executive care about performance, anyway?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-executive-introduction">non-executive introduction</h2>

<p>Ok, now that the executives are gone, it is time to party.</p>

<p>Let’s put on some nice music.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Let it out.</p>

<p>The year is 2020. and we are utterly fucked.</p>

<p>Supposedly we are here reading this article because we “like computers” or
something but let’s be clear about one thing - you’re not here because of that.
I know. You know. We all know. You couldn’t give two fried pennies about
computers if they didn’t help you feel the things you so desperately need to
feel.</p>

<p>You’re here, ultimately, because of control. Your entire life is entombed
in an elaborate, entirely abstract labyrinth of machines that define so
many aspects of every moment of your waking life. You’re here to better
understand the prison you find yourself within. You’re here to sympathize
with the machine.</p>

<p>While you will only seep ever more deeply into this morass of gold and glass,
you have the power to turn your captors into familiar friends. You have the
power to make the machines into the only friends you will ever need. You are
here to abandon the organic and the analogue. There is nothing for you on the
other side of your window. As you lounge (please fix your posture now) in your
designated quarantine pit, gazing listlessly into the LED mesh while biding
your time, I invite you to join me - your newest simulated human experience -
on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure into the bowels of the machine through which
you experience joy and place orders for more toilet paper.</p>

<p>It begins today.</p>

<p><img src="https://sled.rs/art/sunrise.jpg" alt="warm sun rising over the water with a boat and mountains in the background"></p>

<p>This guide contains basic information for getting started with
performance-sensitive engineering. I think most folks will learn something new.
I know I have. And, part of why I wrote this is to have a single place with a
memorable URL where I can return to when I forget most of this stuff. More
importantly, when I unfurl fiery screeds in random internet comments I want to
have an intimidating reference to which I can mercilesly link.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this guide for the Rust ecosystem, where many people are now
trying their hands at optimization for the first time. But nearly all of this document
applies to general programming, with a few of the hardware effects mentioned
being specific to x86 and ARM circa 2020. Linux is assumed, because that’s
what the overwhelming majority of server workloads run today.</p>

<p>This guide brings together ideas from systems engineering, systems theory,
psychology, hardware, queuing theory, statistics, economics,
distributed systems, concurrency and philosophy of science with the goals of
helping you to be less of an asshole and write code that tends to improve
the metrics you care about.</p>

<p>Performance is about being thoughtful about the metrics that matter to us and
allowing ourselves to be aware of them while making decisions.</p>

<p>These materials are based on Tyler Neely’s Rust workshop content, and have been
inspired by the writings of

<h2 id="principles">principles</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose
reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive biases.

You just are cognitive biases.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Rationality-An-Introduction">- Luke Muehlhauser, via R:AZ</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is that our minds are pure shit and everything we
know is wrong. We must accept our fallibility before embarking down the path to
fast-as-fuck machinery.</p>

<p>We build towers of assumptions that are bound to specific contexts, and when the
conditions that caused us to form these beliefs change, we tend not to revisit
the now-invalidated beliefs. Cache invalidation is hard when we are so rarely
aware of the dependency graphs of what we believe.</p>

<p>So, we measure. Even when we’re convinced that we’re right. Because we are
always out of sync with reality, and we are fundamentally incapable of altering
this fact. But we can be responsible in the face of that.</p>

<p>Corollary: allow yourself to be wrong. Allowing yourself to be wrong with
yourself, your collaborators, and in public is a key optimization for learning
faster and building better things with less effort and in less time.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, machines tend to be somewhat amenable to measurement. We built
them that way. Indeed, constructing them to be somewhat measurable in the first
place was the only way we were able to assemble them at all despite our
innumerable shortcomings. We took the predecessor to your current machine,
chose some metrics to improve, made a huge number of mistakes while continuing
to measure, and occasionally we got lucky: the metrics we cared about improved
enough to alter production lines, crystallizing our occasionally successful
results into new production processes that eventually put your machine in front
of you.</p>

<p>We must measure.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that real programs on real hardware see real
improvements in relevant metrics like total cost of ownership, responsiveness,
etc… If a metric doesn’t help a human, it’s just a vanity pursuit that may
make the important metrics worse due to under-investment.</p>

<p>We must select our measurements with care. Our time is precious.</p>

<p>By making decisions that are considerate of available data, we are able to cut
through so much bullshit. We have so many ideas that our experience tells us
should cause our code to improve, but it simply isn’t true when we actually
measure. Code changes that made your Java, C++, Haskell or JS programs faster
may not make Rust any faster. Don’t make Rust code ugly just because some
program you wrote in the 90s worked better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">manual loop
unrolling</a>. Compilers change,
in many ways for the better.</p>

<p>Don’t be macho. Make decisions while having real data on-hand and limit the
damage of hubris.</p>

<h2 id="e-prime-and-precise-language">e-prime and precise language</h2>

<p>So many aspects of performance-critical engineering can be highly contextual
and may vary wildly from one machine to another. It helps to avoid the verb
“to be” and its conjugations “is”, “are” etc… when describing observations.</p>

<p>When we say something “is” something else, we are casually equating two
similar things for convenience purposes, and we are lying to some extent.
By avoiding false equivalences (usually easily spotted through use of “is”, “are” etc…)
we can both communicate more precisely and we can allow ourselves to reason
about complexity far more effectively. Situations that may seem completely
ambiguous when described using “to be” phrases are often quite unambiguous
when taking care to avoid false equivalences. This general form of speech
is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t say “lock-free queues are faster than mutex-backed queues”, say “on
hardware H with T threads running in tight loops performing operations O, our
specific lock-free queue has been measured to achieve a latency distribution of
X1 and our specicific mutex-backed queue has been measured to achieve a latency
distribution of X2.” It’s likely your lock-free queue will sometimes perform
worse than a well-made mutex-backed queue given certain hardware, contention
and many other factors. What does “perform worse” even …</p></section></div>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jmrphy" target="_blank">Justin Murphy</a> quit his academic career to research and teach on the internet full-time. Justin saw the University system as bloated and bureaucratic. He was frustrated with the paperwork and the politics. </p>



<p>Justin decided to leave his academic career as a professor to do what he planned in the first place – seek truth and communicate the best ideas into the world.</p>



<p>He felt that he could best achieve this goal by using the power of the internet. He is learning, experimenting, and growing like a Silicon Valley startup. But rather than taking on the legacy taxi or hotel business, Justin is taking on the University business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s working. Justin creates his own Teachable courses on topics he’s genuinely interested in. Driven students pay per course. In addition, he connects with people through books, podcasts, and his 16k Twitter followers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I spoke with Justin, he noted that he has created a philosophy course with <a href="https://twitter.com/nina__power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nina Power</a>, PhD. It’s called “<a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/bataille/?ref=linktree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Philosophy and Politics of Georges Bataille</a>.” A quote from one of his past students shows that Justin is tapping into something very interesting.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My thinking was challenged, exposed, and reshaped… Justin’s social network brings together rogue intellectuals, experimental musicians, martial arts teachers, conceptual artists and entrepreneurs from all over the globe. Collaborations have outlasted the length of the course.”</em> – Raven Connolly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The picture below is from his course and shows how Justin has built a classroom for himself.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gV-q5QlniNZKifQnI_uPRPJ48aZsBK4B79EVV8Vl7IM-LHJtTekCLAoUIk35hT62Vf8VEv6BlU88eNx4Xe4tFHqA22pVisfevfnHRDk8zrGtwJLt87k40_Yf9F8Gz2wQKMnGE-6Z" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Justin calls himself a “Full Stack Professor.” It’s a play on full stack developer – a software engineer who builds both the front and back ends of a website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Full Stack Professor handles all aspects of the professorship online and without the University. Research, publishing, bringing students together, creating classes, and building community is all part of the <em>stack</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I discussed <a href="http://makemymba.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MyMBA</a> with Justin and what it means for students in addition to professors to break off from Universities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MyMBA brings business professionals together to create an MBA education for themselves at a fraction of the cost. Learn more here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://grantnissly.com/introducing-mymba/" target="_blank">Introducing MyMBA</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MyMBA Members take business classes online from top MBA programs, meet and collaborate with each other and business leaders, and create content on personal websites to prove their learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Justin inspired me to think of MyMBA in relation to his experience. In a way, MyMBA Members are creating the “Full Stack Business Student.” MyMBA Members strive to complete everything a traditional business student does using the resources of the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to the Full Stack Professor, a MyMBA Member believes that with deliberate effort, they can make the most of the infinite resources online and pave a way for themselves without the University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking it a step further, one can see Universities as a third party. They are the intermediary between students and professors or students and employers. Justin works without this third party by communicating directly to students. MyMBA works without this third party by communicating directly to employers.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In my spare time (whenever I get to have some these days) I like to
poke around in the world of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>.</p>

<p>I do have some experience with various Lisp dialects such as Scheme,
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> and <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>,
so this is not my first introduction to the Lisp family. I’ve been
developing in Clojure at my current job and has also used Scheme
(<a href="https://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a> in particular) and Racket
in various small to mid-sized personal and hobby projects. Having
spent a fair amount of my time with the various Lisp dialects I
wouldn’t say that I’m expert in Lisp, not even close.</p>

<p>We are now in the 2020 year, and this is also the year that Lisp would
become 62 years old! That is an impressive age for a programming
language. With that said that does not mean that the concepts and
ideas developed in Lisp are old.</p>

<p>A thing so common for all languages these days such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E2%80%93then%E2%80%93else">if-then-else</a> was first
introduced by the creator of Lisp itself - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John
McCarthy</a>.
Another notable thing so common to lots of modern languages such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">garbage
collection</a>
came from Lisp too. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">Read-Eval-Print-Loop
(REPL)</a> that most
of us cannot live without is another good example.</p>

<p>And these are just a few of the things that Lisp gave to the world.</p>

<p>These days Lisp isn’t very popular compared to other languages as it
used to be back in the days, but that isn’t to say that Lisp itself is
dead. As a matter of fact it is in a pretty good shape - various
Common Lisp implementations are actively being maintained – few days
ago <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/all-news.html#2.0.0">SBCL 2.0.0</a> got released
for example. Research and innovations are still happening in Racket
(check out the Honu project for instance), and Clojure is kicking
butts in the JVM world.</p>

<p>So, why spending time with Lisp you might ask?</p>

<p>Is it for the famous Lisp enlightenment everyone is talking about? I
don’t know, maybe. Personally, I find programming in Lisp quite fun.
Exploring stuff and poking around at the REPL in Common Lisp is a
whole different story than most of the REPLs you’ve dealt with.  Maybe
it is my personal curiousity about programming and computer science
that drove me to Lisp.</p>

<p>The language has a long history, so you would find lots of
reading materials, research papers and it’s fascinating to know that
you can still run such old code in modern Common Lisp implementations.</p>

<p>Have I been enlighted by Lisp? I don’t feel smarter after learning
Lisp. I do however feel that I’ve gained more experience as a
programmer. And maybe that’s the <em>Lisp enlightment</em> these old Lispers
talk about, maybe it’s something else. What I do know however is that
learning new paradigms and techniques definitely makes you a better
problem solver, so that’s another another reason to try learning some
Lisp.</p>

<p>Oh, and I <em>do</em> like the s-expr syntax. That for me is a good enough
reason to be excited about Lisp.</p>

<p>In this post I’m going to summarize my experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common
Lisp</a> so far, and hopefully
the things I write here are going to be useful to someone else in
his/hers own journey in the world of Lisp.</p>

<p>I also need to mention that even though I have experience with Scheme
and Clojure, I’m quite new to Common Lisp. These being Lisp dialects
does not mean they are fully compatible with each other. Scheme takes
the functional-first approach to solving problems and Clojure is a
more modern reincarnation of Lisp which is closer to Scheme being a
Lisp-1 dialect, while Common Lisp is the ANSI standardized vision of
what Lisp should be.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that this post is not intended as a tutorial for all
things related to Lisp, but rather they document my particular
development setup and show various code samples which I’ve found
useful, and hopefully others will too.</p>

<p>At the end of this post you will also find additional references to
learning materials such as books and documentation, which I’d
recommend checking out. These references will be valuable to anyone
starting up with Common Lisp as they provide useful information and
insight.</p>

<h2 id="installing-common-lisp">Installing Common Lisp</h2>

<p>The nice thing about Common Lisp being ANSI standardized language is
that you can <a href="https://common-lisp.net/implementations">choose between various
implementations</a>.</p>

<p>You need high-performance Lisp compiler -
<a href="http://www.sbcl.org/all-news.html#2.0.0">SBCL</a> has got you covered,
you need to use the JVM platform - <a href="https://abcl.org/">ABCL</a> is there
for you. You can check out the various Common Lisp implementations and
choose the one that suits you most. My personal choice has been SBCL,
but as long as you develop standard compliant code your project be
portable to any conforming implementation.</p>

<p>Installing SBCL on my Mac is as simple as the following command.</p>



<p>And when I’m working on my <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> system
I would install SBCL using the following command.</p>



<p>You would want to get a copy of the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html">Common Lisp
Hyperspec</a> as
well. On Macs you can install the HyperSpec using the following command.</p>



<p>Or you can grab the HyperSpec from
<a href="http://ftp.lispworks.com/pub/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec-7-0.tar.gz">here</a>
instead.</p>

<p>After installing SBCL you can test things up quickly in the REPL and
confirm everything has been installed properly.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sbcl
This is SBCL 2.0.0, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.
More information about SBCL is available at &lt;http://www.sbcl.org/&gt;.

BSD-style licenses.  See the CREDITS and COPYING files <span>in </span>the
distribution <span>for </span>more information.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Evaluating the following expression from the REPL would return
the Lisp implementation type and version.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>lisp-implementation-type</span><span>)</span>
          <span>(</span><span>lisp-implementation-version</span><span>))</span>
<span>"SBCL"</span>
<span>"2.0.0"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="editor-setup">Editor setup</h2>

<p>I’ve been a long time Emacs user and for me the choice of editor
support for Common Lisp is simple -
<a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a>.  Vim users would
probably want to pick <a href="https://github.com/l04m33/vlime">Vlime</a>.</p>

<p>What follows below are snippets from my Emacs config. I keep these as global
settings at the top of my <code>~/.emacs</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>server-start</span><span>)</span>

<p>I also keep various personal Elisp snippets that I usually throw at
<code>~/.emacs.d/lisp</code>, so I have this as well.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; For storing custom snippets</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>My theme settings - I use one for day-time coding and another one for
late-night work. I’ve found that personally for myself working in
light themes during the day works best for my eyes and usually at
night I would switch my theme to a darker one.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; Theme customizations</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>One of the JavaScript concepts that most learners skip when studying the language is how JavaScript runs code on a single thread, and how it handles asynchronous tasks. By understanding the Call Stack and Event Loop, you'll learn how tasks are handled by the JavaScript engine, and hence, start writing non-blocking code.</p>
<p>Now, why should you care? Here are three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You get to understand how JavaScript works under the hood.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It helps in debugging code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Based on my research, questions on the Event Loop and the Call Stack come up in interviews.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-stacks-and-queues-">What are Stacks and Queues?</h2>
<p>We'll be using two important terms in this article: <em>stack</em> and <em>queue</em>; so, it's necessary that I throw some light on them before the action starts.</p>
<p>A Stack and a Queue are data structures that are supported in most, if not all, programming languages. If you already know what they are feel free to skip this section.</p>
<h3 id="a-stack">A Stack</h3>
<p><em>In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and. pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.</em> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shorturl.at/foruQ">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/stack_representation.jpg" alt="A Stack"></p>
<p>Take note of the text <strong>Last in - First out</strong> in the presentation above. Stacks use the <em>Last In, First Out</em> principle in managing a list (or array) of objects (elements), where the last item <strong>pushed</strong> onto the list is the first to be <strong>popped</strong> off. Makes sense?</p>
<p>A common example of a stack, is a pile of books:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NSMGzCL/stack-of-books.jpg" alt="A stack of books"></p>
<p>In order to add a new book to the pile of books, you put it on top, making it the last book; but in order to take the first one, Literature, you'd have to take off the last ones: Maths, History, Science.</p>
<p>So, the last item in the stack is the first to go out of it. That's the main idea behind the <em>stack</em> data structure.</p>
<h3 id="a-queue">A Queue</h3>
<p><em>In programming, a queue is a data structure in which elements are removed in the same order they were entered. This is often referred to as FIFO (first in, first out).</em> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/Q/queue.html">Webopedia</a></p>
<p>Unlike stacks, a queue uses the <em>First In, First Out (FIFO)</em> principle when managing lists. In this case, the element or object which is first added to a list, is the first to go off the list.</p>
<p>A real-life example is a queue of people looking to meet the doctor at a hospital. The person who comes first sees the doctor first, right?</p>
<p>Queues have the idea of <em>first come, first serve</em>.</p>
<p>Since this isn't a data structures article, let's get to why we're really here.</p>

<p><em>In computer science, a call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program</em> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>To translate the above definition into JavaScript, "active subroutines" simple means "active functions" or "invoked (running) functions".</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the <strong>call stack</strong> is a single-threaded stack of function <em>invocations</em> in an active JavaScript program.</p>
<p>The call stack is basically a list of functions which have been invoked but aren't done running. The fact that it is single-threaded means only one thing is happening at a time.</p>
<p>Whenever we call a function (e.g. <code>funcA</code>), it gets pushed onto the stack as a <strong>stack frame</strong>. A stack frame is a memory location on the call stack.</p>
<p>So, if this particular function depends on another function (e.g. <code>funcB</code>), as in, it invokes <code>funcB</code> in its block, then <code>funcB</code> gets pushed onto the stack too, right on top of the function which invoked it; in this case <code>funcA</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>function</span> <span>funcB</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>"End of B"</span>;
}


<span><span>function</span> <span>funcA</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  
  <span>let</span> str = funcB();
}


funcA();
</code></pre>
<p>Now, here's a visual representation of how the JavaScript engine runs this script:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Cs6wj3L/call-stack-eg-1.png" alt="Representation of the call stack and the stack frames"></p>
<p>Okay, let's digest this.</p>
<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost, where the heck is the <code>main()</code> function coming from, and how did it get its own stack frame?
When a script (JavaScript code) is executed, the JavaScript engine creates a <strong>Global Execution Context</strong>, which is denoted by <code>global()</code> or <code>main()</code> function, which gets pushed onto the call stack. Thereby, becoming the first stack frame. We're not responsible for this; the JavaScript engine does this, so the Global Execution Context acts like an entry point for our JavaScript program.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the code we wrote, only <code>funcA()</code> was invoked globally (on the last line). This invocation creates a <strong>Function Execution Context</strong> for <code>funcA()</code> and pushes it onto the call stack, and it starts being executed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <code>funcA()</code> function, <code>funcB()</code> is invoked - where its returned string is stored in the variable <code>str</code>. At this point, a <strong>Function Execution Context</strong> is created again for <code>funcB()</code> and a stack frame is created for it and gets pushed onto the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inside <code>funcB()</code>, every task (or code) is run until the last line (in our case, the <code>return</code> statement) which marks the end of the function. On this note, the function exits and is popped off the call stack. Since the call stack is a <strong>stack</strong> data structure, the last item goes out first (Last In, First Out). Therefore, <code>funcB()</code> is the first to be popped off the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When <code>funcB()</code> finishes executing, its returned value is obtained by <code>funcA()</code> which is stored in the <code>str</code> variable. And since the variable initialisation is the last line of <code>funcA()</code> it marks the end of the function, and hence causes the stack frame of <code>funcA()</code> to be popped off the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, since there are no more functions to be executed by the JavaScript engine, the Global Execution Context exits and <code>main()</code> or <code>global()</code> is popped off the call stack too, leaving it empty.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the image above isn't big enough just open it in a new tab and zoom in.</p>

<p>Before you get overly excited, this section isn't about the forum <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.gyenabubakar.dev/www.stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> 😅.</p>
<p>There's a maximum number of stack frames that can occupy the call stack.</p>
<p>If this limit is exceeded, a stack overflow occurs. In other words, the JavaScript engine throws a <code>RangeError</code> exception (in Chrome), or <code>InternalError</code> exception (in Firefox).</p>
<p>But how could this ever happen?</p>
<p>A common way a stack overflow could occur is when a recursive function is executed without an exit condition.</p>
<p>A recursive function is any function which invokes itself in its definition block.</p>
<p>When such a function is invoked and no condition is provided for it to stop infinitely calling itself, the stack size limit is exceeded and a stack overflow occurs.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a recursive function which has no exit condition:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>example</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  
  example();
}


example();
</code></pre>
<p>Copy the code above and run it. Check the developer console and you'll see an error which looks like this (Chrome):</p>

<hr>
<p>I mentioned earlier that JavaScript is single-threaded, and that it runs one task at a time.</p>
<p>So, how does it handle asynchronous tasks?</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-tasks">Asynchronous Tasks</h2>
<p>JavaScript code is ran from top to bottom; tasks that are written first are executed first. However, this is different with asynchronous tasks.</p>
<p>Basically, asynchronous tasks are those that take some time before they complete. An example is fetching data from a remote server. Another instance is writing <code>setTimeout()</code> to invoke a function after a number of milliseconds.</p>
<p>Let's examine this code:</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(<span>"start"</span>);


setTimeout(() =&gt; {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>"middle"</span>);
}, <span>1000</span>);

<span>console</span>.log(<span>"end"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code><span>start</span>
<span>end</span>
middle
</code></pre><p>As you'd expect, the <code>setTimeout()</code> fired its callback after a second, but then clearly the browser skipped it and executed the <code>console.log()</code> at the end before coming to execute the callback in the <code>setTimeout()</code>.</p>
<p>How does that happen under the hood when we know JavaScript has one call stack and is single-threaded?</p>
<p>First of all, the first <code>console.log()</code> is pushed onto the call stack (after the global execution context, of course).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/zVLLyky/e-loop-eg1.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>And after it logs to the console, its stack frame is popped off the call stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/RSkPPY5/e-loop-eg1b.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>Then, the <code>setTimeout()</code> is pushed onto the call stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/HFPWPGd/e-loop-eg2.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>Browsers come with their own APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), such as <code>setTimeout</code>, the DOM, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, etc. These APIs aren't provided by the JavaScript engine and hence, it doesn't know how it can execute such code. Therefore, the engine immediately marks it as complete (without running it), pops it off the call stack, and lets the browser or Web API handle it.</p>
<p>So, our <code>setTimeout()</code> is popped off the call stack so the Web API handles it, and then a timer is placed on its callback by the Web API.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NCbdjt4/e-loop-eg3.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>At that point, since it has been removed from the call stack, the JavaScript engine continues executing the code, and the last <code>console.log()</code> is pushed onto the call stack and executed, whilst the <code>setTimeout()</code> callback is being handled by the Web API.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YPmtKbW/e-loop-eg4.png" alt="example"></p>

<p>The moment the provided time on the <code>setTimeout()</code> expires, in this case 1 second, the callback is pushed onto the <strong>Callback Queue</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xCZyMPD/e-loop-eg5.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>And obviously, by now, the last <code>console.log()</code> had already been executed and popped off the call stack, meaning the script is done running.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YTzR1MY/e-loop-eg5b.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>Remember what the <em>queue</em> data structure is?</p>
<p>The <strong>Callback Queue</strong> is a first-in-first-out data structure. Meaning, the first function which it takes is the first to go out of it.</p>
<p>Why didn't the Web API push the callback function directly onto the call stack? The reason is that, by the time the timer on the callback expires, the call stack may be busy executing functions.</p>
<p>So, the asynchronous code is enqueued on the Callback Queue, waiting to be pushed onto the call stack by the <em>event loop</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>event loop</em> is an endless loop which has only one goal: push tasks (from the callback queue) onto the call stack when the call stack is done running the script.</p>
<p>The <em>event loop</em> keeps checking both the call stack and callback queue; if the call stack is empty, it checks if there are any queued tasks on the callback queue. If there are any, it pushes them onto the call stack.</p>
<p>So, now that the JavaScript engine is done executing code and the call stack is left with no more code or functions to execute, the event loop takes the callback from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack to be executed.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/GQbNmPz/e-loop-eg6.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>The callback is ran, and the engine notices it calls <code>console.log()</code>. It takes that and …</p></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving">Seam carving</a> is a technique
for <em>content-aware resizing</em>, which changes the size of an image while
attempting to preserve the interesting content of the image. The basic
idea behind the technique is to remove <strong><em>low-energy seams</em></strong>: paths of pixels
that are similar to their surroundings. A removed seam can be either vertical or
horizontal, to reduce either the width or height of an image.</p>

<p>For example, here’s a panorama I took a few years ago near Spruce Knob, WV.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/pano.jpg"></p>

<p>The image is super wide, but we can carve it down.
Here’s an animation of the process, generated by the
<a href="https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl/pull/123">seam-carver I implemented recently</a>
as a parallel benchmark for
<a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a>.</p>

<p>Getting real parallel speedups in this implementation turned out to be an
interesting challenge. For typical images, which are fairly small,
I found that the most obvious approach for parallelizing the algorithm was not
able to extract enough parallelism, because it required too small of a
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29">grain size</a></em>.
So, I designed a new way of parallelizing the algorithm which works much
better on small images. This post presents some of the details.</p>

<h2 id="the-seam-carving-algorithm">The Seam Carving Algorithm</h2>

<p>The idea behind seam-carving is to consider all possible seams in an image,
select the one which is least important, and remove it. A <strong><em>seam</em></strong> is a path of
pixels that cuts across an image, touching one pixel in each row (or column)
along the way. When we remove a seam, we reduce either the width or height
of the image by 1. We can repeat this process as many times as desired to
shrink the image.</p>

<p>We’ll base the “importance” of seams on a notion of pixel <strong><em>energy</em></strong>, which
can be defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_gradient">many different ways</a>.
For seam-carving, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference">color difference</a> gradient
seems to work well, which measures how different a pixel’s color is in
comparison to its surroundings. The <strong><em>energy of a seam</em></strong> is just the
cumulative energies of all pixels touched by the seam. With this setup,
the seam with <em>minimum energy</em> should be unimportant and safe to remove from
an image.</p>

<p>To compute <em>minimum seam energies</em>, we can use a simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>
algorithm. For simplicity here, let’s focus on vertical seams. Let
\(M(i,j)\) be the minimum energy of
any partial seam that ends at row \(i\) and column \(j\), and let
\(E(i,j)\) be the energy of the pixel at that position. These minimum seam
energies are related by the following equation:</p><p>

\[M(i,j) = E(i,j) + \min(M(i-1,j-1), M(i-1,j), M(i-1,j+1))\]

</p><p>A picture might help. For each position, we look at the minimum partial
seams that end above it, pick the smallest, and then add the next pixel.</p>

<p><img width="250px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/equation.svg"></p>

<p>Once \(M\) has been fully computed, we can find the minimum overall seam by
working backwards, from bottom to top, by walking upwards along the path of
minimum seam energies starting at the smallest in the bottommost row.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-minimum-seam-in-parallel">Finding the minimum seam in parallel</h2>



<p>The dependencies within the equation for \(M\) appear to offer a lot of
parallelism. Perhaps the most immediately obvious approach is to compute
\(M\) in <strong><em>row-major</em></strong> order,
where first we do all of row 0, and then all of row 1, etc. With this ordering,
the values within a row can be computed entirely in parallel, because each
\(M(i, j)\) only depends on three values \(M(i-1, \ldots)\) from the previous row.</p>

<p>However, there’s a major problem in practice with row-major order:
typical images are only at most a few thousand pixels wide, and each pixel
only requires a small amount of work. That’s not enough work (per row)
to parallelize effectively! We’ll need a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29">granularity</a>
of at least, say, a thousand pixels to amortize the cost of parallelism itself.</p>

<p>This pretty much rules out using row-major order for typical, small images.
Is there a better to compute \(M\) without reducing the grain size?</p>



<p>To extract more parallelism without reducing the grain size, we need a
better way to partition up the work. This is something that probably
<em>could</em> be done “automatically” (e.g. take a look at
<a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/c/Chowdhury:Rezaul_Alam.html">Rezaul Chowdhury</a>’s
work), but here we’ll just try to design something ourselves.</p>

<p>What are all of the dependencies for a single value \(M(i,j)\)? Visually,
the dependencies form a triangle with the pointy-end pointing down:</p>

<p><img width="300px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/depend.svg"></p>

<p>We can use triangles like these to split up the work in a nice way. First,
imagine grouping adjacent rows into <strong><em>strips</em></strong>. Within one strip,
cover the top of the strip with a bunch downward-pointing triangles. The
leftover space will look like a bunch of upward-pointing triangles, each
of which has all of its dependencies already satisfied (this is not immediately
obvious but drawing a picture will help). So, we
can process one strip in two parallel rounds, where first we do a bunch of
downward-pointing triangles in parallel, and then we do a bunch of
upward-pointing triangles to fill in the leftover space.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture using triangles that are 6 pixels wide at the base. Note that
if we use triangles of even base-width, then these tile naturally with no
overlap.</p>

<p><img width="350px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/strips.svg"></p>

<p>How wide should each triangle be in practice? Recall that we’re shooting for a
target granularity of maybe one or two thousand pixels. This corresponds to
triangles with base-widths of somewhere between 64 (1056 pixels in the triangle)
and 90 (2070 pixels in the triangle).</p>

<p>So, in a smallish image, e.g. 1000 pixels wide, we can fit
at least 11 triangles horizontally, suggesting a maximum possible
speedup of 11x or more. This is a big improvement over the row-major strategy,
which (using a granularity of 1000 pixels) would not be able to extract any
parallelism from such an image.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-and-performance">Implementation and performance</h2>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a>, I implemented both the row-major
and triangular strategies to compare their performance. The code for the
triangular strategy is available in the <code>examples/src/seam-carve/</code> subdirectory
of the <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a> repo. I’ll leave the row-major
code as an exercise to the reader. (It’s not too bad!)</p>

<p>Here are some performance numbers for
removing 10 seams from an image of size approximately 2600x600. I did a little
bit of tuning, and ended up choosing a row-major granularity of 1000 pixels,
and a triangular base-width granularity of 88 (1980 pixels).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Strategy</th>
      <th>P = 1</th>
      <th>P = 10</th>
      <th>P = 20</th>
      <th>P = 30</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>row-major</td>
      <td>0.66</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>triangular</td>
      <td>0.78</td>
      <td>0.17</td>
      <td>0.12</td>
      <td>0.09</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On 1 processor (P = 1), the row-major strategy is faster by about 15%, but
on more processors quickly hits a maximum speedup of about 2x, seeing no
additional improvement above 10 processors.
In contrast, the triangular strategy continues to get faster as the number
of processors increases, with self-speedups of about 5x on 10 processors,
6.5x on 20, and 9x on 30.</p>

<p>Despite having a mild amount of overhead on 1 processor, we can see that
the triangular strategy provides significant gains. On higher core counts,
it is as much as 4x faster than the row-major strategy.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>One might wonder: why are the speedups we got so far away from theoretical
limits? With a base-width of 88, shouldn’t we be able to get up to 30x speedup
on an image of width 2600? Well, unfortunately, there are a large number of
barriers to achieving such good speedup in practice: ineffective cache
utilization, memory bandwidth bottlenecks, non-optimal scheduling… and
many more.</p>

<p>In the case of seam carving, there are two major limiting factors.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Seam carving is largely memory-bound, i.e., for each memory access it
  only does a small amount of work before the next access. To get around this
  bottleneck, we might need better cache utilization, and so we would have to
  more carefully lay out the values of \(M(i,j)\) in memory. (For this
  implementation, I used a simple flat-array layout, where \(M(i,j)\) lives at
  index \(iW + j\). We could instead try storing these values in a
  hierarchical structure, indexing first by strip, and then by triangle, to
  better improve locality.)</li>
  <li>Seam carving has high span, performing a small amount of work in
  between each synchronization. For example in the row-major strategy, we use
  a barrier between each row, and in the triangular strategy, we use two
  barriers per strip. This can cause the scheduler to perform too many thread
  migrations. To mitigate this, one thing we could try is to let triangles
  overlap slightly, to increase the size of each strip. This trades a small
  amount of duplicated work for fewer barrier synchronizations overall, which
  could prove to be hugely beneficial.</li>
</ol>

						<p>SpaceX wants to transform the Boca Chica Village in Texas into a modern spaceport, according to a new <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/spacex/jobs/4816599002?gh_jid=4816599002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing</a> for “Resort Development Manager” posted this week. Spotted by CNBC reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1292913032042086401">Michael Sheetz</a>, the job description states that “SpaceX is committed to developing this town into a 21st century Spaceport.”</p>
<p>Boca Chica is the small area near Brownsville, Texas, where SpaceX already conducts tests with the Starship project — which aims to deliver new spacecrafts designed to take passengers beyond low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>According to the job description for the SpaceX Brownsville facility, the company wants to turn the entire region into a spaceport to accommodate both the people and cargo that will be on board the Starship vehicle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>SpaceX is committed to developing revolutionary space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets. Boca Chica Village is our latest launch site dedicated to Starship, our next generation launch vehicle. SpaceX is committed to developing this town into a 21st century Spaceport. We are looking for a talented Resort Development Manager to oversee the development of SpaceX’s first resort from inception to completion.&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Resort Development Manager will be responsible for managing the entire project, including design and architectural aspects, costs, schedules, and all government approvals.</p>

<p>With so much effort on this project, SpaceX clearly wants to offer a unique experience for those planning to travel to the Moon or even Mars.</p>
<p>Last week, NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley successfully <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://spaceexplored.com/2020/08/03/boaters-crash-nasa-astronaut-splashdown-for-spacex-mission-in-dangerous-coordinated-effort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned to Earth</a> from the International Space Station, building SpaceX’s experience safely conducting human spaceflight missions.</p>

<p>Bad decision-makers who make quick decisions get themselves in a lot of trouble. They need to slow down and be more thoughtful.</p>



<p>Bad decision-makers who make slow and thoughtful decisions are still bad decision-makers. They need to make better decisions.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who makes slow and thoughtful decisions do well for themselves but they waste time and endure unnecessary stress due to indecision. They need to be more decisive.</p>



<p>Good decision-makers who make quick decisions are great decision-makers. They trust their good judgement and make the most good decisions.</p>

It’s becoming increasingly normal for teams to update their Kanban boards on a weekly basis and adapt their projects to the changing requirements.</p><p>Many of us would find this flexible approach a little familiar mainly because many teams are attempting to apply the Agile approach in their work processes.</p><p>We wanted to get a real-life perspective about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/datascience/taking-an-agile-approach-to-data-science" target="_blank">Agile approach in data science</a>, so we got in touch with Christos Hadjinikolis, the Lead ML-Engineer of Data Reply UK, to talk about this topic. You can check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://christos-hadjinikolis.github.io/" target="_blank">his personal website to learn more about his credentials and work in Machine Learning (ML)</a>.</p><h2 id="0-agile-in-data-science">Agile in Data Science</h2><p>Christos spoke about the Agile approach in data science in his session <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://2018.mcubed.london/sessions/data-science-agile-way/" target="_blank">Doing Data Science The Agile Way</a> at the Mcubed London event in 2018. You can watch the video for more information.</p><figure><p> <iframe title="M3 18: Christos Hadjinikolis - Doing Data Science the Agile Way" width="500" height="281" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-data-cli-class="cli-blocker-script" data-cli-label="Youtube embed" data-cli-script-type="analytics" data-cli-block="true" data-cli-block-if-ccpa-optout="false" data-cli-element-position="body" data-cli-placeholder="Accept <a class='cli_manage_current_consent'>Analytics</a> cookies to view the content." data-cli-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nRsqFrutfSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>Hadjinikolis defines Agile Software Development as a time-boxed, iterative and incremental approach to software delivery. The Agile approach in data science is based on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">its twelve principles</a> (you can click on the anchor texts to find out what they are if you don’t know).</p><p>According to Christos, a data scientist’s role in an Agile team is to experiment and learn what works and what doesn’t. Agile Software Development is all about creating experiments, not tasks. Experimentation tolerates failure as education.</p><blockquote><p>“If practicing Agile Software Development produces value from learning through failing fast and safe… then a Data Scientist’s role in an Agile team is to help the team to fail faster!”</p><cite><a href="https://2018.mcubed.london/sessions/data-science-agile-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christos Hadjinikolis at Mcubed London 2018</a>.</cite></blockquote><p>When we do an experiment, we start by forming a hypothesis and determining the variables. Then, we proceed to collect and analyse data based on those variables.</p><p>When the results are not what we wanted or expected, it shows that the hypothesis doesn’t work or there’s not enough data to test this hypothesis. So, we adjust the hypothesis and redo the experiment to see if that hypothesis works or not.</p><h3 id="1-story-splitting">Story splitting</h3><p>In Agile, a use case is split into different user stories. A user story is an explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end-user. A user would describe the functionality they want in a feature and the benefit gained from that functionality.</p><p>Here’s an example we came up with. In a non-tech use case of baking the town’s best range of cupcakes, a user would say in a user story, “As a <em>cupcake seller</em>, I want <em>more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter</em>, so that <em>the cupcakes will be tastier</em> <em>for cupcake eaters</em>.”</p><p>In this user story, the “cupcake seller” is the description of the user, “more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter” is the functionality requested and “the cupcakes will be tastier for cupcake eaters” is the benefit of the functionality.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg" alt="Putting cupcake batter into the cupcake mold." srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg?v=1597029413 960w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-300x200.jpg?v=1597029413 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-768x512.jpg?v=1597029413 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-600x400.jpg?v=1597029413 600w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-old-src="//www.iunera.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter.jpg?v=1597029413 960w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-300x200.jpg?v=1597029413 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-768x512.jpg?v=1597029413 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-batter-600x400.jpg?v=1597029413 600w"><figcaption>Hypothesis testing can be applied to making a good cupcake batter for delicious cupcakes.<br>Image Source: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/baking-cupcakes-cake-batter-4020041/" target="_blank">Alice_Engelbrink</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The baker would test the hypothesis that more vanilla essence in the cupcake batter would result in tastier cupcakes. The baker would experiment with several batches of cupcake batters with different amounts of vanilla essence, and then, record the data to analyse if more or less vanilla essence is better.</p><p>The baker would repeat experiments for other user stories about other cupcake features like the amounts of sugar, flour, ground flaxseed, water, colouring, oven temperature, flavouring and icing.</p><p>The same can be done in software development. Let’s look at it from the lens of a customer service colleague who is logging an issue about an online shopping app feature as a user story in the use case of improving the online shopping app.</p><p>This user would say, “As a <em>customer service representative</em>, I want <em>the</em> <em>quantity of items in the shopping cart to be changeable</em>, so that <em>the customers can buy more than one of the same product</em>“.</p><p>The software developer would then experiment with hypothetical ways to enable the quantity of items to change from 0 or 1 to the maximum number in stock.</p><hr><h2 id="2-agile-cuts-time-consuming-planning-and-speeds-up-turnaround-of-projects">Agile cuts time-consuming planning and speeds up turnaround of projects</h2><p>Frameworks based on Agile including Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, Feature-Driven Development and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) may emulate the adaptivity encouraged by Agile Software Development.</p><p>But they don’t necessarily have to be followed if they don’t necessarily meet the needs of failing faster, getting results faster and deploying software faster to give value to the customer faster.</p><p>That’s the beauty of the Agile approach. Nothing has to be concrete from the start and adjustments can be made along the way. Especially when there’s uncertainty about data availability, no time is wasted on excessive planning and documentation, and instead, more time is spent on pleasing the end-user.</p><h3 id="3-data-science-specific-practices-based-on-agile-values-will-eventually-be-developed-in-research">Data Science-specific practices based on Agile Values will eventually be developed in research</h3><p>Christos commented that the emergence of new Data Science-oriented practices will drive the application of Agile in the research domain.</p><p>“The focus there is about delivering business requirements, in the form of features and products, fast in a volatile, constantly evolving environment.”</p><p>“To support this, a number of underpinning practices have been developed, covering areas like modelling and design, coding and testing, risk handling and quality assurance.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Some of these underpinning practices can directly be transferred in the Data Science world (e.g. user stories and backlogs, timeboxing and retrospectives).”</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1596795332" alt="Waterfall vs Agile Process" srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1597029378 1024w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-300x225.jpg?v=1597029378 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-768x576.jpg?v=1597029378 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1536x1152.jpg?v=1597029378 1536w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o.jpg?v=1597029378 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="//www.iunera.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1596795332" data-srcset="https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1024x768.jpg?v=1597029378 1024w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-300x225.jpg?v=1597029378 300w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-768x576.jpg?v=1597029378 768w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o-1536x1152.jpg?v=1597029378 1536w, https://www.iunera.com/wp-content/uploads/8746306184_502e6dcccf_o.jpg?v=1597029378 1728w"><figcaption>Christos said that, for data scientists, Agile is mostly about adjusting to the requirement of working in a way to deliver business value from their experimentation.<br>Image Source: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/visualpunch/8746306184/in/photostream/" target="_blank">visualpun.ch</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>“So, a clear benefit of trying to apply Agile in Data Science is that gradually, similar Data Science-specific underpinning practices will eventually be developed and these will, of course, be based on the same Agile drives: adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery and continual improvement, and more generally, flexible responses to change.”</p><hr><h2 id="4-the-downsides-of-the-agile-approach-in-data-science">The downsides of the Agile approach in data science</h2><p>However, Agile may not work for everyone and for every situation. When we asked him about the downsides, he said that people tend to wrongly assume that Agile is the only way a team can work and be productive when it’s not.</p><p>“Ever since Agile emerged—in the concrete form that we know it today through the Agile manifesto—many hurried to undermine the effectiveness of other development models, e.g. Waterfall.”</p><p>“There is nothing wrong with the Waterfall model either; the real question is whether these practices or models are fit for purpose! There are surely research projects as well as business requirements around the delivery of software that could potentially be delivered through the Waterfall approach or maybe through a combination of the two.”</p><p>To this, he recommended that project managers and teams should strive to increase their effectiveness and efficiency.</p><p>“If that can be done by building on top of the Agile values then great; if not, then maybe they will need to try and come up with a different formula.”</p><blockquote><p>“People focusing too much on what Agile is and what is not—if it needs to be Scrum or Kanban or if too much documentation or too much time spent in design is not Agile—are bound to make mistakes.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h3 id="5-the-agile-industrial-complex">The Agile Industrial Complex</h3><p>He also agreed that the imposition of Agile on teams, i.e. The Agile Industrial Complex, is defeating the purpose of Agile in finding what works best for teams in working adaptively.</p><p>“Once more, I can’t stress enough how there is no single perfect development model. Project managers need to always assess what is fit for purpose.”</p><p>“Primarily though, they should focus on the underpinning values and principles that Agile or other development models are characterised by. When they do, a recurrent mistake that I have experienced through my consulting career is the oversimplification of Agile as an anti-methodology, anti-documentation and anti-planning development model.”</p><p>“I appreciate that this makes understanding Agile much easier, but at the same time it is a very unfair representation of what Agile is!

<p>I <a href="https://reeve.blog/blog/principles/">recently argued</a> that 80% of a product manager’s job is to discover the right product to build and drive organizational alignment. At the same time, ‘product discovery’ is often the most nebulous part of the job. So how&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;great product managers do this? While product discovery will never be easy, I’ll outline a simple yet effective framework that I use.</p>



<p>There are many great books about product discovery. They also tend to be complicated and tricky to reference day-to-day. So over time, I’ve tried to simplify this, and I’ve distilled it down into what I call the “Five P’s.” In my experience, all five have to be defined and considered when deciding what to build:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the mission of your company or product?</li><li><strong>Problem: </strong>What is the customer or user problem we’re solving?</li><li><strong>Pattern:</strong> How many people are impacted by this problem?</li><li><strong>Prose: </strong>What is the narrative for how solving this problem benefits the customer and our business?</li><li><strong>Priority: </strong>How important is this solving this problem vs. other problems on which we could focus?</li></ul>







<p>Your purpose is why your company or product exists, reflected as a mission and strategy. Without this, you’re flying blind. There’s no use in identifying the auto industry’s most common problems if your mission is to create the world’s leading crypto bank:</p>



<ol><li>A <strong>mission</strong> statement is what you’re trying to accomplish. E.g., <em>Plant a billion trees on each continent to offset the world’s carbon emissions. </em>A mission statement should be concise, opinionated, inspiring, and action-oriented (i.e., begin with a verb.)</li><li>A <strong>strategy</strong> is how you’re going to achieve your mission. E.g., <em>Identify suitable land, build irrigation systems, procure seeds and fertilizer, sow seeds by helicopter.</em></li><li><strong>Vision</strong> and mission are easily confused. Think of vision as defining what the world will look like when you’ve achieved your mission.<em> </em>E.g., <em>we’ve offset the world’s carbon emissions by 30%, providing cleaner air to billions of people.</em></li></ol>



<p>Investing time in defining a purpose may seem abstract. Still, it’s critical: Having a clear and compelling mission and strategy inspires a product team and points discovery efforts in the right direction. For product “tracks” within larger companies, the track’s purpose should contribute to the company’s purpose. Boz (VP at Facebook) wrote a great article on mission and strategy <a href="https://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics">here</a>.</p>







<p>The core part of effective product management is identifying pain within the context of your mission and strategy. What problems do your target customers have? Why do people like or not like your product? Are your customers asking for something?</p>



<p>Problems can surface qualitatively or quantitatively:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> This might include user experience research, a customer call series, feature requests from users, input from your team or stakeholders, competitor research, or your own product judgment. To paraphrase <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ablue/">Allen Blue</a>, look for places where your target customers are already “duct-taping” things together.</li><li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> What you’ve identified through studying trends in your metrics. Product managers should study their metrics daily to understand how the product is performing and identify problems and opportunities.</li></ul>



<p>Customers will often tell you the solution, not the problem. They’re trying to be helpful. But well-intentioned customers usually don’t know what’s possible, nor what will work best for your product. Asking the right questions can help identify the problem:</p>



<ul><li>If you get X, what will it help you do?</li><li>What happens if you don’t get X?</li><li>If you don’t get X, how will you achieve Y?</li></ul>



<p>Be careful in situations where there’s a “layer” between you and the user. Suppose the person you’re talking with is an intermediary (e.g., the buyer or someone who administers the product within a company): In this scenario, they may not understand the experience from the end user’s perspective. Be mindful of who is answering your questions.</p>



<p>Finally, while many formal research functions support the discovery process (product marketing, user research, etc.), a deep understanding of the customer can’t be delegated to another function. Great product managers have strong opinions and intuition; this comes from being exposed to raw feedback, e.g., attending customer calls, studying metrics, and talking to users.</p>







<p>Most of the time, product managers are looking for systemic issues that impact a large percentage of your target customers. We can define ‘systemic’ in different ways: The number of customers with a problem, the value of the customers who have the problem (e.g., how much they spend with you), or whether they are uniquely significant (e.g., a prominent “brand name”).</p>



<p>There are going to be situations where solving an isolated problem is the right call. You might choose to build something purely because a critical customer is asking for it. You might prioritize something for a small but essential cohort of users (e.g., power users or promoters). These are fine, but they should be the exception, not the norm.</p>







<p>The word ‘prose’ underscores the importance of looking beyond a singular metric. Don’t get me wrong, moving metrics is crucial, and I spend a lot of time doing just that, but they aren’t exhaustive. Too often, I see product teams focusing on tuning a singular metric without considering the entire ecosystem or whether something is the right long-term investment as part of a broader mission and strategy. </p>



<p>Even worse, product teams may shy away from building a great product because they can’t predict the quantitative impact of building it. <strong>In practice, you often won’t be able to accurately predict the metric impact of shipping a brand new product or making a step-function change.</strong> </p>



<p>Persuasive prose forces product teams to consider both the quantitative and qualitative effects of building something <em>and</em> how it ties to a broader mission and strategy. It underscores the value of having a clear and compelling narrative for understanding:</p>



<ol><li>What the problem is.</li><li>Why the problem should be solved.</li><li>How the problem will be solved.</li><li>The qualitative and quantitative impact of solving the problem.</li><li>How solving the problem contributes to a broader mission and strategy.</li></ol>



<p><strong>I’ll touch on the two main tools I use when working with ‘prose’:</strong></p>



<p><strong>The first you’re probably familiar with, which is the hypothetical external press release, </strong><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html"><strong>popularized by Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The press release explains what the product is, why it exists, and the features and benefits. It’s a compelling articulation of the value that the product delivers to the customer and the market. If it isn’t compelling, you may either not be solving the right problem, or not have the right product to solve it.</p>



<p><strong>But I’m guessing you haven’t heard of the second application of ‘prose’:</strong> The concept is similar, but it’s an <em>internal</em><strong><em> </em></strong>press release. Imagine you’re summarizing the “why,” “what,” and “how” to your CEO. Articulate the problem you’re solving, how it ties to broader mission and strategy, how you’re going to solve it, and the impact that solving it will have on your business. This internal press release will narrate what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and support it with qualitative and quantitative data. And yes, for any significant decision, you should share it! This exercise identifies incongruencies in your logic, and it will also help communicate the value of doing something.</p>







<p>Prioritization is conceptually simple. In practice, it’s harder and often imprecise, a mixture of art and science. Usually, it’s about the cost versus benefit.</p>



<ul><li><strong>First, we want to understand the impact of solving a problem:</strong> How much will it move a given metric? How many customers have asked for this? Will this increase retention? Will it unlock a portion of the market?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Second, we need to have a sense of how much solving it will cost:</strong> How many engineering weeks are required to build the solution? What are the support and marketing costs?</li></ul>



<p>There are many prioritization frameworks, including <a href="https://medium.com/@nimay/inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-impact-confidence-ease-and-gist-5180434e5b15">ICE</a>, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/guides/product-prioritization-techniques-product-managers/">RICE, and many others</a>. Still, I’ve found that they often miss the need for product teams to balance multiple distinct success metrics and “themes” of work. I’ve had success with a slightly augmented version of ICE that I’ve eloquently named <strong>MICE</strong> (Metric, Impact, Confidence, Ease.)</p>



<ul><li><strong>Metric: </strong>What is the importance of the metric that this feature will move? E.g., do we care more about improving activation, or more about retention?</li><li><strong>Impact: </strong>What is the impact of solving this problem based on the pattern you’ve identified?</li><li><strong>Confidence: </strong>What is our confidence in this impact?</li><li><strong>Ease: </strong>How easy is this problem to solve? (An inverse of cost, higher is cheaper.)</li><li>Multiply M*I*C*E, and sort from highest to lowest.</li></ul>



<p>A prioritization framework will give you a way of loosely sorting what you <em>could</em> work on, but it’s a supplement for judgment, not a replacement. “Because the framework said so” isn’t a valid reason for prioritizing something. Prioritization is always a balancing act between data, intuition, and stakeholder alignment.</p>



<p>Always remember that teams are comprised of people, and people are better when they aren’t stretched thin across multiple contexts. Set a theme for the quarter (e.g., we’re going to nail this particular customer type or user persona), and focus on making material progress within that theme, instead of trying to solve a dozen problems for a dozen different customer segments. Great focus yields great results.</p>







<p>Someday, I’ll write a longer piece about driving organizational alignment (which is just a fancy way of saying “getting people to agree that this is the right thing to build”). Still, it’s so important that this article wouldn’t be complete without touching on it.</p>



<p>Organizational alignment has to start early, and often. The mechanics are incredibly variable, but there are a few unavoidable pieces:</p>



<ul><li><strong>1-1 conversations: </strong>Asking a group of 10 people, “what do you think about this?” isn’t how you create alignment and understanding. In my …</li></ul></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<p><em>This article was published in The Seybold Report Volume 30 Number 6, November 2000. It was a strange time when QuickDraw GX 3rd party developments like Japanese stroke fonts and plug-in font scalers were up in the air without a clear migration path to the newly announced MacOS X ATSUI Carbon framework, OpenType Japanese fonts and InDesign J had been announced but were months away from shipping, and Japanese print customers were angry with Adobe and Morisawa for forcing font upgrades on everybody. It’s a snapshot of Japanese publishing in transition as Steve Jobs was saving Apple and tossing the Japanese print market a few morsels like extended Japanese glyph sets, Adobe was caught flat footed and was furious with Apple.</em></p>



<hr>



<p>Japanese DTP arrived with Apple’s NTX-J PostScript printer and Linotype’s first Japanese PostScript imagesetter in 1989. They came at the right time: The early- ’90s economy was bubbling, companies had money to burn and Japanese DTP took off. It was a young, booming market and it forgave many mistakes that would haunt the industry later.</p>



<p>By 1996, the go-go days were gone and they would not come back. By this time, DTP tools (Quark Xpress, Illustrator, Photoshop and, to a smaller extent, PageMaker) had captured nearly 40 percent of the production process. For a conservative industry like Japanese publishing, this was phenomenal―until compared to the West. There, in the same amount of time, practically the entire industry converted to DTP production. Japan is still about 40 percent and holding.</p>



<p>What happened? Three things: the economy, the failure of Western technology to address Japanese issues, and the same old cultural differences Westerners have been running into since Commodore Perry knocked down the doors in 1853. They just do things differently here, get used to it.</p>



<p>The economic crunch hit the publishing market hard, and it hasn’t really recovered. Consider the book and magazine market: On average, this year’s revenues are down 3.4 percent over last year.</p>

<p>Basically, the publishing industry overextended itself in the bubble years of the early ’90s and is still adjusting.</p>



<p>Some of the difficulty is the publication distribution structure. Anybody in the business will tell you there just isn’t enough shelf space and return rates are climbing. Internet publishing is not much of a factor yet. Japanese book retail laws, which prohibit stores from selling below suggested retail prices, will be relaxed soon and will put tremendous pressure on the current price structure, which supports lots of marginally profitable items</p>



<p>The Japanese market is also a highly segmented one. There are the major newspapers, which have very specialized workflow systems and in-house fonts. There is the book industry, which runs the gamut from standard tanko bon hardbacks to the ingenious, very popular pocket-size bunko hon paperbacks (which really have no equal in the West). There are lots of printers, using both DTP and traditional systems, that cover everything in-between. In a class of their own are manga: the hefty weekly comic books you can find on subway luggage racks, left there by salarymen too embarrassed to take them home.</p>

<p>On the whole, the industry is still in a slump and has been treading water for the last few years, with relatively little investment in new technologies such as computer-to-plate. At the same time, competition and consolidation in the printing sector have forced prices down-more than 30 percent in the past year alone-so there is a great need to reduce production costs and increase efficiency. This is the great challenge of the Japanese publishing industry. Meeting it will require new investment in hardware and software. The challenge for vendors is to provide the right products. Those who watch the market and listen to customers carefully will find opportunity.</p>



<p><strong>The font technology failure</strong><br>A designer once said, “Fonts are like air.” They are the environment in which DTP lives and thrives. Compared to the West, the Japanese DTP air is pretty thin.</p>



<p>One of the great tragedies was the refusal of <a href="https://atadistance.net/2020/04/25/requiem-for-shaken/" data-type="post" data-id="44199">Shaken KK</a>, the largest, most popular, and perhaps most beautiful Japanese font library, to license its faces to Adobe or have anything to do with PostScript. It kept its proprietary machines and formats, losing over 40 percent of its market share (and lots of prestige and talent) in the bargain. The industry is filled with ex-Shaken people. A low point came a year and a half ago when tax raiders found several safes in the company basement filled with 10,000-yen bills; the president of Shaken, Yuko Ishii had stashed away the money in the early ’80s and was now reporting it as profit.</p>



<p>This sorry state of affairs had two huge repercussions. It denied a large part of the Japanese font legacy to designers working with DTP. (Imagine a world without Helvetica and Times and you get the idea.) It also left the only other competitor, Morisawa, which did license its library to Adobe, with a practical monopoly. But these were not the only problems.</p>



<p><strong>Initial problems</strong><br>The first implementation of Japanese PostScript Type 1 fonts had serious shortcomings. First of all, they could not be downloaded on a per-job basis, but had to reside permanently on the printer. This turned the production process upside down; service bureaus and printers were suddenly dictating to designers which fonts could and could not be used. For every PostScript device, users had to invest in font licenses― and Japanese fonts are very expensive. In a market where making a single face can easily require ¥30,000,000 (about $280,000) and consume two years, font vendors made sure they got maximum return on their investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To this end, Morisawa and Adobe came up with the idea of marketing two flavors of PostScript printer fonts: low-resolution (up to 600 dpi) and unlimited. A single unlimited-resolution Japanese font costs ¥218,000 (about $2,000).</p>



<p>The situation became more complex when ATM J arrived on the scene in late 1993. Morisawa’s ATM fonts used hardware binding to lock the font to the hard disk. This resulted in a high maintenance operation, because hardware binding required installer floppies for each font and for every CPU. (This remains true even today.) If the user got a new hard disk, he had to send the old floppies back to the vendor and exchange them, for a fee, for new ones. Large operations had the extra burden of keeping track of the floppy that had been installed on each CPU. On top of all this, each installation took time; putting a family of 15 Kanji fonts on two or three Macs could easily eat up a day.</p>



<p>In addition, compared to traditional systems, these fonts had primitive typographic features: lack of pair kerning, lack of proper metrics and poor Gaiji support. (Gaiji are Kanji characters outside of the current JIS [Japanese Industrial Standard] and Unicode encoding sets and are not included in a standard font. They comprise many “unofficial” Kanji characters, mistakes and misinterpretations, and seldom used Kanji passed down for generations, long before printing presses and governments created standards.</p>



<p>These Gaiji characters are widely used in people and place names. To this day, they are a reason for publishers to hang on to their proprietary systems. Last but not least, Japanese PostScript fonts were not cross platform.</p>



<p><strong>The first fix</strong><br>Adobe has been trying to fix the font problem. Its first attempt was CID (character-key ID). CID divorced two-byte PostScript fonts from dependence on any encoding scheme and allowed character subsets to be downloaded to the printer on a job basis, laying the foundation for PDF font embedding in Japanese Acrobat 4.0 as well.</p>



<p>Unfortunately the CID font upgrade was a marketing washout. Upgrades were not cheap, and there were few benefits the end user could really see. Morisawa also decided to tweak some glyph designs and the font metrics. Designers would open old files with the new fonts and find they had to redo everything. They stayed away in droves. As a result, the installed base is still overwhelmingly OCF (original composite font), which has slowed acceptance of PDF as a major production format.</p>



<p><strong>Dueling fixes</strong><br>Adobe’s final solution for the Japanese font problem is OpenType. OpenType will be a very big deal and, in the long term, fundamentally change the market. OpenType finally brings true font parity between Windows and Mac. Morisawa and Fontworks are busy preparing OpenType upgrades. It marks the first time their font libraries will be available cross-platform. Both companies see Windows as an opportunity for revenue growth―something that has been missing on the Mac side for years. Users will finally be able to choose the platform that best fits their needs and budgets without worrying about font problems.</p>



<p>This will be especially interesting because Mac OS X and OpenType are both arriving in 2001. According to a Japanese Publishing Consortium survey in 1999, Apple has nearly 80 percent of the DTP installed base. However, a large share of the machines in the printing and publishing areas (but not in design) are pre-G3 PowerPC systems that will have to be upgraded to run Mac OS X. Apple Japan’s “We’ll let the market decide” marketing statements may become a true nightmare if the market chooses Windows instead of Mac OS X</p>



<p><strong>Adobe Japan 1-4</strong><br>The most important feature of Japanese OpenType will be the Adobe Japan 1-4 character collection. This is the big Gaiji fix everybody has been waiting for. AJ 1-4 addresses the Gaiji encoding problem and provides a consistent and cross-platform way for font developers to add Gaiji to OpenType fonts. Adobe says the collection …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>While working on <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault’s</a> <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/playground/go">Go Playground</a>, I came across a very strange error. The standard library’s <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/?m=all#Printf" rel="noopener">fmt.Printf()</a> function prints nothing to the console when called. <em>Nothing.</em></p>



<p>For those of you who are familiar with the function, when compiled to a “normal” executable <code>fmt.Printf</code> prints a formatted string to standard output. As per the official documentation, this program:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const name, age = "Kim", 22
	fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.", name, age)
}</code></pre>



<p>Will print:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<p>The interesting thing is that when the same exact program is compiled using Web Assembly, we get a different result. If you want to try it, copy the above program and run it <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/playground/go">here</a>.</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: <em>It doesn’t print anything.</em></p>



<p>However, if you change the program slightly:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const name, age = "Kim", 22
	// add a newline character
	fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", name, age)
}</code></pre>



<p>Then it may print the expected:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<p> thought if you run the two programs back to back, you may actually find that this is printed instead:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Kim is 22 years old.Kim is 22 years old.</code></pre>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>When compiled to Web Assembly, the <code>fmt.Printf</code> function is writing to a buffer, and that buffer is not cleared until a newline character is printed to standard out. In other words, you can call <code>fmt.Printf</code> as many times as you want, but nothing is printed until a <code>\n</code> character comes through standard output.</p>



<p>Take a look at the <code>writeSync()</code> code in Go’s <a href="https://github.com/lane-c-wagner/classroom.qvault.io/blob/master/public/wasm_exec.js#L43">wasm_exec.js</a>, which is a required include to execute Go Web Assembly in the browser:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">writeSync(fd, buf) {
	outputBuf += decoder.decode(buf);
	const nl = outputBuf.lastIndexOf("\n");
	if (nl != -1) {
		console.log(outputBuf.substr(0, nl));
		outputBuf = outputBuf.substr(nl + 1);
	}
	return buf.length;
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, <code>console.log()</code> is only called on the buffer if a newline is found within the output string, otherwise the output is just appended to the stateful <code>outputBuf</code>.</p>



<p>My current working theory is that it was implemented this way because there is no way to print to the console in a browser without appending a newline. JavaScript’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log" rel="noopener">console.log()</a> <em>always </em>appends a newline.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>This time the post is inspired by the proposal of <a href="https://github.com/Arkoniak">Andrey Oskin</a>
(thank you for submitting it, below I have adapted business problem description
and <code>dplyr</code> source codes that Andrey provided).</p>

<p>Andrey shared with me typical tasks that he is faced with when doing logs
analysis. To make things concrete, assume that you have a site and you collect
users’ clicks. In the output of this process you get a table with two fields:
time of click (<code>ts</code> column below, measured in seconds) and the user identifier
(<code>user_id</code> column below).</p>

<p>Given such data there are natural business questions, that we can ask, like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How many sessions an average user has?</li>
  <li>How many users have exactly two sessions?</li>
  <li>Find top 10 users, ordered by the descending number of sessions?</li>
  <li>What is the average time between sessions start?</li>
</ol>

<p>Session in these questions is a more or less arbitrary thing, usually,
it has a meaning of sequence of events that come together as there is
a short time difference between consecutive events. In the examples we
assume that if a user has not clicked on our site for 900 seconds after the last
click the session is over.</p>

<p>What I do in this post is take a toy data set that has this structure and
<code>dplyr</code> codes that Andrey shared with me that answer the business questions
presented above and rewrite them to DataFrames.jl.</p>

<p>The objective of this post is to compare the syntaxes of <code>dplyr</code> and
DataFrames.jl. Therefore neither <code>dplyr</code> nor DataFrames.jl codes were tuned
to be optimal. Rather I have just taken what Andrey proposed in <code>dplyr</code> and
translated it to DataFrames.jl in a way that first came to my mind (but trying
to use piping). However, in the last part of the post I out of curiosity I
decided compare the performance of the codes.</p>

<p>All codes were  tested under R version 4.0.2 and dplyr 1.0.0.
For Julia I used version 1.5.0-rc1.0 and packages: DataFrames.jl 0.21.4,
Pipe.jl 1.3.0, and ShiftedArrays 1.0.0. If you do not have much experience
with setting-up Julia project environments, in <a href="https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2020/06/28/automatic-project-environments.html">this post</a> I give
a simple recipe how you can do it easily while ensuring you use exactly the same
versions of the packages as I do.</p>



<p>In the first step we load the required packages, create a data frame that
will be used later and sort it by the <code>ts</code> column.</p>

<p>In all examples in this post I first present R code, and then Julia code.
The expected output is shown in a comment. After each step I briefly comment
on the Julia code.</p>

<p>In this step I used two things that are worth learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code>@pipe</code> macro from the Pipes.jl package allows to pass result of the left
hand side of <code>|&gt;</code> to the right hand side in the position where <code>_</code> is placed.
In this case <code>_</code> is a first argument to <code>sort</code>.</li>
  <li>I used <code>DataFrame!</code> constructor; the <code>!</code> in this case means that columns
passed to a freshly constructed data frame <em>are not copied</em> (by default
<code>DataFrame</code> constructor copies passed columns for safety).</li>
</ul>



<p>So the first task is to identify sessions in our data. For each user
a <code>session_id</code> column gives a number of session for this user, starting from
zero. Remember, that we assume that a fresh session starts for some user, if
two consecutive events for this user are separated by at least 900 seconds.</p>

<p>Now I could have rewritten the <code>dpyr</code> code to DataFrames.jl in many ways, but
a most natural thing to do it was for me to use the following syntax:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>combine(source_column =&gt; transformation_function, grouped_data_frame)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>With this approach I can conveniently define an anonymous function
within a <code>begin</code>-<code>end</code> block and return a <code>(ts=ts, session_id=session_id)</code> value
that is a <code>NamedTuple</code> and will get expanded into two columns of a data frame.</p>

<p>I use <code>ungroup=false</code> syntax to keep the result a <code>GroupedDataFrame</code> to match
what we get in <code>dplyr</code>.</p>

<p>Also, in the code of the function I use the <code>lag</code> function from ShiftedArrays.jl.</p>

<p>Now we have all information to answer our business questions.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} =  A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger}\]

\[\begin{align}
(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} &amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}B &amp; A_{0,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0,n-1}B \\
    A_{1,0}B &amp; A_{1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1,n-1}B \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{m-1,0}B &amp; A_{m-1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{m-1,n-1}B \\
\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger} 
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    (A_{0,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,0}B)^{\dagger} \\
    (A_{0,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,1}B)^{\dagger} \\

\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \overline{A_{0,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,0}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \overline{A_{0,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,1}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    \overline{A_{0,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{0,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    A_{1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{n-1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{n-1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{n-1,m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;=
A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-mixed-product-property">Kronecker Product Mixed-Product Property</h4>

<p>Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{C}^{r \times s}$, $C \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$, and $D \in \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$, then</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)(C \otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\]

</p><p>This has been proved in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker Product In Circuits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-expansion-property">Inner Product Expansion Property</h4>

<p>Suppose $|x\rangle$ is any unit vector whose $|x|^2 = \langle x | x \rangle = 1$. We have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) &amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)^{\dagger} (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | x \rangle^{\dagger}) (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger}|\phi\rangle) \otimes (| x \rangle^{\dagger}|x\rangle) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle x | x \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes 1\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-matrix-preserves-inner-product">Unitary Matrix Preserves Inner Product</h4>

<p>Given two complex vectors $x$ and $y$, multiplication by unitary matrix $U$ preserves their inner product.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= \langle x, y \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Using the definition of inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= (Uy)^{\dagger} (Ux) \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}U^{\dagger} U x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}(U^{\dagger} U) x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} I x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;= \langle x, y \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="no-cloning-theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p><p>

\[| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle \xrightarrow[]{U} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p><p>

\[U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the “vacant” system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \phi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that “copying” any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such “copy” operator, the mathematical expression for “copy” will be as follows.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\\
U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi^{\prime}} | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= e^{\varphi} e^{\varphi^{\prime}}\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle| &amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}}| |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= 1 |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle |^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum “copy” operator that makes “copy” of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p><p>

\[U(| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p><p>

\[U(| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle x | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} | x \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle x | x \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

<p>For more than two millennia, Western thinkers have separated emotion from cognition – emotion being the poorer sibling of the two. Cognition helps to explain the nature of space-time and sends humans to the Moon. Emotion might save the lioness in the savannah, but it also makes humans act irrationally with disconcerting frequency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the quest to create intelligent robots, designers tend to focus on purely rational, cognitive capacities. It’s tempting to disregard emotion entirely, or include only as much as necessary. But without emotion to help determine the personal significance of objects and actions, I doubt that true intelligence can exist – not the kind that beats human opponents at chess or the game of Go, but the sort of smarts that we humans recognise as such. Although we can refer to certain behaviours as either ‘emotional’ or ‘cognitive’, this is really a linguistic short-cut. The two can’t be teased apart.</p>



<p>What counts as sophisticated, intelligent behaviour in the first place? Consider a crew of robots on a mission to Mars. To act intelligently, the robots can’t just scuttle about taking pictures of the environment and collecting dirt and mineral samples. They’d need to be able to figure out how to reach a target destination, and come up with alternative tactics if the most direct path is blocked. If pressed for time, the team of robots would have to know which materials are more important and to be prioritised as part of the expedition.</p>



<p>Part of being intelligent, then, is about the ability to function autonomously in various conditions and environments. Emotion is helpful here because it allows an agent to piece together the most significant kinds of information. For example, emotion can <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-sociable-robots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instil</a> a sense of urgency in actions and decisions. Imagine crossing a patch of desert in an unreliable car, during the hottest hours of the day. If the vehicle breaks down, what you need is a quick fix to get you to the next town, not a more permanent solution that might be perfect but could take many hours to complete in the beating sun. In real-world scenarios, a ‘good’ outcome is often all that’s required, but without the external pressure of perceiving a ‘stressful’ situation, an android might take too long trying to find the optimal solution.</p>



<p>Most <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195166194.001.0001/acprof-9780195166194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposals</a> for emotion in robots involve the addition of a separate ‘emotion module’ – some sort of bolted-on affective architecture that can influence other abilities such as perception and cognition. The idea would be to give the agent access to an enriched set of properties, such as the urgency of an action or the meaning of facial expressions. These properties could help to determine issues such as which visual objects should be processed first, what memories should be recollected, and which decisions will lead to better outcomes.</p>



<p>But research from the behavioural and brain sciences suggests that emotion is not just an ‘added feature’ layered on top of ‘standard’ cognition. Instead, it’s an integral part of our cognitive machinery. In one of the <a href="http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0904551106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experiments</a> from my lab, people in a scanner watched videos of rapid, flashed-up images of either a house or a skyscraper. They had to identify which of these scenes was present in the video, a task designed to be very difficult. We then introduced an element of emotional manipulation. Before viewing the clips, half of the participants received a mild electric shock while viewing a series of skyscrapers; the other half, instead, watched a series of houses appear, paired with the same mild shock. This is what’s known as <em>classical conditioning</em>, and links an initially neutral stimulus (a nondescript picture) with the emotional meaning of the unpleasant stimulus (the shock).</p>



<p>The outcome: participants conditioned to the skyscrapers were better at detecting them than at detecting houses; conversely, participants conditioned to houses detected those better than they did skyscrapers. And in each case, responses in the visual cortex were stronger for the type of stimulus (house or skyscraper) to which participants had been conditioned. This study shows that perception is not a passive process that merely reflects the external world. Rather, it involves picking up on the significance of objects, and determines how they are processed. Vision is never neutral, it is always laden with affective meaning.</p>



<p>It’s the architecture of the brain, with its short- and long-range connections, that allows these properties to emerge. Emotion doesn’t come about from local computations in a single region, such as the amygdala, which is frequently called the ‘emotion centre’ in the brain. Instead, anatomical <a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1238406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> have revealed that the areas in the brain associated with perception, cognition, emotion, motivation, action and bodily sensations are closely <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2017.03.002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intertwined</a>. Looking at the brain as a complex network helps to clarify why some brain structures, such as the amygdala, are important for emotion: they’re hubs, much like major airports that link to a very large number of destinations. As a consequence, these regions can influence and be influenced by many parts of the brain – which also suggests that it’s not possible to subtract emotion without affecting cognition.</p>



<p>The point is <em>not</em> that emotion is needed for intelligent, autonomous robots – the answer is yes – but that emotion needs to be hooked up to everything that goes on in a cognitive system. Emotion is not an ‘add-on’ module that endows a robot with feelings or allows it to express an internal state, such as the current risk of overheating. Its integration is a design principle of the information-processing architecture. Without emotion, no being that we might create can have any hope of aspiring to true intelligence.</p>

<p>Work hard, become successful, <em>then</em> you’ll be happy. At least, that’s what many of us were taught by our parents, teachers and peers. The idea that we must pursue success in order to experience happiness is enshrined in the United States’ most treasured institutions (the Declaration of Independence), beliefs (the American dream), and stories (<em>Rocky</em> and Cinderella). Most people <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11392863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">want</a> to be happy, so we chase success like a proverbial carrot on a stick – thinking that contentment lurks just the other side of getting into college, landing a dream job, being promoted or making six figures. But for many chasers, both success and happiness remain perpetually out of reach. The problem is that the equation might be backwards. </p>



<p>Our <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069072707308140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypothesis</a> is that happiness precedes and leads to career success – not the other way around. In psychological <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232577536_Subjective_Well-Being_Three_Decades_of_Progress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">science</a>, ‘happiness’ relates to ‘subjective wellbeing’ and ‘positive emotions’ (we use the terms interchangeably). Those with greater wellbeing tend to be more satisfied with their lives, and also to experience more positive emotions and fewer negative ones. Research <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069072717751441?journalCode=jcaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggests</a> that it’s these positive emotions – such as excitement, joy, and serenity – that promote success in the workplace.</p>



<p>Let’s look first at the cross-sectional studies that examine people at a single point. This allows researchers to determine whether happiness and success are correlated. Relative to their glummer peers, happier people are more satisfied with their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/096317909X478557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jobs</a>; they also receive greater <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879196915560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social support</a> from co-workers and better <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199901)20:1%3C1::AID-JOB885%3E3.0.CO;2-W" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performance evaluations</a> from supervisors. Notably, it might be that bosses give happy employees higher performance evaluations due to a halo effect, where a favourable impression in one area (such as happiness) influences opinion in another area (such as work ability): eg, ‘Tim is happy, so he must be great at his job too.’ However, there’s also some evidence that people with higher wellbeing perform better on a range of work-related tasks: one pivotal <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232497771_Explanatory_Style_as_a_Predictor_of_Productivity_and_Quitting_Among_Life_Insurance_Sales_Agents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that sales agents with a more positive outlook sold 37 per cent more life-insurance policies than their less positive colleagues.</p>



<p>Happiness is associated with excellent work performance in <a href="http://www.shawnachor.com/the-books/the-happiness-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other areas</a> as well. People who frequently experience positive emotions <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.01017.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tend to</a> go above and beyond for their organisations; they’re also less likely to be <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10717919070130020401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absent</a> from work or <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-03046-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quit</a> their jobs. People with better wellbeing also tend to earn bigger <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1014411319119.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">salaries</a> than those with lower wellbeing.</p>



<p>However, such cross-sectional research has its limits, since it can’t establish which comes first – happiness or success. Longitudinal studies can help here, as they follow people over days, weeks, months or years to see how they’ve changed over time. According to the longitudinal literature, people who start out happy eventually become successful, too. The more content a person is at an earlier point in time, the more likely she is to be clear later on about what <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879105001016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kind of job</a> she wants, as well as to fill out more <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/peps.12027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job applications</a>, and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167212444906?casa_token=vPK_H2R02nQAAAAA:K-Q5uKmbRhlEekZ_6XOcUQ522go9OJ79pRU-bZ6umWZGfzJ34ThuC7lW5HwJ0hP8Ky9y65R_V05O-bo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find</a> employment. A key <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1005539609679.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that young people who reported higher wellbeing than their peers just before graduating from college were more likely to receive follow-up job interviews three months later.</p>



<p>Positive emotions are also predictors of later achievement and earnings. In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12635918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, happy 18-year-olds were more likely to be working in prestigious, satisfying jobs and to feel financially secure by age 26. In <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1019672513984.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a>, people who were more cheerful when starting college went on to have higher incomes.</p>



<p>But it’s not enough to establish that happiness comes <em>before</em> success; we want to know, does one <em>cause</em> the other? After all, there could be some unmeasured variable, such as intelligence or extraversion, that’s driving both wellbeing and work performance. Indeed, extraverts are more likely both to be <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7449572_Personality_and_the_Prediction_of_Consequential_Outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">happy</a> and to earn <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9914.2010.00477.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greater incomes</a>.</p>



<p>Well-designed experiments can control for these variables. For example, studies have randomly assigned people to situations that make them feel neutral, negative or positive emotional states, and then measured their subsequent performance on work-related tasks. These <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experiments</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1986-29171-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed</a> that people who are made to feel positive emotions set more ambitious goals, persist at challenging tasks for longer, view themselves and others more favourably, and believe they will succeed. Happy people’s optimistic expectations appear to be realistic, too: on both <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1990.tb00417.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clerical-coding</a> assignments and <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00992168.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digit-substitution</a> tasks, people with positive emotions <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1526075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tend</a> to do better and be more productive than those in the grip of neutral or negative emotions. The weight of experimental evidence suggests that happier people outperform less happy people, and that their positive demeanour is probably the cause.</p>



<p>From our review of more than 170 cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies, it’s clear that wellbeing promotes career success in many ways. That’s not to say that unhappy people can’t succeed – which is just as well, as a sad person reading this and telling herself she <em>must</em> cheer up to be successful is unlikely to help matters! To the contrary, history demonstrates that depressed individuals such as Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill can accomplish incredible feats. Both negative and positive emotions are adaptive to situations – there’s a time to be sad, just like there’s a time to be happy.</p>



<p>So for any business leaders or managers reading this, we’d caution against hiring only overtly happy people or pressuring your employees to be more upbeat. Such strategies have backfired in the past – as in the case of the mandatory jollity imposed on staff at the US supermarket chain Trader Joe’s, where the policy ironically made workers more miserable. People and companies hoping to boost happiness in a healthier way would have better luck if they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19301241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> positive activities, like performing acts of kindness and expressing gratitude.</p>



<p>The philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1951 said that: ‘The good life, as I conceive it, is a happy life.’ But he went on: ‘I do not mean that if you are good you will be happy; I mean that if you are happy you will be good.’ When it comes to making your mark at work, we agree. If you want to be successful, don’t hang around and wait to find happiness: <em>start</em> there instead.</p>

A speaker with a stream of slides full of text, monotonously reading them off as we read along.  We’re so used to it we expect it.  We accept it.  We even consider it ‘learning’. As an educator I push against ‘death by PowerPoint’ and I'm fascinated with how we can improve the way we present and teach.  The fact is we know that PowerPoint kills.  Most often the only victims are our audience’s inspiration and interest.  This, however, is the story of a PowerPoint slide that actually helped kill seven people.</p><p>January 16th 2003.  NASA Mission STS-107 is underway. The Space Shuttle Columbia launches carrying its crew of seven to low orbit.  Their objective was to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and on ants and spiders they had with them.  Columbia had been the first Space Shuttle, first launched in 1981 and had been on 27 missions prior to this one.  Whereas other shuttle crews had focused on work to the Hubble Space Telescope or to the International Space Station this mission was one of pure scientific research.  </p><p>The launch proceeded as normal.  The crew settled into their mission.  They would spend 16 days in orbit, completing 80 experiments.  One day into their mission it was clear to those back on Earth that something had gone wrong.  </p><p>As a matter of protocol NASA staff reviewed footage from an external camera mounted to the fuel tank.  At eighty-two seconds into the launch a piece of spray on foam insulation (SOFI) fell from one of the ramps that attached the shuttle to its external fuel tank.  As the crew rose at 28,968 kilometres per hour the piece of foam collided with one of the tiles on the outer edge of the shuttle’s left wing.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_17738"><div><p>It was impossible to tell from Earth how much damage this foam, falling nine times faster than a fired bullet, would have caused when it collided with the wing.   Foam falling during launch was nothing new.  It had happened on four previous missions and was one of the reasons why the camera was there in the first place.  But the tile the foam had struck was on the edge of the wing designed to protect the shuttle from the heat of Earth’s atmosphere during launch and re-entry.  In space the shuttle was safe but NASA didn’t know how it would respond to re-entry.  There were a number of options.  The astronauts could perform a spacewalk and visually inspect the hull.  NASA could launch another Space Shuttle to pick the crew up.  Or they could risk re-entry.  </p><p>NASA officials sat down with Boeing Corporation engineers who took them through three reports; a total of 28 slides.    The salient point was whilst there was data showing that the tiles on the shuttle wing could tolerate being hit by the foam this was based on test conditions using foam more than 600 times smaller than that that had struck Columbia.  This is the slide the engineers chose to illustrate this point:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_26426"><div><p>NASA managers listened to the engineers and their PowerPoint.  The engineers felt they had communicated the potential risks.  NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.  They rejected the other options and pushed ahead with Columbia re-entering Earth’s atmosphere as normal.  Columbia was scheduled to land at 0916 (EST) on February 1st 2003.  Just before 0900, 61,170 metres above Dallas at 18 times the speed of sound, temperature readings on the shuttle’s left wing were abnormally high and then were lost.  Tyre pressures on the left side were soon lost as was communication with the crew.

Morrison shelters were a way of protecting people from in their own homes from falling bombs. This was an alternative to the Anderson shelter in the garden and the public shelters.</p><table><tbody>

<p>
The Morrison shelter’s official name is the “Table (<i>Morrison</i>) indoor shelter”, it was designed by John Baker and named after Herbert Morrison who was the Minister of Home Security at the time. The idea for the Morrison shelter was fed from the realization that there was a lack of indoor shelters as not enough homes had cellars.</p><p>

The Morrison shelter measured approximately 6 ft 6 inches (1.98m) long, 4 ft (1.21m) wide and 2 ft 6 inches (0.76m) high. With a steel plate “table” top, welded wire mesh sides, and a metal lath floor. Three tools were supplied with the pack that you built up inside your home and it had 359 parts altogether. A lot of people used the shelter as a table and had bedding inside of it.</p><table><tbody>

<p>
Derek Lambert <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0000CMLO7/">describes</a> how this new shelter at first appeared to be a more comfortable option:</p><blockquote>
When the first savagery of the night attacks faded we left the cupboard under the stairs and moved into a Morrison shelter.<p>

This was a large metal cage a little higher than a dinner table. It had a hefty iron frame with a sheet steel ceiling screwed together with chunky nuts and bolts. Underneath was a crude wire mattress. It was massive and angular and filled the dining room except for a space in front of the fire.</p><p>

It became part of the house, a foundation almost; we slept in it and on it, we ate from it, we played in it. When the siren sounded we were supposed to dive inside and put up steel mesh around the sides. Thus, according to the theorists, we were protected from falling masonry by the frame and steel ceiling and from flying rubble by the mesh cage.</p><p>

When the Germans resumed the destruction of such military targets as schools, shops, houses and sleeping cows we spent all night in the shelter...</p><p>

As the bombs stirred the ground and the shrapnel clattered down the road we fought a quiet battle of cunning for the bedclothes. Feet touched faces, arms swung across chests, elbows elbowed; snores bubbled and spluttered to be silenced by ostensibly accidental blows; fragments of wild dream-talk escaped from the depths of our private lives. Enmity was closer to the surface during those caged nights than at any other time in our well-mannered lives.</p><p>

The system collapsed after a few weeks. White-faced, shadow-eyed, we decided that for the sake of health and happiness two of us would have to evacuate the shelter. For the next few months my parents slept on top of it while I rolled and stretched and crawled and sometimes slept beneath. When the next lull in the bombing came we crept back to our beds.</p></blockquote><p>
Half a million Morrison shelters had been distributed by the end of 1941, with a further 100,000 being added in 1943 to prepare the population for the expected German V-1 flying bomb.

        <div>
            <p>I’ve developed an unusual approach to styling in my React code. It’s sort of a functional, atomic css approach. Other methods I’ve used are BEM + separate css files, styled components, and tailwind. By far this is the one that lets me move fastest on my personal projects (I haven’t yet subjected anybody at work to dealing with it). Without further ado.</p>
<h2 id="element-styling">Element Styling</h2>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>const</span> <span>buttonStyles</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>caps</span>, <span>px</span>(<span>s6</span>), <span>py</span>(<span>s5</span>), <span>clickable</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>activeStyles</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>buttonStyles</span>, <span>bg</span>(<span>"green"</span>), <span>fg</span>(<span>light0</span>));
<span>const</span> <span>inactiveStyles</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>buttonStyles</span>, <span>bg</span>(<span>light0</span>), <span>shadow</span>);
<span>return</span> (
  &lt;<span>Row</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>fullWidth</span>, <span>alignCenter</span>)}&gt;
    &lt;<span>div</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>weightSemiBold</span>, <span>f1</span>, <span>fg</span>(<span>dark6</span>))}&gt;<span>Do</span> <span>you</span> <span>have</span> <span>a</span> <span>PS4</span><span>?</span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>Spacer</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span>{<span>s7</span>} /&gt;
    &lt;<span>div</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>roundedLeft</span>, <span>hasPS4</span> <span>?</span> <span>activeStyles</span> : <span>inactiveStyles</span>)}&gt;
      <span>yes</span>
    &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>div</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>roundedRight</span>, <span>hasPS4</span> <span>?</span> <span>inactiveStyles</span> : <span>activeStyles</span>)}&gt;
      <span>no</span>
    &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
  &lt;/<span>Row</span>&gt;
);
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>s</code> function is at the heart of the approach. It just takes objects and merges them:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> (...<span>args</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>_</span>.<span>assign</span>({}, ...<span>args</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>To feed into <code>s</code>, I’ve got a collection of atomic styling objects that can be pieced together, stuff like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>// Helper for constructing styles
</span><span></span><span>const</span> <span>keyedProp</span> <span>=</span> (<span>key</span>: <span>string</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>x</span>: <span>any</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> {
  <span>return</span> {
    [<span>key</span>]<span>:</span> <span>x</span>,
  };
};

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>fullWidth</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"width"</span>)(<span>"100%"</span>);
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>clickable</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"cursor"</span>)(<span>"pointer"</span>);

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>weightRegular</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"fontWeight"</span>)(<span>400</span>);
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>weightSemiBold</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"fontWeight"</span>)(<span>500</span>);
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>weightBold</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"fontWeight"</span>)(<span>600</span>);

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>flexible</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"flexBasis"</span>)(<span>0</span>), <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"minWidth"</span>)(<span>0</span>));

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>fg</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"color"</span>);
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>bg</span> <span>=</span> <span>keyedProp</span>(<span>"backgroundColor"</span>);

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>caps</span> <span>=</span> {
  <span>textTransform</span><span>:</span> <span>"uppercase"</span>,
  <span>letterSpacing</span><span>:</span> <span>"0.03rem"</span>,
};

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>size</span> <span>=</span> (<span>x</span>: <span>string</span> <span>|</span> <span>number</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> {
  <span>return</span> <span>s</span>(<span>height</span>(<span>x</span>), <span>width</span>(<span>x</span>));
};
</code></pre></div><p>There’s a lot more. Sometimes they take a parameter, sometimes they don’t, and all return style objects that can be fed into the <code>style</code> jsx attribute.</p>
<p>Anyone reading that has used tailwind probably recognizes this sort of style, of having a bunch of smaller rules that combine. There’s a few benefits to it being in code instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time or runtime errors (depending on your setup). In tailwind if you type <code>mr_4</code> accidentally instead of <code>mr-4</code>, you won’t notice unless you see that the page isn’t laid out correctly. With this approach and Typescript I get an error right away.</li>
<li>Tailwind’s approach to being able to specify the background color as any of 100 colors is to create 100 CSS classes. You can get caught with a pretty large CSS file, and you can’t use dynamic colors. You get a similar usage here, but less drawbacks, instead of <code>bg-green</code> you write <code>bg("green")</code>, and if you want dynamic you can do <code>bg(someColorVar)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another advantage of this approach is that it’s very ergonomic, and that’s partly because these style objects form a monoid under the <code>s</code> function. That sounds more complicated than it actually is, and has real benefits. First of all, it means there’s an identity element, like 0 in addition or 1 in multiplication. In this case it’s the empty object <code>{}</code>. This identity element is useful when you want nothing to happen, ex:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx">&lt;<span>div</span> <span>style</span><span>=</span>{<span>s</span>(<span>size</span>(<span>32</span>), <span>isActive</span> <span>?</span> <span>bg</span>(<span>"green"</span>) <span>:</span> {})} /&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Because we have an identity element we can put <code>{}</code> in there for the case where we don’t want anything to happen to the previous style when <code>isActive</code> is <code>false</code>. The other nice feature is that since <code>s</code> returns the same type as its input, we can use the output in a new call to <code>s</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>const</span> <span>regularButton</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>clickable</span>, <span>px</span>(<span>8</span>), <span>py</span>(<span>4</span>));
<span>// We can use the above style by itself, or we can
</span><span>// feed it into `s` again to create a new style
</span><span></span><span>const</span> <span>boldButton</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>(<span>regularButton</span>, <span>weightSemiBold</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Just to round out the monoid thing for anyone curious what else makes it a monoid, <code>s</code> is associative, but there’s nothing useful about that.</p>
<p>Inline styles are bound to look ugly to some people. There’s nothing as clean as styled components markup. But that cleanliness comes at a cost. I find having to do two passes when writing markup to be a pain, since you have to write the markup then go make the components. It can also be hard to figure out how the styling is working based on the markup, having to jump back and forth between the markup and the definitions for complex layouts.</p>
<h2 id="spacing">Spacing</h2>
<p>A while back I read a comment or article on Hacker News that that spacing should be seen as its own element instead of properties of the other elements on the page. I found myself agreeing on principal, and I’ve seen benefits from putting it into practice. If you’ve got a header, followed by 16px of space, followed by body text, the traditional approach would be to give a <code>margin-bottom</code> of <code>16px</code> to the header. What I’ve been doing instead is this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx">&lt;<span>div</span>&gt; <span>Header</span> &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>Spacer</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span>{<span>16</span>}/&gt;
&lt;<span>div</span>&gt; <span>Body</span> &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>I’ve found this to be easier than giving margins to a bunch of my elements. It also makes the non-spacing elements more re-usable, since I don’t have to modify the spacing when I copy them over to some new page or component.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-349383fc=""><p><img src="https://drand.love/images/drand-launch-banner.png" alt="Banner for drand v1.0"></p> <p>Welcome to the brand new website for the drand project! Drand is now in production, providing publicly verifiable randomness as a foundational internet service.</p> <p>Below you'll find an introduction to drand, information on recent protocol upgrades, details about the expansion and strengthening of drand's largest deployment, the League of Entropy, and glimpses into the future of drand and the League of Entropy.</p> <h2 id="new-to-drand-here-is-a-primer"><a href="#new-to-drand-here-is-a-primer">#</a> New to drand? Here is a primer</h2> <p>Randomness is at the core of many business-critical operations and protocols that we rely on every day (e.g., the cryptography of secure communications, the execution of public lotteries, and so on). However, despite being such a huge requirement, there has never been a source of public randomness capable of providing truly unbiased randomness at scale. Drand was created to change that.</p> <p>Drand provides a mechanism for a universally accessible source of publicly-verifiable, unbiasable, and unpredictable randomness. Following an initial multi-party computation to establish a distributed key, drand nodes operated by independent parties periodically broadcast information that gets aggregated into a final random beacon whose validity can be easily verified by users.</p> <p>Drand started as a research project in the <a href="http://dedis.epfl.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEDIS lab at EPFL</a>, and the first network was launched as an experiment in 2019. After nearly a year in the research stage, it was time to transform drand into a production-level public service. Over the past few months, we have rolled out a host of new changes and improvements to the service. We've also deployed drand's largest network, the <a href="http://leagueofentropy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">League of Entropy</a>.</p> <p>We believe that drand can be a foundational Internet core service for randomness, one that everyone online can access and use in the same way as other foundational protocols, like DNS or NTP.</p> <h2 id="drand-v1-1"><a href="#drand-v1-1">#</a> Drand v1.1</h2> <p>Drand launched v1.0 in July and updgraded to v1.1 in August, rolling out many new features and architecture improvements. Chief among them are:</p> <h3 id="_3-layered-architecture"><a href="#_3-layered-architecture">#</a> 3 layered architecture</h3> <p>The network architecture was split into three layers, offering enhanced protection to the drand nodes while increasing scalability, with a distribution network utilizing <a href="http://api.drand.sh/public/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP CDNs</a>, <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libp2p Gossipsub</a> relays, a <a href="http://drandeokfd5aaz3hr4hfk7mlr23vc63boxrpr44ertumtbousmdgbhad.onion/public/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tor hidden service</a>, and a <a href="https://twitter.com/loebot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter bot</a>.</p> <h3 id="new-features"><a href="#new-features">#</a> New features</h3> <ul><li><strong>Round-to-timestamps guarantees</strong> with a catch-up functionality where, after a downtime, nodes quickly generate randomness to be up-to-date.</li> <li>The ability for a node to <strong>download a full copy of an existing chain prior to joining the group</strong>.</li> <li>A new curve (<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLS12-381</a>) for <strong>improved security</strong> and <strong>compatibility with major blockchains like Filecoin and Ethereum 2.0</strong>.</li> <li>Solid client implementation with provider <strong>failover</strong> and <strong>optimizations</strong> in Go and JS.</li> <li>A broadcast channel enabling more <strong>robust set-up ceremonies</strong>.</li></ul> <h3 id="deployment-monitoring"><a href="#deployment-monitoring">#</a> Deployment monitoring</h3> <p>A set of tools is now used to monitor the various drand nodes and alert operators to incidents. A <a href="https://drand.statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">status page</a> that shows both system status and any planned maintenance is now available for the network. We have also established a network observatory to measure network performance and reliability from the perspective of the end-user, with vantage points around the world.</p> <h3 id="drand-s-specification-security-model"><a href="#drand-s-specification-security-model">#</a> Drand’s specification &amp; security model</h3> <p>The drand protocol now has a <a href="https://drand.love/docs/specification/">full specification</a> and a documented <a href="https://drand.love/docs/security-model/">security model</a>.</p> <h3 id="security-audit"><a href="#security-audit">#</a> Security audit</h3> <p>The drand implementation underwent an end-to-end security audit carried out by <a href="https://sigmaprime.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SigmaPrime</a>. We are excited to share the report with you <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fCy1ynO78gJLCNbqBruzHx7bh72Tu-q2/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> in which you can learn about the findings and the approach used. Working with the SigmaPrime team was an absolute delight, they were thorough and very communicative throughout the entire audit, which enabled the drand team to quickly solve the issues as they were found.</p> <h3 id="code-quality-refactor-testing"><a href="#code-quality-refactor-testing">#</a> Code quality, refactor &amp; testing</h3> <p>Improved development practices, including a testnet for pre-deployment evaluation of new versions and greatly increased code coverage, as well as linting and regression testing.</p> <p>General improvements to the codebase, with over 400 merged pull requests in the last couple months.</p> <p>With these changes, drand got the upgrades it needed to become  a reliable production environment.</p> <h2 id="new-website-logo"><a href="#new-website-logo">#</a> New website &amp; logo</h2> <p>We built this website to be the drand community's primary repository for the growing body of documentation about drand. We also want this to be the new home for the drand community of developers, operators, and end-users. We'll use it to host our blog and share important updates and news about the project.</p> <p>In addition to a new site, we also created a logo for the drand project, which you can see at the top of this post or <a href="https://drand.love/drand-logo-kit.zip">download the logo kit</a>.</p> <h2 id="the-league-of-entropy-main-network-loe-mainnet-becomes-a-production-service"><a href="#the-league-of-entropy-main-network-loe-mainnet-becomes-a-production-service">#</a> The League of Entropy main network (LoE Mainnet) becomes a production service</h2> <p>The true power of drand comes not from its implementation but from a strong, decentralized network of independent nodes contributing to the randomness generation. In addition to significant protocol upgrades, we also strengthened the League of Entropy.</p> <p>In 2019, Cloudflare, EPFL, the University of Chile, Kudelski Security, and Protocol Labs came together to start the League of Entropy and run the drand network. Since then, the group has expanded to include partners in six countries, spanning the spectrum from universities to infrastructure companies.</p> <h3 id="new-league-of-entropy-partners"><a href="#new-league-of-entropy-partners">#</a> New League of Entropy partners</h3> <p>With the LoE Main Network upgrade, a set of new partners joined the league to increase its robustness and quality of service. The current set of members include:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.c4dt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C4DT</a></li> <li><a href="https://chainsafe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChainSafe</a></li> <li><a href="https://celo.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cLabs</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a></li> <li><a href="https://emeraldonion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emerald Onion</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dedis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPFL</a></li> <li><a href="https://ethereum.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum Foundation</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.initc3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IC3</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kudelski Security</a></li> <li><a href="https://protocol.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol Labs</a></li> <li><a href="https://ptisp.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PTisp</a></li> <li><a href="https://tierion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tierion</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UCL</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.uchile.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Chile</a></li></ul> <p>More partners have signed up to join soon, and we'll keep growing the network over the years to come.</p> <h3 id="league-of-entropy-s-governance"><a href="#league-of-entropy-s-governance">#</a> League of Entropy's governance</h3> <p>Our changes start with the drand community. Drand's strength and resilience are ensured by the number and diversity of its nodes. But a key requirement for the overall security of the network is that no single entity retains complete and centralized control over the drand network. This calls for an explicit and decentralized governance model for the drand community of operators. So one of the first changes was to draft a new model of collaborative governance for the League of Entropy – the consortium supporting and sustaining the drand network.</p> <p>With this new governance model, we've established the rules and requirements that the League of Entropy needs in order to maintain a high level of network security, ensure that the League operates effectively, and establish the right conditions for ongoing improvement to the production quality of drand. We've also laid down the procedures for adding new members to the League of Entropy in an equitable, fair, and decentralized way. All told, we think these changes set up the drand project for continued success as we find new users and implement new features.</p> <h2 id="filecoin-becomes-drand-s-first-high-profile-production-user"><a href="#filecoin-becomes-drand-s-first-high-profile-production-user">#</a> Filecoin becomes drand's first high-profile production user</h2> <p>In this first post to our new website, we've talked about the changes and upgrades we're making to realize the future of drand as a production-ready service. We're thrilled to report that the Filecoin project at Protocol Labs has <a href="https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-testnet-phase-2-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> they are adopting drand as the source of unbiased randomness for leader election on the Filecoin blockchain. Filecoin has thus become the first known production user of drand!</p> <p>This is a huge announcement that couldn't come at a better time. One of the most promising production use cases of drand is in the blockchain space. Filecoin is already a cutting-edge blockchain-based technology, and its incorporation of drand as its preferred randomness source will power some incredible innovation, testing, and development for the drand network. We're excited for what the future holds for both Filecoin and drand.</p> <p>That's all for now, but there will be more to come in the weeks and months ahead. We hope you'll join us again at drand's new online home to hear about the next round of news and updates to the project.</p> <h2 id="one-last-announcement-join-us-on-august-13-for-the-randomness-summit"><a href="#one-last-announcement-join-us-on-august-13-for-the-randomness-summit">#</a> One last announcement: Join us on August 13 for The Randomness Summit</h2> <p>To help celebrate this exciting launch, the drand team, ETHGlobal, Protocol Labs Research, and ResNetLab are pleased to announce a <a href="https://randomness2020.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-day virtual summit</a> on state of the art and future directions for randomness beacons.</p> <p><a href="https://airtable.com/shrTsIV4Btd8Wugqb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Register now</a> to learn from top cryptographers and randomness beacon experts, League of Entropy partners, and drand developers. The Ethereum and Filecoin project leads will also be talking about the critical role of randomness in the operation of their networks.</p> <p>That’s all for now, but there will be more to come in the weeks and months ahead. We hope you’ll join us at drand’s new online home to stay informed of future news and updates to the project.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                                
<blockquote><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.getglobalhome.com/?utm_source=cornerstone&amp;utm_medium=methodology&amp;utm_campaign=launch">GlobalHome</a></strong> is a US-based digital platform for discovering and buying NRI properties in India. We leverage data science and insights to pre-verify properties, and provide a digital platform for financing, booking online and end-to-end purchasing.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Buying a property thousands of miles away is incredibly hard. Most buyers need to spend weeks of in-person visits to finalize a property and ton of paperwork to get the finance and purchasing done. <br>In fact, the entire process is so tiring and stressful that many NRIs (Non Resident Indians) just avoid buying a property in India or procrastinate for years effectively missing out on investment opportunities in one of the hottest real-estate markets in the world. </p>



<h3><strong>What makes buying property in India so hard?</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>Why hasn’t anyone solved this for NRI purchasing?</strong></h5>



<p>There are a few different aspects which add to the complexity of searching and buying a property thousands of miles away for NRIs.</p>



<div><p><em><strong>Note: If you want to jump to the data science part – <a href="https://getglobalhome.com/using-data-driven-property-insights-for-purchasing-nri-properties-in-india#methodology">Click here to Jump to Methodology</a><br></strong></em><br><strong>1. Distance &amp; Time: </strong>Typically, NRIs spend most of their time out of India and visit every 1-2 years and spend maybe 3 weeks. Just a few weeks is never enough time to scout for properties given that most Indians (like myself) would end up using couple of weeks just to settle in and say hello to friends and relatives. You can of course shortlist properties beforehand, <br>however under construction properties is usually the preferred choice and it takes quite a bit of imagination to envision what the property might end up looking like. For folks looking to buy resale properties, there’s a huge challenge with communication and seller reliability. In addition, the amount of co-ordination and intracity traveling needed makes it unworthy to spend time on properties which may not be a good fit or are going to have issues.</p><p><strong>2. Paperwork &amp; In-person visits</strong>: If you are buying a property in India, everything needs hardcopy paperwork, especially if you are an NRI. Your home loan agent will make you visit the bank branch to attest documents, your builder or seller will make you sign papers, you need power of attorney on a physical stamp paper, you need to fill paper forms for applying for a loan – yes the one with square boxes and 30 different fields. There are countless other documents. Unless you can time heist, all of this process is nearly impossible to pull off by yourself without significant help from your family or friends.</p><p><strong>3. Amount of Choice, Lack of builder reliability &amp; Litigations:</strong> In India, it wont be unfair to say that every street has an under construction property, and hundreds of builders constructing those. All of these properties get listed on online portals who proudly tout that they have thousands of properties listed. While more is usually better, in this case it just adds to confusion, every property listing looks more of the same and you cant get your decision done until you or someone actually visit the property.<br>Builder reliability is a huge factor in determining whether you will get your “possession” on the promised date or years later, and whether the final construction will look and feel anything like those pretty pictures. Some builders are established, litigation-free and financially sound, while others are not, and this hugely matter. It is merely impossible for someone to fully investigate and research the builder and property in their short buying timeline, its very easy to fall for the polished brochures and onsite air conditioned showing offices. Government of India has introduced RERA – aka The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 – to protect home buyers, however just RERA registered property doesn’t mean anything at all and requires much deeper research to actually make use of that information to infer whether the builder is legit and if the promised property is actually on track for completion.</p><p><strong>4. Return on Investment</strong>: Buying a property is a huge financial decision, it is a life event for most of us, regardless of whether its an investment property or a place where you may end up living some day.  In addition to all the above factors, there is generally an uncertainly about the actual want for buying a property abroad and what investment gains you can make from it. For example, one may contemplate the following: Am I actually going to live there? If I buy a property who will manage it? How much will the property price go up by? Is it better to just invest my money in stocks? What if someone encroaches on my property? Who is going to find tenants every year? What if USD exchange rate goes up?<br>All these questions are valid questions, and it is non trivial to answer these.</p></div>



<h2 id="methodology"><strong>How is GlobalHome solving this using data?</strong></h2>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.getglobalhome.com/?utm_source=cornerstone&amp;utm_medium=methodology&amp;utm_campaign=launch">GlobalHome</a> was built with a very clear mission:  <em>Bring Transparency and Simplicity to cross-border real estate transaction</em>s</p></blockquote>



<h4>Pre-vetted properties with Property Scores</h4>



<p>Too much choice is never a good thing. Don’t believe me? Think of all those options you have on Netflix, and how you end up spending hours browsing just to end up watching a crappy movie. You’d much rather search for the IMDB Rating for the movie and gain insight into whether you’d like the movie. You may not agree with all the ratings, but it will generally help you boil it down to a few choices – my favorite is the Imdb top 250 list, I’ll watch all those movies in a heart beat.</p>



<div><p><strong>Now let’s apply the IMDB analogy to Properties.<em> </em><br></strong><em>GlobalHome has pioneered a proprietary methodology to scientifically score thousands of under construction properties and builders so that we can rank and shortlist the ones which have the best ROI and reliability.</em></p><p>Each week, we score and add new featured pre-vetted properties.</p></div>



<p>We look at and make available unprecedented insights about the property, builder, locality, return on investment to ease your decision making. Most property portals will merely show you the list of amenities and past projects for the builder – this tells you nothing, sure it helps you shortlist from 5000 to maybe 100, but still it doesn’t get you down to those 1-2 properties you really would buy.</p>



<h4><strong>GlobalHome – Property Score and Insights</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Below are some of the factors which go into the scoring:</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Project construction detailed status </strong>– Is the excavation done? Is the tiling done? What percentage of construction is done? How long has the work been pending? Are they meeting their promised timelines?<br></li><li><strong>Builder or Developer Profile</strong> – Is this builder and project RERA registered? What are their past projects? Have they completed previous projects on time? Is the builder a registered company? Is the builder legit and can we find legal registrations for those?<br></li><li><strong>Financial Standing of Builder</strong> – What is the CRISIL or SMERA rating for the builder? How much debt does the builder has? Does the builder have any supplier issues? Is the builder in the news for financial issues?<br></li><li><strong>Litigations</strong> – Does the project or builder have any outstanding litigations? Is the land free of litigations? Are there any criminal proceeding against the directors or owners of the construction company?<br></li><li><strong>Locality Insights</strong> – Does the locality have water connectivity? Are the roads approved? Are there local shops nearby? How is the connectivity to freeways? Is the locality near any future planned metro or rail routes? Is it near major amenities such as malls, theatres?<br></li><li><strong>Pricing &amp; Rent Trends</strong>: What is the actual or expected year over year price growth for the area? Is it near IT hubs or any major colleges? How easy is it to rent out the apartment?  How easy is it to sell similar properties in the area?</li></ul>



<p>You must be thinking – Where are you getting all this data from? Are you actually doing data science? Is this information reliable?<br>All of these are great questions – and the answer is that there is indeed a lot of data available on RERA sites for each state, public land records, public litigation and court records, user reviews, pricing trends and rental data.<br>I want to show a few examples of what that data looks like so that you can get a sense of how this information can be leveraged</p>



<h4>Let’s look at a few examples of property insights data</h4>



<p>Is the work actually completed? How much units are available to buy? What are the pricing trends in localities?</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of how we are leveraging data to bring transparency and simplicity into property buying process.<br>Hopefully this gives you some insight into our scoring methodology!</p>

<p>A majority of programmers work in the massive field of web development, because there are so many jobs, resources and problems to solve! This is especially true for self-taught developers like myself or bootcamp grads. With that, there are also many people looking to try something other than web-development, whether it be out of boredom, curiousity or passion for another area of computer science.</p>
<p>I'm particularly a fan of this, as while web-development got me hooked into programming (and is partially what I do now), exploring other types of work made me a much <em>much</em> better engineer. I think that two months of working on backend development at Shopify helped me grow less than a three-month side project for which I built a very simple raytracer. My experience has also been that it's very hard to break out of web development since there's activation energy, and it's harder to be as impactful, so I'm hoping this will help.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects<a href="#projects" aria-label="Anchor link for: projects"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Projects listed in vague order of increasing difficulty / time committment. I have not done all these of course, but I at least know someone who did / have some special respect for the creator.</p>
<h3 id="ray-tracing-in-one-weekend">Ray Tracing In One Weekend<a href="#ray-tracing-in-one-weekend" aria-label="Anchor link for: ray-tracing-in-one-weekend"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">Link to Book</a></p>
<p>This is one of the single most impactful projects I've done! With a raytracer you can model objects in 3D space and generate images for what they'd look like by applying your own colours, angles and lightning. It uses a little bit of math and teaches introductory graphics. The most fun part about raytracing is the development cycle, since you can instantly test software (limited by how fast your computer is) and see the result, without having to worry about hidden bugs.</p>
<p>I estimate for it to take less than a week if you work on it full time and a month if doing it in free time. There is also "Ray Tracing the Next Week" and "Ray Tracing the Rest of Your Life" if you want more!</p>
<h3 id="llvm-tutorial">LLVM Tutorial<a href="#llvm-tutorial" aria-label="Anchor link for: llvm-tutorial"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/">Link to Tutorial</a></p>
<p>The LLVM tutorial helps you to build an entire programming language with LLVM which is insanely fun and relevant to software we use everyday. It also includes teachings about JITs! I recommend <em>not</em> following the OCaml tutorials as the tutorials are old and you'll have trouble installing dependencies (like I did). I really like compilers as an area of focus because unlike graphics or GPU programming, your work is relevant to anyone who is a programmer.</p>
<p>I estimate this to take a week full time and 2+ weeks doing it in free time and no more than two months.</p>
<h3 id="crafting-interpreters">Crafting Interpreters<a href="#crafting-interpreters" aria-label="Anchor link for: crafting-interpreters"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html">Link to Book</a></p>
<p>I put this one after the LLVM tutorial just because it is longer, but Crafting Interpreters is an <em>excellent</em> resource. It actually teaches you how to build two interpreters, one with Java and another with C and also covers VMs and garbage collection. I think the type of interpreters you'll build through Crafting Interpreters will help you understand CRuby and CPython source code more than the LLVM Tutorial will help you understand Rust source code.</p>
<p>I recommend starting on the second interpreter iff you have a solid impression of how interpreters tend to work and you're familiar with programming in C as well as data structures. I estimate the entirety of Crafting Interpreters to take 3 - 6 weeks full time or a few months part time (more variable since it's longer and there are more opportunities to challenge yourself).</p>
<h3 id="spinning-up-in-deep-reinforcement-learning">Spinning Up in Deep Reinforcement Learning<a href="#spinning-up-in-deep-reinforcement-learning" aria-label="Anchor link for: spinning-up-in-deep-reinforcement-learning"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/">Link to Resource</a></p>
<p>This collection of resources / docs is created by Open AI and generally impressed me in quality of documentation (I generally have very little faith in big companies being able to document things well). It's not a tutorial, but is good at giving the full picture (how to get into the career, lingo, example implementations, etc). It also provides two exercises that are fairly long as well as fun information such as PyTorch vs Tensorflow comparisons.</p>
<p>I think of all the resources I listed, this one gets you the closest to a career change (partially just the nature of the ML field). I only list one Machine Learning related resource because other good intro-to-ML guides have good page rank (though I think Spinning Up in Deep RL has underrated pagerank). </p>
<p>Some resources for people who already have some background in AI (read the Wikipedia definitions and did Tensorflow/Pytorch tutorials): </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://d2l.ai/">Deep Dive into Machine Learning</a> (a book)</li>
<li>For people vaguely familiar with Machine Learning: (language model focused, sorry)
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">All You Need is Attention</a> (a paper)</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT</a> (a paper, though BERT is not the entire name of the paper)</li>
<li><a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">GPT2</a> (also a paper, and GPT2 is not the name of the paper)</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/library">Collection of Resources about AI Safety</a> (doesn't actually need much of a ML background)</li>

<h3 id="implementing-the-raft-distributed-consensus-system">Implementing the Raft Distributed Consensus System<a href="#implementing-the-raft-distributed-consensus-system" aria-label="Anchor link for: implementing-the-raft-distributed-consensus-system"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://raft.github.io/">Link to Raft Info Page</a></p>
<p>Raft is a consensus algorithm. I'm not going to describe further, but it's an algorithm to solve problems with distributed systems -- something you may be familiar with! Unlike many of the projects I've listed, Raft will require a lot of reading / research to build background knowledge. Implementing Raft requires knowledge about operating systems, systems programming in general, networks and concurrency. I feel that it'll also test more software engineering skills since the process will include lots of logging, tests and error handling.</p>
<p>I'm not going to give time estimates about Raft since I've read a lot but haven't implemented it. More importantly, it depends on your background. If I had to say, it would be at least a week full time.</p>

<p>This one seems fun but I've only briefly attempted it.</p>
<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/03/12/the-rust-os-story/">Julia Evans on an OS in Rust</a> | <a href="https://tc.gts3.org/cs3210/2020/spring/lab.html">Georgia Tech Course Materials</a> | <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial###">OS Tutorial</a> (unmaintained in 2+ years) | <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page">OS Dev Wiki</a></p>
<p>Though challenging and a long project, I recommend OS dev because it's a surprisingly common project (you can probably find more resources for this than say, Raft). The difficult parts with this project is that it's more open-ended, longer even to get to a minimal project and the development cycle is a bit more painful.</p>
<p>Estimate 4+ weeks full time for a minimal-ish OS.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Vision</strong>. I didn't list any tutorials for this since none are particularly special, but <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> is powerful and there are a whole bunch of projects that can come out of it! The documentation is not as polished as most web-dev documentation which I think makes it extra fun.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong>. I'm generally pretty clueless about blockchain, so not listing any resources but I'm leaving it here in case anyone has ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Regex</strong>. This is not a career, nor is it distinct from webdev, but it certainly exercises your brain in a different way and is a unique skill! Being able to write regexes off the top of my head has been a great help to my software engineering. I learned/practiced through <a href="https://carolchen.me/blog/past-webdev/regexcrossword.com/">Regex Crosswords</a>.</p>

<h3 id="competitive-programming">Competitive Programming<a href="#competitive-programming" aria-label="Anchor link for: competitive-programming"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Hesistant about including this since it's sometimes just "leetcoding" but I think competitive programming was formative to my programming skills. <a href="https://carolchen.me/blog/past-webdev/codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> has weekly contests (also see TopCoder, DMOJ). Some of the problems are more traditional data science and algorithms, but sites like Codeforces over Leetcode will have some more adhoc and math focused puzzles. Speaking of math, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is also a great source of problems. I also like throwing away writing good code sometimes and just writing code for me!</p>

</h3>
<p>Kaggle is a platform where users receive datasets and try to predict / compute some values in a contest format. They also have some open datasets with various tutorials on how to work with them, such as the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Titanic Dataset</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>As a web developer, a lot of my learning was throug Stack Overflow, videos and Medium articles. I think my learning of compilers was high-friction because of my unwillingness to read papers (which I'm still working on). This is not applicable to <em>everything</em>, for example machine learning has a lot of strong Stack Overflow resources through uses of libraries (though you'll definitely need to read papers for ML), and for learning to do reverse engineering, individual blog posts with write-ups are probably your best resource. In general, you may have to relearn how you filter / search through content.</p>
<h3 id="open-source">Open Source<a href="#open-source" aria-label="Anchor link for: open-source"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Something missing from this article is "after I learn these skills, how do I get a job?", and the reason it's missing is because I'd be talking out of my ass if I tried to answer that. However, I do some know reliable ways through which that has been done and Open Source is definitely one of them!</p>
<p>Spend some time looking into different projects and start working up towards contributions. I recommend larger projects for exposure and also because they'll have better support systems for new contributors. I know numerous people who somewhat bypassed education through side projects and gained skills entirely through working on OSS!</p>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially. This is shown in the following graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png 600w"><figcaption>Average time to create one object increases with the number of objects on the heap <a href="https://jsperf.com/cost-of-objects">(Data Source)</a></figcaption></figure><p>So the question arises if CRDTs are actually suitable for shared editing on the web, or if they impose a too significant cost to be viable in practice.</p><p>In case you don't know me, I'm the author of a CRDT implementation named <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a>, that is specifically designed for building shared editing applications on the web.</p><p>In this article, I will introduce you to a simple optimization for CRDTs and examine the exact performance trade-off of using Yjs for shared editing. I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.</p><h2 id="yjs">Yjs</h2><p>Yjs is a framework for building collaborative applications using CRDTs as the data model. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions that enable shared editing using different editors (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-prosemirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror">ProseMirror</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remirror/extension-yjs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror">Remirror</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-quilljs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill">Quill</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/codemirror">CodeMirror</a>, ..), different networking technologies (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket">WebSocket</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-webrtc">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-hyper">Hyper</a>, ..), and different persistence layers (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-leveldb">LevelDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-redis">Redis</a>, ..). Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

If not, and you want to dive into this rabbit hole, I recommend this fun interactive series:</p><figure><a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/"><div><p>CRDTs: Part 1</p><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/profile.jpg"><span>Lars Hupel</span><span>Lars Hupel</span></p></div><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/topics/crdt/world.jpg"></p></a><figcaption>A fun interactive series about CRDTs</figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://crdt.tech/resources"><div><p>CRDT Resources • Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</p><p>Resources and community around CRDT technology — papers, blog posts, code and more.</p><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/favicons/favicon-192x192.png"><span>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</span></p></div><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/img/crdt-favicon.png"></p></a><figcaption>Good entry point to find more CRDT related resources</figcaption></figure><p>The concept paper that describes Yjs' conflict resolution algorithm YATA is available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types">Researchgate</a>. The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {
    id: { client: 1, clock: 0 },
    content: 'ABC',
    ...
}</code></pre><figcaption>Yjs's internal representation of items in the linked list</figcaption></figure><p>If a user copy/pastes a lot of content into the document, the inserted content is represented by a single <code>Item</code>. Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

We’ll call this flight AA2305, and we’ll use an Airbus A321 to operate it.</blockquote><p>Airlines distribute their schedules through industry data providers, who then make them available to other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers. <a href="https://www.oag.com/">OAG</a> and <a href="https://www.cirium.com/">Cirium</a> are the leaders in this space.</p><p>This isn’t just static data which changes infrequently - airlines generally update their schedules at least once a day, and there are about 800 scheduled airlines for the data providers to work with.</p><h2 id="fares">Fares</h2><p>A fare describes a price at which an airline is willing to sell seats on a particular flight, and the rules (sometimes known as "conditions") that go with that price.</p><p>A fare from American Airlines might look something like this:</p><blockquote>We’re willing to sell seats on our flights AA2305 and AA2307 for $200, as long as there is space in booking class N. However, you must book your seat as part of a return, you’ll have to stay in San Francisco for a Saturday night, and we won’t give you any refund if you want to cancel.</blockquote><p>A fare has a name, called a “fare basis code”. A fare basis code is a short set of letters and numbers - for example <code>NVAKZNM3</code>.</p><p>Fares are made up of rules which describe who is eligible for them, what flights they can be used for, and restrictions on how they can be sold or used. Examples of fare rules could include:</p><ul><li>You must fly via Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>)</li><li>You can change flights, but only if you pay a $50 penalty</li><li>You can't have a "stopover" overnight on your journey</li></ul><p>The full fare rules for a fare can easily be thousands of words long - you can see the real-life fare rules for the American Airlines fare <code>NVAKZNM3</code> <a href="https://gist.github.com/timrogers/ef7a0070d29ea1ffa5d925184e7a4887">here</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the most important fare rules can be described in a structured way which a computer can understand, allowing a search engine to work out what fares match your search without a human reading through manually.</p><p>Airlines file their fares in an industry directory run by <a href="https://www.atpco.net/">ATPCO</a>, which other airlines, travel sellers and tech providers can subscribe to. Each airline can change their pricing by refiling fares many times a day. All in all, ATPCO processes more than 10 million fare updates per day.</p><p>Airlines offer many fares for the same flight at the same time, since a traveller won’t always want the cheapest, most restrictive option. For example, you might want a checked bag, or the ability to change your flights free of charge.</p><h2 id="availability">Availability</h2><p>Airlines don’t just say “this flight has seats available” or “this flight doesn’t have seats available”.</p><p>Airlines want to make as much money as they can from their metal boxes flying through the sky, so they want to sell some seats cheaply, but hold some seats back for travellers who are willing to pay more.</p><p>A flight is broken into different “booking classes”, sometimes known as “reservation booking designators” (RBDs). These are letters of the alphabet, so a flight can be split into 26 different buckets: <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, etc..</p><p>A fare points to a specific booking class. The example fare we looked at above, <code>NVAKZNM3</code>, is for the booking class <code>N</code>. Usually, the first character of the fare basis code is the booking class.</p><p>Each booking class on a flight can have different availability. For example, imagine that American Airlines uses the booking classes <code>N</code>, <code>V</code> and <code>Y</code> for economy.</p><p>They might use <code>N</code> for the most restrictive economy fares, <code>Y</code> for the most flexible ones and <code>V</code> for ones in the middle. Being able to control availability for each booking class means that “cheap economy” can be sold out, but there can still be “expensive economy” seats left.</p><p>Airlines don’t “publish” their availability. To know the latest, up-to-the-minute availability, you have to go to the airline’s passenger service system (PSS). Popular passenger service systems include <a href="https://amadeus.com/en/industries/airlines/altea-suite">Amadeus Altéa</a>, <a href="https://www.sabreairlinesolutions.com/home/software_solutions/customer_sales_service/">Sabre Sonic</a> and <a href="https://www.navitaire.com/new-skies-reservation-system">Navitaire New Skies</a>.</p><h2 id="putting-this-all-together">Putting this all together</h2><p>To find results for a simple search, a flight search engine has to combine together schedules, fares and availability.</p><p>There is only a small number of flight searches engines on the market. Most travel sellers use the search built into the global distribution system (GDS) they use (for example <a href="https://amadeus.com/">Amadeus</a>, <a href="https://www.sabre.com/">Sabre</a> or <a href="https://www.travelport.com/">Travelport</a>). But there are competitors: airlines and larger sellers often use search solutions from providers like <a href="https://www.itasoftware.com/">ITA Software by Google</a> and <a href="https://pros.com/">PROS</a>.</p><p>Flight search is very complex, and it requires a lot of computer power.</p><p>The first step is to identify possible routings. For our trip from New York to San Francisco, there are tens of thousands of reasonable options if we take into account connecting flights and the full range of available airlines.</p><p>At the simple end, we could take a direct flight, <code>AA2305</code>. But we could also fly with Alaska Airlines on <code>AS17</code>, <code>AS398</code> and <code>AS3311</code>, connecting in Seattle (<code>SEA</code>) and Los Angeles (<code>LAX</code>).</p><p>For each of those routings, the search engine needs to work out what fares are applicable, checking all of the rules.</p><p>There can be hundreds or thousands of potentially relevant fares to check per airline, especially given that there can be many different ways to apply fares to a set of flights.</p><p>If we take our example above with Alaska Airlines, you’d fly from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, then <code>SEA-LAX</code> and finally <code>LAX-SFO</code>. In terms of fares, this could be structured as:</p><ul><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SFO</code></li><li>A one-way from <code>JFK-SEA</code>, and then a one-way from <code>SEA-SFO</code></li><li>Three one-ways: <code>JFK-SEA</code>, <code>SEA-LAX</code> <code>LAX-SFO</code></li><li>…</li></ul><p>If we’re booking a round trip, this gets even more complex.</p><p>Once you’ve combined the schedules and fares, you’ll have a series of “priced itineraries” - for example:</p><blockquote>You can fly on AA2305 direct from JFK to SFO for $200, using fare NVAKZNM3, as long as booking class N is available</blockquote><p>The final step is to bring availability into the picture. You’ll probably find that a lot of your priced itineraries are not available because one or more of the booking classes you need are full.</p><p>The end result is a series of search results — or what we call "offers" in the Duffel API.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>When you search for flights, a flight search engine has to combine schedules, fares and availability to generate your search results.</p><p>To do this, it has to consider hundreds of millions of options (at least!), turning them into a relatively small number of valid, relevant combinations. And all of that in just a couple of seconds!</p></section></div>]]>

		<h3>7 August 2020</h3>

<p>I've been using MyFitnessPal and it has the facility to load nutrition information by scanning the barcode on the product. I can guess how the retrieval works once the barcode number is obtained (a big database somewhere) but it struck me that I had no idea how the reading of the barcode <em>itself</em> worked and.. well, I'm curious and enjoy the opportunity to learn something new to me by writing the code to do it. I do enjoy being able to look up (almost) anything on the internet to find out how it works!</p>

<p><em>(For anyone who wants to either play along but not copy-paste the code themselves or for anyone who wants to jump to the end result, I've put the code - along with the example image I've used in this post - up on a <a href="https://github.com/ProductiveRage/BarcodeReader">GitHub repo</a>)</em></p>

<h3>The plan of attack</h3>

<p>There are two steps required here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read image and try to identify areas that look like barcodes</li>
<li>Try to extract numbers from the looks-like-a-barcode regions</li>
</ol>

<p>As with anything, these steps may be broken down into smaller tasks. The first step can be done like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Barcodes are black and white regions that have content that has steep "gradients" in image intensity horizontally (where there is a change from a black bar to a white space) and little change in intensity vertically (as each bar is a vertical line), so first we greyscale the image and then generate horizontal and vertical intensity gradients values for each point in the image and combine the values by subtracting vertical gradient from horizontal gradient</li>
<li>These values are normalised so that they are all on the scale zero to one - this data could be portrayed as another greyscale image where the brightest parts are most likely to be within barcodes</li>
<li>These values are then "spread out" or "blurred" and then a threshold value is applied where every value about it is changed into a 1 and every value below it a 0</li>
<li>This "mask" (where every value is a 0 or 1) should have identified many of the pixels within the barcodes and we want to group these pixels into distinct objects</li>
<li>There is a chance, though, that there could be gaps between bars that mean that a single barcode is spread across multiple masked-out objects and we need to try to piece them back together into one area (since the bars are tall and narrow, this may be done by considering a square area over every object and then combining objects whose squared areas overlap into one)</li>
<li>This process will result in a list of areas that may be barcodes - any that are taller than they are wide are ignored (because barcode regions are always wider than they are tall)</li>
</ol>

<p>The second step can be broken down into:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take the maybe-barcode region of the image, greyscale it and then turn into a mask by setting any pixel with an intensity less than a particular threshold to zero and otherwise to one</li>
<li>Take a horizontal slice across the image region - all of the pixels on the first row of the image - and change the zero-or-one raw data into a list of line lengths where a new line starts at any transition from zero-to-one or one-to-zero (so "01001000110" becomes "1,1,2,1,3,2,1" because there is 1x zero and then 1x one and then 2x zero and then 1x one, etc..)</li>
<li>These line lengths should correspond to bar sizes (and space-between-bar sizes) if we've found a barcode - so run the values through the magic barcode bar-size-reading algorithm (see section 2.1 in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2859730/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2859730/</a>) and if we get a number (and the checksum is correct) then we're done, hurrah!</li>
<li>If we couldn't get a number from this horizontal slice then move one pixel down and go back around</li>
<li>If it was not possible to extract a number from any of the slices through the image region then it's either not a barcode or it's somehow so distorted in the image that we can't read it</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach is fairly resilient to changes in lighting and orientation because the barcode regions are still likely to have the highest horizontal intensity gradient whether the image is dark or light (and even if <em>part</em> of the image is light and part of it is dark) and the barcode-reading algorithm works on ratios of bar/space-between-bar widths and these remain constant if the image is rotated.</p>

<p><em>(Some of the techniques are similar to things that I did in my <a href="https://www.productiverage.com/face-or-no-face-finding-faces-in-photos-using-c-sharp-and-accordnet">Face or no face (finding faces in photos using C# and Accord.NET)</a> and so I'll be using some of the same code shortly that I described then)</em></p>

<h3>Identifying maybe-barcode images</h3>

<p>Let's this image as an example to work with (peanut butter.. I <em>do</em> love peanut butter) -</p>

<p><img alt="Delicious peanut butter" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode.jpg"></p>

<p>Before looking at any code, let's visualise the process.</p>

<p>We're going to consider horizontal and vertical gradient intensity maps - at every point in the image we either look to the pixels to the left and to the right (for the horizontal gradient) or we look at the pixels above and below (for the vertical gradient) and the larger the change, the brighter the pixel in the gradient intensity map</p>

<p><img alt="Horizontal gradient intensity" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-HorizontalAndVerticalGradients.jpg"></p>

<p>And when they're combined by subtracting the vertical gradient at each point from the horizontal gradient, it looks lke this:</p>

<p><img alt="Combined gradient intensity" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-CombinedGradients.jpg"></p>

<p>If this image is blurred then we get this:</p>

<p><img alt="Blurred combined gradient intensity" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-Blurred.jpg"></p>

<p>.. and if we create a binary mask by saying "normalise the intensity values so that their range goes from zero (for the darkest pixel) to one (for the brightest) and then set any pixels that are in the bottom third in terms of intensity to 0 and set the rest to 1" then we get this:</p>

<p><img alt="Mask of possibly-part-of-a-barcode areas" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-Mask.jpg"></p>

<p>If each distinct area (where an "area" means "a group of pixels that are connected") is identified and squares overlaid and centered around the areas then we see this:</p>

<p><img alt="Mask of possibly-part-of-a-barcode areas, extended into squared areas" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-MaskSquares.jpg"></p>

<p>.. and if the areas whose bounding squares overlap are combined and then cropped around the white pixels then we end up with this:</p>

<p><img alt="Combined possibly-a-barcode areas" src="https://www.productiverage.com/Content/Images/Posts/PeanutBarcode-MaskSquaresCombined.jpg"></p>

<p>This has identified the area around the barcode and also two tiny other areas - when we come to trying to read barcode numbers out of these, the tiny regions will result in no value while the area around the genuine barcode content <em>should</em> result in a number successfully being read. But I'm getting ahead of myself.. let's look at the code required to perform the above transformations.</p>

<p>I'm going to start with a <strong>DataRectangle</strong> for performing transformations -</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-main" role="main"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <meta itemprop="mainEntityOfPage" content="//advices-writing-blog-posts/"> <meta itemprop="description" content="">  <figure itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"> <meta itemprop="url" content="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/advices-writing-blog-posts/vintage-1148940_1280.jpg"> <meta itemprop="height" content="853"> <meta itemprop="width" content="1280"> </figure> <section> <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>At work, I’ve recently been asked to advise our engineers on how to write blog posts. A lot of such articles are already available. However, they tend to focus around two main themes:</p> <ul><li><span>The technical publishing platform <em>e.g.</em> Jekyll, Medium, etc.</span></li><li><span>Metrics <em>e.g.</em> readability score, <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, etc.</span></li></ul> <p>Beyond that, everyone is on one’s own. But I believe that writing a good technical article is as much art as engineering.</p> <p>In this post, I’d like to try to address this gap: I’ve been writing this blog for more than a decade. I hope I’ve learned some things along the way, so here are my advices.</p> <p>Note that they are solely based on my humble experience, and not prescriptive in any way! Feel free to discard those that don’t feel relevant to you. And I’ll be happy about any feedback about your own experience.</p> <div> <h2 id="a-tentative-typology">A tentative typology</h2> <div> <p>Before detailing how to write a blog post, one should first accept it depends on the type of post. On this blog, I’ve noticed my posts can be mainly put into one of those categories:</p> <ol><li><span>Solving a problem</span></li><li><span>Learning in a step-by-step way</span></li><li><span>Comparing alternatives</span></li><li><span>Reviewing a book</span></li><li><span>Ranting!</span></li></ol> <p>Remember that all models are wrong, but some are helpful. While this typology is helpful, it might not be so clear-cut in every case. Also, there are a lot of other blog post types, but those listed are the ones that regularly worked for me. Let’s detail each of them in turn.</p> <div> <h3 id="solving-a-problem">Solving a problem</h3> <p>I started this blog when I was working as a consultant: my day-to-day job was basically to solve problems. The idea behind this kind of blog post is to make use of one’s work during one’s job. It also allows to deepen the understanding that one was not able to get due to time’s constraints during the project.</p> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i title="Warning"></i> </td> <td> <p>In this kind of post, the author should take utmost caution to remove any information that shouldn’t be made public. I’d very strongly advise that the post be proof-read by others before being published.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> <p>Writing such a post should be structured around the following sections.</p> <div> <dl> <dt>The context</dt> <dd> <p>When reviewing other’s blog posts, this is the part that is the least detailed, when it’s not forgotten altogether. IMHO, it should be the most important one. Engineering is all about trade-offs. If the context is not described in detail, the rest of the post loses a lot of value.</p> </dd> <dt>Considered alternatives</dt> <dd> <p>Before choosing a specific solution, the team probably considered multiple alternatives. They should be listed with their pros and cons <strong>in regard to the context</strong> described in the previous section. Try to be as objective as possible.</p> </dd> <dt>Chosen solution</dt> <dd> <p>Now is time to describe the chosen solution, along with its pros and cons. More importantly, this section should tell why it was chosen, again in regard to the context.</p> <p>Remember that not everything is related to technical issues. In some cases, the reason bedind the choice might be because of the organization, the schedule, conflict between team members, etc. Those are perfectly valid reasons. If you feel comfortable - and you’re not covered by a <abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreement">NDA</abbr>, feel free to say so. If not, tell explicitly you’re not at liberty to say why.</p> <p>The important bit to remember is to strive to be as transparent as possible in regard to the project.</p> </dd> <dt>Conclusion</dt> <dd> <p>This section recaps the above in a few sentences. With hindsight, tell whether the chosen solution was the right one. If no, explain the reasons why, and why others shouldn’t take the same decision in the same context. Make the conclusion your own retrospective.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Examples:</p> <ul><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/what-version-jekyll-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What’s the version of my Jekyll site?</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/logging-additional-metadata/">Logging additional metadata</a></span></li></ul> </div>  <div> <h3 id="comparison-of-alternatives">Comparison of alternatives</h3> <p>This kind of post tries to help readers make an informed choice about some alternatives. The idea is to have a set of alternatives, as well as a set of criteria. An important part of the work is to find the relevant criteria: while it’s not feasible to be exhaustive, one should mention the major ones. Here’s a proposal about such a post’s structure.</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Evaluation of alternatives</dt> <dd> <p>Each section should be dedicated to a single criterion. Each alternative should be evaluated regarding this criterion in one, or a couple of paragraphs.</p> </dd> <dt>Recap matrix</dt> <dd> <p>The most important section should be a recap matrix of all alternative/criterion combination. It’s advised to make use of colored symbols.</p> </dd> <dt>Optional conclusion</dt> <dd> <p>To help readers, one can write a conclusion. It should flesh out a few contexts, and extrapolate the "best" alternative given the above matrix.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Examples:</p> <ul><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/comparing-lombok-and-kotlin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comparing Lombok and Kotlin</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/git-service-providers-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git service providers comparison</a></span></li></ul> </div> <div> <h3 id="book-review">Book review</h3> <p>The name says it all: read a book, and write a review about it. Note that the reading part is actually the most time-consuming part of the blog post. It’s a great way to take notes, and let others benefit from it at the same time.</p> <p>While I’ve done a couple of book reviews in the past, I’m not sure I got them right. This is the way I did it, only time can tell if I continue doing them this way - or not. In the meantime, here’s the structure that I used before.</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Facts</dt> <dd> <ul><li><span>State the number of pages, of chapters, the price, etc.</span></li><li><span>Sum-up the whole book into a paragraph <em>i.e.</em> what’s the book about</span></li><li><span>Describe who the book is intended for</span></li></ul> </dd> <dt>Pros</dt> <dd> <p>State one thing you like, one paragraph for each</p> </dd> <dt>Cons</dt> <dd> <p>State one thing you dislike, one paragraph for each</p> </dd> <dt>Conclusion</dt> <dd> <p>This section is where you can be less objective, writing your personal feelings about what you read. The final sentence should be whether readers should acquire the book, or not.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>For teams, there’s an alternative type of book reviews that I’ve successfully lead in the past: "What our team read". Each participating team member writes a short paragraph about one of the last books he liked.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/the-leprechauns-of-software-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Leprechauns of Software Engineering</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/specification-by-example-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Specification by Example review</a></span></li></ul> </div> <div> <h3 id="opinion-rant">Opinion rant</h3> <p>Again, the name is pretty descriptive. The structure depends a lot on the subject.</p> <p>The important bit in this kind of post is the choice of the subject:</p> <ul><li><span>The focus should be on an <em>unpopular opinion</em>. Howling with the wolves is pretty useless, both for you and readers.</span></li><li><span>You should be 100% convinced that you’re right despite not belonging to the majority</span></li><li><span>Last but not least, there should be enough arguments to support your position</span></li></ul>  </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2> <div> <div> <dl> <dt>Code repository</dt> <dd> <p>I assume most blog posts will be about code and programming. Hence, it makes sense to provide code along them. There are two cases:</p> <ul><li><span>The post is based on a full-fledged code repository. You can copy-paste code snippets in the relevant parts of the blog post. Also, don’t forget to link to the code repository. GitHub has a bit of an advantage here over GitLab: in the repository description, link back to the blog post.</span></li><li><span>If a code repository is not warranted, but code snippets are necessary, they should be tested in the IDE to make work as expected.</span></li></ul> </dd> <dt>Series</dt> <dd> <p>I’ve experienced an interesting fact: the longer a blog post is, the more chances I’ll skip reading it after some point. There’s a relationship between the content’s quality and the content’s size I’m willing to go through.</p> <p>But in all cases, if the post is too long, I will stop reading. I unfortunately cannot state a rule concerning the "right" size, it’s a matter of gut feeling for me. In all cases, I’d recommend splitting posts that feel too long into separate parts and create a serie.</p> </dd> <dt>Reuse</dt> <dd> <p>Writing a blog post is a significant time investment. Why not get more out of this investment by turning it into a talk? While not all blog posts can be turned into talks, some do. In that case, preparing the talk will be quite easy.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>Remember that all this post is very empirical, so take the above advices with a pinch of salt. Also, please feel free to give your own advices in the comments, I’ll be happy to learn about upping my game myself.</p> </div> </div>   </div> </section>   </article> </div> </div></div>]]>

<!-- How to understand a system -->
<!-- Tales of feedback loops, leverage points and bottlenecks. -->

<p>To solve a problem, you first need to understand the problem.</p>

<p><a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">Problems exist within systems.</a></p>

<p>So, to understand the problem, you need to understand the system.</p>

<!-- One of the key aspects of working with any system is figuring out how it works.[^1]  -->

<!-- [^1]: This is probably true for everything. To work with X you need to figure out how X works. -->

<p>By systems I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex adaptive systems</a>. They are the most interesting kind, and difficult to deal with.</p>

<p>Complex, because removing a part destroys the system. Each part is interdependent on other parts. Like removing a heart from the human body.</p>

<p>Adaptive, because each part reacts to what the other parts do. Like the heart pumping faster when artery blockages develop.</p>

<p>Treating complex systems like a black-box, where you figure out the problem by trying solutions is a terrible idea. Imagine going to a doctor and without listening to you, the doctor gives you aspirin. Do you feel better? No? Then paracetamol. Still no? An antacid. Still no?&nbsp;.. Sigh, okay, tell me what’s wrong?</p>

<p>But that’s how we solve most surface problems. And in simple systems, it usually works.</p>

<p>The key is, can you distinguish between simple and complex systems?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t know what to call it, you can’t distinguish it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Every time you hit your mobile phone hoping it would start working, you're treating it like a black box. -->

<p>An alternative is white-box thinking. Here, we dissect the system, get into its internals and figure out why things weren’t working, or how the system works.</p>

<!-- With simple systems, it's faster to take the blackbox approach. Over time, this becomes a habit. Things get dangerous when we stop distinguishing between simple and complex systems. -->

<p>I think there are at least two ways to figure out a system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simulate the system</li>
  <li>Experiment with the system</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>

<p>Simulation is either computational or thought based.</p>

<p>One is running a computer simulation,<br>
the other is running a thought experiment.</p>

<p>In both cases, what you get are insights into how the system works. They go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Both need a basic understanding of how things will work - without an existing model, you can’t simulate. These methods are also used to refine your model. For example, you start with a barebones model built by experience. Then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you run it</a>. Then, you improve the model based on the difference in results between your model and the world.</p>

<p>One pillar example of simulation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Limits to Growth</a> done in 1972. It tracks the demise of humans on the current trajectory of consumption and environment degradation.</p>

<p>Criticized in the beginning, LTG has come to be accepted as the model predicting reality, now that we have 50 years of living the model behind us.</p>

<!-- Put in enough loops in a system and what you get is the human world. Imperfect, lots of actors, lots of variables, no accepted unifying principle. -->

<!-- Humans are interesting. We can inspect systems we are a part of. Not that we succeed every time, with our emotions getting the better of us. -->

<h3 id="thought-experiments">Thought experiments</h3>

<p>Take a hypothesis, theory or a principle. Think through what will happen if it were true. That’s a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Consider an example - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schrödinger’s cat</a> (1935). It presents a cat that is indeterminately alive or dead, depending on a random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_indeterminacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum event</a>. Figuring out if it’s alive or not is dependent on looking in the box. Till that point, it’s both, alive and dead.</p>

<p>What makes this thought experiment so great is the way it explains quantum theory. Say, instead, you had a coin inside the box. You can toss this coin by pressing a button outside the box. If it’s heads, the cat will die. Tails, and it lives. With every button press, the probability to live decreases, but at no point is that cat both alive and dead. Is your mind blowing to pieces yet?</p>

<!-- Thought experiments are all about running experiments in the mind - to figure out the system, by simulating what you think will happen when you do X. 
unconsciously/consciously using the equations fed to your simulation model. -->

<h4 id="the-process">The process</h4>

<p>You begin with a set of hypothesis about what would happen.<br>
You run through them in your mind</p>

<p>There are two things that might happen.<br>
You arrive at an outcome different from what you expect<br>
You arrive at your version of reality</p>

<p>Both cases are a cause for concern.<br>
You confirm that’s what would happen in the real world, via experience<br>
If your model is close enough to the real world, profit.<br>
else you refine your hypothesis and restart.</p>

<h2 id="experimentation">Experimentation</h2>

<p>Here, we enter the territory of real world experiments with real world consequences that might change the state of the system.</p>

<p>You’re perturbing the system to try and figure out what will happen. Thus, you want to experiment with small changes first.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Want universal basic income? Try experimenting in a few cities first. it’s A/B testing on whatever scale works.</p>

<p>The only caveat: things break when you scale up.</p>

<p>Experimentation with system is needed when your imagination can’t keep up with what you’re seeing. This usually happens in complex systems. There are too many variables - you don’t know half of them, and you can’t keep the other half in your brain.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>The main aim, using the above approaches is to build an accurate-enough model. One that behaves the same way the system behaves, given the same input.</p>

<p>Input → System → Output<br>
Input → Model → Output</p>

<p>Fair warning though, knowing this model isn’t the same as controlling the system. That’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Law of Requisite Variety</a> - to control a system, you need a controller at least as complex as the system.</p>

<p><a href="https://thesystemsthinker.com/behavior-over-time-diagrams-seeing-dynamic-interrelationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behaviour over time diagrams</a> are an excellent tool to build this model. Sometimes sketching things out, looking at it all together helps see the relationships. That’s what BOTDs are for.</p>

<h2 id="questions-to-answer">Questions to answer</h2>

<p>In both approaches, you’re trying to fill in some blanks. Here are some important questions to answer. They exist in every system.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure what some of them mean, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">head over to seeing systems.</a></p>

<p>Find the driving factors</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What would happen if I do X?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Figure out the loop structure</p>
<blockquote>

<h2 id="system-archetypes">System Archetypes</h2>

<p>Some very common models come into play again and again. If you know these well, the problem switches from trying to figure out what is happening, to which model fits? - This is powerful and dangerous.</p>

<p>Dangerous because you get a tendency to beat the current situation into one of these models.</p>

<p>Powerful because you don’t have to start from scratch every time.</p>

<p>This is how <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-Simplistic-explanation-to-Mental-Models.html">Mental Models work</a>. They are archetypes for life.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_archetype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> has an excellent introduction to system archetypes.</p>

<p>To dive into available archetypes, <a href="https://thesystemsthinker.com/systems-archetypes-i-diagnosing-systemic-issues-and-designing-interventions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Systems Thinker is an excellent resource.</a></p>

<p>I haven’t explored archetypes enough, yet.</p>

<p>What I do know, is that the above archetype list is incomplete.</p>

<p>As Charlie Munger found out, sometimes it’s easier to look in an adjacent field than diving deeper in yours.</p>

<p>That’s what I’ll do.</p>

<p>Into Chemistry - equilibriums. Systems can be thought of as an equilibrium.</p>

<p>That’s when we can use results from chemical equilibrium to explain system behaviour. Presenting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chatelier%27s_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Le Chateliers Principle</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a settled system is disturbed, it will adjust to diminish the change that has been made to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- With computer models: the language is clearer - explicit and shows the underlying assumptions. -->

<p>This is precisely what Jay Forrester says happens in social systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“At any time, a near-equilibrium exists affecting population mobility
between different areas of a country. To the extent that there is disequilibrium, it
means that some area is slightly more attractive than others and population begins
to move in the direction of the more attractive area. Movement continues until
rising population drives the more attractive area down in attractiveness to again
be in equilibrium with its surroundings. Other things being equal, an increase in
population of a city crowds housing, overloads job opportunities, causes
congestion, increases pollution, encourages crime, and reduces every component
of the quality of life.”<br>
- <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-988-system-dynamics-self-study-fall-1998-spring-1999/readings/behavior.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Forrester,  Counter intuitive behaviour of social systems</a></p>
</blockquote>

<!--

Efforts to improve some condition of a city will result primarily in increasing
population until other conditions deteriorate to reestablish an equilibrium.

Programs aimed at improving a city can
succeed only if they result in eventually raising the average quality of life for the
country as a whole.

Counter intuitive behaviour of social systems
1. Human intuition develops from exposure to simple systems. In simple systems,
the cause of a trouble is close in both time and space to symptoms of the trouble.
If one touches a hot stove, the burn occurs here and now; the cause is obvious.
However, in complex dynamic systems, causes are often far removed in both time
and space from the symptoms. True causes may lie far back in time and arise
from an entirely different part of the system from when and where the symptoms
occur. However, the complex system can mislead in devious ways by presenting
an apparent cause that meets the expectations derived from simple systems. A
person will observe what appear to be causes that lie close to the symptoms in
both time and space—shortly before in time and close to the symptoms.

For example, human suffering in cities is accompanied (some
think caused) by inadequate housing. As a result, housing is increased and
population rises to defeat the effort. More people are trapped in the depressed
urban system. As another example, symptoms of excess population are beginning
to overshadow all countries. 

2. social systems seem to have a few sensitive influence points
through which behavior can be changed. These high-influence points are not
where most people expect. Furthermore, when a high-influence policy is
identified, the chances are great that a person guided by intuition and judgment
will alter the system in the wrong direction. 

3. social systems exhibit a conflict between short-term and long-term
consequences of a policy change. A policy that produces improvement in the
short run is usually one that degrades a system in the long run. Likewise, policies
that produce long-run improvement may initially depress behavior of a system.
This is especially treacherous. The short run is more visible and more
compelling.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">
           <div itemprop="articleBody">
            
  <div id="concepts">

<p>Normandy is a system that allows Mozilla to instruct Firefox clients to
perform a variety of actions to aid the user and gather feedback to guide
Mozilla in developing a better browser for them. To do this, we need a way to
instruct Firefox to perform certain actions without having to download an
update or wait for a new release.</p>
<p>The system is made of two main components, a server and client. These
components are known simply as the Normandy client and Normandy server. The
server provides information that the client acts on.</p>
<p>Normandy’s execution is built around two main concepts: Actions and Recipes. This
document describes those concepts in detail.</p>
<div id="actions">
<h2>Actions<a href="#actions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An action is one of the capabilities provided by Normandy. As of Firefox 66,
actions are implemented entirely within the browser as native code (though
previously they were served by the server and retrieved at runtime). Actions are
identified in recipes by name, such as “preference-experiment” or
“show-heartbeat”.</p>
<p>Actions can accept a configuration object that is specified within the
Normandy control interface. This configuration, which is part of a
<a href="#recipes"><span>recipe</span></a>, contains data required by the action, such as
translated strings or boolean options for controlling behavior.</p>
<p>For example, a “survey” action could consist of code within Firefox to check
whether we have shown a survey to the user recently, to determine which
variant of a survey to show, and the code to actually display the survey
itself. When issued to clients, this action is paired with configuration for
the survey action would contain the text of the survey prompt and the URL to
redirect the user to after answering.</p>
</div>
<div id="recipes">
<h2>Recipes<a href="#recipes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A recipe is a model that represents a single instance of an action we want to
perform. Recipes contain three important pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Client filtering data that determines which users the recipe should be run
for. This takes the form of a <a href="https://github.com/TechnologyAdvice/Jexl">JEXL</a> expression that is evaluated on the
client and has access to several pieces of data about the client, such as
the data collected by <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Telemetry">Telemetry</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The name of the <a href="#actions"><span>action</span></a> that this recipe should perform
when run.</p></li>
<li><p>The configuration data to pass to the Action code when it is executed, called
the recipe’s <strong>arguments</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Recipes are stored in the Normandy server’s database and the Normandy client
fetches them from the service during execution. All active recipes are sent
to every client, and filtering is done locally on the client.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a recipe in JSON format, as fetched by the Normandy
client:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>{</span>
   <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Console Log Test"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"revision_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"action"</span><span>:</span> <span>"console-log"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"arguments"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"message"</span><span>:</span> <span>"It works!"</span>
   <span>},</span>
   <span>"filter_expression"</span><span>:</span> <span>"normandy.version &gt;= '65.0' &amp;&amp; stableSample(0.5)"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The data retrieved by the Normandy client is the minimum subset of data
that is needed execute the action. Other API end points return more
information about the recipe, including it’s history and approval status.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="normandy-client">
<h2>Normandy Client<a href="#normandy-client" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Normandy client is <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/normandy">a Firefox component</a> that reads and executes
instructions from the server. Upon activation (typically every few hours),
the client:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Downloads <a href="#recipes"><span>recipes</span></a> from the Normandy service.</p></li>
<li><p>Verifies the signature of the recipes.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluates the recipe filters and removes recipes that do not match the
client.</p></li>
<li><p>Executes the corresponding action code using the recipe’s arguments.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="security-considerations">
<h2>Security Considerations<a href="#security-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the goal of SHIELD is to allow Mozilla to perform certain privileged
actions quickly without shipping full updates to Firefox, it is a tempting
target for compromising Firefox users. Normandy includes several security
controls to help mitigate this risk.</p>
<div id="action-and-recipe-signing">
<h3>Action and Recipe Signing<a href="#action-and-recipe-signing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Recipes that are downloaded by the client are signed according to the
Content-Signature protocol as provided by the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph">Autograph</a> service. The client
verifies the signature upon downloading the recipes, ensuring that only
recipes that have been signed with a Mozilla-controlled key are executed.</p>
<p>This helps prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks where an adversary pretends to be
the remote Normandy service.</p>
</div>
<div id="peer-approval">
<h3>Peer Approval<a href="#peer-approval" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Recipes cannot be enabled in the Normandy admin interface without going through
an <cite>approval process &lt;/user/peer_approval&gt;</cite>. One user must submit the recipe
for approval, and a separate user must approve the recipe before it can be
distributed by the service.</p>
<p>This helps prevent compromise of a single account from compromising the entire
service, since two accounts need to be compromised to publish a recipe.</p>
</div>
<div id="safe-instructions">
<h3>Safe Instructions<a href="#safe-instructions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Recipe data is provided in either a non-executable format (JSON) or a safe
executable format designed specifically to be weak and without enough access
to exfiltrate data (JEXL filters). In technical terms, the JEXL filters are
not turing complete, by design. This means that even if an attacker could run
a malicious recipe in Firefox, they are limited to the actions implemented in
the existing client.</p>
</div>
<div id="configurable-admin">
<h3>Configurable Admin<a href="#configurable-admin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The admin interface for Normandy can be disabled via a Django setting, which
allows for disabling the admin interface on public-facing web servers and
running them with read-only privileges. The writable admin interface is then
deployed behind a VPN to restrict access to authorized users.</p>

<![CDATA[Managing Proxmox Using Terraform, Cloud-Init, SaltStack and Prometheus]]>

August 10, 2020 | https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In the last <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-saltstack-part-1-linux/">two</a> <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/">series</a> of posts on this site, I covered using SaltStack to deploy <a href="https://consul.io/">Consul</a> and <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> Exporters, and also using different Prometheus service discovery mechanisms to gather instances to monitor in each provider.</p>
<p>There is no Prometheus discovery mechanism for Proxmox, nor a consistent way to discover tagged instances in Proxmox (regardless of which tool queries the Proxmox API). Instead, we can implement something like Consul to discover the instances.</p>
<p>Also, Proxmox supports Cloud-Init, so we can bootstrap virtual machines and them register with Salt, install base packages and more without the cyclical dependency of needing to be registered to Salt to install Salt.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>As mentioned, we have covered some of what we are using here in different posts already: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-node_exporter">Prometheus: Discovering Services with Consul</a> - Using Consul with Prometheus to discover instances to monitor</li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/saltstack-introduction">Configuration Seasoning: Getting started with Saltstack</a> - A primer on SaltStack, including how to configure a basic Salt environment</li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-saltstack-part-1-linux/">Prometheus - Auto-deploying Consul and Exporters using Saltstack Part 1: Linux</a> - This post (and series) contains all of the Salt states we use in this post, as well as the Prometheus configuration</li>
<li>Prometheus Service Discovery posts on <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform</a>, <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-digitalocean/">Digital Ocean</a> and <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/">OpenStack</a> - This post cover using Terraform with various cloud providers, as well as making use of Cloud-Init</li>
</ul>
<p>By using elements of each of the above, we can treat Proxmox almost like another Cloud environment/provider.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-proxmox">Setting up Proxmox</h2>
<p>Proxmox can be installed using the <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads">ISOs</a> provided on the Proxmox website. Full instructions for how to install the Virtualization Environment are available <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Installation">here</a>.</p>
<p>The following videos also do a good job of explaining it too: -</p>

</p>

<p>Once installed, you should be able to view the Proxmox GUI on <code>https://$IP_OF_HOST:8006</code>: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-gui.png" alt="Proxmox GUI"></p>
<p>You can create Proxmox hosts in either standalone mode or multiple hosts in a cluster. The latter allows you to manage all of your instances from the UI of any host in the cluster. It also allows live migration of instances between Proxmox hosts (seamlessly, if using shared storage).</p>
<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p>Once Proxmox is installed, we can configure the Terraform Proxmox <a href="https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox">provider</a>.</p>
<p>For information on how to install Terraform and an example project structure, see <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/#configure-terraform">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="install-the-provider">Install the provider</h3>
<p>As the provider is from a third party, and not an official Terraform provider, you need to install the provider manually on your machine. Full instructions for this are available <a href="https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/blob/master/docs/installation.md">here</a>, but to summarize the steps: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Clone the repository</span>
$ git clone https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox

<span># Go Install the provider and provisioner (requires a working Goland installation)</span>
$ cd terraform-provider-proxmox
$ go install github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/cmd/terraform-provider-proxmox
$ go install github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/cmd/terraform-provisioner-proxmox

<span># Run the Makefile</span>
$ make

<span># Create the Terraform plugins directory and move the generated plugins to it</span>
$ mkdir ~/.terraform.d/plugins
$ cp bin/terraform-provider-proxmox ~/.terraform.d/plugins
$ cp bin/terraform-provisioner-proxmox ~/.terraform.d/plugins
</code></pre></div><p>The provider will now be available to use within your Terraform environment.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-terraform-user-in-proxmox">Create a Terraform user in Proxmox</h3>
<p>Terraform requires a user to authenticate against the Proxmox API. You can create the user via the GUI, but you will need to use the CLI to assign it to the correct roles. Alternatively, you can create the user and assign roles with the CLI: -</p>
<h3 id="configure-the-proxmox-provider">Configure the Proxmox provider</h3>
<p>Within your Terraform directory, create a directory called <code>proxmox</code> and then add a <code>provider.tf</code> file: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>provider</span> <span>"proxmox"</span> {
  pm_api_url <span>=</span> <span>"https://$IP_OF_HOST:8006/api2/json"</span>
  pm_user <span>=</span> <span>"<a href="https://yetiops.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="354150474754535a47581845475a4375454350">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
  pm_tls_insecure <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>You also need to supply the password, however it is not advisable to supply this as part of the configuration. Sensitive credentials should not be comitted to a version control system (like Git). Instead, you can use an environment variable: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ export PM_PASS<span>=</span><span>"PR0M0X_P8SS"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You should now be able to configure instances in Proxmox using Terraform.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-template">Creating a template</h3>
<p>The Terraform provider can create instances using either the <code>iso</code> option (i.e. a CD-based installer) or via a <code>clone</code> (i.e. a copy of another instance). The former provides little benefit over installing via the GUI. Instead we can create a template instance ready to be cloned, with all the necessary dependencies for <a href="https://cloud-init.io/">Cloud-Init</a>.</p>
<p>There are two ways to achieve this: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Create your own instance, install the necessary dependencies and convert to a template</li>
<li>Use an image with the dependencies installed already.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proxmox recommend using the same <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html">images</a> used for <a href="https://openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>, as OpenStack supports Cloud-Init. Also, Proxmox and OpenStack both use <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM</a> for virtualization, meaning the images use common dependencies and kernel modules.</p>
<p>To create the template, obtain one of the OpenStack images (I am using Debian Buster): -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Navigate to the ISO directory for Proxmox</span>
$ cd /var/lib/vz/templates/isos

<span># Source the image</span>
$ wget http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/current-10/debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2
</code></pre></div><p>Use the following commands to create a template within Proxmox, ready to be cloned: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Create the instance</span>
qm create <span>9000</span> -name debian-cloudinit -memory <span>1024</span> -net0 virtio,bridge<span>=</span>vmbr0 -cores <span>1</span> -sockets <span>1</span>

<span># Import the OpenStack disk image to Proxmox storage</span>
qm importdisk <span>9000</span> debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2 local-lvm

<span># Attach the disk to the virtual machine</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -scsihw virtio-scsi-pci -virtio0 local-lvm:vm-9000-disk-0

<span># Add a serial output</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -serial0 socket

<span># Set the bootdisk to the imported Openstack disk</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -boot c -bootdisk virtio0

<span># Enable the Qemu agent</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -agent <span>1</span>

<span># Allow hotplugging of network, USB and disks</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -hotplug disk,network,usb

<span># Add a single vCPU (for now)</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -vcpus <span>1</span>

<span># Add a video output</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -vga qxl

<span># Set a second hard drive, using the inbuilt cloudinit drive</span>
qm set <span>9000</span> -ide2 local-lvm:cloudinit

<span># Resize the primary boot disk (otherwise it will be around 2G by default)</span>
<span># This step adds another 8G of disk space, but change this as you need to</span>
qm resize <span>9000</span> virtio0 +8G

<span># Convert the VM to the template</span>
qm template <span>9000</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This template will now be usable with Terraform with the name <code>debian-cloudinit</code> (i.e. the name specified when creating the instance).</p>
<h3 id="define-an-instance">Define an instance</h3>
<p>You can now create the configuration files for your first Proxmox instance. The below is from the file <code>vm.tf</code> in the <code>terraform/proxmox</code> directory: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span># Source the Cloud Init Config file

</code></pre></div><p>To summarize the steps being taken here, we are: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Source the <code>cloud-config</code> file, with steps that the instance should take at first boot
<ul>
<li>We also supply variables to set the hostname, domain and our SSH key to the instance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We generate a local file of the template with the variables applied</li>
<li>We use a <code>null_resource</code> in Terraform to copy the file to the Proxmox host
<ul>
<li>Null Resources are used instead of an existing provider</li>
<li>The provisioner is used to place the file in the remote location (i.e. the Proxmox host)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We create a QEMU-based virtual machine
<ul>
<li>This depends on the <code>cloud-config</code> file being generated and transferred to the Proxmox host</li>
<li>We specify the Proxmox node to build it on</li>
<li>We tell it to clone the <code>debian-cloudinit</code> image (from the <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/#creating-a-template">Creating a template</a> section)</li>
<li>We use the <code>cicustom</code> option to specify our <code>cloud-config</code> template</li>
<li>We use <code>ipconfig0</code> to specify the IP of the first network interface</li>
<li>We tell it to have a disk size of 10G</li>
<li>We create the network, with an ID of 0 (which matches the <code>ipconfig0</code> ID)</li>
<li>We ignore changes to the network</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last step is because the Proxmox provider wants to recreate the interface on every apply, as the MAC address is randomly generated each time. You either need to ignore changes so that it doesn’t want to recreate the interface, or specify the MAC address in the <code>network</code> block using the <code>macaddr</code> field, eg: -</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		




<p>I recently got a <a href="https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0AUX">Behringer UMC22 sound card</a> for video conferencing and DJing. This page documents what I've learned about using this sound card, and USB audio in general, on FreeBSD.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Everything works as long as the sound card follows the USB audio device class specification.</p>

<img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/thumbnails/freebsd-usb-audio-large.jpg" alt="Behringer UMC22 sound card connected to FreeBSD computer">

<h2>Hardware support</h2>

<p>Which USB sound cards are supported in FreeBSD? The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/12.0R/hardware.html">hardware notes</a> don't list USB sound cards, and neither does the manual page for the corresponding driver, <code><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=snd_uaudio">snd_uaudio (4)</a></code>. Inspecting the <a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/dev/sound/usb/uaudio.c?view=co">source code for the <code>snd_uaudio</code> driver</a> lists some cards that require custom tweaks, but a complete list isn't present.
</p>

<p>Hardware support for USB sound cards appears to be based on compliance with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131105223008/http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/audio10.pdf">USB audio device class specification</a>, rather than on specific chipsets or models.
</p>

<p>How can you verify whether a USB audio device is compliant with the specification? In the case of the UMC22, the chip used is the TI PCM 2902. The <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pcm2902.pdf">specifications for the PCM2902 chipset</a> say somewhat ambiguously that "the whole board design should be considered to meet the USB specification as a USB-compliant product" and indicate that the interface communicates through a "the standard USB request and USB audio class specific request". There doesn't appear to be an explicit statement, but it is implied that the chipset is compliant with the USB audio device class specification. The same chipset is apparently used in other Behringer sound cards such as the UM2, UA222, UCA222, and UCA202.
</p>

<h2>Using the sound card</h2>

<p>When connected to a FreeBSD machine, <code>dmesg</code> shows that the UMC22 is recognized by the <code>uaudio</code> driver. Note the string identifying the PCM2902 chipset from the spec sheet ("Burr-Brown from TI"):
</p>

<p>
uaudio0 on uhub1<br>
uaudio0: &lt;Burr-Brown from TI USB Audio CODEC, class 0/0, rev 1.10/1.00, addr 2&gt; on usbus0<br>
uaudio0: Play: 48000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Play: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Play: 32000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 48000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 32000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 22050 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 16000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: Record: 11025 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit S-LE PCM format, 2x8ms buffer.<br>
uaudio0: No MIDI sequencer.<br>
pcm3: &lt;USB audio&gt; on uaudio0<br>
uaudio0: HID volume keys found.<br>
</p>

<p>The available sound devices can be listed using <code>cat /dev/sndstat</code>, which shows that the sound card is recognized for both playback and recording (here at pcm3):</p>

<p>
Installed devices:
pcm0: &lt;Realtek (0x0257) (Analog 2.0+HP/2.0)&gt; (play/rec) default<br>
pcm1: &lt;Realtek (0x0257) (Right Analog Mic)&gt; (rec)<br>
pcm2: &lt;Intel Kaby Lake (HDMI/DP 8ch)&gt; (play)<br>
pcm3: &lt;USB audio&gt; (play/rec)<br>
No devices installed from userspace.
</p>

<p>How can the sound card be set as the playback device? Some programs, such as <a href="https://www.mixxx.org/">mixxx</a> or <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, allow setting the output device in their preferences. Other programs will only use the default output device, which can be set using:<br><code>   sysctl hw.snd.default_unit=3</code><br>with the appropriate number for the device (in this case, <code>pcm3</code> = 3).
</p>

<p>The device number shown in <code>/dev/sndstat</code> corresponds to the device number under <code>/dev/dsp</code> and <code>/dev/mixer</code>. For example, to view the volume levels on the sound card with <code>mixer (8)</code>, you would use:<br><code>   mixer -f /dev/mixer3</code><br>To set the volume, you would use a command such as:<br><code>   mixer -f /dev/mixer3 vol 75</code><br>(If the sound card has been set as the default device, there is no need to specify the device in the <code>mixer</code> command).
</p>


<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>If an application is playing audio from the sound card when the system goes into a suspend state, the system will get stuck until all programs using the sound card close the corresponding device nodes, with a series of messages like this on the console:</p>

<p>
pcm3: unregister: channel pcm3:virtual:dsp3.vp0 busy (pid 45989)<br>
pcm3: Waiting for sound application to exit!
</p>

<p>These messages will continue to repeat until the application releases the audio device, at which point the system will finally be able to enter suspend state.</p>

<p>To work around this, I currently set the default audio device back to ID 0 as part of my pre-suspend script. This will prevent an application using the default device (such as Firefox) from preventing suspend.</p>

<p>However, for applications that set the audio device explicitly, this doesn't work. In fact, they'll often keep the audio device open even when audio isn't playing, hanging the suspend process and eventually forcing a reboot.</p>

<p>To allow suspend to continue, I use my pre-suspend script to just quit any program that has the sound card open before suspend:</p>

<div><p>
# Close up the USB sound card before suspend<br>
sysctl hw.snd.default_unit=0</p><p>

# Close any programs still using the sound card<br>
while fstat | grep dsp3 2&gt;&amp;1; do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fstat | grep dsp3 | cut -w -f 3 | while read pid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do kill -15 "$pid"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done<br>
done<br>
while [ "$(ls -l /dev | grep -c dsp3)" -gt 1 ]; do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep 1<br>
done
</p></div>

		<p>The NanoPi NEOLTS is a SBC from <a href="https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=69&amp;product_id=132">FriendlyElec</a> that uses the Allwinner H3
SOC. The NanoPi NEOLTS has a nice selection of hardware including 100Mbit
Ethernet, 3 USB Ports and a bunch of exposed GPIO.</p>
<p>FreeBSD on the NanoPi uses GENERICSD image. This image requires a bootloader
to be added before it will work. We can prepare a single image to be copied to
many SD cards by using a memory disk as an intermediate step.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventurist.me/images/nanopi-neolts.jpg"><img src="https://adventurist.me/imagessmall/nanopi-neolts.jpg" alt="NanoPi NEOLTS" title="NanoPi NEOLTS"></a></p>
<p>We need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the latest GENERICSD card image snapshot</li>
<li>Install the correct boot loader pkg</li>
<li>Create a memory disk</li>
<li>Copy the GENERICSD image to memory disk</li>
<li>Copy the bootloader to the memory disk</li>
<li>Mount the root partition of the sd card image</li>
<li>Copy the programs and files we need for the tutorial to the sd card</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest image is as I write is 13 CURRENT from 20190829:</p>
<pre><code>$ fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/arm/armv7/ISO-IMAGES/13.0/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-arm-armv7-GENERICSD-20190829-r351591.img.xz
</code></pre><p>We have to decompress the image before we can use it</p>
<pre><code>$ xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-arm-armv7-GENERICSD-20190829-r351591.img.xz
</code></pre><p>Each u-boot bootloader platform has its own package, currently there are 46
different bootloaders in the FreeBSD ports system. We want the u-boot for the
nanopi_neo (our target).</p>
<pre><code>$ pkg search nanopi     
u-boot-nanopi-neo2-2019.07     Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi-neo2
u-boot-nanopi_a64-2019.07      Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi_a64
u-boot-nanopi_m1plus-2019.07   Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi_m1plus
u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07      Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi_neo
u-boot-nanopi_neo_air-2019.07  Cross-build das u-boot for model nanopi_neo_air

# pkg install u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07
</code></pre><p>The <code>u-boot-nanopi_neo</code> package contains the binary bootloader we need in
<code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code></p>
<pre><code>$ pkg info -l u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07

u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07:
    /usr/local/share/licenses/u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07/GPLv2
    /usr/local/share/licenses/u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07/LICENSE
    /usr/local/share/licenses/u-boot-nanopi_neo-2019.07/catalog.mk
    /usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/README
    /usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/boot.scr
    /usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/metadata
    /usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin
</code></pre><p>With the GENERICSD image and the bootloader we need to create the memory disk
image we will use for staging. First we need to create a large enough backing
file.</p>
<pre><code>$ truncate -s 8G nanopi.img
# mdconfig -f nanopi.img
md0
</code></pre><p>Now we can <code>dd</code> the GENERICSD image to the memory disk</p>
<pre><code># dd if=FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-arm-armv7-GENERICSD-20190829-r351591.img of=/dev/md0 bs=1m
</code></pre><p>We need to <code>dd</code> the bootloader to the start of the SD card, i.e. the entire
device and not a partition.</p>
<pre><code># dd if=/usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-nanopi_neo/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/da0 bs=1k seek=8 conv=sync
</code></pre><p>With the memory disk attached we can interact with the image file as if it were
a real USB drive or SD card. </p>
<pre><code>$ gpart show md0
=&gt;      63  16777153  md0  MBR  (8.0G)
        63      2016       - free -  (1.0M)
      2079    102312    1  fat32lba  [active]  (50M)
    104391   6187041    2  freebsd  (3.0G)
   6291432  10485784       - free -  (5.0G)
</code></pre><p>We can mount the root partition of the SD card and modify or add any files we
wish:</p>
<pre><code># mount /dev/md0sa mnt
</code></pre><p>When we are done changing things we have to disconnect the memory disk:</p>
<pre><code># sudo mdconfig -d -u md0
</code></pre><p>Finally we can copy the memory disk to a real sd card using <code>dd</code>:</p>
<pre><code># sudo dd if=nanopi.img of=/dev/da0 bs=1m
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I like open source. I use open source software when it’s appropriate. I write open source software, at that, and I’m happy to do so. (To wit: PortalWizard, LogN, Opensymphony components, RSSLibJ, as well as others.) That said, I really,&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;dislike the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>. When I have a choice between their offerings and someone else’s, I nearly always go with the alternatives. I don’t use their licenses. I don’t defend them, or even their goals, really. In many ways, I’m actively antagonistic.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s pretty simple. I thought the FSF rocked until I had to deal with them directly, and the repercussions of that interaction made me reconsider all my assumptions.</p>
<h2>Starting Down the Slippery Slope</h2>
<p>I was working as a consultant for IBM in 1997, on their ProductManager suite. ProductManager needed a little language, for which I designed a grammar and lexer. When you need a compiler compiler and a lexer, you look at packages in the&nbsp;<code>yacc</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>lex</code>&nbsp;family… and the best of those, for C, remain the FSF’s&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html"><code>bison</code></a>&nbsp;and Vern Paxson’s&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/flex.html"><code>flex</code></a>. Not only was I trying to do well for IBM, but I was also aiming at using the best products available.</p>
<p>IBM, understandably, wanted to cover its pockets in the case of liability, so they had me talk to the respective authors to make sure that their code was actually theirs to give away. The reasoning was, as I understand it, that if (say)&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;incorporated some copyrighted Microsoft code, and Microsoft discovered that IBM was using that code, Microsoft could sue both the author of&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;IBM. However, if IBM had a signed affadavit from the respective authors that asserted their right to distribute code, then IBM would have done due diligence to protect itself and other companies from illegal activity. It wouldn’t have been a full defense, but would be enough to mitigate most damage in court. (The realisation that IBM didn’t expect due diligence to be a complete shield was a blow to my faith in civil courts, too, even though that faith was pretty weak to begin with.)</p>
<p>So I wrote Vern Paxson and the FSF (because Richard Stallman was listed as the author of&nbsp;<code>bison</code>, which surprised me.) Vern got back with me after a few hours, and said he’d be happy to sign a form for us. When I talked to him on the phone and explained the exact situation, he reversed his position, saying that he simply couldn’t honestly say that&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;had no copyrighted code in it. He didn’t think it did, but he wasn’t able to get such an assertion from each author.</p>
<p>That eliminated&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;for our project. I didn’t mind, for a few reasons: one was that lexers are fairly trivial, and we could replace lex with something feature-comparable; another reason was that Vern was very straightforward about the situation. I got the feeling that he actually considered the needs of his potential userbase.</p>
<p>A few hours after Vern’s initial reply came back, the FSF responded, too. (I was genuinely surprised at how rapid both responses were made.) They said that Richard Stallman was, indeed, the author of&nbsp;<code>bison</code>, and soon we managed to strike up a dialog with him directly.</p>
<p>Eventually, we were in a conference call with him. I was a little awed, considering that I’d been using some of RMS’s tools (like Emacs) for quite some time even then. Basically, we had in mind a sort of&nbsp;<em>quid pro quo</em>, in that we wanted an affadavit signed and he wanted a monetary grant. It was also a chance for the FSF to score points in the courts, since the GPL hadn’t been challenged. Our reasoning was that if IBM was using the code, and was challenged, then the FSF would be piggybacking a defense of the LGPL from IBM’s defense team.</p>
<p>RMS would have none of it. What we were asking for, to be clear, was an assertion that the FSF had the right to apply their license to the software they made available. A denial of that assertion undermines their whole reason for being, after all, and we were certainly going to recompense the FSF for making good software available. Instead, RMS refused outright to sign the affadavit, and suggested quite bluntly that ProductManager (which costed IBM millions to develop, and was a pretty vertical product) should be open source, and we could send a check to him at this address, etc.</p>
<p>I was&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;impressed. It wasn’t so much the open source spiel that bothered me, but the refusal of the assertion. If it was&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;code, I’d have been happy to say it was mine, as long as I knew (a la Vern Paxson’s response). RMS, however, didn’t even entertain the thought from the impression he gave us. Instead, he came across as a complete hypocrite, an impression confirmed with further investigation of the FSF’s policies and approach. He was effectively implying that he’d stolen the code, and released it as open source just to further his personal views on software source code availability.</p>
<h2>The Air Over There</h2>
<p>I think the FSF is on crack. They want software to be open-sourced, as a statement of ethics, and yet they advocate strong-arming companies in order to get what they want. They don’t want the code, even – they just want all code to be open source, and they’re willing to act like brown-shirts to do it.</p>
<p>If you go to their&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/">home page</a>, for example, you see this announcement at the end of the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as `Linux”, they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>The opening sentence for the paragraph is “Welcome to the GNU Project web server.”</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Not only is the sentence about Linux inappropriate for the paragraph’s subject matter, it’s retarded. Their&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">justification</a>&nbsp;is something like this: “Linux is just the kernel, and GNU provides the rest of the system that makes the kernel useful, so the name should be GNU/Linux instead of just Linux.”</p>
<p>That’s idiotic. For one thing, they’re targeting Linux in this, for reasons of publicity only. (Yes, that’s right, I just said the FSF was a bunch of publicity whores.) If they were going to be fair about this, they’d apply that reasoning to a lot of software: “GNU/Cygwin,” et cetera. To my knowledge, they don’t do this. For another, they presume that GNU is central to Linux… and it’s not. I know of developers who’ve created Linux distributions with BSD tools instead of GNU, for example, and the mere fact that it’s doable suggests that maybe GNU isn’t as critical to Linux as the FSF seems to suggest. Sure, maybe Linus used GNU tools to generate the kernel. Does that mean that every Visual Basic app needs to trumpet “MS/Whatever” as part of its name, too?</p>
<p>It gets worse. The FSF not only demands recognition (which, by the way, it got plenty of already), but it actively supports piracy, offering&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Piracy">this newspeak</a>&nbsp;as a replacement. “Use neutral terms to describe piracy,” they suggest, offering “unauthorized copying” as well as “sharing information with your neighbor.” Pardon me, fellows, for actually setting the price I want as recompense for my effort. The freedoms the FSF supposedly tries to work for include the rights to say “No, I wrote this with my blood, sweat, and tears, I want $100 for it or you don’t have to use it.”</p>
<p>And that brings up another annoyance with the FSF – the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">GPL</a>. The GPL is a viral license, requiring programs that use GPLed code to be under the GPL themselves. In a way, that makes sense, although most other similar licenses are less militaristic;most of them respect the right of authors to keep their code proprietary, usually requesting links to the source of licensed software. The GPL, on the other hand, says that it’s&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;open, and they choose licenses accordingly.</p>
<p>To wit, they have a “Lesser GPL,” the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#LGPL">LGPL</a>, which doesn’t have the same viral effect that the GPL does. The FSF has a document, called&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061113044900/http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">Why you shouldn’t use the Library GPL for your next library</a>&nbsp;(written before the LGPL was renamed to “Lesser GPL”), which explains that the LGPL is used where there’s no real reason to rely on the GNU offering. In other words, all the truly useful stuff they have (and there’s a good bit of it) is basically bait for the GPL; “use GetOpt, and&nbsp;<em><strong>we have you!</strong></em>”</p>
<p>That’s cowardly, in my opinion, arguing from a position of weakness.</p>
<p>And that’s the FSF for you.</p>

This idea took root and, over the years, we've gradually started tackling the surrounding challenges, such as:</p><ul><li><p>a fast and reliable build system much needed in front-end development, </p></li><li><p>various JS interop features that spawned an ecosystem of well typed libraries,</p></li><li><p>a production-ready standard library,</p></li><li><p>and recently, a fresh, solid syntax.</p></li></ul><p>These developments have attracted many people into our community. But one bigger challenge persisted: newcomers dropped out at the sheer amount of extra incongruent tools and learning overhead from having to understand OCaml concepts, Reason concepts, and BuckleScript's own concepts. Take, for example, what's required to make a ReasonReact app:</p><ul><li><p>Knowledge of React.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of JS.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of ReasonReact's specific idioms (that we've tried hard to keep to a minimum).</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of OCaml idioms, on top of which BuckleScript is built.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of BuckleScript's JS interop and the build system.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of the Reason syntax.</p></li></ul><p>Ironically, the more documentation we pile up, the more mental overhead newcomers suffered. During the various BuckleScript &amp; Reason meetups, we've frequently seen folks' enthusiasm crushed at the sheer prospect of making a web app while keeping 5+ tabs' worth of documentations open. This was discouraging, both for said eager developers and for us maintainers. </p><p>The adoption barrier is real, and it's about time we finally solve it.</p><p>Today, we'll start to truly unify the various BuckleScript-related projects under a single name: ReScript. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>The compiler, the build system and the syntax unified and shipping under a single install. Likewise for future efforts such as editor plugin.</p></li><li><p>A single documentation site which covers the above: <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescript-lang.org</a>.</p></li><li><p>Streamlined communication through said website, a <a href="https://forum.rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new dedicated forum</a> and a new <a href="http://twitter.com/rescriptlang" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>.</p></li><li><p>The renaming of various tools, always in a backward-compatible way.</p></li></ul><p>In short, all JS-related tools are now called ReScript. Previously, due to the messy situation, most real-world BuckleScript adoption came from a few heroic community members suffering through the technical and social risk of spreading our tech to their coworkers. From today onward, you can simply tell to your coworkers: "this is ReScript", and point to them a clear starting point instead of sending them to various incompatible sources, with a risk of losing goodwill and credibility.</p><p>It's worth emphasizing that while this rebranding seems to be very disruptive, in reality it's mostly a bunch of name changes for the same tech. To reiterate our stance on existing userland code:</p><ul><li><p>Please read our <a href="https://reasonml.org/blog/a-note-on-bucklescripts-future-commitments" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> on backward compatibility with pure OCaml &amp; Reason syntax.</p></li><li><p>The current Reason website will keep existing, with proper redirects to our new one when relevant. Existing Reason-to-JS users' code keep working, as per above post. Reason itself will continue tackling the parts BuckleScript didn't tackle before, such as native.</p></li><li><p>The various BuckleScript binaries will keep working. Instead of renaming those, we'd create new binaries instead.</p></li><li><p>The BuckleScript docs will redirect to the new site without breaking links.</p></li></ul><p>Thank you for your support and keep shipping. A brighter future awaits us!</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>The ReScript team (Bob, Cheng, Cristiano, Maxim, Patrick, Ricky).</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>This guide covers timeless ideas that are helpful to keep in mind while working with
systems where performance matters. Many of these ideas are fairly “durable”
and will apply regardless of what hardware, programming language, operating
system, or decade you are working in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for follow-up articles that will drill into hardware and
more Rust-specific techniques.</p>

<p>Skip to the <a href="#contents">table of contents</a> if you don’t like intros.</p>

<p>There’s some foul language in here. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast</li>
  <li>only do things that are necessary for correctness and safety</li>
  <li>your engineers will burn out, leave your team, and relentlessly shit talk you
if they don’t make their code pretty and low-friction to work with</li>
  <li>align all latency-throughput queuing positions for everything in the
serial dependency graph, or you will get worst-of-all-worlds
latency-throughput behavior, increasing latency and lowering throughput</li>
  <li>if something necessary can be done in the background without blocking,
queue it up for eventual batch processing to improve cache performance</li>
  <li>look at allocation lifetime using DHAT, avoid short-lived allocations
and ensure that long-lived allocations employ time-space trade-offs
that consume plentiful resources instead of scarce ones where possible</li>
  <li>seriously, it’s always your fault if your engineers quit.</li>
  <li>performance happens naturally when engineers love the codebase and they
are aware of which parts of the system can be sped up</li>
  <li>before wasting time optimizing things that don’t matter, we can easily test
whether optimizing could be useful at all by adding delays or deleting
relevant code to see what the impact of infinite optimization would be</li>
  <li>by default your machine will randomly change your cpu frequency, yank
processes across cores and sockets, and generally make measurements
deceptive and non-reproducible. we can control this behavior. if you
don’t account for this behavior, your measurements are not sound justifications
for code changes</li>
  <li>wait, why does an executive care about performance, anyway?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-executive-introduction">non-executive introduction</h2>

<p>Ok, now that the executives are gone, it is time to party.</p>

<p>Let’s put on some nice music.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Let it out.</p>

<p>The year is 2020. and we are utterly fucked.</p>

<p>Supposedly we are here reading this article because we “like computers” or
something but let’s be clear about one thing - you’re not here because of that.
I know. You know. We all know. You couldn’t give two fried pennies about
computers if they didn’t help you feel the things you so desperately need to
feel.</p>

<p>You’re here, ultimately, because of control. Your entire life is entombed
in an elaborate, entirely abstract labyrinth of machines that define so
many aspects of every moment of your waking life. You’re here to better
understand the prison you find yourself within. You’re here to sympathize
with the machine.</p>

<p>While you will only seep ever more deeply into this morass of gold and glass,
you have the power to turn your captors into familiar friends. You have the
power to make the machines into the only friends you will ever need. You are
here to abandon the organic and the analogue. There is nothing for you on the
other side of your window. As you lounge (please fix your posture now) in your
designated quarantine pit, gazing listlessly into the LED mesh while biding
your time, I invite you to join me - your newest simulated human experience -
on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure into the bowels of the machine through which
you experience joy and place orders for more toilet paper.</p>

<p>It begins today.</p>

<p><img src="http://sled.rs/art/sunrise.jpg" alt="warm sun rising over the water with a boat and mountains in the background"></p>

<p>This guide contains basic information for getting started with
performance-sensitive engineering. I think most folks will learn something new.
I know I have. And, part of why I wrote this is to have a single place with a
memorable URL where I can return to when I forget most of this stuff. More
importantly, when I unfurl fiery screeds in random internet comments I want to
have an intimidating reference to which I can mercilesly link.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this guide for the Rust ecosystem, where many people are now
trying their hands at optimization for the first time. But nearly all of this document
applies to general programming, with a few of the hardware effects mentioned
being specific to x86 and ARM circa 2020. Linux is assumed, because that’s
what the overwhelming majority of server workloads run today.</p>

<p>This guide brings together ideas from systems engineering, systems theory,
psychology, hardware, queuing theory, statistics, economics,
distributed systems, concurrency and philosophy of science with the goals of
helping you to be less of an asshole and write code that tends to improve
the metrics you care about.</p>

<p>Performance is about being thoughtful about the metrics that matter to us and
allowing ourselves to be aware of them while making decisions.</p>

<p>These materials are based on Tyler Neely’s Rust workshop content, and have been
inspired by the writings of

<h2 id="principles">principles</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose
reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive biases.

You just are cognitive biases.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Rationality-An-Introduction">- Luke Muehlhauser, via R:AZ</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is that our minds are pure shit and everything we
know is wrong. We must accept our fallibility before embarking down the path to
fast-as-fuck machinery.</p>

<p>We build towers of assumptions that are bound to specific contexts, and when the
conditions that caused us to form these beliefs change, we tend not to revisit
the now-invalidated beliefs. Cache invalidation is hard when we are so rarely
aware of the dependency graphs of what we believe.</p>

<p>So, we measure. Even when we’re convinced that we’re right. Because we are
always out of sync with reality, and we are fundamentally incapable of altering
this fact. But we can be responsible in the face of that.</p>

<p>Corollary: allow yourself to be wrong. Allowing yourself to be wrong with
yourself, your collaborators, and in public is a key optimization for learning
faster and building better things with less effort and in less time.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, machines tend to be somewhat amenable to measurement. We built
them that way. Indeed, constructing them to be somewhat measurable in the first
place was the only way we were able to assemble them at all despite our
innumerable shortcomings. We took the predecessor to your current machine,
chose some metrics to improve, made a huge number of mistakes while continuing
to measure, and occasionally we got lucky: the metrics we cared about improved
enough to alter production lines, crystallizing our occasionally successful
results into new production processes that eventually put your machine in front
of you.</p>

<p>We must measure.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that real programs on real hardware see real
improvements in relevant metrics like total cost of ownership, responsiveness,
etc… If a metric doesn’t help a human, it’s just a vanity pursuit that may
make the important metrics worse due to under-investment.</p>

<p>We must select our measurements with care. Our time is precious.</p>

<p>By making decisions that are considerate of available data, we are able to cut
through so much bullshit. We have so many ideas that our experience tells us
should cause our code to improve, but it simply isn’t true when we actually
measure. Code changes that made your Java, C++, Haskell or JS programs faster
may not make Rust any faster. Don’t make Rust code ugly just because some
program you wrote in the 90s worked better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">manual loop
unrolling</a>. Compilers change,
in many ways for the better.</p>

<p>Don’t be macho. Make decisions while having real data on-hand and limit the
damage of hubris.</p>

<h2 id="e-prime-and-precise-language">e-prime and precise language</h2>

<p>So many aspects of performance-critical engineering can be highly contextual
and may vary wildly from one machine to another. It helps to avoid the verb
“to be” and its conjugations “is”, “are” etc… when describing observations.</p>

<p>When we say something “is” something else, we are casually equating two
similar things for convenience purposes, and we are lying to some extent.
By avoiding false equivalences (usually easily spotted through use of “is”, “are” etc…)
we can both communicate more precisely and we can allow ourselves to reason
about complexity far more effectively. Situations that may seem completely
ambiguous when described using “to be” phrases are often quite unambiguous
when taking care to avoid false equivalences. This general form of speech
is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t say “lock-free queues are faster than mutex-backed queues”, say “on
hardware H with T threads running in tight loops performing operations O, our
specific lock-free queue has been measured to achieve a latency distribution of
X1 and our specicific mutex-backed queue has been measured to achieve a latency
distribution of X2.” It’s likely your lock-free queue will sometimes perform
worse than a well-made mutex-backed queue given certain hardware, contention
and many other factors. What does “perform worse” even …</p></section></div>

<p>After so lengthy underneath lockdown, what higher lunch companion than the “happiest man on this planet”? Matthieu Ricard pops up on my iPhone display screen, immediately recognisable by his heat smile and darkish purple and orange monastic robes.</p>
<p>The 74-year-old biologist-turned-Buddhist, the French interpreter to the Dalai Lama, gained the epithet — which, by the way in which, he thinks absurd — within the 2000s, after collaborating in a 12-year research on the long-term impression of meditation. By means of a long time of coaching, he was discovered to have considerably altered the construction of his mind. The outcomes despatched digital camera crews dashing to the Himalayas to find his secret (spoiler alert: there isn’t one — it’s a lifetime of arduous work). And it later led the media to christen him “the world’s happiest man”.</p>
<p>Ricard is the best visitor for these anxious occasions. He has an intimate know­ledge of solitude, having spent a complete of 5 years of his life in contemplative retreat. He’s the primary to confess that “confinement, in fact, for me it’s an exquisite factor”. His recommendation for the remainder of us? “Make peace with your individual thoughts . . . after which the time won’t really feel so heavy and so troublesome.”</p>
<p>In a nod to Ricard’s stints in retreat, I’ve come to a distant sanctuary of my very own: a small hut within the hills close to my dwelling in south-west Scotland. It’s roughly the identical measurement because the three-metre-square refuge in Nepal the place he spends months on finish.</p>
<p>We start with a digital tour of our respective environment. “I at all times needed to go to Scotland to take pictures,” says Ricard, who has travelled to the likes of Patagonia, Iceland and Yukon in north-west Canada to {photograph} their wild landscapes, together with his photographs praised by Cartier-Bresson.</p>
<p>Ricard eyes the little hut the place I’ve laid a small wood desk for lunch. “It appears like a hermitage,” he says approvingly. A cuckoo calls within the distance; nearer by is the sound of bleating lambs on the hillside.</p>
<p>“If this had been final week, I might have proven you the whole Himalayan mountain vary with 4 8,000-metre peaks,” he provides. “However now it’s largely French forest, which is gorgeous, however doesn’t have the identical dimensions.”</p>
<p>A couple of week earlier than our encounter in early Could, Ricard left the Shechen Tennyi Dargyeling Monastery in Nepal on the final flight in another country organised by the French embassy there. He returned to Dordogne in south-west France to be together with his 97-year-old mom. Now he’s sitting on her balcony, avoiding coming into the home throughout a 14-day quarantine interval. I catch a glimpse of her inside. “Hiya&nbsp;<em>maman</em>,” Ricard waves. “<em>Maman, on t’a dit bonjour de l’Écosse</em>.”</p>

<p>Lunch doesn’t usually characteristic prominently in my companion’s routine. His late father wrote an anthology of gastronomy (<em>Tradition and Delicacies: a Journey By means of the Historical past of Meals</em>), however, says Ricard, “I’m completely the other. I don’t bear in mind 10 minutes later what I ate. I’m actually not .”</p>
<p>I attain for my flask and pour a mug of steaming leek and potato soup. Ricard is vegetarian — “I don’t need to dwell on the struggling and the dying of different animals” — and he has in entrance of him a easy salad starter of lettuce, grated carrot and corn blinis.</p>
<p>What does Ricard make of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/coronavirus" data-trackable="link" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus</a> and the worldwide confinements to halt its unfold? “I feel we must be very humble,” he says. “There are individuals who have large difficulties, monetary difficulties, well being difficulties, household difficulties. It will be pretentious to say something about that as a result of they’re going through unimaginable hardship.” But “there’s a entire class of people who find themselves doing fairly OK materially” however who’re nonetheless disoriented. A submicroscopic speck has overthrown us, “shattering an phantasm that fashionable man has constructed up.”</p>
<p>The notion that we will management exterior situations is mistaken, he explains, gesticulating with a corn blini on his fork for emphasis. “We now have this very boastful concept that we have now extracted ourselves from nature. We’re masters of the universe, we will ship folks to the Moon, we will manipulate genes. Plainly we’re invincible.”</p>
<p>He’s horrified, too, by the thought of transhumanism, and its adherents’ quest to delay dramatically the human lifespan. “Think about Donald Trump being elected for the 50th time or Lionel Messi scoring his 50,000th aim. How boring!” I chortle in settlement. He goes on: “I imply, I really like my hermitage, however a thousand years? As my mom likes to say, eternity is terribly lengthy, particularly close to the tip.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Ricard’s path to Tibetan Buddhism</strong> started removed from the Himalayas, in Savoie, south-eastern France. He grew up in and close to Paris, raised agnostic by dad and mom who had been on the centre of French mental life. His father, Jean-François Revel, was a political commentator who turned well-known for his challenges to each communism and Christianity; his mom, Yahne le Toumelin, is an abstractionist painter.</p>
<p>By means of his dad and mom’ circles, Ricard’s upbringing was spent socialising with a few of the nice artists of the day: André Breton, the daddy of Surrealism, Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, and Spanish film-maker Luis Buñuel, to call however a couple of. “I used to be extra fascinated about watching birds and taking part in music and soccer, however I used to be there at dinner so I noticed them, and listened roughly to their dialogue,” Ricard remembers.</p>

<p>He struggled to search out the position mannequin he was in search of. “I realised later, after I tried to determine why, that there was no correlation between their specific abilities or genius and being a superb human being.” He offers an excessive instance: one among his father’s greatest associates was the French Marxist thinker Louis Althusser. “He turned loopy and killed his spouse.”</p>
<p>Ricard was 20 when he watched a documentary about Tibetan Buddhist masters and “noticed that there have been 20 St Francis of Assisi, 20 Socrates who had been alive immediately.” He travelled to Darjeeling, within the Himalayan foothills, the place his conversion to Tibetan Buddhism started. Ricard credit his mom with instilling in him an curiosity in “spirituality at giant” throughout his childhood. In return he urged her to go to India to expertise “a residing custom . . . not simply in books.” She adopted his recommendation and, remarkably, additionally deserted French bohemia and have become a Tibetan Buddhist nun.</p>
<p>Whereas Ricard accomplished a PhD in cell genetics on the Pasteur Institute in Paris, every summer season he would return to the mountains. As quickly as he completed his doctorate within the early 1970s, he moved to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It was by means of one among his academics that Ricard first met the Dalai Lama, the non secular chief of the Tibetan folks. After a number of years of figuring out one another, the Dalai Lama requested Ricard — who’s fluent in French, English and Tibetan — to grow to be his French interpreter. “It was fantastic as a result of it’s so wonderful to be with him intimately. The principle factor is that the Dalai Lama is strictly the identical with a head of state and with the woman who cleans the lodge,” says Ricard.</p>
<p>He remembers accompanying him to satisfy the late French president François Mitterrand on the Elysée Palace. “Usually, after the assembly, you get within the automotive and the president says goodbye and also you go. However the Dalai Lama went throughout the courtyard to shake palms with the guards, faucet them on the shoulder, chortle with them. Mitterrand didn’t know whether or not to remain or return in.” The Dalai Lama lives in India, in everlasting exile from Tibet. Ricard gained’t be drawn on Tibet’s relations with China, saying solely: “I actually hope I can return to Tibet earlier than I die.”</p>
<p>By now we have now moved on from our starters. My companion is having fun with a plate of seitan, a vegan meat substitute that’s made out of hydrated gluten. In step with Ricard’s ordinary regime, I’ve additionally ready a easy, vegan major course: a salad of lettuce, tomato and grated carrot, with do-it-yourself hummus.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>It wasn’t till 1997</strong> that Ricard turned a family title in France, when he co-authored a e-book together with his father,&nbsp;<em>The Monk and the Thinker: A Father and Son Talk about the That means of Life</em>. It was framed as an east-meets-west dialogue on the preoccupations which might be as outdated as humankind: the which means of life, consciousness, freedom and struggling.</p>
<p>On the time, Revel was a widely known French thinker and journalist, however his son was a relative unknown. The e-book turned a bestseller in Europe and was translated into 23 languages. “That was an enormous change,” he says. “It was both the start of my hassle, or the start of a chance, I don’t know.</p>
<p>“It exhibits you the way fully synthetic movie star may be as a result of no person is aware of something about you after which abruptly inside weeks they cease you on the street. I’m simple to recognise as a result of I’m like a strolling flag with this monk gown.”</p>

<p>As we end our starters, we flip to the theme with which he’s maybe most synonymous: happiness. His 2004 TED speak “The habits of happiness” has been considered greater than 9m occasions. In it, he makes the excellence between happiness as one thing that may be learnt and cultivated, and pleasure, which is anchored in time and place, and exhausts itself as you expertise it.</p>
<p>“There’s a tendency immediately to search for hedonic happiness,” he tells me, pointing to obsessions with standing, wealth and picture; and the …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p><em>Freedom is monetizing your curiosity</em></p><cite>@jackbutcher</cite></blockquote>



<p>Imagine you time travel to Europe 200 years ago and ask a factory worker if he enjoys doing his work. I think he would either laugh at you or curse you for wasting his time with silly questions.</p>



<p>The idea that you can get joy or fulfillment from your job is pretty recent. For centuries, people have worked to provide food and shelter for their families. That was it. No pleasure. <strong>For a long time, work has been the exact opposite of pleasure.</strong></p>



<p>That’s why people started having hobbies as soon as they got more leisure time. They needed to find a way to use their creativity and explore their interests. They couldn’t do that at work.</p>



<p>Even though society has changed and created a lot of new jobs and careers to choose from, a lot of people still hate their jobs. They are still not getting meaning or joy from them.</p>



<p>But, thanks to new platforms, this doesn’t have to be the case anymore. Now, you can make a living from your hobby. You can even turn your hobby into a career. You have more opportunities than ever to monetize your curiosity. <strong>To be free.</strong></p>



<p>Welcome to the Passion Economy.</p>



<h3>The Passion Economy</h3>



<blockquote><p><em>The future is millions of decentralized creator businesses.</em></p><cite>@jackbutcher</cite></blockquote>



<p>We’ve been hearing stories of influencers making 6-figures for a while. Now, you’ll start hearing stories about <em>creators</em> making 6-figures. Here in the US we already have a handful of those.</p>



<p>If you think about it, creators aren’t a new thing. Youtubers and bloggers, for instance, are creators. And they’ve been around for years. What’s new here is the available tools.</p>



<p>The Passion Economy is powered by platforms that empower creators.</p>



<p>These platforms help creators combine their unique skills and interests, and turn them into digital products and services. <strong>In the Passion Economy, every individual has the potential and the opportunity to become a business</strong>. An independent and decentralized creator business.</p>



<p>But before you make your first buck you’ll need an audience.</p>



<h3>Your most valuable asset</h3>



<blockquote><p><em>Audience building is a career insurance policy.</em></p><cite>@jackbutcher</cite></blockquote>



<p>An asset is something you own that can create value for you.</p>



<p>For a factory, machinery is an asset. It’s what enables the factory to produce stuff for sale. For a pharmaceutical company, a patent is an asset. It gives the company a competitive advantage. Assets produce benefits that produce money.</p>



<p>Assets can be physical, like real state, or nonphysical, like specific knowledge or a brand.</p>



<p>When you’re a creator, your audience is one of your most valuable assets. This doesn’t mean you need an audience to become a great creator (look at Van Gogh). It means you’ll need an audience if you want to create an income as one.</p>



<p>Trying to sell a digital product or service without an audience is like setting up shop in the desert – nobody will buy your stuff.</p>



<h3>Good friends</h3>



<blockquote><p>The best marketing doesn’t feel like marketing</p><cite>@jackbutcher</cite></blockquote>



<p>Audience building isn’t easy. It takes consistent effort. That doesn’t mean it can’t be fun, though. Actually, audience building should be kind of fun. Something you kind of struggle with, but at the same time you enjoy.</p>



<p><strong>I believe building an audience is more about making new, good friends than getting new customers or follower</strong>s. It’s about building real, long-term, human relationships. Not about finding people to sell something to. Or people who will “like” your posts.</p>



<p>You want to attract and be surrounded by like-minded people. People who share your interests and your values. People you can be authentic with. People you can trust. People who really care about you.</p>



<p>The key word here is “attract”. The way you attract these kind people is by actively being one of them yourself.</p>



<p>Want to attract like-minded people? Talk openly about your true interests and values.</p>



<p>Want to attract authentic people? Be authentic yourself. Be vulnerable. Share your struggles.</p>



<p>Want to attract people you can trust? Be trustworthy yourself. Be honest. Always stick to your words.</p>



<p>Want to attract people who care about you? Do things for others. Support people. Encourage them.</p>



<p>If you do this, <strong>you’ll end up building a community instead of an audience</strong>. And that’s far more valuable.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>I come from a musical background, with <a href="https://helen.blog/music/" data-type="page" data-id="2033">degrees in piano performance and piano accompanying and chamber music</a>, and I think a lot about how that’s shaped who I’ve become in web and software development. I’ve even gotten to give <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2016/06/30/helen-hou-sandi-code-is-poetry-musicians-tale/">a talk relating musicianship skills to programming and open source management in a concert hall in Vienna that included a piano performance</a>. For this blog post I want to talk about another particular aspect of the classical music world: masterclasses.</p>



<p>Masterclasses are not unique to classical music, but they do form a central and critical component of music study. <strong>A masterclass is a format in which musicians perform a work for an established artist and the artist then gives them feedback rather like a lesson, except that all of this happens in front of an audience.</strong> You might also hear about “studio class” in music school settings, which are similar except that it is not an open audience but instead one made up of your peers who share the same primary professor. For big artists coming to a school or a region, you might have to audition (compete) for a spot to be criticized publicly on your performance. Put that way, it might not sound very appealing, but it is foundational in how to function and succeed as a musician and really in any profession, including as a part of a software team, which is what I do today.</p>



<h2>Managing feedback in group settings</h2>



<p>The first experience in managing professional feedback is typically how you receive it. Sometimes you might not immediately agree with what you’re being asked to do, and that’s okay. What’s important is to respect the time and effort of the person giving you the feedback and show them that you understand it, even if after synthesizing that information you decide it’s not the direction you want to go. In music, that means acknowledging what you’ve heard by demonstrating the requested change on the spot. This might be a specific request, like “play this section softer”, or something that requires more interpretation, like “don’t lose momentum by getting stuck before the high point of this phrase”. This kind of flexibility is itself a skill, and one that is of high value.</p>



<p>In software, your feedback sessions might not involve direct and immediate action in the same way, but it can be very helpful to show that you understand a concept. For instance, you might say “I hear you, and I need to think about it some more; I’ll start by trying out a different way of structuring this file”. Do be careful not to just repeat back verbatim all the time or come across as explaining back in a condescending way.</p>



<p>As you progress through your career, you will likely find yourself in the position of also <em>giving</em> feedback in a group setting. For many people who are just beginning this part of the journey, this can be quite intimidating because you have not previously had experience in doing this. You also may have had bad experiences in the past with feedback that was not delivered in a constructive way. This is where an early culture of group feedback comes in so handy, notably in the studio class setting: professors are asking your peers to also learn how to process, structure, and deliver feedback in real time. You hear from your professor every week; this is an opportunity for students to deliver a polished performance, receive feedback, and give feedback all at once.</p>



<p>That said, peer groups can also be intimidating. This is not unlike having to give a talk or demo some code in front of your coworkers – it can feel like more pressure than a large room of strangers because these are people whose opinions you are exposed to on a near-daily basis and hopefully care about. Remember that we are all learning all the time, and your peers may also need to work on their delivery! Some strategies you may have encountered are to use “yes, and” instead of “but”, or to begin feedback with related praise.</p>



<p>I highly recommend that teams actively solicit peer feedback at various stages throughout a project and also workshop methods of requesting and giving feedback, something that can be facilitated by an engineering manager. An EM might even want to structure some team meetings much like a studio class, where people present on something they’re working on so that not only do they have a chance to share about something they might not otherwise get to talk about, but the team also has a mechanism built-in for giving and receiving feedback. Soliciting feedback is also a skill in its own right – a culture of regular and expected feedback goes a long way toward building that in all levels of team members.</p>



<h2>Arriving prepared</h2>



<p>Another major difference between masterclasses and lessons is that you are expected to present a polished product at a masterclass, whereas lessons are to workshop that polish. In a masterclass setting, you and any collaborators enter the stage, bow, and perform to applause before proceeding with the feedback from the masterclass artist. Some professors, especially at the conservatory level, also require performance attire when performing in studio class (though perhaps not black tie).</p>



<p>Working on a software team typically does not involve building something in a vacuum until you’re ready to release it to the world – you hopefully have team checkpoints that are more equivalent to music lessons. But there is a lot to be said for knowing that even though you’re ready to share your work publicly and have met your deadline, there’s still more that can be done, rather like a software beta. And even for something you’ve been performing for a long time, a fresh perspective can change not only how you’re approaching that piece, but how you think about your craft in general. Always be prepared to show your best and recognize that true mastery is in knowing that there’s always another level to reach for.</p>



<h2>Cross-discipline knowledge</h2>



<p>While masterclasses are typically with an individual artist who specializes in an instrument, many works involve other musicians, such as a string quartet or a piano trio. These are things that are worth bringing to masterclasses too! Related, it’s also valuable to have lessons from people who might normally be considered outside of your discipline – one of the best lessons I’ve ever had was with a jazz professor who spent 2 hours pushing me to express myself more and more.</p>



<p>Not only do your collaborators need to be equally prepared, you need to work together to really achieve artistry. All too often you will see lower-level instrumental masterclasses where the pianist is an afterthought, plunking their way dutifully through concerto reductions, and it shows. Sometimes the masterclass artist will also dutifully ignore them, but more often they have to involve all collaborators in their feedback. No amount of telling a vocalist to evoke the dreamy sparkling of Debussy’s <em>Nuit d’Etoiles</em> is going to work if the pianist is heavy-handed on those rolled chords, or vice versa. (This is also why collaborative pianists have to study lyric diction and multiple languages and can specialize in vocal coaching, but I digress.)</p>



<p>Not only does feedback need to be inclusive of a group while also targeted to each individual, it needs to be clearly contextualized. In music, that means including music history and theory as well – the performance practices of the era, specific notational quirks of the composer, what harmonies are and how do they drive the piece, and limitations of instruments and how they interact together. So when giving feedback to a software team, be sure to continually frame things within broader feature or product goals, and tie the various disciplines together to create that cohesive whole.</p>



<p>In both giving and receiving that style of feedback, you will find that you need to have some amount of understanding of disciplines outside of your own. That doesn’t mean that you need to be an expert; in fact, you will probably be received poorly if you try to instruct somebody on how specifically to accomplish something you don’t normally work on. Instead, much like framing within broader goals, think about how you might inspire somebody to look at something a different way, or contextualize within your own discipline so that they can understand you better as well.</p>



<h2>Bonus: watch a masterclass!</h2>



<p>Here’s a 45 minute masterclass session with Benjamin Zander, the music director/conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra and the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, and Amanda Chi, the cello section lead of the youth orchestra. I promise you don’t need to be a musician to get something out of this – at one point, Maestro Zander acknowledges non-musicians in the audience and gives them a brief explanation of what he means by the direction and pull of harmonies. But even outside of that, you’ll see some real mastery of not only the musical material from both parties, but also how to address both audience and performer, contextualize the feedback, and deliver that feedback in a constructive and suggestive way rather than making it into a personal demand. I also really enjoy what he talks about at the end, differentiating between what you need to do as a performer of this solo piece versus what you need to do as the leader of your group.</p>

<p>We spent the whole <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">Chapter 2</a> defining what we will be building (an email newsletter!), narrowing down a precise set of requirements. It is now time to roll up our sleeves and get started with it.</p>

<p>This chapter will take a first stab at implementing this user story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We expect our blog visitors to input their email address in a form embedded on a web page.<br>
The form will trigger an API call to a backend server that will actually process the information, store it and send back a response.<br>
This chapter will focus on that backend server - we will implement the <code>/subscribe</code> POST endpoint.</p>

<h2 id="1-1-our-strategy">1.1. Our Strategy</h2>

<p>We are starting a new project from scratch - there is a fair amount of upfront heavy-lifting we need to take care of:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose a web framework and get familiar with it;<br></li>
<li>define our testing strategy;<br></li>
<li>choose a crate to interact with our database (we will have to save those emails somewhere!);<br></li>
<li>define how we want to manage changes to our database schemas over time (a.k.a. migrations);<br></li>
<li>actually write some queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a lot and jumping in head-first might be overwhelming.<br>
We will add a stepping stone to make the journey more approachable: before tackling <code>/subscribe</code> we will implement a <code>/health_check</code> endpoint. No business logic, but a good opportunity to become friends with our web framework and get an understanding of all its different moving parts.</p>

<p>We will be relying on our Continuous Integration pipeline to keep us in check throughout the process - if you have not set it up yet, have a quick look at <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-06-zero-to-production-1-setup-toolchain-ides-ci/">Chapter 1</a> (or grab one of the <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-06-zero-to-production-1-setup-toolchain-ides-ci/#5-2-ready-to-go-ci-pipelines">ready-made templates</a>).</p>



<p>What web framework should we use to write our Rust API?<br>
This was supposed to be a section on the pros and cons of the Rust web frameworks currently available. It eventually grew to be so long that it did not make sense to embed it here and I published it as a spin-off article: check out <em><a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">Choosing a Rust web framework, 2020 edition</a></em> for a deep-dive on <code>actix-web</code>, <code>rocket</code>, <code>tide</code> and <code>warp</code>.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR:</em> as of August 2020, <code>actix-web</code> should be your go-to web framework when it comes to Rust APIs aimed for production usage - it has seen extensive usage in the past couple of years, it has a large and healthy community behind it and it runs on <code>tokio</code>, therefore minimising the likelihood of having to deal with incompatibilities/interop between different async runtimes.<br>
It will thus be our choice for Zero To Production.</p>

<p>Nonetheless <code>tide</code>, <code>rocket</code> and <code>warp</code> have huge potential and we might end up making a different decision in 2021 - if you are following along Zero To Production using a different framework I’d be delighted to have a look at your code! Please shoot me an email at <em>contact@lpalmieri.com</em></p>

<p>Throughout this chapter and beyond I suggest you to keep a couple of extra browser tabs open: <a href="https://actix.rs/"><code>actix-web</code>’s website</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/"><code>actix-web</code>’s documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/actix/examples"><code>actix-web</code>’s examples collection</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s try to get off the ground by implementing a health-check endpoint: when we receive a <code>GET</code> request for <code>/health_check</code> we want to return a <code>200 OK</code> response with no body.</p>

<p>We can use <code>/health_check</code> to verify that the application is up and ready to accept incoming requests.<br>
Combine it with a SaaS service like <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">pingdom.com</a> and you can be <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/product/alerting/#">alerted</a> when your API goes dark - quite a good baseline for an email newsletter that you are running on the side.</p>

<p>A health-check endpoint can also be handy if you are using a container orchestrator to juggle your application (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-liveness-command">Kubernetes</a> or <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/service#service-parameters">Nomad</a>): the orchestrator can call <code>/health_check</code> to detect if the API has become unresponsive and trigger a restart.</p>

<h2 id="3-1-wiring-up-actix-web">3.1. Wiring Up actix-web</h2>

<p>Our starting point will be the <em>Hello World!</em> example on <code>actix-web</code>’s homepage:</p>

<h3 id="3-2-1-server-httpserver">3.2.1. Server - <code>HttpServer</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.HttpServer.html"><code>HttpServer</code></a> is the backbone supporting our application. It takes care of things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>where should the application be listening for incoming requests? A TCP socket (e.g. <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code>)? A Unix domain socket?<br></li>
<li>what is the maximum number of concurrent connections that we should allow? How many new connections per unit of time?<br></li>
<li>should we enable transport level security (TLS)?<br></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>HttpServer</code>, in other words, handles all <em>transport level</em> concerns.<br>
What happens afterwards? What does <code>HttpServer</code> do when it has established a new connection with a client of our API and we need to start handling their requests?<br>
That is where <code>App</code> comes into play!</p>

<h3 id="3-2-2-application-app">3.2.2. Application - <code>App</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.App.html"><code>App</code></a> is where all your application logic lives: routing, middlewares, request handlers, etc.<br>
<code>App</code> is the component whose job is to take an incoming request as input and spit out a response.<br>
Let’s zoom in on our code snippet:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

    .<span>route</span>(<span>"/{name}"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>App</code> is a practical example of the <em>builder pattern</em>: <code>new()</code> gives us a clean slate to which we can add, one bit at a time, new behaviour using a fluent API (i.e. chaining method calls one after the other).<br>
We will cover the majority of <code>App</code>’s API surface on a need-to-know basis over the course of the whole book: by the end of our journey you should have touched most of its methods at least once.</p>

<h3 id="3-2-3-endpoint-route">3.2.3. Endpoint - <code>Route</code></h3>

<p>How do we add a new endpoint to our <code>App</code>?<br>
The <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.App.html#method.route"><code>route</code></a> method is probably the simplest way to go about doing it - it is used in an <em>Hello World!</em> example after all!</p>

<p><code>route</code> takes two parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>path</code>, a string, possibly templated (e.g. <code>"/{name}"</code>) to accommodate dynamic path segments;<br></li>
<li><code>route</code>, an instance of the <code>Route</code> struct.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/struct.Route.html"><code>Route</code></a> combines a <em>handler</em> with a set of <em>guards</em>.<br>
Guards specify conditions that a request must satisfy in order to “match” and be passed over to the handler. From an implementation standpoint guards are implementors of the <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/guard/trait.Guard.html"><code>Guard</code></a> trait: <code>Guard::check</code> is where the magic happens.</p>

<p>In our snippet we have</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rust">.<span>route</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>web</span>::<span>get</span>().<span>to</span>(<span>greet</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>"/"</code> will match all requests without any segment following the base path - i.e. <code>http://localhost:8000/</code>.<br>
<code>web::get()</code> is a short-cut for <code>Route::new().guard(guard::Get())</code> a.k.a. the request should be passed to the handler if and only if its HTTP method is <code>GET</code>.</p>

<p>You can start to picture what happens when a new request comes in: <code>App</code> iterates over all registered endpoints until it finds a matching one (both path template and guards are satisfied) and passes over the request object to the handler.<br>
This is not 100% accurate but it is a good enough mental model for the time being.</p>

<p>What does a handler look like instead? What is its function signature?<br>
We only have one example at the moment, <code>greet</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><code>greet</code> is an asynchronous function that takes a <code>HttpRequest</code> as input and returns <em>~something~</em> that implements the <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/trait.Responder.html"><code>Responder</code></a> trait<sup id="fnref:impl-trait-syntax"><a href="#fn:impl-trait-syntax">3</a></sup>.<br>

  <p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates network architecture engineering. It aims to learn a network topology that can achieve best performance on a certain task. By dissecting the methods for NAS into three components: search space, search algorithm and child model evolution strategy, this post reviews many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient automatic neural architecture search.</p>

<p>Although most popular and successful model architectures are designed by human experts, it doesn’t mean we have explored the entire network architecture space and settled down with the best option. We would have a better chance to find the optimal solution if we adopt a systematic and automatic way of learning high-performance model architectures.</p>

<p>Automatically learning and evolving network topologies is not a new idea (<a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">Stanley &amp; Miikkulainen, 2002</a>). In recent years, the pioneering work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> has attracted a lot of attention into the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), leading to many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient NAS methods.</p>

<p>As I started looking into NAS, I found this nice survey very helpful by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al 2019</a>. They characterize NAS as a system with three major components, which is clean &amp; concise, and also commonly adopted in other NAS papers.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Search space</strong>: The NAS search space defines a set of operations (e.g. convolution, fully-connected, pooling) and how operations can be connected to form valid network architectures. The design of search space usually involves human expertise, as well as unavoidably human biases.</li>
  <li><strong>Search algorithm</strong>: A NAS search algorithm samples a population of network architecture candidates. It receives the child model performance metrics as rewards (e.g. high accuracy, low latency) and optimizes to generate high-performance architecture candidates.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation strategy</strong>: We need to measure, estimate, or predict the performance of a large number of proposed child models in order to obtain feedback for the search algorithm to learn. The process of candidate evaluation could be very expensive and many new methods have been proposed to save time or computation resources.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Figure 1. Three main components of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) models.  (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al. 2019</a> with customized annotation in red)</em></p>



<h2 id="search-space">Search Space</h2>

<p>The NAS search space defines a set of basic network operations and how operations can be connected to construct valid network architectures.</p>

<h3 id="sequential-layer-wise-operations">Sequential Layer-wise Operations</h3>

<p>The most naive way to design the search space for neural network architectures is to depict network topologies, either CNN or RNN, with a list of <em>sequential layer-wise operations</em>, as seen in the early work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a>. The serialization of network representation requires a decent amount of expert knowledge, since each operation is associated with different layer-specific parameters and such associations need to be hardcoded. For example, after predicting a <code>conv</code> op, the model should output kernel size, stride size, etc; or after predicting an <code>FC</code> op, we need to see the number of units as the next prediction.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-search-space.png" alt="The sequential layer-wise operation search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2. (Top) A sequential representation of CNN. (Bottom) A sequential representation of the tree structure of a recurrent cell. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To make sure the generated architecture is valid, additional rules might be needed (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a layer is not connected to any input layer then it is used as the input layer;</li>
  <li>At the final layer, take all layer outputs that have not been connected and concatenate them;</li>
  <li>If one layer has many input layers, then all input layers are concatenated in the depth dimension;</li>
  <li>If input layers to be concatenated have different sizes, we pad the small layers with zeros so that the concatenated layers have the same sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The skip connection can be predicted as well, using an <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log%20/2018/06/24/attention-attention.html">attention</a>-style mechanism. At layer \(i\) , an anchor point is added with \(i−1\) content-based sigmoids to indicate which of the previous layers to be connected. Each sigmoid takes as input the hidden states of the current node \(h_i\) and \(i-1\) previous nodes \(h_j, j=1, \dots, i-1\) .</p><p>

\[P(\text{Layer j is an input to layer i}) = \text{sigmoid}(v^\top \tanh(\mathbf{W}_\text{prev} h_j + \mathbf{W}_\text{curr} h_i))\]

</p><p>The sequential search space has a lot of representation power, but it is very large and consumes a ton of computation resources to exhaustively cover the search space. In the experiments by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>, they were running 800 GPUs in parallel for 28 days and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> restricted the search space to contain at most 2 <code>FC</code> layers.</p>

<h3 id="cell-based-representation">Cell-based Representation</h3>

<p>Inspired by the design of using repeated modules in successful vision model architectures (e.g. Inception, ResNet), the <em>NASNet search space</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>) defines the architecture of a conv net as the same cell getting repeated multiple times and each cell contains several operations predicted by the NAS algorithm. A well-designed cell module enables transferability between datasets. It is also easy to scale down or up the model size by adjusting the number of cell repeats.</p>

<p>Precisely, the NASNet search space learns two types of cells for network construction:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Normal Cell</em>: The input and output feature maps have the same dimension.</li>
  <li><em>Reduction Cell</em>: The output feature map has its width and height reduced by half.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NASNet-search-space.png" alt="NASNet search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. The NASNet search space constrains the architecture as a repeated stack of cells. The cell architecture is optimized via NAS algorithms. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>)</em></p>

<p>The predictions for each cell are grouped into \(B\) blocks (\(B=5\) in the NASNet paper), where each block has 5 prediction steps made by 5 distinct softmax classifiers corresponding to discrete choices of the elements of a block. Note that the NASNet search space does not have residual connections between cells and the model only learns skip connections on their own within blocks.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/cell-prediction-steps.png" alt="5 prediction steps in one block"></p>
<p><em>Figure 4. (a) Each cell consists of \(B\) blocks and each block is predicted by 5 discrete decisions. (b) An concrete example of what operations can be chosen in each decision step.</em></p>

<p><a name="ScheduledDropPath"></a>During the experiments, they discovered that a modified version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07648"><em>DropPath</em></a>, named <em>ScheduledDropPath</em>, significantly improves the final performance of NASNet experiments. DropPath stochastically drops out paths (i.e. edges with operations attached in NASNet) with a fixed probability. ScheduledDropPath is DropPath with a linearly increasing probability of path dropping during training time.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al (2019)</a> point out three major advantages of the NASNet search space:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The search space size is reduced drastically;</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motif</a>-based architecture can be more easily transferred to different datasets.</li>
  <li>It demonstrates a strong proof of a useful design pattern of repeatedly stacking modules in architecture engineering. For example, we can build strong models by stacking residual blocks in CNN or stacking multi-headed attention blocks in Transformer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hierarchical-structure">Hierarchical Structure</h3>

<p>To take advantage of already discovered well-designed network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motifs</a>, the NAS search space can be constrained as a hierarchical structure, as in <em>Hierarchical NAS</em> (<strong>HNAS</strong>; (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)). It starts with a small set of primitives, including individual operations like convolution operation, pooling, identity, etc. Then small sub-graphs (or “motifs”) that consist of primitive operations are recursively used to form higher-level computation graphs.</p>

<p>A computation motif at level \(\ell=1, \dots, L\) can be represented by \((G^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell)})\), where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)}\) is a set of operations, \(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)} = \{ o^{(\ell)}_1, o^{(\ell)}_2, \dots \}\)</li>
  <li>\(G^{(\ell)}\) is an adjacency matrix, where the entry \(G_{ij}=k\) indicates that operation \(o^{(\ell)}_k\) is placed between node \(i\) and \(j\). The node indices follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological ordering</a> in DAG, where the index \(1\) is the source and the maximal index is the sink node.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/hierarchical-NAS-search-space.png" alt="Hierarchical search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5. (Top) Three level-1 primitive operations are composed into a level-2 motif. (Bottom) Three level-2 motifs are plugged into a base network structure and assembled into a level-3 motif. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To build a network according to the hierarchical structure, we start from the lowest level \(\ell=1\) and recursively define the \(m\)-th motif operation at level \(\ell\) as</p><p>

\[o^{(\ell)}_m = \text{assemble}\Big( G_m^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell-1)} \Big)\]

</p><p>A hierarchical representation becomes \(\Big( \big\{ \{ G_m^{(\ell)} \}_{m=1}^{M_\ell} \big\}_{\ell=2}^L, \mathcal{O}^{(1)} \Big), \forall \ell=2, \dots, L\), where \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}\) contains a set of primitive operations.</p>

<p>The \(\text{assemble}()\) process is equivalent to sequentially compute the feature map of node \(i\) by aggregating all the feature maps of its predecessor node \(j\) following the topological ordering:</p><p>

\[x_i = \text{merge} \big[ \{ o^{(\ell)}_{G^{(\ell)}_{ij}}(x_j) \}_{j &lt; i} \big], i = 2, \dots, \vert G^{(\ell)} \vert\]

</p><p>where \(\text{merge}[]\) is implemented as depth-wise concatenation in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">paper</a>.</p>

<p>Same as NASNet, experiments in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al (2017)</a> focused on discovering good cell architecture within a predefined “macro” structure with repeated modules. They showed that the power of simple search methods (e.g. random search or evolutionary algorithms) can be substantially enhanced using well-designed search spaces.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02639">Cai et al (2018b)</a> propose a tree-structure search space using path-level network transformation. Each node in a tree structure defines an <em>allocation</em> scheme for splitting inputs for child nodes and a <em>merge</em> scheme for combining results from child nodes. The path-level network transformation allows replacing a single layer with a multi-branch motif if its corresponding merge scheme is add or concat.</p>

          <p><span>We inhabit a world full of uncertainty, complexity, and randomness. Our ability to predict the future is very limited. Trying to predict the exact outcome of future events is foolhardy.  </span></p> <p><span>A more practical approach is to </span> <strong>farm luck</strong> <span>, by making many survivable small bets with tremendous potential upside. We will be right at least </span> <em>directionally</em> <span>. This allows us to not just be robust against randomness, but benefit from it. Or as Nassim Nicholas Taleb would call it: </span> <em>antifragile</em> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>We can't control when luck will strike. But we can increase our exposure to it. We can broaden our </span> <strong>surface area of luck</strong> <span>. This is similar to the way a large surface area helps organisms absorb nutrients </span> <em>in nature:</em> <span> a mycelium in a fungus, or the villi that line your small intestine. </span></p>

<p><em>This is a guest post from James Turnbull. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>Steve Jobs made the phrase “Good artists copy, great artists steal” famous in the tech industry. However, there’s considerable debate about the origin of the expression. Ironically, he was possibly cribbing from Picasso, who might have been cribbing from Igor Stravinsky, William Faulkner, or perhaps T.S. Eliot. Of all the many variants, I prefer Faulkner’s “Immature artists copy, great artists steal.”</p>



<p>What does this phrase have to do with writing code? More than you’d imagine. As engineers, we’re often stuck on something, banging our heads against a wall over a block of code, or a problem we can’t solve. Some people go for a walk to overcome these blocks, and others take a shower or switch contexts. But many of us go searching the Internet for answers. We try Google, Stack Overflow, or Github for error messages, snippets of code, or implementations that might overcome our problem. When we find something that helps we take this code, often morph it a little, and then use it in our codebase:</p>

<p>Or in a code comment:</p>


<pre title=""># From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62048888/how-to-select-a-floating-point-or-integer-using-a-regular-expression-from-text
text.lines.find { |l| l[' Running Total '] }[/[\d.]+/]
. . .
</pre>


<p>But there is a lot of disdain, even hate, for this approach from other engineers. This hate is often combined with gatekeeper overtones or remarks about how this wasn’t how things were done when they were learning. I’ve heard it described as “copy-pasta coding” or “cargo coding,” or sometimes even described as outright plagiarism. So is it plagiarism?</p>



<p>To me, there’s a clear distinction between imitation and inspiration. When you go looking for that code, you’re looking for inspiration to solve the problem you have. It is rare to find the exact code you need that you can without modification, nor do you often find code can be used by simply copying it in place. By the very nature of trying to understand how someone else solved the problem, you’re learning, inspired by their creation. Later, as someone finds your code when they seek to solve the same or a similar problem, they can see your implementation and the original, and potentially receive further inspiration and insight.</p>



<p>There are best practices, though, that you should abide by when you use this approach. Firstly, credit the source of your inspiration, acknowledge the work of the original author, and help the next person who is following the same path to a solution. Indeed, if you feel uncomfortable about acknowledging the source of the code that inspired you, perhaps that’s a signal that you’re not doing right by the original creator?</p>



<p>Secondly, use the code as a learning tool; experiment and apply your knowledge and perspective to it. I recently found a Ruby method to work with a nested hash. I liked the solution but realized there was a way to make it more functional and easier to understand. So I took the code, modified it, and made it my own. In has been my experience that the best code results from code shared, whether developed with others or even code reviewed to get other’s perspectives. This process is how we learn to be better coders by learning the lessons of those who came before us and building upon them.</p>



<p>So ignore those folks who hate on this approach. I am sure they protest too much because I can guarantee they have done this in the past, and their disdain draws from the rose-colored glasses that inhibit memories of how they learned. Great artists don’t spawn from nothing, and “Great artists steal” is about finding inspiration; finding the key or the “eureka” moment someone else’s implementation sparks and using it as a starting point to creatively solve your problems.</p>

As important health care access points, these hospitals serve a population that is disproportionately older, impoverished and burdened by chronic disease.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1997, with small rural hospitals under increasing financial strain and closing in large numbers, the federal CAH designation was established to increase their viability and to ensure that rural communities have adequate access to health care.</p><p>Prior research studies comparing the quality of care provided by CAHs and non-CAHs have found that risk-adjusted mortality rates at CAHs were higher, and the hospitals’ quality of care, therefore, lower. But a new study led by investigators at the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brown.edu%2Facademics%2Fpublic-health%2Fcghr%2F%3Futm_source%3DSPHResearch%26utm_medium%3Daccordion&amp;t=YmM0NzQ3NWRmNGQ2YmVjNDdkYzM0MzFiYzIzODczZmMyMGViN2Y4NCxzM0VvaXFFWg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626083780719951873%2Frural-us-hospitals-quality-of-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597366210">Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research</a> in Brown’s School of Public Health suggests that standard risk-adjustment methodologies have been unfairly penalizing CAHs.</p><p>According to the study, for Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas who were hospitalized during the period of 2007 to 2017, CAHs submitted significantly fewer hospital diagnosis codes than did non-CAHs. The primary reason for the relative under-reporting of diagnoses at CAHs has to do with differences in Medicare reimbursements — while non-CAHs are incentivized by Medicare to complete diagnosis coding, CAHs, which receive cost-based reimbursements, are not.</p><p>“When payments for episodes of care are tied to the acuity of patients, health care providers have the incentive to fully report or even overstate acuity,” said study senior author Momotazur Rahman, an associate professor of health services, policy and practice at Brown. “Since payments for non-CAHs are dependent on reported acuity while payments for CAHs are not, non-CAH patients will appear comparatively sicker than they actually are.”</p><p>Because mortality rates are adjusted per severity of illness — acuity, in Rahman’s words — the result is that CAHs appear to have higher mortality rates for patients with similar conditions, when in reality their patients may in fact be sicker than those in non-CAHs, from the standpoint of risk adjustment.</p><p>The <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjama%2Farticle-abstract%2F2768976&amp;t=OTU2MTA4OTg1MzYwMzgyOTdjOWU4ZWJjNzNlMmQyMDNhYjQ5MGViNyxzM0VvaXFFWg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626083780719951873%2Frural-us-hospitals-quality-of-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597366210">study</a> was published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> on Tuesday, Aug. 4.</p><p>How did the researchers determine that CAHs tend to overreport diagnoses? In 2010, Medicare increased the allowable number of billing codes for hospitalizations from 10 to 25.</p><p>“We observed a large jump in reported acuity among non-CAH patients in 2010,” Rahman said, “but we saw a much smaller jump for CAH patients. We found that due to this difference in acuity reporting, when compared to non-CAHs, the risk-adjusted performance of CAHs on short-term mortality measures looks much worse than it actually is.”</p><p>The CAH program, created to prevent rural hospitals from closing, has repeatedly come under threat. Given that in many parts of the U.S., CAHs serve as sole health care providers, Rahman said that examining differences in quality of care is important for understanding the value of the CAH program and informing decisions about the allocation of funding for rural health care.</p><p>The finding that short-term mortality outcomes at rural CAHs may not differ from those of non-CAHs after accounting for different coding practices, he added, is essential knowledge for ensuring timely access to acute care for vulnerable rural communities.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brown.edu%2Fnews%2F2020-08-10%2Fcah&amp;t=Yzk0YTNiMDM2MjcyNmQ4OWE1NzBkOWMyOWQzZWQ1YjQxNTY3OWNiYixzM0VvaXFFWg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626083780719951873%2Frural-us-hospitals-quality-of-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597366210">Brown University</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Association of Diagnosis Coding With Differences in Risk-Adjusted Short-term Mortality Between Critical Access and Non–Critical Access Hospitals”,&nbsp;<i>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1001%2Fjama.2020.9935&amp;t=NWIzNmIzYTc5OGNiYzgwZWYxZjBiM2YwYzA5YWQ4NDkyMWFiMzY0YyxzM0VvaXFFWg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626083780719951873%2Frural-us-hospitals-quality-of-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597366210">http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.9935</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/175410522827/rural-healthtech-podcast">Rural Health Tech’s enormous potential (podcast)</a></p>

		<div>

			
<p>Do you think writing a book in just 2 weeks is possible?</p>



<p>Well, I just finished and launched one. On my own and without any help.</p>



<p>To be fair, I did have some experience writing… Instagram captions. </p>



<p>Now, seriously. All (bad) jokes aside. I’ve liked writing since I was a teenager, so I’ve naturally written some stuff. I’ve written some short articles. I’ve written some cheesy poems. A couple of crappy songs too. But I wrote most of it a long time ago. And it was always occasional. I never had a writing habit. I had <strong>never </strong>written long-form content in my life either.</p>



<p>Yet I pulled it off. I wrote a real, 35-page-long book in just two weeks. And you know what? I think you <em>should</em> do it too.</p>



<h2>Why you <em>should </em>consider writing a book</h2>



<p>When I started working on my book, <strong><a href="https://gum.co/flyonyourown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fly On Your Own</a></strong>, my only goal was to help my younger brother. <a href="https://twitter.com/dbustac/status/1285055600393695232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wanted to teach him a couple of things about making money online</a>. That was it.</p>



<p>Now, I realize that by writing the book I didn’t just help my brother, I helped myself too. A LOT:</p>



<ul><li>I created a writing habit</li><li>My writing is getting better thanks to the feedback I’m getting from people who read the book</li><li>I have a bunch of content that I can repurpose and post on my blog and social media  </li><li>I learned to do new things</li><li>I learned a ton about myself</li><li>I had a lot of fun </li></ul>



<p>In summary, I gained experience, I gained some skills, and I created something that hopefully will add value to my brother and even other people. And that has already created a lot of value for me. </p>



<p>That’s why I think you should write a book too – it’s a very entertaining and rewarding way to learn and improve yourself. Also, it’s a good way to start making money online. You can sell your book on <a href="https://gumroad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gumroad </a>or <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon </a>and make some money out of it. </p>



<h2>The 7 things I learned</h2>



<p>As I mentioned before, writing Fly On Your Own was very instructive. It taught me a great deal about myself and about writing. After reflecting on my experience, I think these are the 7 key lessons I got (at least from a writing perspective):</p>



<h3> 1. You don’t need credentials </h3>



<p>There are a lot of myths about writing and publishing a book. The first one is that you need credentials.</p>



<p>You don’t need to be a “professional” writer. You don’t have to be an expert on a particular subject or field.You don’t need a publisher. </p>



<p>The only thing you need is to have something to say or teach. And I’m pretty sure you do.</p>



<h3>2. There’s something you know that other people would like to learn</h3>



<p>The same way I “knew” some things that my brother didn’t, there are things you know that other people probably don’t and would love to learn about. Maybe you <strong>take them for granted</strong>. But all your knowledge, skills, and experiences are valuable. They can help other people. Unfortunately, sometimes we don’t realize it. </p>



<p>Even if you’re just starting out and don’t have a lot of baggage, you can still write about other people’s ideas and experiences. You can curate, explain and simplify things from your own perspective. That can be super valuable too. </p>



<p>It doesn’t matter that other people know what you know or have written about the same topic. That will always be the case. So don’t get discouraged by that. Don’t aim to be original, aim to be unique. </p>



<h3>3. You don’t need to be a “talented” writer</h3>



<p> If you can write a tweet or a text message, you are talented enough to write a book. </p>



<p>What matters is that you’re <strong>concise, clear and direct</strong>. Make sure you use simple, common words most of the time. Keep your sentences and paragraphs short. Avoid using passive voice. </p>



<p>Your goal is to get people to understand your message as fast and effortlessly as possible. And that’s how you do it.</p>



<h3>4. You need a deadline</h3>



<p>The only reason why I finished the book in 2 weeks is because I had a <strong>public</strong> <strong>deadline</strong>. </p>



<p>I tweeted that I was going to do it the same day I started working on it. I told some close friends too.</p>



<p>Believe it or not, that forced me to stick to my word. I didn’t care that it was only a few people who knew about it. That was enough to make me want to keep my promise.</p>



<h3>5. You need to manage your time and your attention</h3>



<p>If you want to stick to your word and your deadline, then you’ll need to get in <strong>production mode.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll need to reduce your inputs and increase your outputs. Put another way, you’ll need to <strong>produce more than you consume</strong>. </p>



<p>Set aside time to work, limit your distractions and make sure you <strong>actually do </strong>the work. Simple as that.</p>



<h3>6. You need an outline</h3>



<p>An outline is a list of topics or points you want to touch on the book and each chapter. It’s your structure. Your framework. </p>



<p>Although writing an outline will probably feel like hard work at first, it will make the whole process smooth and easy later on. </p>



<p>You won’t spend hours staring at the blank page trying to figure out what to say. You already know what you want to say. Because you already did the heavy lifting.</p>



<h3>7. You need immediate feedback</h3>



<p>In a way, writing a book is like building a product for a startup. </p>



<p>It’s not a good idea to wait until your book is 100% ready to start getting feedback. You should seek constant feedback from the beginning. </p>



<p>Ask somebody close to you to read all your drafts as you write them. Don’t ask them to judge for aesthetics or style, though. Ask them to judge the <strong>clarity </strong>of your writing. You want to make sure you’re being concise, clear and direct, remember? </p>



<p>Make sure your message is being delivered <strong>quickly and painlessly.</strong></p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Thanks to this experience, I realized how much you can get done and learn in very little time when you focus and do the work. Likewise, I realized how powerful and underrated is experimentation as a learning strategy. </p>



<p>There’s a famous Bill Gates’ quote that goes:&nbsp;“<em>Most&nbsp;people overestimate what they can do in one year&nbsp;and&nbsp;underestimate what they can do&nbsp;in ten&nbsp;years.</em>”</p>



<p>But now I see there’s another side to this: Sometimes <strong>people underestimate what they can do in two weeks</strong> and <strong>overestimate what they can do in two months.</strong></p>



<p>I hope this post inspires you to start writing your own book, and that my insights can help make your process easier. </p>



<p>If you have any questions or just want to say hi, <a href="https://twitter.com/dbustac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reach out to me on Twitter</a>. I’d love to hear from you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I am sure you have heard about <strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.com/new">Discord</a></strong>, a real-time chatting tool that started as a <strong><em>Slack for Gamers</em></strong>. </p>
<p>Today, Discord is used as a community for designers, developers, artists, business managers, friends hangout zones, and more. It has become a reliable and welcoming place, no matter your interest or background. Features like video calling, audio calling and broadcasting make it a powerhouse. Surprisingly, these features work better in Discord than Slack and Microsoft Teams from my experience. </p>
<p>Here's an interesting video by Discord that shares its future goals and vision:</p>

<p>I am glad that at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a>, we switched from Slack to Discord for our team discussions and collaborations. It's been two years now, and we are thrilled with the experience so far. Recently, we opened up our Discord server for anyone to join and get help directly from the Hashnode team and community.

<p>By MEGAN FROST BABB, MD (1)</p>



<p>The other day while I walked to work, I deliberately slowed my pace to allow time for my left hand to lightly graze the brick wall I was passing. I watched as my fingers ebbed and flowed through every groove and imperfection. There was a familiarity to this. Perhaps it was the texture, perhaps the grit. Either way, memories emanated as I was no stranger to brick walls. Over the years as I pursued a career in medicine, my hands had gotten quite used to dismantling them.</p>



<p>The journey to becoming a physician is a long one. When I started upon it, littered everywhere were remnants of items belonging to predecessors who had once traveled the same path. At one point along the way, I found a piece of literature recommending whiskey for a teething child. This provided me some context to its age. Interestingly, despite the medical and technological advancements throughout healthcare in the last few centuries, for female physicians, significant inequities still exist. And as a result, for those of us on this road, brick walls are a common obstacle to meet.</p>



<p>The first wall I encountered came at the beginning of my third year of medical school while on a surgical rotation. Its brick-supplier was one man: an attending surgeon. Its building contractor was the system that employed him. The project itself was funded by the profits he generated for them. My brick was #864. I remember the day mine got added to the wall.</p>



<p>It started with, “Your hair smells incredible<em>.”</em>&nbsp;Followed by, “My hands may touch you. They are hard to control.” It even went as far as, “You were in my dream last night. Did I mention it was wet?” He made my skin crawl. I spent more time focused on trying to be where he wasn’t that I had no space left to focus on why I was there in the first place, and that was to learn. The awkward stares from OR staff looking upon me with pity made me want to vomit. And the number of male physician on-lookers who seemed to watch this behavior for sport did nothing but enable his behavior (when one brought his daughter to work with him, it was all I could do but hope she never had to experience from a man what I was experiencing from him). The lack of shock of such behavior from everyone aware in the system confirmed its normalcy.</p>







<p>The bricks that these walls are built, each have a unique story to tell. They all represent the individual experiences of female physicians plight with gender bias. The misogyny is the mortar that holds each brick together. The wall itself represents the cumulative effects of sexism in healthcare. And the support lending to each wall comes from those controlling these systems who allow the pervasiveness of such behaviors to continue.</p>



<p>The wall I stare at today, more than one-thousand bricks tall and wide. Inspired originally by the&nbsp;<strong>#MeToo</strong>&nbsp;movement and most recently by representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s most poignant address on sexism in politics (that provided the confidence I needed to publish this), the following vignettes have been collected from fellow female physicians who, like me, have a story to share.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #4:</strong>&nbsp;I was asked by a male patient if I needed to practice my prostate exam technique because he was happy to allow me to do so on him. When I asked the administrative team to move him to the service of any one of my many male colleagues I was told, “These are the sort of things that build character. I think we need to thicken your skin. The patient will remain on your service.”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #29:</strong>&nbsp;I recently gave a presentation at grand rounds in my hospital. When I walked to the podium, I overheard a male physician say to a group of others, “Isn’t the lecture today supposed to be given by an orthopedic surgeon?” I am the orthopedic surgeon he speaks of.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #56:</strong>&nbsp;I am a trauma surgeon. When I was in fellowship, a male attending told me he wasn’t a fan of women being trauma surgeons because he didn’t think we could stomach the type of injuries that they typically treated.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #82:</strong>&nbsp;My research team was being introduced at a major medical conference in front of an audience of over 10,000 physicians. I was the only female in our group of eight. Each male was introduced as Dr. So-and-so. I was introduced as Susan. Just to be clear, like the other seven, I am also a physician.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #122:</strong>&nbsp;Today a physician asked me why I didn’t go to nursing school. “Because I wanted to go to medical school. Why didn’t you go to nursing school?” I asked. He looked puzzled.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #215:</strong>&nbsp;At our medical group’s Christmas party a male colleague approached me and said, “Who knew that under your usual frumpy outfits there existed a body like that!”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #297:</strong>&nbsp;I am currently in residency and one of my male attendings said to me, “I don’t know how any female physician finds a husband. Don’t most men find your level of education unattractive?”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #365:</strong>&nbsp;I once disagreed with the treatment plan of one of my hospitalist colleagues and made different recommendations to the management of the patient’s kidney disease. He later saw me in the physician’s lounge at lunch and said, “I appreciate your input but I am going to ask Dr. X (another nephrologist but male) to consult on the case because I don’t agree with your recommendations. You don’t care do you?”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #398:</strong>&nbsp;Our hospital board of directors recently sent out an email welcoming their new diversity officer. He is a white male. We now have sixteen board members. Sixteen of them are white males.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #441:</strong>&nbsp;I am a cardiology fellow and every month my male colleagues ask if I am still taking my birth control. They are worried about me getting pregnant and going on maternity leave.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #507:&nbsp;</strong>As a medical student I was on a surgical rotation with a male urologist. While assisting him with a TURP he asked me, “Would you like to see what a well-endowed penis looks like?”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #558:</strong>&nbsp;One of my kids got sick and so I had to cancel my patients for the day. My male boss responded to my text message with, “Don’t you have a nanny for that?”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #606:&nbsp;</strong>I was a medical student when my breast was grabbed by a male attending. When I went to report it, the individual taking down the information asked if I had done anything to make this physician think I wanted him to do that.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #670:&nbsp;</strong>I am a surgeon. It happened to be a Friday afternoon when I was doing a routine surgical procedure that was taking longer than expected. The male anesthesiologist on the case yelled out in front of everyone in the OR, “If you weren’t a female perfectionist, we would have been done hours ago!”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #781:</strong>&nbsp;A colleague of mine was offended when I told him he tended to be sexist. He told me that was impossible. “I have three daughters!” As if being a father to daughters excludes men from this behavior.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #836:</strong>&nbsp;I asked my medical school classmate why he wanted to pursue a career in obstetrics and gynecology. His response, “Because who doesn’t like to watch women moan?” I found out where he was applying and emailed each program with the following:&nbsp;<em>If you have any doubt about this candidate, there is a reason for it. Listen to your gut.</em></p>



<p><strong>Brick #887:</strong>&nbsp;I emailed an orthopedic residency program I had just interviewed with to thank them and to express my enjoyment in meeting them. The Program Director replied-all to the group asking, “Can someone find out if she is married, with or without kids?” I was crushed. For those that don’t know, this is unethical and highly frowned upon.</p>



<p><strong>Brick #914:</strong>&nbsp;To improve physician retention in my medical group I suggested we consider offering the female physicians twelve weeks of fully paid maternity leave following the delivery or adoption of a baby. A male colleague was quick to shut down the idea stating, “Nah, that’s a terrible idea. Women will just take advantage of it.”</p>



<p><strong>Brick #991:</strong>&nbsp;The following is an excerpt from a note written by a female colleague who died by suicide (this is shared with family permission under the premises that she remain anonymous), “You sexually harassed me for months. Your desire was that I believe in myself to be nothing. You win. The system weakened me. You broke me. I did physically what you did verbally. Words can kill too.”</p>



<p>It is incredible how much information can be gathered by the fingertips. I require myself to feel every brick so that each experience they represent can be heard. With each behavior tolerated, left unattended by those with the authority to correct them, the mortar strengthens and in turn the wall itself. As women, we are taught that it must be us who improves uncomfortable situations. And since it is clear these walls strengthen with time and that only we can improve the uncomfortableness of it all, I leave you with just one suggestion: Get yourself a sledgehammer because getting uncomfortable just got a whole lot easier. It is about time these walls start coming down… indefinitely.</p>

          <h2 id="learn-what-user-testing-methods-are-right-for-you-during-your-stage-of-product-development">Learn what user testing methods are right for you during your stage of product development <br></h2><p>User Testing is an integral part of the product development process and can save thousands of dollars when implemented correctly. Throughout the development lifecycle, product owners can often feel stuck when trying to imagine all the quirks a user needs from the solution. While having a grand vision for how a product can solve a problem <em>is</em> possible, understanding exactly how it will be used without talking directly to the user <strong>is not</strong>. If you’re new to User Testing, <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/the-most-overlooked-design-skill-user-testing/">check out our Beginner’s Guide</a>. </p><p>Fortunately, integrating User Testing into the development process is easy. User Testing encompasses a seemingly endless list of ways to engage users, attain their feedback, and set yourself up best for success. On average, testing <a href="https://www.intechnic.com/blog/100-ux-statistics-every-user-experience-professional-needs-to-know/">5 users can find 85% of user issues within a system.</a> User Testing is easy to implement, information-rich and completely flexible. That’s why more and more companies are jumping to make it a part of their workflow. However, if you’re not familiar with User Testing, understanding when and how to do it in your project can be tough.</p><h2 id="so-when-should-i-implement-user-testing">So When Should I Implement User Testing?</h2><p>To put it simply: <strong>as soon as possible</strong>! Implementing User Testing early and often can help you identify problems and roadblocks before the project even gets fully conceptualized. Below you’ll find a breakdown of a few different ways you can do testing. Keep in mind that most of these tests are variable and can be implemented at any time during your product lifecycle!</p><h3 id="product-conception-and-discovery">Product Conception and Discovery</h3><p>You’ve suddenly awoken in the middle of the night with a great idea for an innovative solution that could potentially change the way you work. Now what? As you begin to conceptualize your product and try to validate the idea, it’s a perfect time to conduct some preliminary research.</p><ul><li><strong>User Interviews </strong>- Sitting down with your target users to understand what their current problem is. Learning how important it is for them to have a solution can help you validate if the idea that's keeping you up at night might become a viable product.</li><li><strong>Stakeholders Interviews </strong>- Speaking with other people who will be involved in the production of the product and understanding their motivations will help in clarifying product requirements and success metrics.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Ethnographic Interviews or Observation</strong> </strong></strong>- &nbsp;Watching your target users interact with technology you are looking to replace.

<p>The village hall in Bowerchalke is an unlikely setting for a mobile technology revolution. Yet local residents, surrounded by crocheted goods and local jams, have spent three years forging a mobile phone network to bridge their own “digital divide”. </p>
 <!-- A generated by theme --> 



 <!-- end A --> 


<p>The experimental Ch4lke Mobile, which runs over just five masts, can connect homes to a network capable of delivering broadband-like speeds, in an area that had been left behind by the digital revolution.</p>
<p>The fledgling network has just secured part of a £2.25m government grant to fill in England’s largest “not-spot” — an area with no mobile signal — and could offer a solution to other pockets in the country blighted by a lack of coverage.</p>
<p>The village sits in the picturesque Chalke valley in Wiltshire little more than 10 miles south of the world-famous Stonehenge. It is known for its high quality watercress and a number of celebrity residents, including film director Guy Ritchie and TV presenter <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c72387ca-31aa-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2" data-trackable="link">James May</a>. </p>
<p>But perhaps more fortunately for its inhabitants, the village also boasts a small group of residents with technology backgrounds. </p>
<p>Ed Gairdner, who used to work with tech start ups in Silicon Valley, moved to the Chalke Valley from Hampshire four years ago and became frustrated at the paucity of coverage. “We looked at the coverage maps in Carphone Warehouse before buying phones. We tried to do our due diligence — but there is no coverage here,” he said.</p>

						</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to tests performed by network measurement company GWS signals are weak to non-existent in the valley. There is even a divide within the ‘digital divide’ as some residents with houses high on the downs get a signal while others have no coverage at all. “It became a non-discussion subject in the pub as it would start too many arguments,” said James Body, chair of the parish council.</p>
<p>Mr Body was unusually well placed when villagers began to complain to him about the lack of coverage. As a former officer in the British army’s Royal Signals, he spent a career in the military building networks and then went on to work in telecoms in the private sector.</p>
<p>Bowerchalke lies just a few miles west of the cathedral city of Salisbury, which now has one of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cdf430ba-499f-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441" data-trackable="link">fastest broadband networks in the country</a>. But the steep, narrow Chalke valley has cut it off from the wireless revolution after an earlier government project failed to deliver five large mobile towers.</p>
<p>Despite few wanting the giant metallic structures, locals were angry at having no coverage. For Sue Lee, who runs a B&amp;B next to the village hall, the lack of connectivity has cost her business.</p>
<p>She describes various visitors abruptly leaving without paying after finding there was no mobile reception. She decided to harangue Mr Body. “Isn’t there anything we can do? It is ridiculous,” she recalled asking him. </p>
<p>Since then, Mr Body has spent three years working with the community to develop a test network that operates off small antennas attached to the chimneys of thatched cottages.</p>
<p>Inspired by an earlier initiative to set up a rural broadband network in Lancashire in north-west England called <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/32f013fc-91e1-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271" data-trackable="link">B4rn</a>, the new mobile network relies on the willingness of the community to solve the problem themselves rather than wait for the government or the industry to sort it out.</p>
<p>This also helps to lower costs as there is no rental or paperwork. The small base stations, that house the antennas, are also less of an eyesore than a mobile tower. The company compares its array of small cells to fairy lights reaching “every nook and cranny” of the valley. </p>
<figure><figcaption>

						</figcaption></figure>
<p>The government funding for Ch4lke will allow the network to move from the experimental phase — where it is still encountering gremlins such as the text messages it occasionally spits out welcoming people to Jersey — to a fully fledged system capable of delivering 5G speeds.</p>
<p>The small base stations are put up by the local TV installer: Mr Body’s house and the village hall already have one and with the funding in place the aim is to build the network out with about 50 across the valley.</p>
<p>The tiny network is pioneering with its use of a so-called neutral host network, which taps into unused spectrum — the frequencies that carry mobile signals — to interconnect with the large UK players — Vodafone, EE, O2 and Three.</p>
<p>Ch4lke Mobile, which is community owned, is using British-made hardware and software from a small Cambridge company called CellXica. The company is also working with O2 on a small trial at a Surrey train station but believes the ingenuity of the rural solution shows that British technology can play a bigger role in a UK market set to phase out radio equipment from China’s Huawei, the largest supplier.</p>

						</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ch4lke could offer a solution for other communities affected by not-spots in areas that the government-backed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cd83abc8-f70c-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654" data-trackable="link">Shared Rural Network</a> programme, launched earlier this year to fill in most of the rural areas with poor coverage, won’t reach. “I’d love to have our radios in every not spot in the country now we have proved this is working,” said Ant Timpson of CellXica.</p>
<p>However getting the large telecoms on-side remains a key part of the process. The government backing for this scheme will help its cause. For John Glen, the local MP, the initiative is an example of a community banding together finding a solution to a debilitating problem where the government and industry has failed. </p>
<p>“You need to think laterally. You can’t conceive of this in Whitehall,” he said, sitting in the village hall. “This will be transformative for social cohesion. Everyone needs to benefit from the B&amp;B owner to the tech entrepreneur to the 85 year old,” he said.</p>

<div><p>You probably haven’t read the whole internet. Slacker.</p><p>GPT-3 has. It’s read all of Wikipedia, even the article about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_llama_syndrome">Berserk llama syndrome</a>. It’s gone through all of Google Books. It read every month of the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> dataset from 2016 to October 2019, comprising every piece of writing on the web during that time. It has read 45 terabytes of text, which equals a book about 3,375,000,000 pages long. It is <em>well-read</em>.</p><p>That’s why it’s writing everything at the moment. By day it’s a <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457">coder</a>, and by night it’s a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#poetry">poet</a>. Need a Seinfeld script written? <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanqnorth/status/1280501755067981826">No problem</a>. Want to chat with Shakespeare? <a href="https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1284110063498522624">He’s here for you</a>. Bored with writing emails to your partner? Just <a href="https://twitter.com/othersideai/status/1285776335638614017?s=11">write a bullet list</a>, and it’ll take care of the rest. GPT-3 can now write seemingly anything.</p><p>How? And how well? We’ve been experimenting with the API over the past few weeks to understand how it works, where it works best, and to discover how it’s going to fit into the content marketing world.</p></div>

<h2>GPT-3’s Mission in Artificial Life Is to Write Just One More Word</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What has GPT-3 done with all that text? Its name alone contains the answer. GPT stands for, in reverse order:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Transformer</strong> is the algorithm the model uses. It specializes in being able to process long pieces of text, pay attention to the salient information therein, and understand how words are used in natural language.</li><li><strong>Pre-trained</strong> means that the weights of the algorithm are already set for you based on the massive corpus of data it has imbibed. When you run it, you don’t need to do any more training.</li><li><strong>Generative</strong> means that the model’s goal is to generate text. It wants to predict what word comes next in any given sentence.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So Generative Pre-trained Transformer Number 3 has analyzed billions of lines of text, figured out what matters and what doesn’t in language, and then uses that information to produce more text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>All it cares about is producing that next word and that word ‘fitting in’ with everything that has come before. It produces different probabilities for different words, and then picks the one with the highest likelihood. With the GPT-3 API, you give it a prompt—a piece of writing—and then it tries to predict what would come after that, based on all the stuff it has read and the rules it has learned. You can ask for five words or 1,000 words, and it’ll try to ‘complete’ your writing.</p><p>This is obviously different to how humans write.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>We build abstract mental models. As I write this, I’m not just thinking that the word after this is <em>is</em>. I’m trying to synthesize my thoughts about GPT-3 with my knowledge of content marketing and my knowledge of neuroscience. I wrote this paragraph before I wrote the paragraph above. I have a construct of this entire article formed in my head that I am trying to make manifest with every word.</p><p>This is because people are more than just memory. We have higher executive functions that allow us to exhibit reasoning, planning, cognitive flexibility, and problem-solving. We also have lower-order emotions that allow us to have opinions and care about one idea over another, one word over another, not just as the output of a probability function.</p><p>GPT-3 doesn’t have any of this.</p><p>But even without these advanced neural functions honed by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, GPT-3 seems to do A-OK on a lot of writing tasks. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">the paper detailing GPT-3</a>, the researchers gave test subjects 200-word news articles written by either humans or the model and asked them to state which one had written them. On average, they chose right only 52% of the time, which is basically chance.</p><p>Only 12% of human subjects were able to recognize this was written by a computer:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2243,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-04 at 9.44.57 PM.png"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The implications of this are enormous. If a computer can write text indistinguishable from humans <em>without</em> all that reasoning and emotion, where does that leave writers? If instead of writing 200 words, a journalist has to just write a title and subtitle and let a computer fill out the rest, then they can 10X their output. And, of course, a newspaper can employ just one journalist instead of 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And where does it leave humans? If reasoning and emotion aren't needed, are we over-engineered? No. As we've understood better how GPT-3 works, we've also understood better its limitations, where humans thrive, and how we can work together with AIs for greater success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Getting GPT-3 to Write Great Long-Form Content Is Hard</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>Can GPT-3 write good content? Good enough that you’d be happy to publish it on your site? We decided the best way to test it out was to get it to write this article—an article about itself. It failed. This isn’t <em>that</em> article.</p><p>If you want to read what GPT-3 wrote, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZAGglPX-6J2rdvFyTIGQoUjc_rtEbc-Gd-xze_tWDi4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">you can check it out here</a>.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We generated that article following these steps:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Gave GPT-3 a small prompt: a title and a brief synopsis of what we were looking for in the article (like you can see in the news article above).<br></li><li>Used that to generate a couple of paragraphs of text output.<br></li><li>Used the first (human) prompt plus the new (GPT-3) text as the next prompt.<br></li><li>Repeated Step 3 until we bootstrapped a nice content-marketing piece at 1,200 words.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>We did a little curating here and there, but with the exception of the title and the first paragraph, everything in that article is generated by GPT-3.</p><p>Now, the article’s not bad. Or rather it is, but it makes superficial sense.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a vast gulf between something that sounds good and something that’s actually good. GPT-3 is fantastic at creating a simulacrum of good content, something that imitates the flow and style of a human writer, but everything that makes an article useful is absent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are a few examples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>It Lacks a Narrative Thread</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>One of the first skills a writer develops is the ability to thread together the component parts of an argument into a cohesive, logical narrative. It’s here that GPT-3 has its biggest failing: the writing meanders and skirts around the topic. It can write <em>about </em>a question but struggles to directly <em>answer </em>the question.</p><p>When we asked <a href="https://twitter.com/gmariethatsme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gail Marie</a>, our lead editor, to edit the article, she tore it to shreds:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>"The reasoning throughout is dizzying and often illogical. A paragraph will begin by stating that X is true, and end stating that X is false. Here’s one example (these sentences come one after the other):</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>‘The real problem is that you can't automate value, entertainment, or authority. At the low end, you can automate value.'</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>My brain hurts."</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a sample comment, inline:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2242,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-05 at 9.42.19 AM.png"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was a common trait when we tried to generate long-form content with GPT-3. It loses the point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>The end of its articles doesn’t relate strongly to the beginning. Whereas a great piece of writing presents you with an idea at the outset and then builds up evidence to a logical conclusion, GPT-3 has a tendency to do what a bad piece of writing does—just say stuff.</p><p>A single narrative thread can be seen in the article <a href="https://medium.com/@arjunsethi/the-hive-is-the-new-network-260b432a6720">The Hive is the New Network</a>. It takes a single idea—the emergent properties of the hive and how they relate to human networks—and pulls it through the entire article, adding on evidence and opinion to build up a compelling argument. The point is never lost because the human writer was capable of understanding the point throughout the writing.</p><p>The ability to build a compelling argument requires showing proof, something else GPT-3 is sorely lacking.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>There Is No (Real) Evidence for Claims</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>GPT-3 is good at making claims and bad at validating them with data or reasoning, in a few ways.</p><p>The first is it just won’t back anything up. It makes assertions about the world but doesn’t link or cite any evidence. Within our editing process, this would lead to both editors and copyeditors highlighting the text with ‘citation/source?’ Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon to see this in articles written by humans, either. There are plenty of blogs that don’t cite their sources.</p><p>The second way GPT-3 is bad at validating claims is slightly more unnerving: it makes mistakes with factual data. You can see an example of this in the news article shared above. It wrote in reference to the Methodist schism:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote><p>The first occurred in 1968, when roughly 10% of the denomination left to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>This isn’t true—it is the other way round. The Evangelical United Brethren Church merged with the United Methodist Church that year.</p><p>But it’s the third mistake that is more insidious. It will make stuff up. Sometimes this is funny. In the article we prompted it to write, GPT-3 had trouble with simple addition and subtraction.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2244,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure><img src="https://2l4ff1gokdmn317w442ckjyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-5.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-03 at 8.08.34 PM.png"></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>It says 5,000 - 2,000 = 500. This is not true.</p><p>Sometimes it is much less funny. When I was experimenting with generating content from small ‘thought leadership’ style sentences, GPT-3 wrote:</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote><p>“If you design a good process,” says O’Reilly Media CEO Tim O’Reilly, “you can’t really have a bad business”</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<div><p>I can’t find that quote online. Maybe it’s on some obscure corner of the web that GPT-3 knows about but Google doesn’t. But this is a massive no-no in any writing profession. Not only is there no citation, but it looks like this is just plain made-up. This is unethical. It can get a human fired.</p><p>Backing stuff up is a core component of good content marketing. In this example, <a href="https://amplitude.com/blog/2016/10/25/month-over-month-growth-rates">3 Mistakes You're Making with Month-Over-Month Growth Rates</a>, the writer has a) got the math correct, and b) shown examples and evidence of the ideas throughout. This makes the article more authoritative and leaves the reader with the intuition and knowledge that convinces them it’s true.</p><p>The mistakes themselves are the result of human-generated insight, something GPT-3 can’t mimic.</p></div>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Article Is Missing Insight</h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>The future of DevOps solutions is bright. The <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/devops-824.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global DevOps market size</a> is expected to <strong>increase from $2.90 billion in 2017 to $10.31 billion by 2023</strong>, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 24.7% during the forecast period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The growing need for fast app delivery is driving the market growth, with organizations that want to achieve both speed and quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the world is facing <a href="https://www.shuttleops.io/the-shortage-of-devops-skills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a shortage of DevOps skills</a>. That’s why DevOps engineers are highly-paid, with <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/devops-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,15.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glassdoor estimating</a> <strong>the average annual pay at around $100,000</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you’re looking for a career switch or upgrade, learning DevOps is a good idea. From books to podcasts, <em>here are the best DevOps resources to start with:&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Phoenix-Project-Gene-Kim/9781942788294?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1588577029418&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">The Phoenix Project</a></strong></h2>



<p>Who would have thought you could write a novel about DevOps? Well, Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford obviously did a great job!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Phoenix Project </strong>is an amazing novel about DevOps. The story revolves around a fictional company called “Parts Unlimited”, where the IT manager gets promoted into a senior position. Then, he gets a deadline of 90 days to repair “The Phoenix Project”, a failing and messy code project that’s crucial to the future of the company. If he fails, the CEO threatens to outsource the entire IT department and let go of the people working in it.</p>



<p>So, he starts working on it with the help of some board members. The most important thing here is his philosophy called The Three Ways. It consists of (obviously) three parts—maximizing the flow of work from left-to-right, starting from business to development to IT operations to the end-user; increasing the feedback loop from right to left, and developing and nurturing a culture of <a href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuous deployment</a> and learning.</p>



<p>This philosophy helps him create <strong>a streamlined workflow in the department</strong>, <a href="https://microtica.com/6-tips-to-solve-miscommunication-in-dev-teams/">improve </a><strong><a href="https://microtica.com/6-tips-to-solve-miscommunication-in-dev-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication</a> and effectiveness</strong>, and make the IT department really valuable to the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think this is a really great book, especially for beginners. It gives a sense of what problems IT departments face every day, and offers realistic solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/infrastructure-as-code/9781491924334/" target="_blank">Infrastructure as Code</a></strong></h2>



<p>Coming from ThoughtWorks, this is another book that focuses on <strong>the entire DevOps movement from a more technical aspect</strong>. This book covers the principles of Infrastructure as Code, practical examples, dynamic infrastructure platforms, various cloud options, tools, patterns, software engineering practices, <a href="https://microtica.com/how-to-create-simple-ci-cd-pipeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creation and management of pipelines</a>, workflows, and infrastructure management. They are all divided into three sections—Foundations, Patterns, and Practices.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    <img src="https://nikodoko.com/img/best_practices.jpg" alt="Beware Of Best Practices /img/best_practices.jpg" data-action="zoom">


<p>As software engineers, our relationship with best practices is an evolving one. We start off unaware
of what they are. One day, because someone told us or because we read about it somewhere, we
discover them. This is usually where we start to revere them as some kind of holy scripture. The
cleaner our code gets, the more obsessed we become. For many of us, it can take a while before we
open our eyes again to the cold, hard truth: best practices are nothing but tools. Good tools, but
not always the most appropriate for the job.</p>

<p>Take DRY for example. Most may know its meaning<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, but how many wondered why it came to be? DRY is
the core principle the authors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer"><em>The Pragmatic
Programmer</em></a> came up with after years of
struggling with hard to maintain, entangled code bases. It is a <em>concrete solution</em> to a <em>concrete
problem</em>, and it involves abstraction, which also has drawbacks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Best practices are in fact just that: experienced programmers’ solutions to recurrent problems,
stripped of their context and boiled down to an easy to remember, catchy phrase. They are not golden
rules, but <em>trade-offs</em>. They come with less drawbacks than advantages - they are <em>best</em> practices
after all - but it is no excuse to not weigh up their benefits and costs before adopting them.  And
for that, it is often necessary to go back to their origins, and understand the problem they were
trying to solve in the first place.</p>

<p>But if the real value of best practices lies in knowing their costs and benefits, why do we always
teach them in a simplified, dumbed-down form? Of course, the most obvious answer to that
question pertains to our brain’s limited storage space. It is easier to remember a three letter
acronym than a full explanatory paragraph! But I feel like our love for best practices is also
deeply anchored in our subconsciousness.</p>

<p>Developing software is a complex and mentally taxing task, that often involves spending hours
pondering over what choice to make. Worse yet, when we finally take a decision, we often do so with
doubt lingering in our minds: did we really chose the right thing? In contrast, best practices
seduce us with the promise of simplicity, stability and certainty. By blindly following them, we
leave the responsibility of making decisions to a greater authority (the people who came up with
said best practice) and assume the more relaxing role of simply applying pre-made rules<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
Besides, because their formulation is so simple, best practices also easily translate into metrics.
We then turn those metrics into targets - another of our little weaknesses<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> - and reaching those
targets ultimately grants us what we are longing for: peace of mind (“I reached 100% test
coverage! My code must be safe!“). As we all know deep down, this is but a mirage. But this false
sense of security can make us dangerously complacent. Reaching 100% test coverage does <em>not</em>
guarantee that our code is bug free, and should not be an excuse to let our guard down!</p>

<p>Obviously, I am not saying best practices should not be followed. They are valuable advice from the
wise software engineers who came before us. But I do believe that we should always remember that
they are not absolute truths.</p>

<p>As always, shoot me a message or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/@nicol4s_c">@nicol4s_c</a> if you want to
chat about any of this, if you spotted any mistakes or typos, or if you’d like me to cover anything
else! Have a great day :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article" id="scroll" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>With a lack of hardware updates, buggy keyboards that never get fixed, removed SD card slots and useless touchbars, the Macbook ecosystem has been languishing for a while. Apple seems intent on cutting away the long tail of power-users, be it audio professionals, video editors or developers. With the recent ARM-transition and Big Sur, it was clear to me that Apple and the Macbook were moving in a direction that I couldn’t join them in, and I refuse to be dragged to along. An iPad with a keyboard running on an ARM chip might honestly be a great computer for the vast majority of users, but I don’t see my requirements fitting into that box - at least for the next five years. I might do a second part on why I left and what the other side offered, along with the choices encountered and an evaluation of the options, but I’ll cut it short here by mentioning my final choice: Ubuntu 20.04 running on an XPS 13 9300 Non-Developer Edition.</p>

<p>The Linux ecosystem is a lot better than it was when I left five years ago, but it still has a ways to go. I’ve had to do quite a bit to get my system to a point where I can reliably and comfortably work on my computer, without spending too much time <em>working on my computer</em>. Don’t get me wrong, I do quite enjoy recompiling kernels and tweaking my workflow - and Linux gives you the most control there - but I still do want a machine I can feel at home in, and not a permanent work-in-progress. Here’s a guide on what I ended up doing to port over the functionality I missed from the Mac and additional improvements made. It was a day or two of work but in the end, I’m happy to say that I haven’t felt the urge to open up my Mac since I finished, despite it being my happy home for the last half-decade or more.</p>

<p>We’ll go through setting up biometrics, backups, gestures, optimizing battery life, and some good alternatives to tools you’ll need.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps">First steps</h2>

<p>Before you get started with the specifics, doing some things first will speed up the process. The tools to work on the tools if you will, and some creature comforts.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-shell-extensions">Gnome Shell Extensions</h3>

<p>Ubuntu uses Gnome 3, which (despite the reports I see online) has been a relatively light and power-sipping window manager in my use. It’s the Goldilocks spot for me - you’ll have better battery life and speed with LFCE, more customization with KDE, but Gnome is yet to give me a reason to leave. Gnome Extensions make it a lot more customizable and powerful, so the first thing you’ll want to do is to install <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-tweak-tool-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa-linux">the Gnome Tweak Tool</a>. Don’t forget to install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep?hl=en">browser extension</a> for Chrome (or the browser of your choice), it makes installation and management painless.</p>

<p>Once that’s done, you’ll want to install a nice theme and set up a few extensions. Here’s what I’m running:</p>

<p><img src="https://hrishioa.github.io/assets/img/MacToLinux/theme.png" alt="theme"></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1214931/">Flat Remix Blue Theme</a> - simple aesthetic preference but I like the transparency (if it has an impact on battery life I’m yet to see it), and the blue accents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1485/workspace-matrix/">Workspace Matrix</a> - I held off on this one for a while, hearing about issues but I’ve been a happy camper ever since I switched. Workspace Matrix lets to change the workspace arrangement in Ubuntu (usually top to bottom), to any grid pattern you wish. Set rows to 1 for a more Mac-like experience with workspaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> - very similar to the one I had on MacOS, keeps your device from going to sleep. Turn it on when you’ve got something you’d like to run uninterrupted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/">Clipboard Indicator</a>, <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/104/netspeed/">NetSpeed</a>, <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1867/wattmeter/">Wattmeter</a> and <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1082/cpufreq/">CPUFreq</a> - helpful if you’d like to interact with the clipboard, CPU frequency governors and keep track of the internet speed. Netspeed comes in handy when you’re trying to find out whether your program or your connection is being laggy. Wattmeter doesn’t do anything intelligent - it simply multiplies the amperage used by the voltage to get Watts, but it’s been useful in letting me know when Dropbox is eating all of my battery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/708/panel-osd/">Panel OSD</a> - I hate the default position and background of Ubuntu notifications, and Panel OSD helps move them to a less obtrusive location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1708/transparent-top-bar/">Transparent Top Bar</a> - I like transparency. I’m one of those people that actually <em>liked</em> Aero effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/">Dash-to-Dock</a> - I wouldn’t personally recommend dash-to-dock. It’s crashed on me pretty regularly and hiccups on multi-monitor setups. But the rest of the world seems to be having a better experience than me - and it’s great when it works - so it’s worth a try.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="install-a-terminal-emulator-and-a-shell">Install a terminal emulator (and a shell)</h3>

<p>Nothing wrong with the one that comes in the box, but if you’re expecting to spend any time in the Terminal, I would recommend <a href="https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/">Tilix</a>. Pretty lightweight, all the settings I was looking for, and it supports Quake-style dropdown terminal which is a godsend on a small laptop screen.</p>

<p>I also installed <a href="https://dev.to/mskian/install-z-shell-oh-my-zsh-on-ubuntu-1804-lts-4cm4">Zsh and oh-my-zsh</a> that I’d gotten quite used to on MacOS. While I initially hated the reason Apple moved away from Bash, Zsh won me over with its innocent features. <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">Powerlevel10K</a> has one of the best set-up processes I’ve ever seen, and <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus">gitstatus</a> gets rid of lag when opening a complex git directory. I use node on a regular basis, and adding <code>--no-use</code> to the nvm loading script in <code>~/.zshrc</code> (or <code>~/.bashrc</code>) sped things up quite a bit. Tilix also needs to use the Virtual Terminal Emulator which zsh doesn’t add by default, but <a href="https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/wiki/VTE-Configuration-Issue">adding it is quite simple</a>.</p>

<h3 id="set-up-gestures">Set up gestures</h3>

<p>I’m placing this early so you don’t have to go through what I did. I had a lot of trouble setting up reliable gestures to port over my muscle memory from MacOS. I failed, gave up, came back and eventually managed to do it. If you do this from the beginning, you won’t need to go through the repeated re-adaptation I needed.</p>

<p>A number of utilities exist for gesture support on Linux and Ubuntu, and I’ve tried most. <a href="https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma">Fusuma</a> was the one that finally worked for me. I’d recommend setting up Workspace Matrix (see above) for a horizontal workspace configuration. Not only is this similar to MacOS, but the up and down gestures are often prevented by applications like Chrome, which seem to want to capture and keep the event for themselves (why this is I have no idea). This means that for three-finger swipe, left and right is far more reliable than up and down.</p>

<p>Best runner up is <a href="https://github.com/Hikari9/comfortable-swipe">comfortable-swipe</a>, which worked well but proved slightly unreliable with gesture recognition. When you’re trying to build in muscle memory, I found that 90-95% wasn’t good enough - your brain simply goes back to the other way of doing it.</p>

<p>I recommend installing the <a href="https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-sendkey">sendkey plugin</a> for fusuma, which has lower latency compared to the default <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool">xdotool</a>. Pinch and four-finger swipes also work well. Here’s my configuration:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>swipe</span><span>:</span>
  <span>3</span><span>:</span>
    <span>left</span><span>:</span>

<h3 id="4-development-environment">4. Development Environment</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/micro">Micro</a> is a good upgrade from nano (if you’re not already on emacs or vim), with clipboard support, good syntax highlighting and plugins. Makes editing the odd commit message or crontab easier.</p>

<p>I’ll also mention VS Code, as porting over settings and extensions took a few extra steps. Proper <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync">Settings Sync</a> isn’t in the stable build yet, so if it still isn’t when you’re reading this, the extension to <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync">sync settings through a gist</a> is a workable option.</p>

<h3 id="file-explorer">File Explorer</h3>

<p>This is entirely personal preference, but I’d recommend <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-nemo-file-manager-ubuntu/">Nemo</a> over the default Nautilus on Ubuntu. It’s got more settings, looks better (to me), and loads faster on my system. If you’re a Dropbox user and you go this route, you’ll also need <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo-extensions/tree/master/nemo-dropbox">nemo-dropbox</a> for better integration - although Ubuntu 20.04 doesn’t seem to have proper support just yet. Not an issue - you can install it from the <a href="https://pkgs.org/download/nemo-dropbox">.deb release</a>.</p>

<h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>

<p>The next big thing for me was configuring backups. From past experience, setting up backups is a lot easier on a clean system and a lot easier to forget once you’re up and running. There are a number of good options out there, but I’ll rip the bandaid off: I couldn’t find one that was as good as Time Machine. If you’re looking for something that can backup your entire system into a bootable copy while it’s running, you’ll have to cobble the functionality together in pieces. If anyone knows anything better than what I’m suggesting here, please do reach out - you’ll make my life easier.</p>

<p>For timed backups and archive management, you need something that can keep incremental (or differential) backups and prune old ones. It’s entirely possible to set something up with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync">rsync</a>, but that comes with its own problems. If you roll your own, you either have to be very diligent in setting it up or make sure you have enough reporting in place. You don’t want to discover that your backups have been silently failing for the last four months, and you certainly don’t want to discover it when staring at a dead machine.</p>

<p><a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Borg</a> has been the best solution for my case, with <a href="https://github.com/borgbase/vorta">Vorta</a> as the GUI. It’s got something of a learning curve, but once it works, it works well. I’m using a Synology NAS at home running RAID as the main onsite backup, and using an SSH Repository worked best for me. Simply mounting an NFS or Samba share will also work, but you then need to take care of making sure the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Many people concentrate on saving and investing as a way to achieve their financial goals.  Both of these are easier to grow with a higher income.  No matter what your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a> are, negotiating a higher salary will make them easier to achieve.</p>



<p>The time you spend researching your fair market value, preparing requests for raises, and making requests for adjustments might very well be the most valuable use of your time.</p>



<p>Considering the importance of salary you would think that people would constantly be on top of their market value ensuring they are compensated fairly.  In my experience this is often not the case.</p>



<h2>Many People are Underpaid and Don’t Even Know it</h2>



<p>Like most people I knew, I never talked about my salary with my friends or co-workers.  It’s taboo for many Americans.  This lack of transparency makes it easy to be underpaid while being unaware of it.  This benefits your employer, but not you!</p>



<p>Once I took on a senior leadership position I begun to understand the severity of differences in how people are compensated for similar positions.  In some cases employees with the same job title were compensated double what others were.</p>



<p>I am sure that most people are aware these inequities exist and might blame them on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-salary-history-bans-boost-pay-for-african-americans-women-11592472602?mod=e2fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discrimination</a>, differences in quality of work, education or level of education.  In my experience a lack of salary negotiation and keeping their salary up to date is the main driver. </p>



<p>Negotiating your salary can be uncomfortable, and asking for raises can be even more so.  This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it though!  Many will shy away from it and those that do not will end up making much more money over time to do the same job.</p>







<h2>Increases in Salary Compound Over Your Career</h2>



<p>As people get further along in their careers these differences can grow to nearly overwhelming numbers.  Employees can literally make over double what others make for the same job.  This is because of the compounding nature of raises on your salary over the course of your career.</p>



<p>Raises are generally given on a percentage basis of your current salary.  What this means is every single time you get a raise you are also getting a raise on all of your previous raises.  This adds up the same way compound interest adds up.  Over time the numbers can get large and with a 40 year long career for many there can be a lot of time for this to happen.</p>



<h2>Examples of Compounding Salary</h2>



<p>Lets look at a few simple scenarios over a 20 year job with a company.  The first scenario shows the affect of negotiating a higher starting salary and the second one shows the affect of negotiating occasional large raises.</p>



<h3>Affect of Negotiating a Higher Starting Salary</h3>



<p>Jack and Jill both were offered the same job, but Jill negotiated a very modest 10% higher salary than Jack.  They both did well and received 3% raises over the course of 20 years working for the company.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$57,963</td><td>$67,195</td><td>$77,898</td><td>$90,305</td><td>$1.43M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>The $5,000 starting difference turns into a little over $9,000 a year difference over 20 years.  This resulted in Jill making an extra $140,000 over the course of her job with this company.</p>



<h3>Affects of Negotiating Larger Raises</h3>



<p>Here we will modify the above table to show Jill negotiating a 10% raise for herself every 5 years while Jack happily accepts the standard 3%.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$61,903</td><td>$76,640</td><td>$94,884</td><td>$117,473</td><td>$1.63M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years, Jill get’s 10% every 5 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>After 20 years with a salary of $81,275 jack would need a whopping 45% raise just to catch up to Jill and still would be behind by $340,000 in lifetime earnings!</p>



<h2>How do I Keep My Salary Up to Date</h2>



<h3>Know Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>This always starts with knowing what your fair market value is.  There are several websites that can help here.  I like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.salary.com/" target="_blank">Salary.com</a>.  Do a little research and come up with a range that you feel is reasonable.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="548" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" alt="salary chart" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?w=731&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Taken from salary.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>You should be honest with yourself about your skills and experience, but I recommend starting at the high end of the range and working down from there.  If someone else can make $100,000 a year doing your job, why not you?</p>



<h3>Getting Your Salary Right to Start</h3>



<p>In my experience the majority of people will accept the first salary offer given.  This is generally a mistake.  Why would a hiring manager make you his absolute top dollar offer to start?  He is generally wise to leave a little room for negotiation for the candidates that do counteroffer.  Some candidates will want to counteroffer no matter what you offer them first!</p>



<p>Once you accept a lower salary it is VERY difficult to get it corrected.  You may have some success here at smaller companies but with larger companies and their bureaucracy don’t get your hopes up.  In my experience the best way to fix this is to find a new job.  You can avoid it by knowing your market value and negotiating a proper base to start.</p>



<h3>Constantly Update Skills</h3>



<p>The job market is always changing.  You need to keep up with it and try to stay out in front of it to maximize your earning potential.  Whatever field you are in set annual goals to achieve certifications, complete continuing education, learn a new tool or attend a conference.  </p>



<p>While one of these things by itself may not change your career, the culmination of annual self improvement over 5 to 10 years can make a massive difference in your marketability.  Senior level employees with relevant certifications and experience can be worth many times what an entry level employee is.</p>



<h3>Take Advantage of Your Time at Work</h3>



<p>You are going to be there for 8 hours a day so you might as well make the most of it.  Always seek out new projects that allow you to learn and develop your skills.  Ask about company paid training, certification or tuition.  Look for ways to add value above and beyond normal for your task.</p>



<p>Most employers will provide you with the tools, money or time to improve your skills because it directly benefits them.  If they won’t help you out here, you may want to re-consider if working there is good for your long term success.</p>



<h3>Write Down Accomplishments as They Happen</h3>



<p>Many companies do a once per year salary adjustment.  Isn’t it basically impossible to remember what all you did when walking into this conversation?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="checklist" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1022&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Keep a running list of your accomplishments</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best way to remember it all is to write it down as it happens.  Keep a running log of your accomplishments. Write them all down and come into the annual review process armed with the information you need.</p>



<h3>Frequently Update Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>Your fair market value is likely always changing.  Make sure to check the websites and understand if you are compensated fairly on a regular basis.  Always do this before an annual review.  </p>



<p>If the market has shifted for your skill set, or a new skill you learned is valuable, make sure your employer knows!  This is the time to ask for a larger than standard raise.  That new certification you acquired could be a great reason to go after a 5 or 10% raise this year.</p>



<h2>Asking for an Adjustment When You are Underpaid</h2>



<p>If you want to stick it out with your company, but found that you were underpaid you will need to ask for an adjustment to market value.  I find that the request should have the following basic supporting documentation:</p>



<ol><li>Report’s on salary range for your job from multiple sources.  If you are underpaid, show them multiple sources that validate this.  The more you can find the better.</li><li>Detail any recent skills you have developed or certifications that you have obtained. </li><li>List of recent accomplishments at work that show you have gone above and beyond.  You have been keeping the list like I recommend above right?</li></ol>



<p>I have asked for larger raises(&gt;10%) multiple times in my career and always gotten what I wanted by using the above method.  I have also been asked for raises by quite a few employees over the years.  Those with accompanying documentation like above were taken much more seriously.</p>



<h2>Leave If Your Employer Doesn’t Value You Correctly</h2>



<p>Some employers will never pay you fair market value.  This could be because they don’t value you fairly or because they don’t need the skills you have.  They may also just not have the money in the budget for someone of your skill level.  </p>



<p>Don’t let their decisions hold you back.  If they won’t pay you fairly then be prepared to get up and leave.  If you have been updating your skills regularly as I mentioned above you may find that moving to a better position is surprisingly easy.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this has shed a little light onto the importance of salary negotiations when being hired and frequently during the course of your career.  If you ignore these conversations because they can be uncomfortable you will pay dearly for it over the long term.  </p>



<p>Ultimately, your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/06/09/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> can be dramatically reduced and result in you having to work for many extra years in order to meet your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a>.  You should take charge of this part of your career before you look back and wish you had.</p>

With the US elections closing in, this will be no inadvertent hack.</p><p>Subreddit pages of r/food, r/NFL, and r/space – all with over a million members – were compromised. Banner images of Trump Make America Great Again were all over these pages as well as other related trump-support images.</p><p>These hack attacks were first noticed on Friday morning as there were reports of subreddit moderator’s accounts being accessed without authorization. This included moderator accounts of the previously mentioned pages and also those in smaller niches. Not long after, pro-Trump imagery and messages with “We Stand With Donald Trump #MIGA2020” as the subject were all over the place.</p><p>Speaking on the matter, a spokesperson of the social media platform stated that they are currently carrying out investigation on the subreddits that were hacked and he confirmed that the attacks were carried out via moderator accounts and the accounts were soon to be locked.</p><p>On Twitter, hackers released a tweet claiming responsibility for the attack. In the tweet, they revealed that they were able to carry out the attack using social engineering and password stuffing. It seems to be a get-back to the <a href="https://secureblitz.com/twitter-hack-major-celebrities-accounts-used-for-bitcoin-scam/">Twitter bitcoin hack</a>.</p><p>About 3 weeks ago, some hackers did penetrate through Twitter to perpetrate a Bitcoin scam which involved accounts of top celebrities and public figures. Notably, this included the Twitter account of former vice president and current presidential candidate, Joe Biden.</p><p>Almost not unanticipated, the account of Donald Trump was not compromised with Twitter naming the reason to be that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327782/trump-twitter-hacked-massive-attack-bitcoin-scam">Trump’s account has extra protections</a>.

That creates a major issue for any organisation in the EU that’s using a service provider (such as a messaging app) that stores - or backs-up - data on servers based outside of the EU. <br></p><p>The ruling comes after several months of pandemic-related lockdown, which has seen organisations turn to messaging apps and collaboration to support widespread working from home. Consumer-grade messaging apps have seeped into organisations, and collaboration tools have been put in place with <a href="https://element.io/blog/seven-questions-to-ask-yourself-about-the-collaboration-tools-you-chose/">more haste than thought</a>. <br></p><div><p>All of which means that centralised messaging apps such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp are now under intense scrutiny, as well as collaboration tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, and video calling services like Zoom.</p></div><p><strong>The rise of digital sovereignty</strong></p><p>Conscious that centralised systems see their data stored on third party servers in territories outside their own, governments and NGOs have been moving towards digital sovereignty for quite some time.<br></p><p>Certainly for governments, on-premise is a very attractive option. The notion of cloud is not necessarily wrong; at least not at an IaaS or PaaS level, but passing data over to a third party that stores it on servers in a different jurisdiction is now a liability. <br></p><p>In the corporate world, the issue of data residency has been an unsexy, complex topic towards the bottom of both IT and Risk’s long to-do lists. Privacy Shield, the EARN IT Act and the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data (LAED) Act are seeing data sovereignty suddenly shoot up the rankings to become a boardroom issue.<br></p><div><p>Companies are now having to assess their exposure and, suddenly, the idea of handing over sensitive company data to a third party vendor - who stores that data in a completely different country, with different privacy laws and a different privacy culture - seems startlingly shortsighted.</p></div><p><strong>Decentralisation is the foundation for privacy</strong></p><p>The idea of decentralised computing for privacy is not new. It can be traced back to the work of David Chaum and his 1979 decentralised computer system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network">Mix Network</a>, which paved the way for other protocols such as <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix;</a> the open, end-to-end encrypted decentralised communication protocol that Element uses.<br></p><p>The original web, of course, was also an open and decentralised network but has become far more centralised - and is now dominated by centralised providers such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.<br></p><p>A decentralised approach enables organisations to participate in a global open network, but to do so while retaining their independence to host and manage their own data - free to choose their own deployment solution, including which countries and jurisdictions.<br></p><p>Conversely the centralised models of Apple (iMessage), Microsoft Teams, Signal, Slack, Telegram and WhatsApp lets those proprietary systems transport, host and own their customers’ data. Some of those organisations’ business model is based upon data mining their customers’ data. Even when that’s not the case, these data honeypots attract all sorts of nefarious attention (such as the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53425822">Bitcoin scam on Twitter</a> and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53528329">ransomware hit on Blackbaud</a>) including commercial data mining and - as evidenced by EARN IT and LAED - routine surveillance.<br></p><div><p>Matrix, in contrast, provides an open decentralised network that also offers end-to-end encryption and cross-signed device verification. It is the foundation layer for secure, private, decentralised real time communications.</p></div><p><strong>EU rules apply outside of the EU</strong></p><p>When the EU introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the implications were felt worldwide as it impacted any organisation intending to interact with people protected by EU law. </p><p>GDPR is a relatively straight-forward and high-level piece of legislation put in place to protect people’s rights to personal data protection (indeed it arguably simply extended existing pre-digital consumer protection rights). GDPR underlines that the EU takes the protection of personal data seriously, even if in practice this goal has not always materialised.<br></p><p>Similarly, the Court of Justice of the European Union <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-07/cp200091en.pdf">judgement on case C-311/18</a> (colloquially known as Schrems II) that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement fails to provide sufficient protection for personal data, also has ramifications outside of the EU.<br></p><p>It means nearly every privacy consultant, lawyer and Data Protection Officer should be going through a review of their organisational data flows before agreeing on any next steps. <br></p><p>None of Your Business (<a href="https://noyb.eu/en">NOYB</a>), the NGO headed up Max Schrems who challenged Privacy Shield (and its predecessor Safe Harbor) offers this <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/next-steps-eu-companies-faqs">checklist of steps</a>:<br></p><ol><li><em><em><em>Review all your external data flows (including to EU processors or controllers that in turn may transfer data to a non-EU entity) for data flows to third countries</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>Identify the relevant legal basis (e.g. Adequacy, Article 49, Privacy Shield, SCCs, etc)</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>In relation to 50 USC § 1881a (= FISA 702) and EO 12.333 identify especially any US "electronic communication service providers" and any data flow to the US that is not secured against wire tapping by the NSA (see model requests below)</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>Stop your data transfers if: </em></em></em></li></ol><ul><li><em><em><em>You or one of our partners still use the Privacy Shield</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>A relevant US entity is an "electronic communication service provider" or</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>You cannot protect your data flows from NSA wire tapping</em></em></em></li></ul><ol><li><em><em><em>Notify the DPA if you continue to use SCCs, BCRs or any other instrument despite a negative assessment</em></em></em></li></ol><p><strong>When six worlds collide</strong><br></p><p>It’s difficult to know if the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is primarily a clash of ideology, government or technology. But it is safe to say that all three are involved, and that as a result we’re seeing six worlds collide.<br></p><p>The ideological difference is perhaps the most fundamental. It sees the EU’s data subject centric stance in direct conflict with the US’ preference towards centralised control, and a greater comfort-level with technology-enabled surveillance.<br></p><p>Whatever the drivers and complexities, European governments are clearly warmer to open source software than traditional proprietary vendors. They are also demonstrating a growing preference for decentralised systems that grant data sovereignty, as opposed to working with centralised service providers which sees government data locked into the systems of overseas vendors.<br></p><p>For our point of view, we see traditional centralised systems (Slack, Teams, Discord, Signal et al) being displaced by a grass-roots open-source movement. The negative effects of data centralisation have become incredibly clear in recent years thanks to Cambridge Analytica, unilateral algorithmic filtering and surveillance capitalism. The pendulum is swinging back towards an internet which is more open, decentralised, secure and vibrant.</p></div></div>]]>

They consume content written by technical writers in the form of documentation, and they also produce technical content. Companies and open source projects alike understand that well-written documentation is key to product adoption. In fact, </span><a href="https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>93% of respondents to a 2017 GitHub survey said that “incomplete or outdated documentation is a pervasive problem”</u></span></a><span> in open source.</span></p><p id="viewer-34g8i"><span>So we understand <em>why</em> technical writing matters, but <em>what</em> is technical writing exactly?</span></p><p id="viewer-eglpo"><span>In this post, you’ll learn what technical writing is, discover examples of technical writing in software and beyond, and gain an understanding of other skills technical writers develop to create successful and effective documentation.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-cai1i"><span>What is technical writing?</span></h3><p id="viewer-ec8gf"><span>Technical writing is the practice of creating primarily text-based instructional or informational documents for users. In software development, common genres of technical writing include product and API documentation, manpages, tutorials, and guides. But technical writing isn’t limited to software or even the developer tools space; technical writing also includes user manuals for everything from consumer products to manufacturing, aerospace engineering, and medical technology. And in certain contexts, documents like data visualizations, whitepapers, knowledge bases/online help articles are also forms of technical writing. (Technical writing is a specialty of a much wider field of practice known as technical communication.)</span></p><h3 id="viewer-d3pr5"><span>How technical writing differs from other forms of writing</span></h3><p id="viewer-5spkq"><span>Unlike other forms of writing—for example, marketing or ad copywriting—technical writing aims for precision and utility. Think, for example, of a recipe you get in a meal-delivery kit. The recipe lists the exact ingredients you need and the precise measurements for each ingredient. The writing is both precise and concise; recipe writers know that people who are in the middle of cooking a meal don’t want to follow a super long recipe! Technical writers try to convey information in a similar fashion. The writing style is meant to create a frictionless user experience that is almost imperceptible to the reader. </span></p><p id="viewer-ef2ai"><span>When technical writing is effective, a reader can do more quickly.</span> <span>But when the writing is poor, the reader may have trouble moving forward which can lead to frustration. For example, a developer trying to troubleshoot a problem at work decides to look at the official documentation for a specific package manager. They are in a time crunch and they need to be able to skim the document quickly to find a solution. They’re scanning the page for specific words, phrases, or code snippets that will point them in the right direction. Good technical writing keeps this in mind.</span></p><p id="viewer-26s29"><span>If the troubleshooting steps are vague, incomplete, or full of superfluous language, it will take the developer much longer to accomplish the task. In this scenario, the developer isn’t visiting the docs to admire the writing capabilities of the person who wrote the doc; they’re visiting the docs to help them do something. </span></p><p id="viewer-143dl"><span>Let’s consider an example outside of software. A co-pilot has to refer to a manual in-flight. They need to be able to quickly locate a section in the manual that can help them interpret one of the flight instruments. In this situation, the user (an airplane pilot) cannot afford to spend time pondering what the instructions mean, especially if they’re faced with an emergency. They don’t want jokes or flair, and they don’t want a back story. They want to find the solution to their problem and they don’t want to use more mental energy than they need to. </span></p><p id="viewer-1t39f"><span>This is why some technical documents seem “dry” or “lacking in flair” compared to the writing we see in email newsletters, blog posts, or landing pages. While copywriting is used to persuade a user to take a certain action, technical writing exists to support the user and remove barriers to getting something done. Good technical writing is hard because writers must get straight to the point without losing or confusing readers. It requires a familiarity with the subject matter, the ability to listen and observe, and a deep understanding of the reader.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-c0n7h"><span>Technical writers can do more than write</span></h3><p id="viewer-c63p8"><span>In addition to tone, technical writers pay a lot of attention to document design. We don’t read online content the same way we read content in print, so document design is also dependent on document format. Elements of document design include layout, page formatting, typography, color, and other visual aids. Technical writers structure their documents to facilitate reading comprehension. They understand that many readers skim and scan documents in search of the information they need, and writers look for ways to surface relevant and important information to readers. And they also recognize that users need to take steps in a certain order to achieve the desired result.</span></p><p id="viewer-9hs07"><span>Technical writing isn’t limited to the act of writing a draft. Technical writers must be familiar with research methods, usability, visual design, and instructional design, among other things. They must know their users and the scenarios that drive users to interact with documentation. They have to be able to search for the right information and know how to ask questions of subject matter experts. They understand how text and visual design work together to create a cohesive user experience. And they review and revise their work as needed, acknowledging the importance of editing in the writing process.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-44eps"><span>Want to learn more about technical writing? </span></h3><p id="viewer-4bg5p"><span>I </span><a href="https://github.com/rubymorillo/pocket-tech-writing-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>compiled a list of technical writing resources</u></span></a><span> for continued learning. It includes style guides, books, online material, and courses.</span></p><p id="viewer-1qaan"><span>I learn best in environments where I can learn from experts and apply what I’m learning in the form of a project or an assignment.

<p><em>Update: this generated a pretty good <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24109726">Hacker News discussion</a>.</em></p>



<p>Does your company have a wiki? If you had to guess, what percentage of that wiki would you say is:</p>



<ul><li>Up to date</li><li>Still relevant</li><li>Viewed at least once per year by someone</li></ul>



<p>I’m going to take a wild guess that your answer is somewhere below 25%. If so, you’re saying that over 75% of your company’s wiki is either irrelevant, unused, or downright incorrect. In other words, the vast majority of your company’s wiki is at best not useful, and is at worst actively harmful if it’s giving people incorrect information. </p>



<p>This is called Wiki Rot. It’s spreading in companies worldwide, and it must be stopped. </p>



<p>What if you had to start over? What if, once a year, everything in your company’s wiki was deleted? Call it Wiki Bankruptcy. Here’s how it could go down:</p>



<ol><li>Tell everyone at your company that in 2 weeks, all wiki contents will be deleted. Let everyone take those 2 weeks to copy/back up/download any pages they want to keep.</li><li>After those 2 weeks end, you back up and delete everything in the wiki.</li><li>Tell everyone that they can now resume creating wiki pages, and are free to recreate the pages they thought were important.</li><li>For all of the people who realize they need stuff that they didn’t think about copying in step 1, allow them to access it from your back up from step 2. But do not allow linking directly to pages in that back up, or else you run the risk of people just continuing to read the backed up wiki pages.</li><li>Repeat after 1 year.</li></ol>



<p>Yes, it’s a huge pain, and there will be a couple weeks where everyone is grumpy about it. But Wiki Bankruptcy is the price we must pay to kill Wiki Rot. Wiki Bankruptcy ensures that the vast majority of your wiki will be up to date and relevant, and it’s a sure-fire way to clear out all the cruft nobody is ever looking at anymore.</p>



<p>Now, let’s hear all the reasons why you hate it. <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me about it</a>!</p>

Slides from this talk are available </em><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DG1mWP8rmDDyjBXPe3q5VE7xPPbfHw1/view?usp=sharing"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Paul Osman: </strong>I lead the SRE team at Under Armour. Who here knows about Under Armour as a tech company? Does anybody think about Under Armour as a tech company? Under Armour makes athletic attire, shirts and shoes. We are also the company that owns MapMyFitness, MyFitnessPal and Endomondo, which are all fitness trackers that our customers use to either keep track of nutrition goals or fitness goals. That's Under Armour, and specifically that's actually my team. We work on the reliability of those consumer applications.</p><p>I'm going to be talking today about postmortems and the postmortem process. First, I'm going to zoom out a little bit and talk about incident analysis, which is actually a much bigger field. Incident analysis is the study of how to actually analyze what happened during events that we can learn from. I'm going to try to give some lessons that we've learned doing incident analysis.</p><p>Let's talk about postmortems. The term comes from medicine and the actual definition is an examination of a dead body to determine the cause of death. That was the first thing that came up when I Googled it. That's awful. I'm really glad that's not what I do. I have a huge amount of respect for doctors. I don't have the stomach for it, and I'm really glad that nobody tends to die when our systems go down. I'm sure there are maybe some people in this room for whom that's true, but that's certainly not true for us.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason I'm bringing this up is, I hate the term. I hate that we've all decided that postmortem is the term for what we do. I don't think it is, but I'm probably not going to change the vernacular of our industry, so we'll go with it.</p><p>Postmortems have to do with incidents, accidents that happen in production systems usually in this context. <a href="https://twitter.com/allspaw">John Allspaw</a>, who's the former CTO of Etsy, has described incidents this way: “Incidents are unplanned investments.” There's two things that I really like about that. One is the emphasis on the fact that incidents are unplanned. They're surprises. The other thing is that they're investments. Incidents take time. They add stress to people's lives, not just customers, but internally to engineers, people who are working customer support cues, and other stakeholders.</p><p>These are all people that we're paying. If we're making that investment, then what we talk about when we discuss postmortems and the postmortem process is opportunities to try to get some return from those investments. I've always thought of incident analysis or postmortems as opportunities for trying to recoup some return on that investment of that incident. What are those returns going to look like?</p><p>Action items are one way that we can recoup some return on those investments. Increasingly, I'm becoming convinced, however, that the real return is actually in learning. If we can figure out ways to improve how learning happens internally after an incident, then we improve lives for our customers and for our engineers, and we generally get better as an organization.<br></p><blockquote>Increasingly, I'm becoming convinced, however, that the real return is actually in learning. If we can figure out ways to improve how learning happens internally after an incident, then we improve lives for our customers and for our engineers, and we generally get better as an organization.</blockquote><p>In practice, this is roughly what that process might look like: you construct a timeline of events that took place during an incident, you get a big group of people together—it can vary in size from the people who are directly involved in an incident to being an open invitation to everyone in the company—and you discuss that timeline. You go over the causal chain of events and then you talk about what went well. What are the things that we should preserve? You talk about what went wrong. And, depending on the group, this can get to be a very interesting discussion. Out of that, there will be a bunch of action items and that's the real value that you get.&nbsp;</p><p>This is definitely how I used to think about incidents. This was my primary mental model and it served me for a while. It definitely resonated with teams I was on and there is some use to it. But what are the problems here? I think there are a few.</p><p>One of the things that I found is that I've been a part of many postmortem review meetings where attendance was really poor. That's awful. This is an opportunity to learn from things that happened and to get better, so it shouldn't be like that. That seems like we might be doing something wrong. I've also heard people discuss these as theater, and I've certainly described them as theater in the past, meaning there's a trap you can fall into where you go through this review process, you generate a bunch of action items at the end and you're done, and then those action items sit in a backlog forever. That can really detract from morale and contributes to the first problem which is people not being excited to go to these things.</p><p>The other thing is that the timeline can be just pre-agreed upon. In this model, you've already assembled the timeline. You've come up with what happened by the time you get a group of people together to discuss it. That can be limiting.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the problems that I started to think about is that big meetings aren't the best place to talk about that timeline. If you are getting a big group of people together and you're asking them about this incredibly stressful, sometimes traumatic event, then having a big group of people isn't going to encourage people to get back into that mindset where they were responding to an incident. Maybe it was 2:00 in the morning, maybe they were under a lot of stress. I don't know about you, but a big group is not the place where I necessarily want to go through that again.<br></p><blockquote>One of the problems that I started to think about is that big meetings aren't the best place to talk about that timeline.

This is something that we've started experimenting with, which is having one-on-one interviews as part of your review process. Actually, <a href="https://twitter.com/MissAmyTobey">Amy Tobey</a> has a great talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFiF-G10WY">One-on-One SRE</a>. Amy talks about her experiences conducting these interviews as part of the postmortem review process. We've started doing this internally at Under Armour and it has dramatically improved the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the things that I found in conducting these interviews is that you can do things that you can't do in big meetings, which is like establish rapport, relate experiences, get people talking about what mindframe they were in, and what context they had during the response. Funnily enough, I've had people give me feedback that when we go through the process like this where someone interviews them and then we get together as a big group and we read back what we've been told, people felt more heard than if they were actually just given the floor during a postmortem review process. That was a really interesting takeaway for me.&nbsp;</p><p>But more than anything else, some of the gems that have come out of these interviews have been amazing. People talking about the ergonomics of tools that they're using, talking about some dashboard where they know is not right. There are all sorts of things that can come up in that one-on-one context that might not necessarily get surfaced otherwise. This emphasizes something I wanted to bring up. I've experienced this a lot and I've heard this repeated a lot: blamelessness is not the same as psychological safety.&nbsp;</p><p>Psychological safety is super important, and I think it's a great thing, but it's not blamelessness. What I mean by that is you can have a group of people who are super psychologically safe or comfortable with being vulnerable in front of each other, who are really close and work as a team effectively, and they will still not come up with this info. If you're doing things in a certain way, they will still be susceptible to falling into traps.<br></p><blockquote>Psychological safety is super important, and I think it's a great thing, but it's not blamelessness.</blockquote><p>Blamelessness is not being safe to say, "I fucked up," because that's still centering you as the person who made a bad decision, which is actually inherently blameful even though it's an example of psychological safety. This tends to tease out some of these subtle nuances in the way that we use some of the vernacular.</p><p>Another problem that I've certainly experienced is that action items never get done. You have these postmortem review processes and these action items just sit at the bottom, which really makes me question if they're the key value that comes out of these things. If action items aren't getting done, are they that important or was the process geared to generate action items and that's why you did them?</p><p>Another thing that I've noticed here is that action items get done and you didn't know about it. You had the meeting, you went through what went well, what didn't go well, and you generated a list of action items. It turns out there's a whole bunch of stuff that engineers actually already did. Well, how could they know? You hadn't had the meeting yet, you hadn't come up with a list of action items, but it's because they had the context right after the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have that engineer who's like, "You know what? I've been meaning to fix that thing. I knew it was wrong. We just had an incident; I'm going to schedule like five hours and just fix this thing,” that's not going to come up in one of these meetings necessarily, but you still want to capture that. This can be more …</p></div></div>

            <p>Call <code>topbar.show()</code> to show and <code>topbar.hide()</code> to hide the progress bar. Before <code>topbar.hide()</code> is called, the progress bar will move slower and slower but never actually reach 100%. Most of the time, these 2 methods are all you need.</p>
            Show Progress
            Hide Progress
            <pre>$('#btnStartSimple').click(function() {
  topbar.show()
})

$('#btnStopSimple').click(function() {

          <h4>Advanced</h4>
          <section>
            <p>Use <code>topbar.config(options)</code> to customize <em>topbar</em>.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>autoRun</code> (default: <code>true</code>): if <code>false</code>, call <code>topbar.progress()</code> manually to run.</li>
              <li><code>barThickness</code> (default: <code>3</code>): the progress bar thickness.</li>
              <li><code>barColors</code>: list of gradient color stops used to draw the progress bar.</li>
              <li><code>shadowBlur</code> (default: <code>10</code>): the shadow blur.</li>
              <li><code>shadowColor</code>: the shadow color.</li>
              <li><code>className</code>: the CSS class name for the progress bar.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: <code>topbar.progress()</code> can take a number or string value. If string, you can use <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> to change the progress relatively to current position. If no argument is specified, return the current progress (<code>0</code> to <code>1</code>).</p>
            Show Progress
            Hide Progress
            <pre>$('#btnStartAdvanced').click(function() {
  topbar.config({
    autoRun      : false,

Because we don't really know," Joordens&nbsp;told CBC Ottawa.</p>  <p>Joordens said the concept particularly doesn't work well for younger folks who want&nbsp;to socialize and meet new people, be it friends or romantic partners.</p>  <p>"It almost becomes the opposite of what [it's]&nbsp;meant to be. It's meant to be a really safe space, but [it isn't]&nbsp;if one member of that bubble brings the virus into it."</p>  <h2>Difficult in practice</h2>  <p>For many people, the bubbles — also known as social circles — are a conundrum,&nbsp;said Dr. Gerald Evans, a professor and chair of the infectious diseases division of the department of medicine at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.</p>  <p>Evans said many of them can't remain&nbsp;pure, given&nbsp;that people often come into close contact with others outside their bubbles.</p>  <p>"What people don't fundamentally understand is that&nbsp;then allows for transmission of the virus from one circle to another," he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5678685.1597065218!/fileImage/httpImage/bubble-explainer-gif.gif"></p></div><figcaption>If just one person in a bubble comes into close contact with another person in another bubble, it opens up their bubbles to more potential sources of exposure.<!-- --> <!-- -->(CBC News)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The challenge to maintain an "exclusive" bubble will be particularly difficult with schools opening in the fall, Evans said.</p>  <p>Most parents have&nbsp;likely been able to restrict the size of their social network during isolation, he said, but September will pose a whole new challenge.</p>  <p>"These are kids who have been starving for some social contact ... so it's going to be very, very difficult to control that."</p>  <h2>'It's kind of like counting calories at this point'</h2>  <p>Ottawa parent Ash Zade is facing that very challenge.</p>  <p>Zade said his family&nbsp;has tried to only be around those in their bubble: four grandparents and one or two families in their neighbourhood.</p>    <p>But he's concerned about sending his four-year-old daughter to junior kindergarten in September, given he was already running into problems with his two-year-old daughter attending&nbsp;home daycare,&nbsp;which exceeded the family's bubble limit.</p>  <p>His&nbsp;wife is an elementary school teacher, which only makes it more complicated.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's kind of like counting calories at this point, where you're like, 'Fruit doesn't count,'" he said. "So daycare, we don't count as [part of the] 10. Although we should."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5594646.1596835677!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-19-back-to-school.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Parents like Ash Zade and Natalee Rubec say when schools reopen in September, there's no way they'll be able to maintain a 10-person social bubble.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Ben Nelms/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Natalee Rubec, a mother of four who works full time from home, said if her kids return to school in September, they would all be going to four separate schools&nbsp;— meaning four times the exposure.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"By my calculations, it effectively opens our bubble from 10 to 15 to 18,300," she said. "It's an impossible situation."&nbsp;</p>    <h2>Bubble tensions</h2>  <p>Joordens said the habits that people are&nbsp;forming post-lockdown will be difficult to change, especially within families and friend groups.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I think we had a certain safety when we were under lockdown in our own place. But now&nbsp;... we're&nbsp;all gambling with other people's money to an extent."&nbsp;</p>    <p>He said one big anxiety-inducing issue&nbsp;is not knowing whether it's safe to visit&nbsp;grandparents or family if your bubble has expanded.</p>  <p>"If you're in a bubble and you feel like somebody else in the bubble is not taking things seriously — and they're&nbsp;thereby endangering everyone in your bubble&nbsp;— it leads to a lot of uncomfortable discussions and arguments."</p>  <p>He's also worried those who've gotten more at ease during the pandemic&nbsp;might not even know they're potentially putting themselves and others at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"They've been living in the bubble&nbsp;and feeling safe&nbsp;and engaging in certain behaviours," he said.

The standard advice is to take an iterative approach, prioritising things and then cycling quickly through them, finding solutions just good enough to move things forwards before moving onto the next thing.</p><p data-reactid="45">It's good advice, but hard to follow in practice. Often when you explore solutions to a problem, even simple ones, the problem reveals itself to be more complex than you'd anticipated. You find sub-problems, and tangental problems, which look just as important as the original. It's easy to go off track and end up deep into the problem you were supposed to just find a quick solution to. After all, it's just one more thing, you're thinking about it, and you'll have to solve it at some point anyway. Why not now?</p><p data-reactid="46">I've made this mistake a lot. I'm trying to get better at being strict about saying "not now" to new problems that I discover in the middle of an iteration, and avoid getting sidetracked from shipping by working on things that can be left for later. I'd like to share a tactic I use to do this that has worked well for me. It's to ask a simple question about each new problem I encounter: "From my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have?". If yes, I skip it. If no, I work on it immediately.</p><p data-reactid="48">An example to illustrate is signup functionality. Let's say I'm starting on a new product. Without signup, there's no possibility of getting any users, which is a problem. From my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have? No - I have zero users right now, and can't get any until signup is done. The only way to move forwards is to build signup.</p><p data-reactid="49">Whilst I'm building signup, I realise that I probably also need reset password functionality. If a user signs up, but then forgets their password, that's a problem. But from my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have? Actually, yes! I have zero users, but having this problem implies I would have users, which would be great. Reset password functionality is important, and will absolutely be required eventually, but I can do it later. First, I should ship anything that's stopping me from getting users in the first place.</p><p data-reactid="51">There are always tiers of functionality which build upon one another, and this simple question provides a neat hack to sort things in order of when they'll actually be useful so you can build and ship that functionality in faster iterations, rather than delaying shipping while you batch and build everything up front. Try it out when you next build something.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

            <p>What does the upstream for major packages <em>really</em> look like? Over the past few years, the shape of the open source ecosystem landscape has shifted drastically, exploding both in the volume of published code, and also the number of dependencies that live upstream from a given library.</p><h3 id="scoping-the-discussion">Scoping the Discussion</h3><p>In order to have a real discussion about software packages and ecosystem health, it's important to first understand the current state of the ecosystem. &nbsp;For the sake of simplicity, we'll keep the focus of this discussion to NPM - which represents the logical extreme of the problems and ideas discussed here. Keep in mind, however, that this is <em>absolutely</em> not exclusively a Javascript issue - a cursory glance shows that all of these <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09535">problems are just as present and relevant in every other programming language ecosystem</a> - even if the awareness is somewhat lower.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>

While code reuse has probably been a part of software development from the earliest days of industry, the practices around this period began to favor it very heavily - during this decade, languages and APIs &nbsp;built around Object Oriented (OO) concepts started to really rise to prominence, and the earliest iterations of package managers were minted. Interface definitions and library packaging were at the forefront of the tooling. If we fast forward to the end of the 90's, specifically to the year 1999 - the year when <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> was published - we see this whole concept codified with the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. &nbsp;This, to be entirely fair, is a great thing for software - reusing previously-written code (that has already been tested, validated, and vetted) probably saves billions in development costs annually. On the other hand, however, it <em>does</em> come with some implicit risks.</p><h3 id="software-reuse-the-implications">Software Reuse: The Implications</h3><p>While all of this was not only very well intentioned, but also a generally smart way to think about the problem, the landscape has shifted drastically since then. Gone are the days when the people <em>behind</em> the software you consume as part of your build process are really understandable - the scope and scale of the open source ecosystem have ballooned over the last few years, and continue to do so at every turn. The implication here is two-fold: Firstly, it is difficult to really reason about <em>what</em> you are incorporating into your codebase when leveraging an external library, giving rise to a whole host of paid solutions that simply provide you with a "bill of materials," and second, there are a whole host of hidden costs bundled into the upstream packages and libraries. The technical debt contained in those packages becomes <em>your</em> technical debt, their issues (to varying degrees) become <em>your</em> issues. This also leads to a great deal of what-ifs: <em>what if</em> one of those packages has a critical vulnerability? <em>What if</em> one of them contains licenses that may impact your commercial viability? <em>What if</em> some of them are abandoned? <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/malicious-npm-development-kit-a02401e6537e?gi=8b38c3b8b606">Contain malware? Have backdoors?</a> &nbsp;</p><p>The short answer is: All of these are valid concerns. Some of them have come to the forefront of the public focus (particularly issues around licenses and vulnerabilities), but as for the rest - they represent a veritable ticking time bomb in the community; one which has arguably gone off <em>already</em> in the form of <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/04/rubygem-typosquatting-malware.html">700 malicious RubyGems</a>, hundreds to thousands of de-listed npm packages, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8hvzja/backdoor_in_sshdecorator_package/">dozens</a> <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/malware-in-pypi-code-shows-supply-chain-risks/d/d-id/1335310">of</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-malicious-python-libraries-removed-from-pypi/">Python</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/malicious-python-libraries-targeting-linux-servers-removed-from-pypi/">libraries</a>, and <a href="https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-security/docker-hub-distributing-cryptomining-malware/">tens of Docker images</a>, among others (while I <em>did</em> promise up front that we'd be focused on NPM, it very much bears mentioning the scope of these issues in other, tangential ecosystems).</p><h3 id="rough-numbers">Rough Numbers</h3><p>So even <em>if</em> we believe that all of this is a big issue, that begs the question: How big is it? Just to get a rough idea, this <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/state-union-npm/">"State of the Union"</a> post about NPM (published in early 2017) indicates that in 2015 - 5 years ago (at the time of writing) - NPM contained a scant 12,500 packages. Fast forward to today, and it contains <em>nearly 1.4 million</em>, and continues to grow at an average rate of almost 900 a day. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/07/npm-growth.PNG" alt="npm growth rate"><figcaption>NPM Growth Trajectory - Graph courtesy of modulecounts.com</figcaption></figure><p>Keep in mind that this is <em>net new</em> packages - not at all counting updates to existing ones under active development. </p><p>What does this really mean, though? Do we really care about the <em>size</em> of the ecosystem if we only use one or two major packages during development? In order to get a better understanding here, we did some more detailed analysis on React (an immensely popular UI framework, for those unfamiliar) to figure out what its dependency graph looks like. A first pass at this seemed like a good spot to simply look at some products that do commodity "bill of materials" and vulnerability analysis. Picking a popular tool, we checked out the latest react build (at the time of writing), and looked to see what its dependency tree would look like: </p><figure><img src="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/07/react-s-number.PNG" alt="React Dependencies Misleading"><figcaption>Proported React Dependency Count</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance, this doesn't really seem to tell the whole story; if we pull open react's <code>package.json</code> directly, we also see this: </p><figure><img src="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/07/react-dev-deps.PNG" alt="react dev dependencies"><figcaption>... And on for tens more lines</figcaption></figure><p>The <code>"devDependencies"</code> are totally ignored! While this may not seem like a big deal at first blush (they aren't included in the final build, after all!), in many ways, they actually pose an even <em>bigger</em> security threat than the production dependencies. Production dependencies for React run in the web browser's sandbox - and while there is certainly a <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5">whole host of bad stuff that can be done there</a>, dev dependencies have the ability to interact directly with the host they are running on without any sandbox, meaning they are free to access files, connect to remote servers, and run additional programs with the same permissions as the current user. </p><p>Really, at its core this means that fundamentally untrusted code, written by random developers, runs on sensitive systems where security credentials are stored, such as developer workstations, CI runners, and more. If stealing some customer data here and there from the browser seems really bad, what does the ability to steal any keys, credentials, and access that a developer or CI runner has the ability to access mean? Most developers have root access to their own system, and often have access to sensitive infrastructure and data, including production systems. CI runners are often worse - modern CI/CD processes frequently inject credentials to <em>everything</em> during the build and deployment process, giving an attacker the proverbial "keys to the kingdom".</p><p>To make matters even worse, simply looking at the <code>package.json</code> doesn't <em>really</em> tell the whole story - nearly all of the dependencies in that list in turn have dependencies, which <em>in turn</em> have more dependencies, and so on. If we pull down the <em>entire</em> graph just for React, we get something like <em>7,000 total dependencies for a single library. </em></p><figure><img src="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/08/react-deps.jpg" alt="react full dependency graph" srcset="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/react-deps.jpg 600w, https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/react-deps.jpg 1000w, https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/react-deps.jpg 1600w, https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2020/08/react-deps.jpg 1621w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The <em>real</em> dependency graph</figcaption></figure><p>To be totally clear, this is <em>not</em> what you'll get every time you run <code>npm install</code>, but rather a <em>superset</em> of what you'll get during that process. Due to semantic versioning (notionally, the option to specify <em>ranges</em> of acceptable package versions in your <code>package.json</code> which will satisfy a dependency), it is all but impossible to say exactly <em>what</em> you'll get <em>a priori</em>, as large parts of the dependency graph may change substantially between package versions. </p><p>Really, all of this simply compounds the root problem: well meaning development principles have been pushed to their logical extreme. This ultimately makes simply understanding what you'll get with a given install an almost impossibly hard problem. This is doubly true if you want to develop anything more than a cursory understanding of the stuff that sits upstream from your development efforts - not mentioning the authors and maintainers <em>behind</em> those packages.</p><h3 id="not-just-security">Not <em>Just</em> Security</h3><p>While security concerns are certainly at the forefront of this discussion, a whole separate class of issues presents itself here: How does the code quality of upstream packages impact the technical debt of your projects? While this seems like sort of a subjective thing to measure on its face, some clear problems present themselves: Does the repository in question have good test coverage? Does it have unit tests at all? What about the contributors, how responsive are they to issues? How many contributors have the ability to commit code - if it is only one, what will happen if that contributor stops working on the project? And as a follow on, does the repository appear to be abandoned?</p><p>These are certainly all concerns for every consumer of open source - issues in any of these areas in a single library will be issues for every package that depends upon them. </p><h3 id="it-only-gets-worse">It Only Gets Worse</h3><p>While all of this seems bad enough, what about updates to those 7,000 existing packages? Even if we have undeniable proof that all of the authors sitting upstream are honest and well intentioned, what happens if they suffer a credential breach, like the <a href="https://duo.com/decipher/docker-hub-breach-can-have-a-long-reach">relatively-recent one suffered by Docker Hub</a>? Additionally, what if their account credentials are compromised in some other way? Either scenario puts every package downstream completely at the mercy of whoever obtains their credentials. This may seem like something of a hypothetical situation, but that is unfortunately not the case; doing some very high-level sampling of some top contributors (with hundreds of published packages, all upstream from dozens of major projects) and comparing the results with some major password breach datasets yielded disturbing results: <em>the very first</em> such contributor we looked at appeared in no less than three such datasets, with the same password in use in all cases - a password extremely vulnerable to dictionary attacks, no less. At this point, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- Toc if any -->
                
                    
                    
                
                <!-- End Toc -->
                <p>I’ll tell you some of my opinions about Software Architecture and what are our plans for Looset.</p>

<p>It’ll watch you source files changes to show in real time a dependencies diagram and Code Block viewer independent of the filesystem. Check it out on the <a href="https://jponline.github.io/looset-landing/">main page</a>.</p>

<p>We haven’t started to work in Looset yet, but I’ve thought a bit about its architecture. I believe the “building” metaphor is bad when talking about software, I prefer the “grow” metaphor. When we think about our software as a living organism that needs constant care we make better decisions about it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of rules around how to create software, “you should use this design pattern”, “you should write your tests first”, TDD, “you should model according to your domain first”, DDD, “behavior first”, BDD, SOLID, Hexagonal (Onion) Architecture, Layers and Modules, etc. I value most of what I mentioned here, but I prefer to understand the principles they reflect. In this direction I like <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/">The Art of Unix Programming</a> and there’s a summary of the principles stated there in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Eric_Raymond's_17_Unix_Rules">a wiki</a>.</p>

<p>I’m influenced by two other ideas: The first, I’ve heard from Martin Fowler, opposing the statement that “The architect is the responsible for making the big important initial decisions” he said something as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/oss-lockin.html">“The architect should let options open”</a>. The second I got by reading <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/#toc">Clean Architecture</a> by Uncle Bob, where he points out that the farther a module is from the business rules, more this module should work as a plugin. I.e, frameworks and databases should work as plugins. And then I started to think what other decisions can I let open and structure as a plugin? Maybe an i18n system, maybe the programming language itself.</p>

<p>To see this project becoming reality you can contribute in the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/looset-team/looset?ref=1i0fmm">Kickstarter Campaign</a>. We’re asking what we need to be able to work on it, and it will be a Free Open Source Software.</p>

<p>I have some general goals when writing software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extensibility: that the accretion of features don’t become slow and dangerous to existent features when the projects grow big.</li>
  <li>Readability - Easy to read and understand.</li>
  <li>Maintainability, Flexibility or Testability - Decoupling in a way that if we change a module it won’t break the system in different places.</li>
  <li>Robust - Handles well unexpected errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Looset we have some more specific goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Community contribution</li>
  <li>Speed</li>
  <li>Modularity</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="back-end">Back-end</h2>
<p>I’ve been working in Clojure for some time now and it has been a constant match between my personal development philosophy and its own and community philosophy. But I understand that other people might have other personal preferences or use a different stack that works better in specific domains.</p>

<p>For this reason we decided to write Looset modules as independent scripts programs that are called using bash. For instance we’ll write a Basic Analyzer in Clojure using <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">babashka</a>, but we’ll let it open for other language specific analyzers to be written in any script language. What could be seen as a sort of Micro Service architecture. One could decide to use Python to write an analyzer for C or even integrate a project as <a href="https://lezer.codemirror.net/">Lezer</a>.</p>

<p>In Clojure, most of the data are maps, it is part of the philosophy. As data will need to be shared across different languages and even the front end, it’d make sense to write it in Clojure EDN (Extensible Data Notation), but thinking in more general adoption we’ll write the data as files in JSON, also being inspired on how Git works.</p>

<h2 id="front-end">Front-end</h2>
<p>Most people would agree that making decisions about the Front-end is very different from making decisions about the back-end. But we still want to maximize the community contribution and modularity, still letting options open. So we decided to write Looset views as independent Web Components that will be used in a basic HTML page. For instance we’ll write components using Clojurescript and <a href="https://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a>, but we’ll let it open for other languages and frameworks that support exporting as Web Components. One could decide to use Angular or Vue.js to write a new functionality.</p>

<p>I’ve already created a web app from scratch without a State Management System as Redux or <a href="http://day8.github.io/re-frame/">Re-Frame</a> and I know how this is important. I would say that the most important is not the library but the idea, so the main point is to have the app state to be global, change it by firing events and subscribe components to the changes. I’m still investigating how we’re going to use it in a way it’s available to any web component in any framework.</p>

<p>Other decisions about how to structure the app state also needs to be done. I like to have it as normalized as possible and splitting what are domain entities (basically what we would write in a database) and UI models (component states) also computing as little as possible in the rendering phase, <a href="https://cognitect.com/blog/2017/5/22/restate-your-ui-using-state-machines-to-simplify-user-interface-development">treating the UI as a Finite State Machine</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
<p>I like the Test Driven Development approach, what is good not only for tests but for structuring dependencies in a testable way. I tend to write them in a BDD style using the <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/">Given, When, Then Gherkin syntax</a>. We’ll mostly write unit tests for the back-end, but I don’t think unit tests are that valuable for the front-end. I’ve already used <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> to write end-to-end tests, clicking in buttons, taking screenshots, etc. But for Looset we’ll use it basically to have a production like environment, but only firing events and checking the result app state.</p>

<p>Another strategy that is sometimes viewed as tests, but I use more as a way to develop and prototype is <a href="https://github.com/bhauman/devcards">Devcards</a>. We’ll use it to visualize all components in multiple states at once while we’re developing and tweaking the app state.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>
<p>In most projects the performance is not a top priority for me because I don’t expect to work with huge amounts of data, what’s different in this project. A main concern is how fast it’s going to be to interact with big projects generating large graphs. To address this problem we’ll have Web Workers or background processes generating caches for the visualizations.</p>

<h2 id="kickstarter">Kickstarter</h2>
<p>We created a campaign to both validate the interest and also to be able to invest the amount of time that this project requires. The campaign asks for a one time contribution of any amount and it’s all or nothing, you’ll be changed at the end of the month and only if we reach the goal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>First off, no-code isn't going to replace code. No-code is simply a set of tools and products that allow someone to do previously difficult actions without hand-writing the code involved.</p><p>Most websites are built with a common set of building blocks, so a few companies got together and made tools that package those building blocks and let you assemble them however you want - namely Wix, Wordpress, SquareSpace, and Webflow.</p><p>Most web/phone apps are built with similar base structures and rely on simple backend databases, so a few companies created tools that made organizing those structures and databases easy - namely Glide, Adalo, and Bubble.</p><p>Then, on a deeper level, there are tools that tie other tools together, creating workflows between components and letting you build larger structures. A few companies that do that are Zapier, Integromat, and Parabola.</p><p>But let's get one thing straight, all these tools work within expected parameters. They were created to solve simple development problems people had over and over again, and thus, they can't go outside those expected parameters. If you have an insane idea for a software product that breaks a ton of new ground, you probably can't build it with no-code. If you have an app idea that's super insane and unique, you probably can't build it with no-code.</p><p>But, if your idea even remotely fits into the building blocks of what's been done before, no-code can be extremely powerful. With a tool like Adalo, and a little practice, you can whip up a fully-functional marketplace app with payment processing, backend databases, and everything else in about two hours. Your idea doesn't have to be incredibly unique to be successful - and no-code can help you build and perfect that first MVP insanely quick. That's what it's good for.</p><p>As an example, ProductHunt is a super successful company - but their site could be built on Webflow and Zapier in less than a day. It's not the tech that's the valuable part, it's the market gap they filled.</p><p>So, no-code is useful for anyone looking to quickly make a piece of technology come to life. I especially love it because you don't need to learn an entire programming language to get started. You do need to understand some basic programming logic to get into advanced functionality, but you're no longer dealing with syntax, you're just building. No-code is also incredibly useful for businesses looking to automate some simple tasks - if you're not trying to build some entirely new product.</p><p>This does replace some code, in the sense that you might not need a technical co-founder right away, or need to hire a consultant to solve a simple tech problem. You may be able to prototype your idea quickly, and start testing. In a lot of cases, even if you're already incredible at programming, you might want to use no-code to start. Often times, no-code tools work off pre-built templates that already optimized for UI/UX and design - you won't have to worry about any of that, and you can always re-build it from the ground up later if you want. I personally think all minimum viable products should be created with no-code to start (if possible) so if your initial draft doesn't stick (and it rarely does) you can change everything super rapidly.</p><p>I was personally able to spin up a small app from a google sheet in less than 20 minutes using Glide, and now I can quickly publish that and start messing with it until something sticks.</p><p>I'm no expert on no-code, but I've been learning a ton from some lessons at Makerpad - would recommend you check it out if you want to get started yourself.</p><p>Also, if this was valuable at all, a retweet would help me spread the word a ton - no pressure though, of course. :)</p></div></div>]]>

<div>
      <p>ARM CPUs are coming to Java. Amazon offers cloud instances based on ARM-compatible processors. And there is now a <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/388">new JEP to create an OpenJDK port for Windows on ARM</a>. And Apple plans to use ARM Processors for its Macs and Macbooks.</p>
<p>What is the difference between ARM and x86 when we program in Java? As long as you follow the rules: None. So let us break the rules</p>

<p>The following test leads to different results on the two processor types. We use a dedicated tool for those types of tests, <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/CodeTools/jcstress">the OpenJDK tool jcstress</a>. The test consists of two methods which are annotated with the annotation <code>@Actor</code>. The annotated methods get called from different threads:</p>
<pre>public class TestReorderWriteWrite {
 SingeltonWithDataRace singelton = new SingeltonWithDataRace();
 @Actor
 public void actor1(II_Result r) {
  if (singelton.instance().initialized) {
   r.r1 = 1;
  } else {
   r.r1 = 0;
  }
 }
 @Actor
 public void actor2(II_Result r) {
  if (singelton.instance().initialized) {
   r.r2 = 1;
  } else {
   r.r2 = 0;
  }
 }
}</pre>
<p>The class <code>Singelton</code> checks if the variable <code>instance</code> is null and if yes, creates a new <code>SingeltonValue</code>:</p>
<pre>public class SingeltonWithDataRace {
 SingeltonValue instance;
 public SingeltonValue instance() {
  if (instance == null) {
   instance = new SingeltonValue();
  }
  return instance;
 }
}</pre>
<p>SingeltonValue sets the variable <code>initialized</code> to true in the constructor:</p>
<pre>public class SingeltonValue {
 boolean initialized;
 public SingeltonValue() {
  initialized = true;
 }
}</pre>
<p>Since we always first write to the variable <code>initialized</code> and then to <code>instance</code>, the variable <code>initialized</code> should always  be true. If I run this test on my development machine, an Intel i5 4 core CPU, I see the following results.</p>
<pre>  Observed state   Occurrences              Expectation
            1, 1      52368551               ACCEPTABLE</pre>
<p>So as expected the variable <code>initialized</code> is always true. Running the same test on an ARM AWS Graviton Processor with 2 vpus gives the following results:</p>
<pre>  Observed state   Occurrences              Expectation
            0, 0             0                FORBIDDEN
            0, 1             7   ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING
            1, 0            14   ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING
            1, 1    57,117,820               ACCEPTABLE</pre>
<p>On ARM the variable <code>initialized</code> is sometimes false, the state 0 1 and 1 0. So on ARM the write to <code>instance</code> and to <code>initialized</code> can be reordered, when we read the variables from a different thread. Why?</p>

<p>CPU Cores cache the values from the main memory in caches. This bridges the gap between the fast core and the slower memory system. A read from the level 1 cache is about 200 times faster than a read from the main memory.</p>
<pre>L1 cache reference      0.5 ns
Branch mispredict         5 ns
L2 cache reference        7 ns    14x L1 cache
Main memory reference 	100 ns    20x L2 cache, 200x L1 cache</pre>
<p>From <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">jboner/latency.txt</a></p>
<p>The result of the test is the effect of this cache system. The behavior of the cache system is specified in a memory model. A memory model answers the question: What happens when multiple threads access the same memory location?</p>
<p>The two processor types have different memory models. The ARM memory model allows the reordering of two writes to different memory locations. And the x86 memory model forbids this. This is the reason why the test leads to different results on the different processor architectures.</p>
<p>Other reorderings like read and write to different memory locations are allowed by both memory models.</p>

<p>The following test shows this. Again we use two methods annotated with <code>@Actor</code>. The two methods run in different threads during the test. The first method writes to the field <code>first</code> and reads from the field <code>second</code>. The second method writes to the field <code>second</code> and reads from the field <code>first</code>:</p>
<pre>public class TestReorderReadWrite {
 private int first;
 private int second;
 @Actor
 public void actor1(II_Result r) {
  first = 1;
  r.r1 = second;
 }
 @Actor
 public void actor2(II_Result r) {
  second = 1;
  r.r2 = first;
 }
}</pre>
<p>And here are the results from a test run on my development machine, an Intel i5 4 core CPU:</p>
<pre>  Observed state   Occurrences              Expectation
            0, 0     5,688,756   ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING
            0, 1    46,185,263               ACCEPTABLE
            1, 0    26,244,626               ACCEPTABLE
            1, 1            86               ACCEPTABLE</pre>
<p>Here is the result from the ARM AWS Graviton Processor with 2 vpus:</p>
<pre>  Observed state   Occurrences              Expectation                                  
            0, 0     5,361,697   ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING                      
            0, 1    55,586,568               ACCEPTABLE           
            1, 0    25,740,292               ACCEPTABLE          
            1, 1             4               ACCEPTABLE</pre>
<p>Sometimes both method reads the default value zero. This means that the read and the write to the variables were reordered.</p>

<p>If we want to write meaningful multi-threaded programs we need a way to tell the processor that he should stop reordering. At least at specific points. The processor provides memory barriers for that. If we annotate the field with a volatile variable the JVM generates memory barriers. Here is the assembler code from my development machine, an Intel i5 4 core CPU:</p>
<pre>movl    $0x1,0xc(%r10)    ;*putfield first
lock addl $0x0,(%rsp)     : Memory Barrier
mov     0x10(%r10),%edx   ;*getfield second                                   </pre>
<p>The JVM inserts the statement <code>lock addl</code>. This makes sure that read and writes do not get reordered.</p>

<p>When we write Java we do not write for a specific processor architecture. So Java also needs a memory model. A memory model which answers the question, what happens when multiple threads access the same memory location, for Java.</p>
<p>The answer is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.3">If a program has no data races, then all executions of the program will appear to be sequentially consistent.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sequential consistency means that reads and writes are not reordered. A run of a multi-threaded program is simply one specific interleaving of the source code statements of the different threads.</p>
<p>A Java program is only sequential consistent when it does not contains data races. A data race is a read and a write or two writes to the same memory location which is not ordered by synchronization actions. Synchronization actions like the read and write from a volatile field create an order between multiple threads, the happens-before order. For example the write to a volatile variable happens-before all subsequent volatile reads from this variable. And if all memory accesses can be ordered through this happens-before relation our program is data race free.</p>

<p>The processor core is not the only system that reorders statements. The compiler also reorders statements to improve the performance. Therefore we need a memory model at the language level. Only we, the programmers, can tell how our program needs to be ordered.<br>
But we do not control at which hardware or JVM our program runs on, so we need a way to specify this order in the program code. We do this by the synchronization actions of the Java Memory Model.</p>
<p><img src="https://vmlens.com/img/articles/cp/systemsReordering.png"></p>
<p>Typical suspects for reordering our program are the processor and the JVM compiler, which compiles the bytecode to machine code.</p>

<p>Sarita V. Adve and  Hans-J. Boehm give a nice overview of the reasoning which led to the Java Memory Model in the paper, <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/8/96610-memory-models-a-case-for-rethinking-parallel-languages-and-hardware/fulltext">Memory Models: A Case For Rethinking Parallel Languages and Hardware</a>. And Aleksey Shipilёv, the developer of the tool JCstress, has written <a href="https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/close-encounters-of-jmm-kind/">a comprehensive blog post over the Java Memory Model.</a> And Paul E. Mckenney  gives a detailed view of the cache system in the paper, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.152.5245">Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers</a></p>

<p>As we have two writes to different variables can only be reordered on ARM CPUs, while it is forbidden on x86 CPUs. The reordering of reading and writing from different variables can be reordered on both CPU types.</p>
<p>When I first read about the Java Memory Model in the book <a href="https://jcip.net/">Java Concurrency in Practice, from Brian Goetz et al.</a> I did not understand it. It took long for me to accept that we need to tell the JVM how memory reads and writes should be ordered. So I am happy that we have now another system, ARM,  which reorders read and writes. And that we can write small Java programs that demonstrate that we need the Java Memory Model.</p>

<p>Microsoft has been in negotiations with TikTok for several weeks and is looking to acquire the social media application for as much as $50 billion. If the acquisition should go ahead despite the complications associated with such a deal, it will likely be one of the largest tech acquisitions to date and carry significant implications for Microsoft’s positioning against its Big Tech competitors. Until TikTok, Microsoft, when compared to Google and Facebook, did not have an avenue to leverage or tap into the internet’s social media revolution. The question, however, remains, despite four decades of exemplary performance as an enterprise service provider, how will Microsoft integrate TikTok into its ecosystem to either augment its existing proposition or create new avenues for value creation?</p>



<p>Assuming the negotiations result in a deal, two potential trajectories emerge for Microsoft in taking TikTok forward. TikTok can be appended to the enterprise and consumer product line Microsoft presently carries, largely acting as an independent entity like Xbox or it can be spun out as a product hub of its own. The decision will hinge on Microsoft’s plans for its future in the consumer sector, with one of the fastest growing consumer reach platforms in the world in its arsenal, Microsoft could springboard off the TikTok deal to become one of the decades unlikeliest Facebook competitors.</p>



<h3>Can TikTok help Microsoft replicate its enterprise success in consumer products?</h3>



<p>Over four decades now Microsoft has been synonymous with enterprise success. Their suite of enterprise products across software, cloud and infrastructure have formed a formidable ecosystem which the company has leveraged to create loyalty amongst its enterprise user base. The Microsoft model of utilising its software touchpoints with companies to onboard other services like cloud and infrastructure products has allowed it to successfully operate without much innovation over the last few years. In its enterprise suite of products the interdependencies are clear and the feedback loop from one to the other forms a convincing argument for why enterprise customers should continue to onboard more and more Microsoft products as they themselves scale and change. Microsoft heavily leans into this advantage, the most recent example being its introduction of Teams. Teams saw very quick adoption amid the pandemic particularly provided its ability to complement other Microsoft enterprise products.</p>



<p>Despite the pervasive reach of the Windows OS into consumer lives, Microsoft has not as successfully created interdependencies across its consumer products. While it offers Microsoft 365 for consumers, this hasn’t been able to strengthen consumer ties to the ecosystem as well as the company was able to in the enterprise sector. Its consumer focused products have not seen similar interdependent success, as it struggles to leverage its consumer relationship to further its ambitions concerning cloud (One Drive), the gaming ecosystem (Xbox) or its search engine (Bing). With the acquisition of TikTok, the question is will social media provide the means to create an interdependent ecosystem that will flush value across Microsoft’s consumer products?</p>



<p>TikTok is bringing with it what most would describe as social capital, user-generated content and access to a new and younger consumer base. These seem like very valuable assets for Microsoft to absorb and flush its ecosystem with stronger consumer touchpoints. It’s important to note that, in this deal, the most important asset Microsoft is acquiring is the consumer base. TikTok users’ unique characteristics of consumption on the platform revolve around a high turn-over rate of content and rapid cycles of endorphin release. Even though a user spends hours on the application, they cycle through the content bank every 1 – 60 seconds placing their rate of consumption at incredibly high levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A consumer base engaged in this mode of discretionary high-rate of consumption is at odds with the characteristics of the consumers that utilise Microsoft’s other consumer products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it might appear as though the Xbox ecosystem and its users are best aligned with TikTok’s platform, the consumption rate that the physical product of Xbox and the consumption of games represents is still at odds with the TikTok form of consumption. For example, the Xbox ecosystem would have been able to create interdependencies with the likes of a consumer base represented by YouTube users, where both brands share mutual points of value creation in-game streaming and consumption of videos. Given how different TikTok is to anything Microsoft has ever owned, translating engagement and loyalty from the platform to the broader Microsoft ecosystem is not as straightforward as integrating it into a sales funnel alongside Microsoft’s other consumer products.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Microsoft’s path forward with TikTok</h3>



<p>Ultimately TikTok represents an aberration to the Microsoft consumer ecosystem, something the Microsoft team has no experience with to date. The acquisition is focused on ensuring that the value available in its consumer base isn’t dispersed to competing platforms upon being banned in the US – a powerful tool, if it is retained in it, ’s existing form and with its existing user base growth. Tiktok in and of itself is a valuable model and a lucrative platform that is already on its way to profitability. Microsoft’s best play here is to allow TikTok to run as a parallel platform and build out its social capital potential. However, with the acquisition of a consumer social media platform, Microsoft will need to be ready for the societal and regulatory burden of managing misinformation, content moderation and the perceived negative implications of social media overuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecosystems as large as Microsoft and GAFA will see the future as a digitally interconnected world where the lines will increasingly start to blur between models servicing consumers and models servicing enterprises. In many ways even now ecosystems that service both already have tenuous links that feed into each other but not explicitly taken advantage of – for e.g. Amazon’s e-commerce data moat feeds into its AI/ML capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft’s TikTok acquisition represents a future-proofing strategy rather than an immediately integratable one, in which the world’s largest tech companies will not silo their value capture into enterprise only or consumer only products. Creating interdependencies across the entire product ecosystem is a way to continually innovate and continue compounding on growth. Where Microsoft has done this with its enterprise side to an extent, TikTok and its social capital represent an avenue for true ecosystem innovation – as it matures Microsoft will have more leeway to morph it alongside its own evolution.</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Ecosystems: broadening the locus of value creation</h3>



<p>The pervasive use of the term ‘ecosystem’ to describe business models is a deviation from primary business theory which focuses on supply and value chains to elucidate organizational models. The term ‘ecosystem’ and the stream of research around its related characteristics and modelling is a telling phenomenon of the internet driven transformation of organisations towards greater degrees of connectivity. Kapoor writing for the Journal of Organization Design, explores the usefulness of ecosystem-based theorizing and the tenets that differentiate an ecosystem based perspective from that of value-chains, supply chains, alliances and networks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Simply put, an ecosystem encompasses a set of actors that contribute to the focal offer’s user value proposition.</p>



<p>… Value creation in an ecosystem is enabled by the presence of complementarities and interdependencies between actors, whose offers contribute to the focal offer’s user value proposition.</p>



<p>… Interdependencies represent a structural relationship between actors in terms of how their offers are connected for the value to be created.”</p>



<p>Kapoor goes on to point out that the ‘locus’ or what we would understand as the central point of integration in an ecosystem is a wholly separate construct to that of the ‘scope’ of integration. Where the scope is the reach into the ecosystem that can be attained through integration into that ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The locus of integration is an ecosystem-level construct that is based on the flow of inputs and outputs in an ecosystem, and the integrator is an actor that bundles inputs. Hence, the integrator has decision rights over the downstream bundling of different offers that are produced upstream with an ecosystem.”</p>



<p>“In contrast, the scope of integration is a firm-level construct that is based on the production of different offers within an ecosystem. An important strategic choice for a firm in an ecosystem is whether to expand its scope and produce different offers that underlie the focal offer’s value proposition”</p>



<p>Kapoor further posits that characterizing ecosystems in terms of what is connected to what within both the supply and demand sides of the ecosystem’s architecture presents three avenues of further inquiry and exploration. These avenues are necessary to both understand and design for maximizing value output from ecosystems.</p>



<p><strong>1. Bottlenecks&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“In an ecosystem, bottlenecks are component offers in the ecosystem whose performance, cost, or scarcity constrains the focal offer’s value proposition, thereby limiting its demand or growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>… The technological architecture can also create system-level interactions between the different components such that an improvement in one component can exacerbate or mitigate the constraints imposed by other components.”</p>

<p>This guide covers timeless ideas that are helpful to keep in mind while working with
systems where performance matters. Many of these ideas are fairly “durable”
and will apply regardless of what hardware, programming language, operating
system, or decade you are working in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for follow-up articles that will drill into hardware and
more Rust-specific techniques.</p>

<p>There’s some foul language in here. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast</li>
  <li>only do things that are necessary for correctness and safety</li>
  <li>your engineers will burn out, leave your team, and relentlessly shit talk you
if they don’t make their code pretty and low-friction to work with</li>
  <li>align all latency-throughput queuing positions for everything in the
serial dependency graph, or you will get worst-of-all-worlds
latency-throughput behavior, increasing latency and lowering throughput</li>
  <li>if something necessary can be done in the background without blocking,
queue it up for eventual batch processing to improve cache performance</li>
  <li>look at allocation lifetime using DHAT, avoid short-lived allocations
and ensure that long-lived allocations employ time-space trade-offs
that consume plentiful resources instead of scarce ones where possible</li>
  <li>seriously, it’s always your fault if your engineers quit.</li>
  <li>performance happens naturally when engineers love the codebase and they
are aware of which parts of the system can be sped up</li>
  <li>before wasting time optimizing things that don’t matter, we can easily test
whether optimizing could be useful at all by adding delays or deleting
relevant code to see what the impact of infinite optimization would be</li>
  <li>by default your machine will randomly change your cpu frequency, yank
processes across cores and sockets, and generally make measurements
deceptive and non-reproducible. we can control this behavior. if you
don’t account for this behavior, your measurements are not sound justifications
for code changes</li>
  <li>wait, why does an executive care about performance, anyway?</li>

<p>Ok, now that the executives are gone, it is time to party.</p>

<p>Let’s put on some nice music.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Let it out.</p>

<p>The year is 2020. and we are utterly fucked.</p>

<p>Supposedly we are here reading this article because we “like computers” or
something but let’s be clear about one thing - you’re not here because of that.
I know. You know. We all know. You couldn’t give two fried pennies about
computers if they didn’t help you feel the things you so desperately need to
feel.</p>

<p>You’re here, ultimately, because of control. Your entire life is entombed
in an elaborate, entirely abstract labyrinth of machines that define so
many aspects of every moment of your waking life. You’re here to better
understand the prison you find yourself within. You’re here to sympathize
with the machine.</p>

<p>While you will only seep ever more deeply into this morass of gold and glass,
you have the power to turn your captors into familiar friends. You have the
power to make the machines into the only friends you will ever need. You are
here to abandon the organic and the analogue. There is nothing for you on the
other side of your window. As you lounge (please fix your posture now) in your
designated quarantine pit, gazing listlessly into the LED mesh while biding
your time, I invite you to join me - your newest simulated human experience -
on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure into the bowels of the machine through which
you experience joy and place orders for more toilet paper.</p>

<p>It begins today.</p>

<p>This guide contains basic information for getting started with
performance-sensitive engineering. I think most folks will learn something new.
I know I have. And, part of why I wrote this is to have a single place with a
memorable URL where I can return to when I forget most of this stuff. More
importantly, when I unfurl fiery screeds in random internet comments I want to
have an intimidating reference to which I can mercilesly link.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this guide for the Rust ecosystem, where many people are now
trying their hands at optimization for the first time. But nearly all of this document
applies to general programming, with a few of the hardware effects mentioned
being specific to x86 and ARM circa 2020. Linux is assumed, because that’s
what the overwhelming majority of server workloads run today.</p>

<p>This guide brings together ideas from systems engineering, systems theory,
psychology, hardware, queuing theory, statistics, economics,
distributed systems, concurrency and philosophy of science with the goals of
helping you to be less of an asshole and write code that tends to improve
the metrics you care about.</p>

<p>Performance is about being thoughtful about the metrics that matter to us and
allowing ourselves to be aware of them while making decisions.</p>

<p>These materials are based on Tyler Neely’s Rust workshop content, and have been

<h2 id="principles">principles</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose
reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive biases.

You just are cognitive biases.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Rationality-An-Introduction">- Luke Muehlhauser, via R:AZ</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is that our minds are pure shit and everything we
know is wrong. We must accept our fallibility before embarking down the path to
fast-as-fuck machinery.</p>

<p>We build towers of assumptions that are bound to specific contexts, and when the
conditions that caused us to form these beliefs change, we tend not to revisit
the now-invalidated beliefs. Cache invalidation is hard when we are so rarely
aware of the dependency graphs of what we believe.</p>

<p>So, we measure. Even when we’re convinced that we’re right. Because we are
always out of sync with reality, and we are fundamentally incapable of altering
this fact. But we can be responsible in the face of that.</p>

<p>Corollary: allow yourself to be wrong. Allowing yourself to be wrong with
yourself, your collaborators, and in public is a key optimization for learning
faster and building better things with less effort and in less time.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, machines tend to be somewhat amenable to measurement. We built
them that way. Indeed, constructing them to be somewhat measurable in the first
place was the only way we were able to assemble them at all despite our
innumerable shortcomings. We took the predecessor to your current machine,
chose some metrics to improve, made a huge number of mistakes while continuing
to measure, and occasionally we got lucky: the metrics we cared about improved
enough to alter production lines, crystallizing our occasionally successful
results into new production processes that eventually put your machine in front
of you.</p>

<p>We must measure.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that real programs on real hardware see real
improvements in relevant metrics like total cost of ownership, responsiveness,
etc… If a metric doesn’t help a human, it’s just a vanity pursuit that may
make the important metrics worse due to under-investment.</p>

<p>We must select our measurements with care. Our time is precious.</p>

<p>By making decisions that are considerate of available data, we are able to cut
through so much bullshit. We have so many ideas that our experience tells us
should cause our code to improve, but it simply isn’t true when we actually
measure. Code changes that made your Java, C++, Haskell or JS programs faster
may not make Rust any faster. Don’t make Rust code ugly just because some
program you wrote in the 90s worked better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">manual loop
unrolling</a>. Compilers change,
in many ways for the better.</p>

<p>Don’t be macho. Make decisions while having real data on-hand and limit the
damage of hubris.</p>

<h2 id="e-prime-and-precise-language">e-prime and precise language</h2>

<p>So many aspects of performance-critical engineering can be highly contextual
and may vary wildly from one machine to another. It helps to avoid the verb
“to be” and its conjugations “is”, “are” etc… when describing observations.</p>

<p>When we say something “is” something else, we are casually equating two
similar things for convenience purposes, and we are lying to some extent.
By avoiding false equivalences (usually easily spotted through use of “is”, “are” etc…)
we can both communicate more precisely and we can allow ourselves to reason
about complexity far more effectively. Situations that may seem completely
ambiguous when described using “to be” phrases are often quite unambiguous
when taking care to avoid false equivalences. This general form of speech
is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t say “lock-free queues are faster than mutex-backed queues”, say “on
hardware H with T threads running in tight loops performing operations O, our
specific lock-free queue has been measured to achieve a latency distribution of
X1 and our specicific mutex-backed queue has been measured to achieve a latency
distribution of X2.” It’s likely your lock-free queue will sometimes perform
worse than a well-made mutex-backed queue given certain hardware, contention
and many other factors. What does “perform worse” even …</p></section></div>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <p>In this piece I would like to describe a practice I adopted a few years ago, after seeing how effectively colleagues were applying it. The idea of what I will call <em>structured debugging</em> is very simple: Document every step of the debugging effort of a complicated bug in an interactive environment in such a way that your thought process and deductions can be followed and verified. Despite its usefulness, simplicity and effectivenes, I see structured debugging practiced rarely. It helped me with complex bugs on multiple occasions, especially in distributed applications, and also leads to artefacts that have value on their own, independent of the debugging.</p>

<p>The first step of structured debugging is figuring out where to document your progress. If you are happy working with the bug tracker that is at your disposal, you can document your work as comments on the bug ticket. If you prefer working in your editor, as I do, I would advise you to create a markdown file named after the ID of the bug. When you want to quickly switch to this buffer, you can use the bug ID, and once you are done, or want to notify others of your work-in-progress, you can copy-paste the contents. Every half decent bug tracker out there accepts markdown input these days; by editing the report in your editor as markdown, you will have best of both worlds, with local shortcuts and utilities, in addition to clickable links and decent formatting for code snippets etc.</p>

<p>Once you have picked out the documentation environment, you should start proceeding in a systematic way. This can be done in the standard debug loop (gather information, set up conjectures, test them, repeat). What you want to achieve iterating over this loop is a <em>reproducible narrative</em>: Document each of the steps in such a way that any other developer with acquintence to the code base can open the ticket, follow through the comments and repeat any commands, arriving at the same conclusions as you do. When gathering information, it is common to make use of SQL queries, for example, or even simple scripts that join data from multiple sources. You should gather all of these in your report, together with the results at the point you ran them. One nice side effect of making this information available in a nice form is that you can take the time to make them as informative and simple as possible, for example by using joins instead of multiple queries in SQL. In order to gather information from your colleagues, you can tag them in the bug ticket, so that they can write their responses there, enriching the bug hunt.</p>

<p>The most relevant source of information in debugging live systems is logs. In the old days, web application logs were stored either as text files on servers, rotated and zipped regularly, or piped to syslog. Both made accessing these in a linkable form problematic. More recently, however, dedicated systems for log analysis have become more and more widely used. These all (or nearly all; CloudWatch doesn't allow linking to a single line) have means for linking to individual lines, time windows or the results of specific queries. Instead of just copy-pasting the relevant log lines, or in addition to that, consider using these links. Any readers can open these links and try alternative searches. Another important source of information for especially complicated bugs is diagrams for explaining workflows, relationships or complex constellations. Timeline of events, for example can be explained using sequence diagrams, which are much better than convoluted text. When the difficulty of the bug warrants it, these are a great addition to the narrative.</p>

<p>Structured debugging can cause significant extra work, but it has major benefits. Most importantly, the end result will leave little doubt as to anything was missed. The conclusions you derive will not be based on conjectures and assumptions, but concrete data and tooling, open for everyone to read and verify. Furthermore, the artefacts resulting from structured debugging are valuable on their own. Not only once did I see the tools used in such debugging actually getting incorporated into internal products, such as SQL queries turned into internal web pages &amp; reports, or Kibana searches that were added to dashboards as graphs. In case the bug proves tougher than you thought, or something more important comes in between, the report will prove invaluable: Once it's taken up again, you or anyone else can read it, and easily take off from where you left. Last but not least, this method will make it visible to the team what gaps in visibility and diagnostics exist, making analyzing and linking the whole system harder or incomplete.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starlight lets you Google something quickly, so you don't have to ruin your workflow by opening your browser.</p>
<p>As it stands, to quickly google something while coding / working on a doc, you need to:</p>
<p>Open Browser → Google → Search → Click Result → Scan website → Back → Click Result → Scan Website .... you get the point</p>
<p>With Starlight, it's as simple as pressing ⌘+Esc and searching.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/KqMG9YC/Screen-Shot-2020-08-08-at-5-23-47-AM.png" alt="Image"></p><p>Google results appear on the left, while websites are loaded on the right. Use F/D to go through results on the left, and J/K to scroll the corresponding site on the right.</p>
<p>No more clicking back / forth, extraneous tabs etc. 🤮</p>
<p>Shortcuts:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hy9z1v3/Screen-Shot-2020-08-08-at-6-55-16-AM.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>I built Starlight last Monday out of pure necessity while working on
<a href="https://fitnessai.com/">FitnessAI</a>, and haven't stopped using it since. I don't even code with a browser open anymore. I shared it with a few friends and everyone seems to love it, so I thought I would share it here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>I’ve been coding websites for a long time but even I was a little puzzled when I came across a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21617580" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hacker News comment</a> where the commenter described their own makeshift CMS that involves using your own file system. The most interesting part to me was when the person said they <strong>add CSS to pages on their personal projects by means of HTTP headers.</strong></p><p>I had heard of this technique before and the person does say in the comment that this doesn’t work in every browser. But I decided to do some research to figure out how one might do this and why this would be easier than just dropping in one or more <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements in the HTML.</p><p>I’m sure many of you who have been developing sites for more some time now are familiar with this. But I thought I’d write it up for those looking for a quick solution. This should especially be helpful because this apparently isn’t the easiest topic to search for since the terms “HTTP” and “header” are quite common in web development (and due to the fact that Google search has sucked for many years now).</p><p>Before getting to the actual solution, let’s take a brief look at how to add HTTP headers in general. You can put a line like the following in your website’s (or directory’s) .htaccess file (assuming you’re on an Apache server):</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Header add Header-Name "parameter=value"</span></p></pre></div><p>This uses <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Apache’s <strong>Header</strong> directive</a>. The part inside the quotes is a parameter/value pair that works as the value for that specific header.</p><p>To demonstrate, I’ll do the following, which creates a custom header:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Header add Funky-Music "getdownand=boogie"</span></p></pre></div><p>This is just a header that I made up. You can also add any <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">valid HTTP header</a>, assuming you use the correct syntax. You also have the option to use the <strong>set</strong> argument instead of <strong>add</strong>, which will overwrite the header if it already exists. There are other arguments you can use, described in the aforementioned apache.org doc.</p><p>I’ve set up a <a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/http-header/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">demo directory</a> and I’ve added an .htaccess file to that directory, along with a basic HTML file called index.html. When you load up that page in your browser, you can see the headers that the server responds with by viewing the Network tab in the browser’s developer tools:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/481d3bf643bb9c65ac0d2ecf7aff4682/28eab/35e80182b2594c27805d057448c89677.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/481d3bf643bb9c65ac0d2ecf7aff4682/28eab/35e80182b2594c27805d057448c89677.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" alt="Custom Header"></p><p>In Firefox it looks like this:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/144ee440200e1a9a4b6799d05da731ec/28eab/0327e8af8080447480a8fb2476ae4d06.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/144ee440200e1a9a4b6799d05da731ec/28eab/0327e8af8080447480a8fb2476ae4d06.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" alt="Custom Header Firefox"></p><p>In both cases you can see the custom header that I added. You can also see any other headers that are added by default.</p><p>That’s a fairly basic summary of adding HTTP headers, including adding custom headers. For a more thorough discussion of the topic, check out <a href="https://htaccessbook.com/add-custom-headers-htaccess/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this post by Jeff Starr</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/http-header/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CUSTOM HEADER DEMO -&gt;</a></p><p>Now that you have a basic idea of how to add HTTP headers, let’s take a look at how to add a stylesheet via the same method. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/styles.html#h-14.6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The W3C’s HTML4 spec</a> has some info on how to do this, however it notes:</p><blockquote><p>This section only applies to user agents conforming to versions of HTTP that define a Link header field. Note that HTTP 1.1 as defined by <!-- -->[RFC2616]<!-- --> does not include a Link header field.</p></blockquote><p>According to my testing, the only current desktop browser that supports this feature is Firefox. The only mobile browser that I could find that supports this is Opera Mini (tested on iPad). This leads me to believe that pre-WebKit Opera supported the feature.</p><p>Nonetheless, to add CSS using an HTTP header, you can put the following line in your .htaccess file:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Header add Link "&lt;style.css&gt;;rel=stylesheet;media=all"</span></p></pre></div><p>The syntax is the same as that for the custom header I added previously, and basically the same syntax as when adding any HTTP headers, custom or not.</p><p>In this case, I’m using <code>Link</code> as the name of the header. This is what tells a supporting browser that I want to add a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element to my page. The value for the header consists of:</p><ul><li>The URL of the stylesheet inside angle brackets</li><li>Attribute/value pairs separated by semi-colons</li></ul><p>The quotes around the full value are optional if the value doesn’t contain spaces. If it does, then the quotes are mandatory for correct parsing.</p><p>So the above header would be equivalent to adding the following to the HTML:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>link</span><span> </span><span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>stylesheet</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>style.css</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>media</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>all</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>The <code>href</code> value can of course be relative or absolute. And, as you probably figured out, this isn’t just for CSS but for anything that can be added using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HTML’s <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element</a>.</p><p>I’ve set up <a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/http-header-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">another demo page</a> that adds some CSS using the <code>Link header</code>. As mentioned, you’ll have to view it in Firefox to see it work. View the HTTP headers in the Network tab of the developer tools, and you’ll see the stylesheet included:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/5d2494481deccafe52b679057432e645/28eab/617ce98f2fbc490e9d13d22ec933d9ed.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/5d2494481deccafe52b679057432e645/28eab/617ce98f2fbc490e9d13d22ec933d9ed.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" alt="Link Header"></p><p>Viewing a Link HTTP Header in Firefox</p><p>Try viewing source on the page itself. You’ll see there’s no CSS file in the source, but the styles are there if you inspect each element. The header will be visible in the Network tab of any browser, but the CSS will only work in Firefox or another browser that supports the <code>Link</code> HTTP header.</p><p><a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/http-header-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CSS HEADER DEMO -&gt;</a></p><p>From what I can see, the <code>Link</code> header is not a deprecated or obsolete feature, it’s just not well supported. It’s confusing to try to figure out if this is still considered a valid web feature, but here’s what I’ve uncovered:</p><p>MDN has an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">article on it</a> and doesn’t indicate that it’s obsolete (though the browser support section is missing).
The <code>Link Header</code> is described in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288#section-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IETF’s RFC 8288</a>, which I believe is the latest proposed standard for “Web Linking”.
As the HTML4 spec mentions, the last version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HTTP 1.1 spec</a> doesn’t include it, whereas the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HTTP2 spec</a> seems to mention the <code>Link</code> header in passing.</p><p>With so little browser support, it’s hard to justify any use for this other than novelty. As the user on Hacker News said, personal projects can be fun because you can do whatever you want, including using a feature that apparently more than 90% of your users won’t see.</p><p>I suppose if you have a lot of HTML pages and you’re not using any kind of back-end scripting or includes, then maybe the best solution is using the <code>Link</code> header. But the fact that it’s so poorly supported doesn’t make it very attractive, personal project or not.</p><p>At this point, the only thing I can think of that could justify use for this in production is as a way to include some Firefox-only CSS, which <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2009/01/22/using-http-headers-to-serve-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Eric Meyer mentions</a> as a possibility in an old post on this subject. But it’s not guaranteed to always only work in Firefox, so that’s still a problem.</p><p>Do with this what you like, but it’s extremely unlikely that this will have any use in a real project. I just thought it would be fun to mess around with it and write it up.</p><div><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://asayer-content.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/89dc00ab92b9450a9c01853f291866c5.jpg"></p></div><p>This article was originally published on <a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/adding-css-to-a-page-via-http-headers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Impressive Webs</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Managers are responsible for partnering with reports to grow their career. This growth should be primarily facilitated by the work that is given to the report. This growth should not be primarily facilitated by “extracurriculars.” Let’s dive into some details.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of ways people can grow skill-sets: the work the business needs or extracurriculars. Extracurriculars are things that are not (or are not in service of accomplishing) a priority for the business. Extracurriculars commonly include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading a book</li>
  <li>Doing side projects</li>
  <li>Taking an online class</li>
  <li>Going to meetups</li>
  <li>Going to conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies should to the best of their ability support people who want to do these things. However, it’s a common anti-pattern for managers (and reports, and companies) to treat these activities as primary drivers of growth. There’s a couple main reasons why people intuitively lean on extracurriculars when trying to drive growth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The alternative to extracurriculars is having people take on work that stretches their ability/skill set, which is less efficient for the business. Stated otherwise: extracurriculars are perceived as 0-risk to the business.</li>
  <li>Interests are confused with growth. Instead of finding ways to strategically grow in a role and in the company, people start growth conversations from “what kind of stuff are you interested in?”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Extracurriculars-as-growth has some major problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The machinery of the company is not set up to hold you accountable to actual delivery of extracurriculars. Nobody ever got a raise because they read a book. Nobody ever got fired because they didn’t read a book. It’s very common to see  extracurricular tasks in growth plans only to never be followed up on.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are usually done off the clock. Companies often don’t make time for people to actually do that work and it’s implicit that the report needs to find time to do both those things and their regular work. Company-driven growth should be done nearly exclusively on the company’s time. Because homework is often not a priority, the company often doesn’t support it being done on the clock, and this - appropriately, obviously - leads to conflict. Expecting homework from an employee isn’t fair.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are often interest-based, not growth-based. So the work often doesn’t translate into any meaningful increase in impact at the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so extracurriculars-as-growth is bad. Let’s fix it. It’s easy - skills should be grown via work the business needs. The company supports that work and holds people accountable to doing it. That growth will be directly in-line with what the company needs. And growing via that work will also actually deliver impact in a way that gets you rewards.</p>

<p>Like eating your vegetables or daily exercise - it sounds easy, but putting this into practice can be difficult. In fact, getting it done is a major culture shift. You have to build a culture that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is willing to invest in people at the cost of optimal delivery in the short term.</li>
  <li>Trusts people to fail. The other main anti-pattern is to give people a chance and then pull them out of the critical path the minute they make a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>August 10, 2020<!-- --> <span>—<!-- --> <a href="https://healeycodes.com/tags/python">Python</a></span></p></header><section><p>I wanted to learn more about web analytics so I budgeted myself a few hours and built a toy analytics system.</p>
<p>The goal was to collect information about page views in a <em>privacy focused</em> manner so that no GDPR notice is required. With that in mind, I made these decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Events on a website aren’t attributed to a particular user (no reading or setting cookies)</li>
<li>No personally-identifying information is stored on disk</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should be able to be used on a third-party host (e.g. GitHub Pages) and the alterations to an existing codebase should be minimal i.e. including a HTML snippet. The web server that captures the tracking requests can be hosted on anything that runs Flask.</p>
<p>The following analytics should be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>What pages users visit</li>
<li>Where users are referred from</li>
<li>What browsers and screen sizes are used</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tracking-pixels"><a href="#tracking-pixels" aria-label="tracking pixels permalink"></a>Tracking Pixels</h2>
<p>A page view can be captured by sending a request to the analytics server. This happens when a browser loads an image. By including an 1x1 transparent image (a tracking pixel) we can initiate this request.</p>
<p>I implemented two methods, one that works with JavaScript enabled and one that works without.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamically add an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with the data encoded in the search parameters of the URL</li>
<li>(In the case of no JavaScript) Render an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with the path and title in the search parameters of the URL</li>
</ul>
<p>They are toggled by the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> pattern.</p>
<p>We’ll get some data from the search parameters and the rest from the request’s headers. Here’s the HTML snippet that includes both methods.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>

<p>When the user’s browser has JavaScript disabled there is far less information available. For either solution, the user’s country and their browser information can be captured on the analytics server.</p>
<h2 id="serving-the-gif"><a href="#serving-the-gif" aria-label="serving the gif permalink"></a>Serving The GIF</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a Flask application that serves a tracking pixel.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>

<span>import</span> base64
<span>from</span> flask <span>import</span> Flask<span>,</span> Response
app <span>=</span> Flask<span>(</span>__name__<span>)</span>


<span>@app<span>.</span>route</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>index</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>return</span> render_template<span>(</span><span>"index.html"</span><span>)</span>


<span>@app<span>.</span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/pixel.gif'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>pixel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    
    gif <span>=</span> base64<span>.</span>b64decode<span>(</span>
        <span>'R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP8AAP8AACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=='</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> Response<span>(</span>gif<span>,</span> mimetype<span>=</span><span>"image/gif"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can be run by exporting the <code>FLASK_APP</code> variable:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>
<span>export</span> <span>FLASK_APP</span><span>=</span>analytics.py
flask run</code></pre></div>
<p>The first time I loaded the test page, I ran into a <code>net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT</code> error in the console. My tracking pixel was blocked by my own ad blocker. Perhaps it’s allergic to 1x1 images.</p>
<p>After toggling my ad blocker, the Flask logs showed that the information we want is being sent, and also that we responded with a 200 status code.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>"GET /pixel.gif?path=%2F&amp;title=Analytics%20Test%20Page&amp;referrer=&amp;resolution=1920%2C1080 HTTP/1.1"</span> <span>200</span> -</code></pre></div>
<p>By using the search parameters object, URL encoding (also known as percent-encoding) was used automatically. For example, <code>%2F</code> decodes to <code>/</code>. You can read more about the reasoning behind this type of encoding in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/std66#page-12">URI Generic Syntax</a> RFC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A percent-encoded octet is encoded as a character triplet, consisting of the percent character ”%” followed by the two hexadecimal digits representing that octet’s numeric value. For example, “%20” is the percent-encoding for the binary octet “00100000” (ABNF: %x20), which in US-ASCII corresponds to the space character (SP).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="anonymizing-user-data"><a href="#anonymizing-user-data" aria-label="anonymizing user data permalink"></a>Anonymizing User Data</h2>
<p>Depending on how your application is deployed you may have a reverse-proxy server before the request reaches Flask. So <code>request.remote_addr</code> might describe a local address. The reverse-proxy server will usually add the user’s IP address to the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header. We can check for that with a fallback to <code>request.remote_addr</code>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>ip <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>headers<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>'X-Forwarded-For'</span><span>,</span> request<span>.</span>remote_addr<span>)</span>
user_agent <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>user_agent<span>.</span>string</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>User-Agent</code> header describes the device. For Chrome it looks something like this: <code>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36</code>. Some mobiles also add the firmware version. We don’t want to keep this, or an IP address, on file because both pieces can be identifiable information which would require a GDPR notice.</p>
<p>Rather than keeping the exact <code>User-Agent</code> we can strip away the information that’s most important to us — browser and major version.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
user_agent <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>user_agent<span>.</span>browser <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> \
    request<span>.</span>user_agent<span>.</span>version<span>.</span>split<span>(</span><span>'.'</span><span>)</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Converting an IP address to a country is a little harder. A simple solution is to use a free geolocation API but shipping IP addresses to a third-party service isn’t exactly privacy focused. I found <a href="https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-python">GeoIP2-python</a>, a package that can be combined with a free <a href="https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/">GeoLite2 country database</a>. With this method, the geolocation happens without any user data leaving our server.</p>
<p>After downloading the database, the package can be used to get a country from an IP:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>  <span>import</span> geoip2<span>.</span>database
  
  reader <span>=</span> geoip2<span>.</span>database<span>.</span>Reader<span>(</span><span>'./GeoLite2-Country.mmdb'</span><span>)</span>
  country <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
  <span>try</span><span>:</span>
      response <span>=</span> reader<span>.</span>country<span>(</span><span>'127.0.0.1'</span><span>)</span>
      country <span>=</span> response<span>.</span>country<span>.</span>name
  <span>except</span> geoip2<span>.</span>errors<span>.</span>AddressNotFoundError<span>:</span>
      <span>pass</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We could also check for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language">Accept-Language</a> via <code>request.accept_languages</code>.</p>
<p>The rest of the page view information comes from the search parameters and we use default values to handle the case where JavaScript isn’t enabled and less information is sent.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>timestamp <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span>time<span>.</span>time<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
path <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>args<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>)</span>
title <span>=</span> request<span>.</span>args<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>'title'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>)</span>

<h2 id="storing-page-views"><a href="#storing-page-views" aria-label="storing page views permalink"></a>Storing Page Views</h2>
<p>I used <code>sqlite3</code> from the standard library to save and load this data. Normally, I’d use SQLAlchemy but for this experiment I only need two functions (save/load) and I don’t think I’ll be extending it.</p>
<p>I need to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the tracking information for a page view</li>
<li>Retrieve tracking information for a slice of time</li>
</ul>
<p>For tiny prototypes like this, a pattern I sometimes use is checking if the table exists whenever the module is imported. This aggressive check makes it easier to share this code without thinking about the database setup. The database file either exists or will be created.</p>

<h2 id="displaying-user-analytics"><a href="#displaying-user-analytics" aria-label="displaying user analytics permalink"></a>Displaying User Analytics</h2>
<p>It’s common to want to view analytics for a given time period like the previous week. So the view that displays user analytics should accept two parameters that define the start time and end time of the slice.</p>
<p>A minimal page should look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Sun Aug 2 10:32:01 2020 - Sun Aug 9 10:32:01 2020

Paths
('/', 2)

Referrers
('', 2)

Countries
('', 2)

Devices
('safari 13', 2)

Resolutions
('414x736', 2)</code></pre></div>
<p>When no parameters are passed, I chose to load all data from the beginning of time.</p>
<p>The analytics view that accomplishes all of that looks like this. <code>Counter</code> from <code>collections</code> saves a few lines of code when aggregating page views.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>@app<span>.</span>route</span><span>(</span><span>"/analytics"</span><span>)</span>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> We recently raised 1,5M euros from LocalGlobe, Seedcamp, Kima &amp; Tiny.vc. This funding will allow us to focus on building a community of early adopters &amp; contributors around our open search engine <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch">MeiliSearch</a>.</p><p>We are still at the very beginning of our open source adventure and we are thrilled to see that more and more people believe in this project. This is our first fundraise and it means the world for the Meili team 🎉</p><h3 id="meili-got-funded-">Meili got funded!</h3><p>Meili SAS (the company) was created in November of 2018 with the idea of building an alternative to existing search engine APIs like Algolia. After some successes and failures as a team and company, we decided to raise some money to keep focus on building MeiliSearch and its ecosystem.</p><p>We believe that an exceptionalsearch experience on websites and applications should be the norm, not an exclusive feature. Thus we are building the most straightforward technology for developers to offer state-of-the-art search to their users, scaling from the tiniest of operations all the way up to enterprise.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.meilisearch.com/content/images/2020/08/david-armstrong-srpE-a5W418-unsplash.jpg"></figure><h2 id="how-we-got-there">How we got there</h2><p>MeiliSearch has been open source since the <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/open-source-or-not/">earliest days</a> of its development. As developers, we made our project accessible on GitHub from day one but without the idea of being an "open source company". First and foremost we set out to make a simpler alternative to Algolia for smaller businesses who needed something more developer-friendly and affordable.</p><p>After describing our project to many developers, we quickly realize that one of the main differences from Algolia was that MeiliSearch is open source. Still we weren't using open source as a force.</p><p>In late 2019, after some substantial discussion within the team, we decided to <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/to-open-source-and-beyond/">fully commit to orienting the business around open source</a>. We could not quietly bootstrap anymore since we decided to build a community around our project to get feedback and contributions from external developers. </p><p>We wrote our <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-beta-release/">Beta release blog post</a> for MeiliSearch in November of 2019. Since then we have been working hard at making MeiliSearch the new obvious choice for developers when it comes to building a search box.</p><p>Charlotte, who joined us in August of 2019, did an incredible job of directing the writing and making of our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> while Clémentine, who joined us one month later, took charge of developing the <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs and integrations</a> to ease the use of MeiliSearch.</p><h2 id="fundraise">Fundraise</h2><p>In late 2019 we began to meet with investors because we knew we wouldn't be able to develop the business without help from industry veterans.</p><div><p>The first key meeting that we had was with <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis from Kima</a> who helped us make our pitch understandable to VCs. Alexis was presented to us as <code>THE investor who understand tech</code> in Paris. Not only did he understood what we wanted to build, he also did an amazing job at introing us to relevant funds regarding our stage &amp; business 😁 </p><p> Then from meeting to meeting we met the different persons we are now working with: <a href="https://twitter.com/mishmashkautsan?lang=en">Mish</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/knightwebb/?originalSubdomain=uk">Louis</a> from <a href="https://localglobe.vc/">LocalGlobe</a> as lead investor, <a href="https://twitter.com/siahouchangnia?lang=en">Sia</a> from <a href="https://seedcamp.com/">SeedCamp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ale6_">Alexis</a> from <a href="https://www.kimaventures.com/">Kima</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/pmoe?lang=en">Philipp</a> from <a href="https://www.tiny.vc/">Tiny.vc</a>.</p></div><p>The deal we made with the VCs is that we develop the community and the usage around MeiliSearch while we better understand the use-cases of our search engine. From there we will be able to generate revenue. <a href="https://blog.meilisearch.com/meilisearch-open-business-plan-v0-1/">Our business plan is publicly available</a> as a iteratively developed document.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><h3 id="core-features">Core features</h3><p>We made an <a href="https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/projects/2">open roadmap on GitHub</a>, and we will publish more roadmap communications in the coming weeks to get better feedback on what developers need in a search engine API.</p><p>There are some features that we know we need to build in order to be competitive as a search engine backend (basic analytics and authorization system 🚧) that are already planned. We are also discussing with developers &amp; companies to gain more insight on features that should be game-changers in the enterprise search industry!</p><h3 id="integrations-documentation">Integrations &amp; Documentation</h3><p>All of this work around MeiliSearch would not make any sense if MeiliSearch is not used. To ease the integration of MeiliSearch we are building different <a href="https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides">SDKs</a> in different languages and improving our <a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/">documentation</a> every week. </p><p>We want anyone to be able to integrate MeiliSearch in any common programming environment in less than 5 minutes. Today, with our most mature front- and back-end libraries you should be able to setup a proof-of-concept in less than an hour.

		<p><em>If you enjoy this article, please check out my free book by clicking <a href="https://deponysum.com/2020/03/30/something-to-read-in-quarantine-essays-2018-to-2020/">Here: “Something to Read in Quarantine: Essays 2018-2020.”</a></em></p>
<p id="b9a9">Natural Language Processing (NLP) per Wikipedia:</p>
<p id="34cf">“Is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.”</p>
<p id="7dd8">The field has seen tremendous advances during the recent explosion of progress in machine learning techniques.</p>
<p id="b5f8">Here are some of its more impressive recent achievements:</p>
<p id="cb15"><strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;The Winograd Schema is a test of common sense reasoning- easy for humans, but historically almost impossible for computers- which requires the test taker to indicate which noun an ambiguous pronoun stands for. The correct answer hinges on a single word, which is different between two separate versions of the question. For example:</p>
<p id="512d"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.</em></p>
<p id="ece3"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.</em></p>
<p id="0ddf">Who does the pronoun “They” refer to in each of the instances?</p>
<p id="d33c">The Winograd schema test was originally intended to be a more rigorous replacement for the Turing test, because it seems to require deep knowledge of how things fit together in the world, and the ability to reason about that knowledge in a linguistic context. Recent advances in NLP have allowed computers to achieve near human scores:(<a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/</a>).</p>
<p id="0a43"><strong>B)</strong>&nbsp;The New York Regent’s science exam is a test requiring both scientific knowledge and reasoning skills, covering an extremely broad range of topics. Some of the questions include:</p>
<p id="a36d"><em>1.Which equipment will best separate a mixture of iron filings and black pepper? (1) magnet (2) filter paper (3) triplebeam balance (4) voltmeter</em></p>
<p id="9797"><em>2. Which form of energy is produced when a rubber band vibrates? (1) chemical (2) light (3) electrical (4) sound</em></p>
<p id="966a"><em>3. Because copper is a metal, it is (1) liquid at room temperature (2) nonreactive with other substances (3) a poor conductor of electricity (4) a good conductor of heat</em></p>
<p id="6d70"><em>4. Which process in an apple tree primarily results from cell division? (1) growth (2) photosynthesis (3) gas exchange (4) waste removal</em></p>
<p id="3a8a">On the 8th grade, non-diagram based questions of the test, a program was recently able to score 90%. (&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p id="2f49"><strong>C)</strong></p>
<p id="267a">It’s not just about answer selection either. Progress in text generation has been impressive. See, for example, some of the text samples created by Megatron:&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf</a></p>
<p id="b8f7"><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p id="db13">Much of this progress has been rapid. Big progress on the Winograd schema, for example, still looked like it might be decades away back in (from memory) much of 2018. The computer science is advancing very fast, but it’s not clear our concepts have kept up.</p>
<p id="1a6c">I found this relatively sudden progress in NLP surprising. In my head- and maybe this was naive- I had thought that, in order to attempt these sorts of tasks with any facility, it wouldn’t be sufficient to simply feed a computer lots of text. Instead, any “proper” attempt to understand language would have to integrate different modalities of experience and understanding, like visual and auditory, in order to build up a full picture of how things relate to each other in the world. Only on the basis of this extra-linguistic grounding could it deal flexibly with problems involving rich meanings- we might call this the multi-modality thesis. Whether the multi-modality thesis is true for some kinds of problems or not, it’s certainly true for far fewer problems than I, and many others, had suspected.</p>
<p id="5a4d">I think science-fictiony speculations generally backed me up on this (false) hunch. Most people imagined that this kind of high-level language “understanding” would be the capstone of AI research, the thing that comes after the program already has a sophisticated extra-linguistic model of the world. This sort of just seemed obvious- a great example of how assumptions you didn’t even know you were making can ruin attempts to predict the future.</p>
<p id="f943">In hindsight it makes a certain sense that reams and reams of text alone can be used to build the capabilities needed to answer questions like these. A lot of people remind us that these programs are really just statistical analyses of the co-occurence of words, however complex and glorified. However we should not forget that the relationships between words are isomorphic to the relations between things- that isomorphism is why language works. This is to say the patterns in language use mirror the patterns of how things are(1). Models are transitive- if x models y, and y models z, then x models z. The upshot of these facts are that if you have a really good statistical model of how words relate to each other, that model is also implicitly a model of the world.</p>
<p id="12db">It might be instructive to think about what it would take to create a program which has a model of eighth grade science sufficient to understand and answer questions about hundreds of different things like “growth is driven by cell division”, and “What can magnets be used for” that wasn’t NLP led. It would be a nightmare of many different (probably handcrafted) models. Speaking somewhat loosely, language allows for intellectual capacities to be greatly compressed. From this point of view, it shouldn’t be surprising that some of the first signs of really broad capacity- common sense reasoning, wide ranging problem solving etc., have been found in language based programs- words and their relationships are just a vastly more efficient way of representing knowledge than the alternatives.</p>
<p id="1e8b">So I find myself wondering if language is not the crown of general intelligence, but a potential shortcut to it.</p>
<p id="beea"><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p id="0095">A couple of weeks ago I finished this essay, read through it, and decided it was not good enough to publish. The point about language being isomorphic to the world, and that therefore any sufficiently good model of language&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a model of the world, is important, but it’s kind of abstract, and far from original.</p>
<p id="e0e2">Then today I read&nbsp;<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this report</a>&nbsp;by Scott Alexander of having trained GPT-2 (a language program) to play chess. I realised this was the perfect example. GPT-2 has no (visual) understanding of things like the arrangement of a chess board. But if you feed it enough sequences of alphanumerically encoded games- 1.Kt-f3, d5 and so on- it begins to understand patterns in these strings of characters which are isomorphic to chess itself. Thus, for all intents and purposes, it develops a model of chess.</p>
<p id="1a14">Exactly how strong this approach is- whether GPT-2 is capable of some limited analysis, or can only overfit openings- remains to be seen. We might have a better idea as it is optimised — for example, once it is fed board states instead of sequences of moves. Either way though, it illustrates the point about isomorphism.</p>
<p id="a87a">Of course everyday language stands in a woolier relation to sheep, pine cones, desire and quarks than the formal language of chess moves stands in relation to chess moves, and the patterns are far more complex. Modality, uncertainty, vagueness and other complexities enter but the isomorphism between world and language is there, even if inexact.</p>
<p id="b6c0"><strong>Postscript- The Chinese Room Argument</strong></p>
<p id="f901">After similar arguments are made, someone usually mentions the Chinese room thought experiment. There are, I think, two useful things to say about it:</p>
<p id="3d7e">A) The thought experiment is an argument about consciousness, a difficult thing to quantify or understand. It’s unclear that there is a practical upshot for what&nbsp;<em>AI can actually do.</em></p>
<p id="1f79">B) A lot of the power of the thought experiment hinges on the fact that the room solves questions using a lookup table, this stacks the deck. Perhaps we be more willing to say that the room as a whole understood language if it formed an (implicit) model of how things are, and of the current context, and used those models to answer questions? Even if this doesn’t deal with all the intuition that the room cannot understand Chinese, I think it takes a bite from it.</p>
<p id="96a9">— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —</p>
<p id="4642">(1)- Strictly of course only the patterns in true sentences mirror, or are isomorphic to, the arrangement of the world, but most sentences people utter are at least approximately true.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In college, I took a self-defense class, taught by Sensei Flagg. The next semester, I took a kickboxing class, taught by Sensei Flagg. The next and final semester, I took an Isshin-Ryū Karate class, taught by Sensei Flagg.</p>

<p>It was the exact same class each time. The administrators just couldn’t decide how to categorize it.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9eba9012f62648f5678b4fc512636f33c4fb1368/1dcd7/images/uploads/karate.jpg" alt="Karate Kata"></p>

<p>According to the school’s policy, retakes did not provide additional credits or grades. But when I noticed the administration’s constant category changes of the same karate class, I realized it would count for a new credit and grade each time. So I kept enrolling and boosted my grades and course-credit total.</p>

<p>This category shuffle had a minor effect on my overall grade (and belt ranking). In the business of software, however, companies live or die by the category they compete in. It affects the number of potential buyers, their budgets, their perceived value of the product, and the alternatives they compare against the product. It even affects how much interest the company can garner from investors and job candidates.</p>

<p>Some think product categories have a loophole similar to my college karate classes: Instead of slugging it out in an existing category, just create a new one! Instead of extra credits, the thinking goes, you become the default market leader and get millions in revenue from the many buyers who realize they can’t live without this kind of product.</p>

<p>On top of that, startup founders are told that legends such as Steve Jobs, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Marc Benioff succeeded because they <em>created</em> categories instead of disrupting old ones.</p>

<p>An exploitable loophole. Growth and revenue. The secret behind the success of legends. No wonder so many founders wonder whether they should create a new category.</p>

<p>From helping startups since 2013 and analyzing tech IPOs from the past two years, I’ve reached this surprising conclusion:</p>

<p><strong>You don’t need a new category.</strong> In fact, the vast majority of startups succeed in an <em>existing</em> category. As did, it turns out, Steve Jobs, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Marc Benioff.</p>

<p>The smartphone category existed over a decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone. Although Salesforce was one of the first breakthrough Software-as-a-Service companies, its founder Marc Benioff neither coined nor used the term “SaaS,” which really emerged in a 2001 industry publication (more on that below). Larry Page and Sergey Brin created an innovative method of ranking web sites but always called Google a “search engine.”</p>

<p>And if you do try it, <strong>category creation is much harder and costlier than it seems</strong>.</p>

<p>This article summarizes my perspective on the matter, based on extensive research and actual go-to-market experiences — some of which are included here as anecdotal stories — and makes the case that startups are more likely to succeed by competing in an existing category than by trying to create a new one.</p>

<h2 id="categories-are-just-words">Categories Are Just Words</h2>

<p>A <strong>category</strong> (“market category” or “product category”) is a group of products that solve a similar problem, in a similar way, to a similar audience. Examples in software include Application Performance Monitoring (APM), Marketing Platforms, and Platforms as a Service (PaaS).</p>

<p>But really, categories are just words.</p>

<p>There’s no single authority that decides what is or isn’t a word, or their meaning. A word is real if enough people use it and it means what most people think it means. Some words change meaning; some disappear; new ones emerge; everything is fluid. And so with categories.</p>

<p>Changes happen as a result of significant innovations, shifts in buyer perceptions or needs, economic environments, and many other factors. Whatever the cause, the change first spreads in the wild before being documented and standardized by some influential person or organization.</p>

<p>As one analyst from the research firm Gartner told me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When we either create or advance terms that we’re hearing, it’s always to provide clarity to the market.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, in 2001, the Software &amp; Information Industry Association <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Shelly38/software-as-a-service-strategic-backgrounder">introduced the world to SaaS</a>: “Software as a Service (SaaS), commonly referred to as the Application Service Provider (ASP) model, is heralded by many as the new wave in application software distribution.” Salesforce, which launched two years prior and uniquely provided its software through the cloud, influenced this change, but it did not coin the term.</p>

<p>None of this diminishes the power of categories. In addition to meaning, they also carry associations, expectations, and perceptions. They can even evoke emotions.</p>

<p>Take NoSQL, for instance. If you’re familiar with databases, that label might stir expectations such as “open-source” and “distributed”; product associations such as DynamoDB, Cassandra, and MongoDB; and perceptions such as “risk of data loss,” “fad,” or “best choice for big data.” Depending on your experience with databases or the year in which you read this, you may involuntarily feel either glee or disgust.</p>

<p>Such reactions have tremendous implications for the company behind the product. The category with which buyers associate that product impacts their level of interest, what they compare it against, how much they expect and are willing to pay, what they expect the product to do, and so on. Companies can influence — but not control — the category they’re associated with through positioning.</p>

<p><strong>Positioning</strong> is the deliberate effort to make a product or service be associated with a specific category for some advantage. Everything from the way the product is built to the way it’s packaged, priced, sold, and marketed can be a part of that effort.</p>

<p>For example, Redis makes a database that fits the NoSQL definition, but maybe they prefer not to be associated with “cheap” and “fad,” nor to compete with the many NoSQL solutions in the market. So they consistently label the product as an “in-memory database” and avoid mentionioning NoSQL throughout the corporate or open-source sites. (This is speculation for illustrative purposes.)</p>

<p>Although successful positioning could make a significant impact for a startup, <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/bff/">it takes work</a> to figure out how and where to position the product to maximize returns. What’s more, any category with a sizable market is sure to already include competition from market leaders or a swarm of other startups.</p>

<p>Which is why some startups attempt a shortcut with category creation.</p>

<p><strong>Category creation</strong> is a marketing strategy in which a company designs a new product category — along with name, problems, solutions, and audience — and promotes that category alongside the product itself. The goal is to convince buyers they need a certain kind of product, then win that growing market by virtue of having the only (or leading) product in it.</p>

<p>The idea of <em>hacking</em> your way to market dominance and unicorn status is understandably alluring to startup founders. If you could mold the market in your favor and sidestep the incumbents and startup competition, why wouldn’t you?</p>

<p>Because, as it turns out, category creation is neither a shortcut nor a surefire way to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="category-creation-is-not-a-shortcut">Category Creation Is Not a Shortcut</h2>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0363448a27ef0cfd5093782fea2c49ae2124d8a8/23fb9/images/uploads/270.jpg" alt="Cartoon about living as kings on a desert island."></p>

<p>Category creation is much harder and costlier than it seems — in time, energy, resources, and opportunity cost.</p>

<p>The hard part isn’t coming up with the strategy. The hard part is moving the market — the buyers and their purchasing behavior — with you to the new category. Until then, you’re not a king; you’re just the mayor of a one-person town.</p>

<p>In other words, everyone can be “#1” in their own category, but that isn’t enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/01bf2eb3e730274b39ae85c5b4dd8c734984b23c/fbadf/images/uploads/category-example-1.png" alt="Message on the Drift homepage boasting about their position in their category.">

<em>Message on the Intercom homepage, boasting about their position in their category.</em></p>

<p>This requirement to move the market is badly and consistently underestimated by startups considering this strategy. It is underestimated in part because it is unacknowledged by proponents of category creation, who say much about “category kings” and market dominance but not enough about the time and cost it takes to get there, nor about the many companies that tried and failed to build a market around their new category.</p>

<p>What does it take to move the market? Marketing. So launching a product and category together just doubles the effort, resources, and time required for sales and marketing. Instead of helping explain the product, the new category just creates another thing that needs explaining.</p>

<p>The cost may be even worse than that, because new categories face more resistance from buyers than new products. As <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2833208">one research study</a> explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Owing to their vested interest in constructing and conveying the value of a new category in the market, producers’ discursive attempts at category-creation are liable to be discounted and viewed with suspicion by other constituents, especially consumers, in a market.” (Durand &amp; Khaire, 2016)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the worst case, it can be repulsive. Buyers might feel they’re being sold buzzwords and snake oil. This is a big risk for startups selling to technical audiences who are already sensitive to anything that smells like marketing.</p>

<p>Launching a category at the same time as bringing a product to market is like trying to bring <em>two products</em> to market. Companies like Monday.com, HubSpot, and Fastly can afford to take shots at creating new categories — Work OS, Flywheel Model, and Edge Cloud Platform, respectively — because they have the resources and cash runway to see it through, just as they would with a new product or major release. Those who don’t have the resources to launch two products at the same time also don’t have the resources to successfully launch a product and a category at the same time.</p>

<![CDATA[Variables and Memory Management in Rust]]>

August 10, 2020 | https://www.warambil.com/variables-and-memory-management-in-rust | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.warambil.com/variables-and-memory-management-in-rust">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately there has been a lot of fuss around the <strong>Rust</strong> programming language developed by the Mozilla team around 2010.</p>
<p>The reality is that this language that was created as an alternative to C++ has gained popularity once it has become more mature, due to the following key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Great performance</li>
<li>Packaging and distribution</li>
<li>Helpful community</li>
</ul>
<p>The objective of this post is to learn more about how Rust handles variables and memory to catch errors at compile time rather than in runtime. This is one of the features that makes it the safe language of choice for critical applications.</p>
<p>Rust applies a concept called: <em>linear types</em>. This means that is based on a <em>linear logic</em> that ensures that objects are only used once and then safely removed or deallocated.</p>
<p>Linear type systems allow references but not aliases. In Rust variables are immutable by default, therefore the following code triggers a compile error</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="0"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> x = </span><span>5</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is: {}"</span><span>, x);</span></span>
<span><span>    x = </span><span>6</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is: {}"</span><span>, x);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you really need to modify a variable once a value has been assigned to it, you must specify it this way:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="1"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> x = </span><span>5</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is: {}"</span><span>, x);</span></span>
<span><span>    x = </span><span>6</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is: {}"</span><span>, x);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now, you must be wondering why immutability should be a <em>de-facto</em> feature and how this may contribute to a produce a safer code.</p>
<p>Then you should understand another Rust concept in memory management: <strong><em>Ownership</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>Understanding Ownership</h2>
<p>Rust does not have a garbage collector like Java or other languages. Its philosophy is based on the premise that whoever declares a variable should own it until the end of the flow. But before digging into this concept, we need to refresh a few old concepts about memory: <strong><em>stack</em></strong> and <strong><em>heap</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Even when <em>stack</em> and heap are memory spaces available to be used during runtime, their structure differs. <em>Stack</em> works in a LIFO (<em>last in, first out</em>) fashion, meaning it stores values in the order it arrive and remove them in the opposite order.</p>
<p>The most important concept about <em>stack</em> is that all data stored there must have a known, fixed size. If we don´t know the size of what we are going to store, then we should use the <em>heap</em>.</p>
<p><em>Heap</em> is less organized and whenever you need to put data on the <em>heap</em>, you request a certain amount of space, the operating system finds an empty spot that could fit and returns a pointer, which holds the address of that location in memory. This process is called <em>allocating</em>.</p>
<p>Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating since the reserved space for data is known before hand. Thus, using the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the operating system does not have to search for a new place to store data. Data in the stack is always on top.</p>
<p>When a function is called, the values passed into the function as well as the function's local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get removed from the stack.</p>
<p>Now, historically the main problem with languages that allow developers to allocate data in the heap (using pointers), was keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap and the deallocation of unused data from the heap. This is what the Rust concept of <strong>ownership</strong> attempts to solve.</p>
<p><em>Each value in Rust has a variable that could be seen as its owner and each variable can have one owner at a time. Whenever the owner goes out of scope, the value is gone.</em></p>
<p>Let's see the following example:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="2"><code><span><span>let</span><span> s = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here we are using a variable that <em>points</em> to a String structure in memory. The string structure is allocated in the heap area and <em>s1</em> is a variable that has information about the address of the String structure, its length and capacity.</p>
<p>Now, the <em>s</em> variable is <em>immutable</em> by default, so if we wanted to modify the String data, we should do this:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="3"><code><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> s = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>s.</span><span>push_str</span><span>(</span><span>", world!"</span><span>); </span><span>// push_str() appends a literal to a String</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>, s); </span><span>// This</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The <em>mut</em> keyword lets Rust know about the variable mutability.</p>
<p>Now, here comes the interesting part about ownership, let's take a look at the following code:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="4"><code><span><span>let</span><span> s1 = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> s2 = s1;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, <em>s1</em> is assigned to <em>s2</em>, therefore if we think of other languages like C++, both <em>s2</em> and <em>s1</em> would be pointing to the same structure. So, after the assignment in the same function I should be able to do this:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="5"><code><span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}, world!"</span><span>, s1);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>However this code fails in Rust because once <em>s1</em> has been assigned to <em>s2</em>, <em>s1</em> does not belong the owner so it is not longer valid. This is what ownership is about. This way, Rust does not have to worry about keeping track of scenarios where the structure is removed from <em>s2</em> and <em>s1</em> may remain orfan.</p>
<p>At this point you may ask, is there then a way to actually deep copy structures and make <em>s1</em> and <em>s2</em> point to a valid structure with the a replicated data? The answer is yes by using a function called <em>clone</em>.</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="6"><code><span><span>let</span><span> s1 = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> s2 = s1.</span><span>clone</span><span>();</span></span></code></pre>
<p>So far so good, we know how ownership works in Rust but what about functions? In order to understand this, let's look at the following example:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="7"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> s1 = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> s2 = </span><span>takes_ownership</span><span>(s1);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"s1 '{}'."</span><span>, s1); </span><span>//not ok</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"s2 '{}'."</span><span>, s2); </span><span>//ok</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>takes_ownership</span><span>(st: </span><span>String</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>String</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    st</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here, <em>s1</em> is passed as parameter to the <em>take</em>ownership_ function. Unlike other languages where functions naturally make a copy of parameter into an local variable, Rust keeps clinging to its rules and <em>s1</em> once it is passed to <em>takes</em>ownership_ function, so it stops existing within the <em>main()</em> function scope.</p>
<p>Now, what if we actually need to <strong><em>borrow</em></strong> ownership? Then we should pass a reference to the variable like this:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="8"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> s1 = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> len = </span><span>calculate_length</span><span>(&amp;s1);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The length of '{}' is {}."</span><span>, s1, len);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>calculate_length</span><span>(s: &amp;</span><span>String</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>usize</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    s.</span><span>len</span><span>()</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here, we are passing a reference of <em>s1</em>, then s and <em>s1</em> points to the same structure. Semantics is important here because <em>&amp;s1</em> lets us create a reference to the value of <em>s1</em> but <u>does not own it</u>. This is a very important distinction because the actual value of <em>s1</em> will only be dropped after the real owner from the <em>main()</em> scope, stops using it.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;s1</code> syntax lets us create a reference that <em>refers</em> to the value of <code>s1</code> but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference goes out of scope.</p>
<p>We cannot modify the String structure from within the <em>calculate</em>length()_ function because we borrowed <em>s1</em>, we don´t own it.</p>
<p>Now, what if we need to modify the String owned by <em>s1</em> and we want to continue to let <em>s1</em> as owner of the struct in the <em>main()</em> function?</p>
<p>For this case we have something called <strong><em>Mutable References</em></strong>.</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="9"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> s = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>change</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> s);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>change</span><span>(some_string: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>    some_string.</span><span>push_str</span><span>(</span><span>", world"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Using <em>mut</em> this way does the trick but there is only one caveat, for security reasons you can only use mutable references only once in a particular scope for a particular piece of data.</p>
<p>Therefore, something like this will fail:</p>
<pre data-language="rust" data-index="10"><code><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> s = </span><span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> r1 = &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> s;</span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> r2 = &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> s;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}, {}"</span><span>, r1, r2);</span></span></code></pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Any number of immutable references or one mutable reference can exist at any time of your code. However, references must always be valid.</p>
<p><strong><em>Notice</em></strong>: The objective of this post was to find another way to explain how variables are handled by Rust, therefore most of the source code examples here have been borrowed from the official <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html">Rust website</a> documentation.</p>

According to <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share">a recent poll by the Cato Institute</a>, a third of Americans say that they are personally worried about losing their jobs or missing out on career opportunities if they express their real political opinions. Americans in all walks of life have been publicly shamed, pressured into ritualistic apologies or summarily fired.</p><p>But critics of the critics of cancel culture make a powerful retort. Accusing others of canceling can, they claim, be a way to stigmatize legitimate criticism. As Hannah Giorgis <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">writes in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">Atlantic</a></em>, “critical tweets are not censorship.”</p><p>So what, exactly, does a cancellation consist of? And how does it differ from the exercise of free speech and robust critical debate? </p><p>At a conceptual level, the difference is clear. Criticism marshals evidence and arguments in a rational effort to persuade. Canceling, by contrast, seeks to organize and manipulate the social or media environment in order to isolate, deplatform or intimidate ideological opponents. It is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity and reduce the scope for forms of criticism that are not sanctioned by the prevailing consensus of some local majority.</p><p>In practice, however, telling canceling apart from criticism can be difficult because both take the <em>form</em> of criticizing others. That is why it is probably impossible to devise a simple bright-line test of what should count as a harmful instance of cancelation.</p><p>A better approach might therefore be diagnostic. Like the symptoms of cancer, the hallmarks of a cancellation are many. Though not all instances involve every single characteristic, they all involve <em>some </em>of its key attributes. Rather than issuing a single litmus test, the diagnostic approach allows us to draw up a checklist of warning signs. The more signs you see, the more certain you can be that you are looking at a cancel campaign.</p><p>Six warning signs make up my personal checklist for cancel culture. </p><p><strong>Punitiveness</strong></p><p><em>Are people denouncing you to your employer, your professional groups or your social connections? Are you being blacklisted from jobs and social opportunities? Does what is being said to or about you have the goal—or foreseeable effect—of jeopardizing your livelihood or isolating you socially?</em></p><p>A critical culture seeks to correct rather than punish. In science, the penalty for being wrong is not that you lose your job or your friends. Normally, the only penalty is that you lose the argument. Even the phenomenon of retracting papers is new and deservedly controversial, because the usual—and very effective—method has been for science to simply discard mistakes and move on. Wrong answers and bad science die on the vine and disappear. Incentives are mostly positive, not punitive: for being right, you win citations, promotions, fame and fancy prizes. Taking a punitive attitude toward mistakes undermines the scientific process because knowledge advances by trial and error.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to punish rather than correct—and often for a single misstep rather than a long track record of failure. A professor <a href="https://spectator.us/academics-get-paper-retracted-some-havent-read-nathan-cofnas/">swears</a> to “ruin [a graduate student’s] reputation permanently and deservedly.” Campaigners against an art curator <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gary-garrels-departure-sfmoma-1893964">declare</a> he “must be removed from his job, effective immediately.”</p><p>The point is to make the errant suffer. </p><p><strong>Deplatforming</strong></p><p><em>Are campaigners attempting to prevent you from publishing your work, giving speeches or attending meetings? Are they claiming that allowing you to be heard is violence against them or makes them unsafe?</em></p><p>A critical culture tolerates dissent rather than silencing it. It understands that dissent can seem obnoxious, harmful, hateful and, yes, <em>unsafe</em>. To minimize unnecessary damage, it goes to great lengths to encourage people to express themselves in a civil manner. But it also understands that, every so often, an obnoxious dissenter is right—and so it opposes silencing and deplatforming.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to shut up and shout down its targets. Cancelers often define the mere act of disagreeing with them as a threat to their safety or even an act of violence. Staffers at the <em>New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/business/media/new-york-times-washington-post-protests.html">claimed</a> that the mere act of publishing a controversial op-ed piece endangered them. Staffers at the <em>New Yorker</em> demanded that Steve Bannon be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/bannon-new-yorker-festival-remnick.html">deplatformed</a>. Shout-downs, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYkNS36ILrAhVUYDUKHWcADuIQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefire.org%2Fresearch%2Fdisinvitation-database%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ONE1G9KXx27R20K-ezA56">disinvitations</a> and demands for retractions and withdrawals are cancelers’ stock in trade.</p><p><strong>Organization</strong></p><p><em>Does criticism appear to be organized and targeted? Are the organizers recruiting others to pile on? Are you being swarmed and brigaded? Are people hunting through your work and scouring social media to find ammunition to use against you?</em></p><p>Critical culture relies on persuasion. The way to win an argument is to convince others that you are right. Often, of course, schools of thought form, and arguments between them can grow heated; but organizing pressure campaigns against political or ideological targets is usually considered out of bounds.</p><p>By contrast, it’s common to see cancelers organize hundreds of petition-signers or thousands of social media users to dig up and prosecute an indictment. Recently, for example, campaigners picked through the social media posts of the psychologist (and member of <em>Persuasion</em>’s Board of Advisers) Steven Pinker in the hope of digging up some kind of case against him. Though they only came up with <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/07/05/the-purity-posse-pursues-pinker/">trivial charges</a>, such as that he had twice used the terms “urban crime” and “urban violence,” they got hundreds of signatories to join a group denunciation.</p><p><strong>Secondary Boycotts</strong></p><p><em>Is there an explicit or implicit threat that people who support you will get the same punitive treatment that you are receiving? Are people putting pressure on employers and professional colleagues to fire you or stop associating with you? Do people who defend you, or criticize the campaign against you, have to fear adverse consequences?</em></p><p>With its commitments to exploring a wide range of ideas and correcting rather than coercing the errant, a critical culture sees no value in instilling a climate of fear. But instilling fear is what canceling is all about. By choosing targets unpredictably (almost anything can trigger a campaign), providing no safe harbors (even conformists can get hit), and implicitly threatening anyone who sides with those who are targeted, canceling sends the message: “you could be next.”</p><p>Thus, a canceled journalist was quickly dropped by his employer, his professional association and his publisher, becoming “<a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/23/im-radioactive/">radioactive</a>,” as he put it. (At last check, he was applying to law schools.) In the resulting climate, people will often join public denunciations or <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/stand-up-for-the-wrongly-accused-341">refrain from defending targets they believe to be innocent</a>, to avoid becoming controversial themselves.</p><p><strong>Moral Grandstanding</strong></p><p><em>Is the tone of the discourse ad hominem, repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged? Are people flattening distinctions, demonizing you, slinging inflammatory labels and engaging in moral one-upmanship? Are people ignoring what you actually say—talking about but not to you? </em></p><p>Precisely because speech can be hurtful, critical culture discourages extreme rhetoric. It encourages people to listen to each other, to use evidence and argumentation, to behave reasonably and to avoid personal attacks.</p><p>Cancel culture is much more invested in what philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke call “<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/grandstanding-9780190900151?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">moral grandstanding</a>”: the display of moral outrage to impress one’s peer group, dominate others, or both. Grandstanders who condemn someone are not interested in persuading or correcting her; in fact, they are not really talking <em>to</em> her at all. Rather, they are using her as a convenient object in a campaign to elevate their own status. Pile-ons, personal attacks and bidding wars to show the most outrage are all ways of engaging in moral grandstanding.</p><p><strong>Truthiness</strong></p><p><em>Are the things being said about you inaccurate? Do the people saying them not even seem to care about their veracity? Do they feel at liberty to distort your words, ignore corrections and make false accusations?</em></p><p>Concern for accuracy is the north star of a critical culture. Not everyone gets every fact right, nor do people always agree on what is true; and yet people in a critical culture try to present their own and others’ viewpoints honestly and accurately. Though I may fail to live up to this standard in some cases, I recognize that I should address what you actually said, not an inflammatory caricature or some out-of-context quotation.</p><p>One of many reasons Donald Trump is a menace to democracy is that he views truth instrumentally, as something to use, abuse or ignore depending on the needs of the moment. He repeats discredited assertions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/10/meet-bottomless-pinocchio-new-rating-false-claim-repeated-over-over-again/">again and again</a>—or shifts ground <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-says-it-doesnt-really-matter-if-iranian-general-posed-an-imminent-threat/2020/01/13/c9f7ea1c-362e-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html">to another</a> when one assertion is definitively debunked. Cancelers often play the same kind of <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/rhetorical-calvinball">rhetorical Calvinball</a>.</p><p>Cancelers’ characterizations of a paper by the philosopher Rebecca Tuvel, for example, were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html">demonstrably incorrect</a>. The person who initiated the campaign even admitted to <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.org/2017/can-we-get-this-person-fired/">not having read</a> the supposedly objectionable paper. “So little of what has been said … is based upon people actually reading what I wrote,” Tuvel <a href="http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/">lamented</a> in a public statement. </p><p>But that did not stop anybody. For canceling is not about seeking truth or persuading others; it is a form of information warfare, in which <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness">truthiness</a> suffices if it serves the cause.</p><p>Those are my six warning signs. If you spot one or two, you should fear that a canceling may be happening; if you see five or six, you can be sure.</p><p>Obviously, mine is not the only approach. Other people, such as <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/a-taxonomy-of-fear">Emily Yoffe</a> and <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/04/whats-the-best-way-to-protect-free-speech-ken-white-and-greg-lukianoff-debate-cancel-culture/">Greg Lukianoff</a>, have made their own attempts at characterizing the current climate of fear or defining cancel culture. Hopefully, many more suggestions and refinements will follow. </p><p>As with most other concepts, we might never come to a complete consensus about its best definition. Still, I predict …</p></div></div>

      <p>Short answer: because we said so.<!--more--></p>

<p>:)</p>



<p>Alright, fine, that’s too short to make it an article, dear reader, and my inflammatory words demand an explanation.</p>

<p>The C Committee meeting – originally scheduled for Freiburg, Germany but not happening there because <em>(* vague gesturing towards outside *)</em> – concluded Friday, August 7th. It went pretty well, with us making good progress on all fronts. Yes, we make real progress; I promise we do, and this is not a dead language.</p>

<p>As a side note I’ve also become the Project Editor for C so before you take this as an uninformed rant of a person too lazy to “make things better”, let me assure that I am, indeed, incredibly invested in making sure C can begin to meet the needs of developers without needing 50 vendor-specific extensions to build remotely nice/usable libraries and applications.</p>

<p>Still, I made a claim (the C Language will never stop you from making mistakes), and therefore I need to substantiate it. We could look at the thousands of CVEs and the inherent issues with tons of C Code, or the need for MISRA to vigorously police every last little potential C feature to prevent misuse (<a href="https://twitter.com/thephantomderp/status/1290824683399663616">hello, K&amp;R prototype declarations</a>…), or other more intricate and fun bugs related to portability and undefined behavior. But instead, we are just going to take the words from the horse’s mouth: the Committee itself.</p>



<p>No, dear reader, put the popcorn away. As with all ISO proceedings, I am not allowed to quote anyone verbatim, and this is not a name-and-shame article. It will, however, explain why things that we can easily diagnose and identify as bad behavior in standards-conforming ISO C will never go away. And we will start with a paper by Dr. Philipp Klaus Krause:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2526.htm">N2526, use const for data from the library that shall not be modified</a>.</p>

<p>N2526 is a very simple paper. “Some data returned by the library is <code>const</code> morally, spiritually, and in fact even by its implementation. It’s undefined behavior and wrong to write into it, so let’s stop teasing each other about it and put a ring on that finger bad boy!” … Okay, that’s not exactly what it says, but I’m sure the idea makes sense to you, dear reader. Originally, when the vote for this paper was taken, there was almost no votes against the paper. Then, a few people voiced their <em>strong</em> objections to the paper because it breaks old code. And, well, of course that’s bad: even my breath caught and I strained to think about this – adding <code>const</code>? C has no ABI that could be affected by this, C (their implementations) doesn’t even respect qualifiers, how are we breaking things?! So, let’s talk about why this would be a breaking change in the eyes of certain folk.</p>



<p>Or, as I like to call it, “The Type Safety Is For Losers Language”. Of course, that’s a mouthful, so “C” will have to do. You may be wondering why I would call a language like C as having no type safety. After all,</p>

Yes, two entirely unrelated pointer types can be set to one another in standards-conforming C. Most compilers warn, but it is standards-conforming to accept this code unless you crank up the <code>-Werror</code> <code>-Wall</code> <code>-Wpedantic</code> etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>In fact, other pointer-related things the compiler can accept without an explicit cast are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>volatile</code> (who needs those semantics anyways?!)</li>
  <li><code>const</code> (write into all the read-only data you like!)</li>
  <li><code>_Atomic</code> (thread safety, shred shmafety!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, note I am not arguing that you should not be able to do these things at all. But when you’re working in C – wherein it is very easy to get yourself a 500, 1000-line function alongside variable names that do not describe WTF they are for – the Hard Facts™ is that you work primarily with pointers, and you lack any amount of safety at all insofar as the Core Language cares. (NOTE: It <strong>is</strong> a constraint violation, but there’s so much legacy code that every implementation ignores qualifiers anyhow, so your code won’t ever <em>stop</em> compiling because of this (<a href="https://twitter.com/fanf/status/1292826424345337868">thanks, @fanf!</a>)!) Every potential failure here is diagnosable – easily so – with a compiler, and they all warn, but they will never require you to cast to communicate to the compiler that you Seriously, Really Meant It. It also means – much more importantly – that the human beings who come after you will have no bloody idea if you meant to do this, either.</p>

<p>All someone has to do is strip the build of <code>-Werror</code> <code>-Wall</code> <code>-Wpedantic</code> and you’ll be off to the races in committing multithreading, read-only, and hardware register crimes.</p>

<p>Now, this is fair, right? If someone strips off all of these warning/error flags, they obviously do not care about whatever faux pas or silly gaffe you’ve committed. Which means that, at the end of the day, these warnings are ultimately irrelevant and harmless as far as standards-conforming, ISO C is concerned. And yet…</p>



<p>Yes.</p>

<p>This is a special kind of hell that C developers have grown comfortable with, and to a lesser extent C++ developers. Warnings are seen as annoyances; and, as is shown by ever turning on <code>-Weverything</code> or <code>/W4</code>, they very well are. Shadowing warnings from variables in the global namespace (thanks, every header and C library ever is now a problem), using “reserved” names (as the kids say, “<a href="https://wg14.link/n2493">lol nice one xd!!</a>”), and “this struct has padding because you used <code>alignof</code>” (… yes, yes I know it has padding, I explicitly asked it to increase my padding BECAUSE I USED <code>alignof</code> MR. COMPILER) are all incredibly time-wasting.</p>

<p>But they are warnings.</p>

<p>Even if they are annoying, they prevent problems. The fact that I can blithely <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rEbPvd">ignore all qualifiers and dumpster all forms of read, write, thread, and read-only safety</a> is a serious issue when it comes to communicating intent and preventing bugs. Even the old K&amp;R syntax produced bugs in industrial and government codebases because users did the wrong thing. This is not because they are shit programmers: it’s because they are straddling codebases sometimes older than they are and gearing up to ride on a multi-million line technical liability. You cannot keep the entirety of the codebase in your head: this is what conventions, static analysis, high warning levels, and everything are supposed to combat. Unfortunately,</p>

<p>everyone likes to have Warning Free code.</p>

<p>This means that the moment a GCC developer makes a warning more sensitive to potential problematic cases, maintainers (not the original developers) will suddenly get hefty several-gigabyte logs containing all the newest vomit of warnings and other things from their old code. “This is stupid”, they say, “the code has been running for Y E A R S, why is GCC complaining now?”. This means that even doing something like adding <code>const</code> to a function signature, even if it is morally, spiritually, and factually the right thing to do, is avoided. “Breaking” people is “they now have to look at code which has questionable intentions”. This is code that would – on pain of Undefined Behavior – crash your chip or <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareMinigun/status/1260061878614556684">corrupt your memory</a>. But that’s the other problem with being a C developer in today’s ecosystem, really.</p>

<h3 id="age-as-a-measure-of-quality">Age as a Measure of Quality</h3>

<p>How many people would have ever guessed <code>sudo</code> had a vulnerability as jaw-droppingly simple as “-1 or integer overflow gives you access to everything”? How many people thought Heartbleed would be a real problem? How many game developers are shipping stb’s “tiny” libraries without ever having run a fuzzer on them and realizing they contain more significant exploitable input vulnerabilities than they could imagine? This is not a dig at any of these pieces of code or the programmers behind them: they are providing a vital service that the world has depended on for decades, often with little to no support from anyone until a big problem exploded. But, the people worshipping and deploying these pieces of code end up fermenting a toxic adage under the auspice of survivorship bias:</p>

<p>“This code is so old and used by so many, how could it possibly have problems?”</p>

<p>By holding backwards compatibility and “not being a bother” as the highest ideals for C code, people who survive long enough in the industry begin to equate age with quality, as if codebases were barrels of wine in a cellar. The older and longer the code is used, the finer and more delectable the wine.</p>

<p>The reality is, unfortunately, far less romantic and cute: crawling with more bugs than you can shake a stick at, security vulnerabilities by the basketful, these technical liabilities only grow more risky with each passing day. Each system evolves into a half-alive, unaddressed, and partially-unmaintained rotting husk. They are gussied up and given the veneer of nobility and greatness when it is in fact an embalmed corpse, just waiting to be poked the wrong way before its festering, antediluvian pustules burst and fill your application with its finely aged botulism.</p>

<h3 id="okay-gross-but-like-what-about-the-c-standard">Okay… Gross, but like what about the C Standard?</h3>

<p>The problem I have noticed in my (incredibly short) tenure as a member is that we prefer backwards compatibility over all else, attributing old applications and their use cases over any chance at improving the safety, …</p></section></div>

                 <p>Toolin' Up Thursdays: Physical Videos</p>
<p>I love movies. I also love <em>my</em> movies, my physical little boxes full of digital creations that I enjoy watching.</p>
<p>You should consider a physical video library.</p>
<p>In many ways, this echoes the debate over whether to use physical books or eBooks. I love both, but I think each experience is completely different from the other one. For me, I'd never consider buying a technical or long-form fiction book that wasn't physical. I enjoy carrying them around, I enjoy flipping back and forth to compare and lookup passages, and I enjoy being a librarian and home entertainment curator.</p>
<p>Those are also the kinds of things I enjoy with a physical movie library. I can browse, thinking over each title. I might pull one out, look at the back, and think: is this good enough for the evening's entertainment? Or is it a bit too dark to go with that other selection. I can make a temporary stack of movies to judge, show them to the family. I can read liners while...</p>            </div>

                 <p>Wayback Wednesdays: Richelieu</p>
<p>On this day in 1624, Cardinal Armand Jean du Plessis, Duke of Richelieu (known simply as "Richelieu" ) was made president of the council of ministers of France</p>
<p>When I say "France", I mean something as we know it today, but back then it was anything but a country. There were severe internal differences, each little fiefdom had it's own lord, and national control was a rare if non-existent thing. The old joke is that the phrase "Holy Roman Empire" was wrong on all counts: It wasn't holy, it wasn't Roman, and it wasn't an Empire.</p>
<p>After the Western Roman Empire slowly disintegrated into little kingdoms, the people in the west still thought of themselves as Romans. Why wouldn't they? In fact, if you look at some very modern terms for leader, like "Tsar" and "Keiser", they're just different ways of saying Caesar.</p>

                 <p>Theory Tuesdays: The MAT</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, I created the Markham Assessment Tool (MAT). The idea wasn't to implement processes, or make some new "maturity scale" for organizations to use to monitor and punish teams. Instead, every team, even the most successful ones, had things they should probably talk about but had been putting it off (or never realized it) The MAT was an effort to provide a standard language to begin conversations no matter how big or what the nature of the team was.</p>
<p>The first job was finding a detailed enough language to try to pinpoint where the conversations should happen. The default was a combination of the RUP and the CMMI's "common obstacles to process improvement" (Once again, this tool had nothing to do with process; it was just about creating a standard language that could be used by coaches across teams) Other combinations were used as well during field testing.</p>            </div>

<h3>Department of State Emergency Relocation Site and Communications Station, Front Royal, VA (demolished)</h3>
<p>These facilities were located at what is now the Smithsonian Institution's Conservation and Research Center.
According to the Center's <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/CRC/FrontRoyal/about_us/CRC_history/"> official history</a>:</p>
<p>"In addition to the USDA functions, the Department of State used a portion of the Center's facilities as an Emergency Relocation site and a communications station.
The State Department equipped several buildings as offices in case of national emergency--enough for the Secretary and 700 State Department employees.
By 1972, all that was left of this activity was the communication station.
In the winter of 1973, USDA decided to close down the Research Station's operations."</p>

under the city in a tunnel specially designed for this purpose. The vehicles
will be able to reach a top speed of 155 mph, making it possible to link the
city from north to south in only 3 minutes instead of 30 minutes using the
usual traffic lanes. The extension of the tunnel could also connect McCarran
International Airport to the south of the city.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Content sites are great, low barrier to entry businesses that (when done right) can generate a sustainable source of cash. </p><p>Not only that, but they’re also fun. Using the method I’m going to outline below, you can pick a topic that really interests you — learn more about it — and make money in the process.</p><p>I started two of my own content sites a few years ago. They were my first foray into internet businesses and affiliate marketing. When I started the first one (about running — Let’s Go Run), I had no idea what I was doing, and no money to do it. </p><p>I scrounged around the internet finding resources about SEO, keyword planning and blogging. I went through about three SemRush trial’s (sorry SemRush!) with different emails trying to come up with a keyword plan, and figure out why the hell my blog posts weren’t coming up on Google! Then, after about 4 months of working on it and putting out content religiously, I started ranking for one of my main keywords. </p><p>I made it to the front page of Google! I’ll never forget the excitement.</p><p>That got me hooked. I spent the next few years growing out that site, and creating another one with my mom (who loves golf). </p><p>I got them to the small-medium level (each had traffic of about 10k monthly visits) and then sold them online. I needed the cash to start what I thought was a ‘real’ business. </p><p>The thing is, I sold them way before I had monetized each of them properly. I just didn’t know what I was doing! And the buyer knew it. All the income was from affiliate earnings, and they were running off the same account (so I don’t have specific figures for each website), earning around about $80 to $100 mark per month combined.</p><p>Knowing what I do now about niche content sites, and their ability to generate a sustainable cash flow, I would have never sold those sites. </p><p>This is my approach to building content sites that are monetized effectively, and how you can too.</p><h2>Background</h2><h3>What Are They?</h3><p>A niche content site is just a website where people wanting to know about something in a certain niche go to find that out.</p><p>If you take any subreddit, and create content specifically tailored to that audience, it would be a niche content site.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52457e66346b8d05835d_0*gL3fHRm-e86x0tgu.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Swim University is the perfect example of a niche site: Everything you need to know about keeping a pool clean.</p><h3>How Do They Work?</h3><p>The fundamentals of it are as follows:</p><ol role="list"><li>Pick a specific niche.</li><li>Create content around that niche, and post it on the website.</li><li>Drive readers to that website.</li><li>Build an audience of readers.</li><li>Monetize that audience.</li></ol><h3>A Modified Approach</h3><p>The approach I’m going to give you here uses the framework above, but modifies the Monetization step slightly.</p><p>The goal is simple: <strong>Get to revenue as fast as possible.</strong></p><p>We’ll go into monetization further below, but the gist of it is this:</p><ul role="list"><li>Traditional niche site model requires a ton of traffic to make decent money (especially today).</li><li>My model requires a few thousand views a month with high intent and in a specific niche.</li></ul><h3>Examples</h3><p><strong>SwimUniversity.com</strong> (above) — Pool care</p><p><strong>GearLab.com</strong> — Outdoor gear reviews</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524647ea4173bd1d6c06_0*d8YHEXfmp62TptgH.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>ApartmentTherapy.com — </strong>Kit out and care for your trendy apartment</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524669ed957a4dbc995f_0*9KPXKzA3bD2Qt04E.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Fatherly.com</strong> — A site for dad’s</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a5245e566339d3104c7a4_0*kZ2EoL3V_m9I3aZ7.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Before you continue, understand your motivation for wanting to do this.</p><p>Here’s mine: <strong>Cash</strong>. Niche sites are great cash generators if you can get them right. As long as you have a steady flow of traffic, they can bring in a (mostly) reliable income every single month.</p><p>For me, that means not having to worry about rent as an expense.</p><p>For you, it might mean an additional income to fund your startup.</p><p>Get clear on your motivation to do this so that when things aren’t going so well, you know whether to knuckle down and commit, or bail out because it’s taking too much time and energy to achieve what you want.</p><p>These aren’t sexy businesses, but they work if you do ’em right.</p><h2>🚵 Pick A Niche</h2><p><strong>And validate it, too.</strong></p><p>This is my unconventional advice: <strong>Start with your interests</strong>.</p><p>The thesis behind that is: If you’re not interested in it, you’re not going to want to create content about it.</p><p>One thing I do know is that for this to be successful you have to commit to creating enough content.</p><p>There are a few things you need to consider when picking a niche, though.</p><h3><strong>Audience size</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>You need a big enough audience to make this viable. <em>Golf</em> = too broad and too competitive. <em>Left-Handed Blind Golfers</em> = too niche. You get the point.</li><li>I would define niche as SwimUniversity.com (above).</li><li>I would define micro-niche as SwimUniversity.com but for glass fibre pools only.</li><li>As a guide — though this is very dependent on your audience and monetization method — your monthly search volume shouldn’t be lower than 30k visits (or 1k visitors a day).</li></ul><h3><strong>Can you monetize it?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>Does this audience typically spend money on this interest? Either directly or indirectly. If yes, then the answer will almost always be continue.</li></ul><p>or…</p><ul role="list"><li>Can you generate a ton of search traffic (100k monthly +), which you’d be able to monetize through Display Ads? This would require large search volume for your search keywords, as well as low domain authority for the competing sites. This is generally only available in completely unexplored niches (of which there are very few around).</li></ul><h3><strong>How does that audience consume most of their content?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>And can you create that content. If your niche consumes mainly blog posts, great. Low barrier. If they mostly consume well produced video content, and you have no experience doing that = bit higher barrier.</li></ul><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Write down all your interests, and then some. Aim for 50 ideas.</li><li>Rank them in order of how ‘niche’ they are. Ie: How many other people are there who share this interest in the world.</li><li>Then rank them in order of your interest in each of them.</li><li>Choose the top 5 combined ranking.</li><li>Sign up for a keyword volume research tool (Most of them offer free trials). I use <a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/#a5dca93d6feebf8609c185b05" target="_blank">Mangools</a>. It’s a lot cheaper (and a bit less powerful) than <a href="https://www.semrush.com/lp/all-in-one-marketing-toolkit/en/?ref=3487429516&amp;refer_source=15-business-ideas-blog-post&amp;utm_source=berush&amp;utm_medium=promo&amp;utm_campaign=link_landing_page:_all-in-one_marketing_toolkit" target="_blank">SEMrush </a>or Ahrefs, but it suits my needs perfectly.</li><li>Do a search for your topic and start collating and creating keywords with monthly search volume &gt; 500 and keyword difficulty &lt; 30. Go after long-tail keywords if you can’t find any.</li><li>If you’re new to this, I haven’t found a better resource than <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/keyword-research/?ref=SimonBlogs" target="_blank">Neil Patel’s guide to keyword research.</a></li><li>When you’re done, you should have a good idea of the amount of monthly traffic you can generate (remember, you’re going to have to rank on the first page for those search terms to get a <em>portion </em>of that traffic!).</li><li>Giving hard and fast rules about traffic volume and keyword difficulty targets is difficult.</li><li>Andrew Boscini put it well to me on Twitter the other day:</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52453067ff4556a6074b_1*hPVtmGrOkuYQX1g7uGPTmQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you going for a ton of traffic that converts in the low % range, or are you going more niche, with very high search intent?</p><p>I’d also recommend snooping around the following forums/places to get a sense for the community you’re diving into and what the pain points are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Reddit </strong>(Find all the applicable sub-reddits)</li><li><strong>Quora </strong>(What questions are people asking)</li><li><strong>Websites</strong>/<strong>Forums </strong>(Who are you competing with)</li><li><strong>Wikipedia </strong>(What information can I give on this niche)</li><li><strong>Twitter </strong>(Do a search and see who the top authorities in the space are)</li><li><strong>Facebook Groups </strong>(How many are they, are they engaged or spammy?)</li></ul><p>As you pick up on areas of discussion, do a search for them as they relate to your niche in the keyword finder and add all those keywords to your list too.</p><h2>✍🏽 Content</h2><p>That’s the fun part done.</p><p>Now that you’ve got your keyword list defined, you need to start writing content. Religiously.</p><p>This is where most people fail on niche sites. They write a few (maybe 5 or 6) articles, and then they get bored and move on. That’s why I said earlier you need to pick a niche that you’re interested in.</p><p>As a guideline, you’re likely going to need to write 100-odd pieces of content in a year.</p><p>If you think that’s unachievable in the niche you’ve selected (because you’ll get bored or otherwise) you have two choices:</p><ol role="list"><li>Go back to the step above and choose a different niche that you’re going to be interested enough in.</li><li>Hire writers (money required).</li></ol><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Once you’ve decided on your niche, start writing. Open a Google Doc and begin on your first piece of content. Aim to put out 2 or 3 pieces for 3 or 4 days back to back.</li><li>You should be going after your most valuable keyword’s (high search, low keyword difficulty) first.</li><li>After 3 or 4 days, you’ll have a good idea for the tone/style of your content and you’ll be better positioned to register a domain and setup a home for your content.</li><li>Try and follow the theme of the example domains I showed above. Preferably including one of the main keywords which describes your niche in the url.</li><li>Don’t get hung up if the ideal .com domain isn’t available. There are other options:</li></ol><ul role="list"><li>Your country’s domain extension (only do this if you’re looking to only attract an audience in your own country)</li><li>.co is a great option</li><li>.io is well recognized in the tech-space</li></ul><p>Your domain name is not the be-all and end-all. A nice one is nice to have, but it’s not essential.</p><p>6. Without a doubt, Wordpress is the best option for a quick and easy setup.</p><p>Your domain/hosting provider will likely have some sort of installer for Wordpress available in the backend (Softaculous, usually) which will do it for you.</p><p>7. Install a theme. I get mine from <a href="https://creativemarket.com/themes/wordpress/blog?u=simonpurdon10" target="_blank">Creative Market.</a></p><p>Again, don’t get hung up on the details. You’ll be surprised by how little people care about the nitty-gritty things that seem to be a big deal to the website-owner.</p><p>If your site works well, looks reasonably good, loads quickly, with great content — that’ll do.</p><p>8. Post your content. Add images. Add external links (more on this later).</p><p>9. Add a method of collecting email addresses! Don’t just have a generic “Join our newsletter” either. No one wants to join just another newsletter.</p><p>Give your readers an actual incentive for signing up: “Join our newsletter for exclusive access to subscriber-only content”.</p><p>10. Remember to install:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank">Yoast SEO plugin</a> (for on-site SEO help)</li><li>Google Analytics</li><li>Facebook Pixel</li></ul><h2>🖱️ Traffic</h2><p>Now for the most important (but also the most tedious, for me) part: <strong>Driving traffic.</strong></p><p>Putting up content and hoping …</p></div></div>

<div>


<div id="post-body">


<p><b><span lang="EN-US">5G has become even more intriguing! The
3GPP industry group is giving 5G a new direction in the latest series of
standards with the release of Release 16</span></b></p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A7meumCEij8/XzEYoxQ_c6I/AAAAAAAABPc/aPqFb2qZPxUOKf6kTjZiim_HZBSHFsOtACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/5G-logo.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="5G-logo-3GPP" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1600" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A7meumCEij8/XzEYoxQ_c6I/AAAAAAAABPc/aPqFb2qZPxUOKf6kTjZiim_HZBSHFsOtACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/5G-logo.png" title="5G-logo" width="640"></a></p>


<p><span lang="EN-US">The latest 5G standards have been
codified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the industry group
that sets the standards for cellular networks. The 3GPP finalised Release 16 on
3 July. While previous editions focused on the core of 5G as a mobile service
generation, Release 16 lays the foundation for new services that have never
been addressed by mobile technology before. At least not in such a rigorous and
comprehensive way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">"<i>Version 15 has really
focused on the situation we're in,"</i> said Danny Tseng, director of
technical marketing at Qualcomm, referring to mobile service, adding that
"<i>Version 16 has really broken the barrier</i>" for robots, cars,
factories and dozens of other applications and situations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>




<p><span lang="EN-US">4G and other previous generations
of cellular systems have focused on one thing: the cell phone. But when 3GPP
members began meeting to define what 5G could be, there was interest in
developing a wireless system that could do more than just connect phones.
"<i>The vision of 5G has always been this unifying platform,</i>"
says Tseng. When the 5G standards were being developed, researchers and
engineers saw no reason why the wireless cell phone couldn't be used to connect
anything wirelessly, so here's a look at what's new and exciting in Release 16.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Vehicle-to-Everything</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">One of the most striking features
of Release 16 is the V2X, short for "Vehicle to Everything". In other
words, the use of the 5G so that <a href="https://www.simturax.com/2020/07/autonomous-driving-levels-what-are-differences.html">cars</a> can communicate with each other and with
everything around them. Hanbyul Seo, an engineer at LG Electronics, explains
that V2X technologies were previously standardized in the IEEE 802.11p and 3GPP
LTE V2X standards, but the intention in these cases was to enable basic
security services. Seo is one of the reporters for the 3GPP point on V2X, which
means that he was responsible for reporting on the progress of the point to
3GPP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pRlLQr9Tyhc/XzEaqs1ZGfI/AAAAAAAABPo/qXF5oQ79vloMuTzivjAh3iPB6MRLn9NjQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/vehicle-to-everything.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="5G-vehicle-to-everything" data-original-height="461" data-original-width="429" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pRlLQr9Tyhc/XzEaqs1ZGfI/AAAAAAAABPo/qXF5oQ79vloMuTzivjAh3iPB6MRLn9NjQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/vehicle-to-everything.png" title="5G-vehicle-to-everything" width="594"></a></p>


<p><span lang="EN-US">In defining V2X for 5G, Seo says
the biggest challenge was to provide high data rate, reliability and low
latency, which are essential for anything beyond the most basic communications.
Seo explains that previous standards typically handle messages of hundreds of
bytes that should reach 90% of receivers within 300 meters in a few hundred
milliseconds. The 3GPP standards bring these benchmarks into the gigabytes per
second range, with a reliability of 99.999% and only a few milliseconds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Sidelinking</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Matthew Webb, 3GPP delegate for
Huawei and other reporter for the 3GPP update on V2X, added that version 16
also introduces a new technique called "sidelinking". Sidelinks will
allow vehicles connected to 5G to communicate directly with each other, rather
than through a cellular tower. As one can imagine, this can make a big
difference for cars passing each other on a highway, as they will be alerting
each other to their position.</span></p>




<p><span lang="EN-US">Tseng explains that the
side-by-side link began as part of V2X's work, but theoretically it can be
applied to any two devices that might need to communicate directly rather than
going through a base station first. Factory robots are one example, or
large-scale installations of the Internet of Things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Location Services</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Release 16 also includes
information on location-based services. In previous generations, three cell
phone towers were required to triangulate the <a href="https://www.simturax.com/2020/07/auto-delete-google-web-location-history.html">location</a> of a phone by measuring
the round-trip distance of a signal from each tower. But 5G networks will be
able to use the round-trip time of a single tower to locate a device. This is
because massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and beamforming allow 5G
towers to send accurate signals directly to devices, so the network can measure
the direction and angle of a beam, as well as its distance from the tower, to
locate them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Private networks</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Then there are the private
networks. When we think of cellular networks, we tend to think of wide area
networks that cover a lot of ground so that we can always be sure we have a
signal. But 5G incorporates millimeter waves, which are higher-frequency radio
waves that don't travel as far as traditional cellular signals. Thanks to
millimeter waves, it will be possible to build a network just for an office
building, a factory or a stadium. At these scales, 5G could work much like
Wi-Fi networks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>




<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Unlicensed spectrum</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The final area to be addressed is
the details of Release 16 on unlicensed spectrum. Jing Sun, a Qualcomm engineer
and 3GPP reporter on the subject, says that Release 16 marks the first time
unlicensed spectrum has been included in 5G cellular service. According to Sun,
it made sense to extend 5G to unlicensed spectrum in the 5 and 6 GHz bands
because these bands are widely available worldwide and ideal for use now that
5G is pushing cellular service into higher frequency bands. Unlicensed spectrum
could be critical for private networks because, like Wi-Fi, networks could use
this spectrum without having to go through the rigorous process of licensing a
frequency band that may or may not be available.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Release 17 will
"extend the reality</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Release 16 introduced many new
fields for 5G service, but very few of these fields are completed. "<i>The
scope of Release 17 was decided last December. We have a pretty good idea of
what's in there,</i>" says Tseng. In general, that means building on many
of the blocks established in version 16. For example, Version 17 will include
more mechanisms for linking devices together, not just cars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">And it will also include entirely
new elements. Version 17 includes work on extended reality, the umbrella term

include a study to explore the possibility of using frequencies in the 52 to 71

<blockquote>
  <p>This story has a soundtrack – as you read, the music changes.</p>
  <p>Press <span>▶</span> to start.</p>
  <p>Make sure your phone isn't in silent mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kyra pulled off her headphones and dumped them onto her desk. She rubbed her eyes then tried to focus on the room around her. It was dark. It was… some time in the night. Thank goodness she wasn’t on shift tomorrow… today… whatever. The glow from her screen still burned into her eyes so all she saw as she looked around was a black-green haze. She picked up her oversized mug and tried to take a mouthful of cold coffee before coming to the disappointing discovery that it was empty. Optimistically, Kyra tipped it upside down until a single drop landed on her tongue then she glanced back at the confirmation dialog on her screen. Release or cancel?</p>

<p>She spun half way round in her chair, hoping to get some of her sight back. Her rollercat appeared from under her bed, its digital eyes dim red in night mode.</p>

<p>The rollercat was about 10 years old and well overdue for an upgrade but Kyra had become attached to it so had just kept upgrading the firmware. It was a ball suspended in fluid inside another ball. However you turned it, the face stayed upright. Inside the inner ball was a tiny computer, a small screen, a motor and a weight. To move around, the motor moved the weight, the ball rolled, the insides stayed upright. It was simple but it was cute. It liked to think it was deadly.</p>

<p>Rollercat purred inquisitively as it rolled over to her and bumped against her bare toes.</p>

<p>“Hey, kitty. Any messages?”</p>

<p>The quiet ‘dunk’ noise told her there weren’t. The rollercat’s face looked open as it tried to read her expression about whether no messages was a good thing or a bad thing. Seeing the corner of Kyra’s mouth curl up ever-so-slightly in the darkness, rollercat smiled contentedly then rolled back and forth along the side of Kyra’s foot.</p>

<p>Kyra had just spent somewhere between 6 and 12 hours (she couldn’t be sure) putting the final touches on her new project. She’d been working on it every night for the last month. Maybe 2 months. Wait, was it winter yet?</p>

<p>She had just completed a new compiler that matched the interface of The Pool. From the outside, it worked like every other Piece but inside it contained what she hoped would be a completely new method of compilation.</p>

<p>Kyra stood up and, barely looking at the screen, tapped ‘release’ before making the gesture to switch off her screen. Although she had become accustomed to the half-light of her room, she was now in complete darkness and, once again, couldn’t see a damned thing. Moving by memory, she deftly stepped over a pile of books, side-stepped a bicycle wheel and felt gingerly for the ceramic of the sink before hitting her knee on it. She brushed her teeth in darkness then collapsed back onto her bed. Rollercat disappeared under the bed once more and the pale red glow of its eyes faded.</p>

<p>She was exhausted but her brain was still twitching with ideas. Should she have waited? Had she made a mistake? Was this a stupid idea?</p>

<p>She tried to marshal her thoughts into place by letting her mind go back to the beginning. The Pool.</p>

<hr><b data-chapter="the-pool">the-pool</b>

<p>It all started from advances in software engineering. The realisation that music creation was a form of <em>declarative programming</em>. You specify what the outcome should be and the instrument renders it without you digging into the details of exactly how it gets there. Much the same way that mathematical problems found in algebra can be restated in geometric terms to provide greater insight and flexibility, tools and techniques from software engineering were applied to music composition and produced new and interesting solutions, new musical forms.</p>

<p>Of course, the flow went two ways. Once there was a clear relationship between the domains, people began applying musical techniques and solutions to software problems. This led to the development of ‘<em>Intention-Based Programming</em>’ or IBP. Beyond simply declaring the desired state, music could be written that conveyed a specific intention with the actual notes being left up to the player. A representative proof-of-concept compiler was developed that mapped this back into the software domain and it became possible to develop programs simply by stating an intention and leaving the details up to the compilers.</p>

<p>It was around this time that the first form of ‘The Pool’ developed. Musicians have always been inspired by other musicians and software developers have always tried to build on top of the work of others – why build something when you can copy-paste it? This led to the combination of algorithms and musical forms to create new pieces. Soon, there were online spaces where algorithms could be mixed freely and start to affect each other, start to produce hybrid algorithmic and musical works that combined the intentions of multiple developers into a single expression. These online spaces grew and merged. With the community coming together around the specification of the Algorhythmic Interface, all the individual online spaces for musical evolution became interlinked. The growth from then was exponential.</p>

<!--b class="mark" data-chapter="loud" data-if="the-pool" data-when="now" >loud</b -->

<p>As pieces grew and mixed, they began to display emergent behaviour. Popular algorithms would be listened to more and become stronger, they would produce random variations which would go on to merge with other pieces. The resultant new pieces payed homage to their predecessors but grew into something different – sometimes better, sometimes worse.</p>

<p>Soon, people were able to load a combination of sources onto their players and listen to them as they evolved through the day then reconnect to The Pool to release the resultant mix. Traditional musicians and software developers still existed but popular algorithm creators became the new trend setters. They were briefly known as Algorhythmists in the press but were mostly referred to as “beaters” (who focused on rhythmic generation) and “beepers” who created the melodies and chord structures.</p>

<p>Due to the specification of the Algorhythmic Interface, every individual user could have their own interpretation of the music and the same piece could sound like anything from slow romantic strings to breakbeat to metal even though they were all driven by the same numbers and equations. There were also visualisers that interpreted aspects of an algorithm into shapes, colours and movement. There were so many ways to create and consume this new form of expression that in only a few years, it became the dominant way to enjoy music, especially as more and more publishers converted and released their back-catalogues with the “Plays in the Pool™” industry movement. Classics were re-engineered as algorithms and released into The Pool. New developments could then build upon the whole of human musical history.</p>

<p>Kyra started as a developer. In high school, she became fascinated with compilers. Particularly those compilers that are written in the language they are compiling, bootstrapped compilers that build on their own previous generations. After years of dabbling around the edges, Kyra got involved in a few open-source projects. Fixing issues here and there, optimising loops, updating docs.</p>

<p>She was in her first year at college when intention-based programming became a big thing. As soon as she heard of it, she started working on a brand-new compiler from scratch. She wanted to bootstrap it completely so she started at the very lowest level, individual machine instructions running on the bare metal of the computer. Every step of the way, she kept the design principles of IBP in the front of her mind so that she was quickly able to make huge leaps forward in the development. Every time she enabled a new type of intention, she could use that in the next iteration and let the compiler worry about the best way to make that happen. Within a few months, her public repository had gained some attention and by the time the Kyral compiler (yes, she’d named it after herself) hit v1, she was already kinda internet-famous. For a certain definition of famous. In very specialised circles.</p>

<p>The open licence she released it under combined with the fact that it was leaps and bounds better at understanding intention than any of the competitors made her compiler the go-to standard. Soon, nearly every piece of music software and IDE embedded Kyral. One of the largest music publishing companies in the world offered her an in-house position that would let her work full-time on Kyral v2 but she turned them down. Despite never charging anyone for the compiler, Kyra had a donation button on her website with the text “If you like this, feel free to buy me a coffee”.</p>

<p>The donations let Kyra do more than buy a coffee. A large number of musicians had made a large amount of money by building on top of the tool she created and they felt they owed her. She had allowed them to express themselves in a way they’d never been able to before. Before she graduated college (with an average-but-not-great grade), she had a decent stash. Not enough to retire on but enough to let her buy a coffee shop and the apartment upstairs to live in. She served coffee during the daytime and coded at night.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the super high-tech, neon fever-dream of a future she’d imagined growing up but it came with limitless supplies of coffee and, ultimately, wasn’t that the dream of every coder?</p>

<p>With a smile, Kyra turned over on her bed and gave way to sleep.</p>

<hr id="mark-2"><b data-chapter="morning-after">morning-after</b>

<p>The next morning (or maybe afternoon, Kyra really had to get a clock in here…) she woke and groggily stood up. She could hear rollercat bumping around in the hall.</p>

<p>“Kitty?” she yelled “Coffee!”</p>

<p>Probably the single feature that most caused Kyra to to develop an attachment to her rollercat was the fact that it could talk to her coffee machine. Caffenation was just a yell away.</p>

<p>By the time Kyra made it to the kitchen, the espresso was just being pulled and the milk steamed. She put on some toast, grabbed her mug and sat at the table.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have made some famously bad decisions in my life. I am sure you have too. I was taught to work my ass off, and hero-worship street hustle. Maybe you were too. But I was never taught how to make good decisions. I don’t think anyone ever is.&nbsp;</p><p>Is decision making really a fuzzy topic? Do successful people just get lucky, are better at making gut calls or do they really know the science of making good decisions? I have spent the past 1 year consciously learning more about this, and this is what I learnt.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>Good decision vs good execution<br></h2><p>I have no problems with working hard. I am not that smart a person, so whatever little success I have had in my career, was because of hard work. I have been lucky to learn new things every new year (<em>digital marketing after graduating as an engineer, coding last year and Ukulele this year)</em>. Those new skills wouldn’t be possible without good execution.&nbsp;</p><p>Put your head down and execute can never really fail you. But I have learnt to realise the danger of <a href="https://www.inc.com/serhat-pala/alexis-ohanian-says-hustle-porn-is-most-dangerous-trend-in-silicon-valley-heres-how-to-eradicate-it.html" target="_blank">hustle porn</a>. Hard work can’t help you much if it is being applied at the wrong place. </p><figure id="w-node-d99405d490b2-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f2941412b5ceeed77d7fe79_Avg%20decision%20vs%20great%20decision.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Average decision vs great decision.jpg</figcaption></figure><blockquote>It is way more important to work on the right thing at the right time, vs working hard.&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>As a startup CEO in 2015, I used to tell everyone proudly that “<em>My superpower is working harder than others. It’s the only way to beat competition”. </em>What a stupid way to live life. I now spend more time thinking about what to do, vs doing it. I still work 10 hours everyday on Kaapi, and a few times last month I even pulled 16 hour workdays. But I now spend 10 days thinking about the decision, and then 20 days of execution. Those 10 days helped me narrow down on our market (<em>employee engagement &amp; feedback)</em>, find a decent GTM (<em>Slack app)</em> and get our earliest 7 paying customers within few days of public launch.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>Two types of decisions&nbsp;</h2><p>We all make 100s of decisions every day. <em>What to eat? Where to sit? Should I go to sleep now?</em> These are all quick decisions.&nbsp;On the other end you have large life changing decisions e.g. <em>Should I marry this person? Should I go into this new market? Should we build this feature?</em>‍</p><p>If you have read the fabulous book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank">Think fast, and slow</a>”, then you must already be familiar with the concept above. Daniel Kahneman calls this System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 is the quick one at the forefront of our monkey brain, while switching on System 2 is more a conscious effort. You have to force yourself to bring System 2 to the forefront. Slow down, think, analyse, introspect and then make a decision.</p><p>If you work in a fast paced environment, especially tech startups, then most probably you are making decisions via System 1. Yes, yes I know that you did an amazing quarterly <a href="https://www.kaapi.team/blog/a-simple-idiot-proof-guide-to-goal-setting" target="_blank">goal planning exercise</a> with loads of thinking. But did you really? Most startup founders (<em>and me, circa 2015)</em> are so busy fighting fires that planning for 90 days happens over one Friday meeting of 2 hours.</p><p>In almost every business or people decision as a leader, you should be focused on getting your System 2 on the driver seat. System 1 thinking leads to biased thinking, and hence bad decisions. More on that below.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>How do humans make decisions<br></h2><figure id="w-node-a49202773084-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f293fe6798affa281d639fb_Anatomy%20of%20a%20decision.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Anatomy of a decision</figcaption></figure><p>We react to changes around us. An employee leaving your team, a bug in the product or market conditions changing (<em>hello Covid-19!). </em>We take these new inputs, process them (<em>quickly or slowly i.e. System 1 or System 2)</em> and then out comes new decisions. Sounds too fancy? Not really. We do this everyday e.g.&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Feeling hunger (<em>Input</em>) —&gt; Trying to lose weight (<em>framework</em>) —&gt; Order salad</li><li>Feeling hunger (<em>Input</em>) —&gt; Today is Monday, loads of meetings (<em>framework</em>) —&gt; Grab a sandwich on the go</li></ul><p>You make different decisions based on the active framework at that time. And that is real clincher. Apply the wrong mental model, you will make a bad decision.&nbsp;Fall victim to your biases; and you will make a bad decision again. Let’s look in more details at the anatomy of a bad decision.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>This is why we make bad decisions</h2><p>I had this painting on my desk wall for over an year.</p><figure id="w-node-eeaf904367d1-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f293b7f7a1ced87e2e4fc8b_1_71TzKnr7bzXU_l_pU6DCNA.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Cheat sheet of Cognitive Biases - by Buster Benson</figcaption></figure><p>Cognitive biases are little software bugs / viruses in your decision making process. You are not as smart as you think you are. It sucks, but it’s true. Me, you and even Elon Musk suffer from hidden-in-plain-sight cognitive biases which are hardwired into our monkey brain. Our past experiences have shaped our understanding of the world; and that is what we use to make decisions that impact our future.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-bf166dc6030e-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f293ffa79f7b56b4690b56b_This%20is%20why%20we%20make%20bad%20decisions.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Bad decision making</figcaption></figure><p>A few common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a> that you might recognise -&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>‍<strong>Herd mentality</strong> - stock market going up? Damn, you must invest too! All these people must be right&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Self serving bias</strong> - failed an exam because the teacher hated you? Business came crashing down because you think the investors backed out wrongly? You are suffering from a self serving bias. I personally went through this in 2015, and took me almost an year to see things clearly.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>The sunk cost fallacy</strong> - ever felt like continuing on a project because you have already spent so much time on it? Too late to give up?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The first step in making better decisions is to simply learn and recognise these cognitive biases. Before you jump into a new thing, slow down, take a pause, and think about it. I recommend <a href="https://medium.com/thinking-is-hard/4-conundrums-of-intelligence-2ab78d90740f" target="_blank">this cheat sheet.</a></p><h2>The solution - build your own frameworks &amp; mental models&nbsp;</h2><p>As a leader, you would already have a set of values that are close to you. The ones that you never sacrifice. Use those to help you make more logical decisions. Another exercise you can do is to make a list of good decisions you made in the recent past and see the common patterns.&nbsp;</p><p>At Kaapi, almost every big decision now goes through a checklist of frameworks we believe in. We can not optimise for every model all the time, but we definitely try.&nbsp;This one simple change in thinking helped us make a much better GTM decision last quarter - </p><figure id="w-node-88ac2a0d7d00-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f293dfbfd7938923754922c_Finding%20ideas.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Found these scribbles in my notes from March</figcaption></figure><p>I have written down my favourite mental models below, but you should build your own. </p><h2>#1 - Focus on avoiding stupid decisions, not finding brilliant ideas</h2><p>Warren Buffet built his entire empire on this one simple concept vs trying to time the market like other investors. Find good companies, run by good operators, invest in them and then ignore the noise.&nbsp;</p><p>We over complicate things. We all do. But you be better served by simply focusing on not doing the absolute basic things that will fuck up the entire company. If a decision is too complex to make, and has too many variables, we simply say no.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>#2 - Avoid ruin. Survive long enough to get lucky.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>If you can simply focus on not dying, and not going to zero, half your problems will go away. You will automatically end up playing for the long term game. <a href="https://nav.al/kelly-criterion/" target="_blank">Naval Ravikant has a fantastic podcast on this. </a>More below.&nbsp;</p><p>We get too flattered by rags to riches stories on the internet. And by press releases from unicorn companies. What is true for 100 people on average, isn’t true for the one person averaging that same thing 100 times. 1% startups make it big. But it doesn’t mean that if you 100 startups, you will definitely succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly criterion is a mathematical formula that tells you how much you can wager on every hand on the poker table. Simply put, don’t get wiped out. But simply put, don’t get wiped out. Survive long enough to get lucky.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>#3 - Invert, always invert&nbsp;</h2><p>An inversion exercise forces you to look at things from the opposite end first. I learnt this from the <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/" target="_blank">fantastic people at Farnam Street</a>. A good way to get started is to make a list of things that will kill you, and then remove those first. Just do a post-mortem in advance.&nbsp;</p><p>Most difficult problems can be solved if you go backwards first. Need to lose 10 kgs in 2 months? Forward thinking sends you searching for the latest diets. Inversion forces you to ask “<em>What is 100% unhealthy?”</em>. The answer is to stop eating sugar, don’t over eat, love yourself and exercise when you can. If these basic things are covered, that is when you can do the fancy diets.&nbsp;</p><p>As a business leader, take your current project, transport yourself 6 months in the future, and then imagine why that project has failed. Do this exercise with a team or with yourself in a room without any distractions. Think until your brain is bleeding from the ears. Now when you have a list of reasons, solve for them first.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35957157" target="_blank">‍</a></p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35957157" target="_blank">Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke</a> is another great resource on this concept<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>#4 - Play the long term game<br></h2><p><br>I talked a bit about it above, but I love it so much that I am going to repeat myself again -&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“Survive long enough to get lucky.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>Compound interest applies to everything. To the skills you learn, and to the decisions you make. Being 1% better everyday stacks up. You shouldn’t be very bothered by competition, but if you can think in 10 year horizons, then you have already defeated most of your competitors, because they are busy thinking in quarterly timelines.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t have much to add here honestly. Better people than me have talked about it. You should definitely <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/these-billionaire-ceos-see-the-world-differently-because-they-see-time-differently-faa2909e8fa2" target="_blank">read more about how Jeff Bezos &amp; Elon Musk think about this</a>.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>#5 - Analyse 2nd &amp; 3rd order effects of your decision&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>I am a doer and operator at heart. I&nbsp;love jumping into a project and executing things. It took me a sometime to realise that I&nbsp;have a bias for action. Sometimes, the worst thing you can do, is to act. Not making a decision today, can be a good decision. But some fences are there for a reason (<a href="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/" target="_blank"><em>read Chesteron’s Fence</em></a><em>)</em>‍</p><p>Those processes &amp; decisions were made by someone sometime before you. And probably for a valid reason (<em>valid at that time). </em>So before you change things, think a few levels deeper about why that fence exists today.&nbsp;</p><p>Think like a chess grandmaster, not a monkey with a hammer in your hand who must find some nails.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>#6 - Decrease the scope and make small bets&nbsp;</h2><p>Work expands to fill the time allocated to its completion (<em>Parkinson’s Law)</em>. To make sure that you don’t sink a lot on a new decision, put constraints. Constraints are …</p></div></div></div>

posted on Instagram by the company's founders. The message describes Apple's
action as "a blow to Prepear," and indicates the intention to keep
the original logo and "send a message to large technology companies that
intimidation of small businesses has consequences.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

I know there are a lot of heavy things going on in the world right now, and this is nothing in comparison, but I need your help in a situation that is affecting me, my family, and my coworkers. Please help! Many of you know that I started a business called Prepear almost 5 years ago. It is an app that you can store all your recipes in one place, plan your meals, make grocery lists, and get your groceries delivered all in one place. Recently @apple yes, The trillion dollar Apple, has decided to oppose and go after our small business’ trademark saying our pear logo is too close to their apple logo and supposedly hurts their brand? This is a big blow to us at Prepear. To fight this it will cost tens of thousands of dollars. The CRAZY thing is that Apple has done this to dozens of other other small business fruit logo companies, and many have chosen to abandon their logo, or close doors. While the rest of the world is going out of their way to help small businesses during this pandemic, Apple has chosen to go after our small business. I’m not trying to get anyone to stop using or buying Apple products. I feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple's aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.

<span lang="EN-US">The Prepear company has been in
existence for 5 years. It is an application that allows users to store all
their recipes in one place, plan their meals, make shopping lists and have
their groceries delivered to the same place. The application is a derivative of
Super Healthy Kids, which offers recipes and feeding strategies and shares tips
and organizational tools for parents. The founders say they are facing
litigation from Apple. Apple is said to disagree with the Prepear logo, arguing
that its attributes are too similar to its own logo.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

change our logo, which is obviously pear-shaped, used to represent our brand in
recipe management and meal planning,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> wrote the founders
of Prepear in a post on Instagram asking for help. Prepear is a small company
with only five employees, and the founders say legal fees have already cost
them "several thousand dollars", plus the dismissal of one team
member, in their legal battle against the iPhone manufacturer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Prepear also points out that
before "<i>attacking us, Apple opposed dozens of other trademark
applications filed by small companies with fruit-related logos.</i> According
to Prepear, many of these small companies have had to change their logos or
even give up and shut down, as the limited means of most of them did not allow
them to fight the iPhone manufacturer in a lawsuit costing tens of thousands of
dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"It's a very

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Sending a message
against the bullying of small businesses by the largest technology companies</span></span></b></h2>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear, Apple has
opposed small businesses with fruit-related logos by launching costly lawsuits,
even when these logos do not resemble the Apple logo at all or are not in the
same industry as Apple. <i>"We're defending ourselves against Apple not
only to keep our logo, but also to send a message to large technology companies
that intimidation of small businesses has consequences,"</i> said the
company's founders.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">The iPhone In Canada website says
it received, on Sunday, more details on the trademark application for the
pear-shaped logo of Prepear, a free application available for download on iOS
and Android. In an email sent to the website, chief operating officer Russ
Monson says Prepear has been registering its trademark for the logo since
January 2017 and that the U.S. trademark office finally told it "<i>that
it was not in conflict with other registered trademarks and that it would
publish it for opposition.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Everything seemed to
be coming to an end when, on the</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> "<i>last day of the
opposition period for the trademark, we were informed that Apple had requested
an extension of the opposition period, and then requested further extensions,
which placed our trademark in a legal limbo for a long period of time".<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<div>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear's email,
Apple filed its effective opposition on the last day it was legally entitled to
do so. According to Monson, the additional extensions filed resulted in
additional legal costs for the small company, and to him, these extensions
"seemed to have been designed by their legal team to be as long, difficult
and expensive as possible for us.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Monson goes on to explain that
Prepear was "naive enough" to think that they could discuss the issue
with Apple in a rational manner, as the two logos are different. But this was
not the case and the opposition has now reached the "discovery
phase", which, according to the COO, "will be the most expensive part
of this case for us". However, Prepear decided to move on to this phase at
Apple's request.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"We believe that
this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple's
position on this issue, Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than
let the public see how it is clearly hurting us for no apparent justifiable
reason,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> said Monson in his email to iPhone In Canada.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Other companies have
already changed their logos as a result of Apple's lawsuits.</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Some companies whose logos
(below) were attacked by Apple under the same conditions have given up. But the
founders of Prepear say they are lucky enough to attract enough media attention
"to expose this practice by Apple.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Other logos have also been the
source of legal actions brought by Apple in the past, such as the case against
a Norwegian political party and a German bicycle path. The logo of the
political party in question depicts a red apple with a stem, a green leaf and
has the letter F in white on the front. Apple wrote a letter to the Norwegian
Patent and Trademark Office stating that this logo with a red apple looks like
its own logo.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

</div>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US">In 2009, Apple also attacked
Woolworths, an Australian supermarket chain, which had just changed its logo.
Woolworths insisted at the time that its logo is nothing more or less than a
stylized "W", but Apple claimed it was an apple and therefore asked
them to stop using it! Hans Hulsbosch, the creator of the logo, said at the
time that the protection of the Apple logo was "taken to extremes".
"Based on this logic, they should attack all fruit sellers.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Prepear says they are not asking
for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone manufacturer to
"stop attacking small businesses in frivolous affairs that seem designed
to make them spend so much money and time thinking about the business instead
of focusing on how to grow business and ensure to survive the current economic
crisis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The petition on Change.org has
now received 20,000 signatures, and Prepear hopes that Apple will drop the case
before moving on to more costly discovery and trial phases. Otherwise, small
businesses should give up using fruit as a logo for their brand.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Dear New Developer,</p>
<p>Congratulations! Let’s take a moment to celebrate the decision you’ve made to launch or redirect your career. What lies ahead is a lot of hard work, satisfaction, the occasional desire to throw your laptop out a window, and a ton of learning. That’s true of most professions, so you’re also in good company.</p>
<p>As a developer, you will solve a thousand puzzles, and then a thousand more. Your brain will stretch and grow. You will dream about databases or pixels or curly braces. I once had a dream where I was walking down a hallway, but the hallway <em>was my code</em>. It was a good dream. I found a bug.</p>
<p>Greg LeMond, a pro cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner, once said something about cycling that I want to share with you: <img data-attachment-id="6422" data-permalink="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/04/27/it-never-gets-easier-you-just-go-faster/lemond/" data-orig-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png" data-orig-size="355,239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lemond" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=355" src="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=1100" alt="lemond" srcset="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png 355w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=150 150w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></p>
<p>“It never gets easier, you just go faster.”</p>
<p>In so many ways, that describes a career in software. The puzzles you struggle with today will be easy in a month or a year. You’ll learn new patterns and best practices. Then you’ll take on new, harder challenges. You’ll struggle with those and learn and grow. Then you’ll start the cycle (pun intended) all over again.</p>
<p>Something I’ll add, though, is that you’ll be able to approach later challenges with more experience and confidence. What we bring to our jobs is an accumulation of skills and experience. This isn’t linear. It sometimes goes smoothly, sometimes it’s faster than we imagine possible. Then there are stretches where it feels like we’re clambering around in the dark.</p>
<p>For instance, I was once asked to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP</a> application (think super early mobile apps before smart phones existed). I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and I was mostly left alone on the project. I started by drawing some screens, took a deep breath, and started building. It was really tough going, but so many lessons have stuck with me from that experience. My skills at breaking down challenges and approaching them bit by bit really improved. I became comfortable throwing away code because the first code I wrote was atrocious. Plus, the project was eventually canceled, which was entirely the right business decision. Through that, I learned about evaluating tradeoffs in terms of business value—my time was better spent on higher priority projects.</p>
<p>In my current adventure, nearly 20 years later, I’m once again writing a mobile app and applying all of those lessons. Picking up languages and frameworks that I haven’t used before is far less daunting. Ensuring that I’m working on the most important thing is a constant recalibration, but one that is comfortable now. Working through stumbling blocks one at a time and having patterns for getting through them is second nature.</p>
<p>Just like learning isn’t linear, neither are careers. Your path will be your own. What you are doing today may or may not be what you’re doing in ten years. You might go into any number of other areas in software, or stay the course as a developer. It’s your life and all those choices are equally valid. One of my former colleagues quit to make hand-built microphones; another makes goat cheese in the Catalan Pyrenees. My personal philosophy is that at each opportunity to make a career decision, you should pick the direction that interests you most. Just like you learn faster when you are interested in your subject, you will ship better software (or make better cheese) when you are interested in your job.</p>
<p>There’s much more I’d love to tell you, but this letter is growing long. I’ll add some concise tidbits before I end.</p>
<ul>
<li>You belong here. Try not to doubt that.</li>
<li>Get really good at debugging. It’s a skill and you will need it.</li>
<li>If you don’t respect your boss, or if they don’t respect you back, go find a new one.</li>
<li>Learning is part of your job. Make time for it.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to put your code in production.</li>
<li>Be a good team member. You will accomplish more and learn faster.</li>
<li>Ask lots of questions. Someone else probably wants to hear the answer.</li>
<li>And finally, have fun! You’ve got this!</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish you all the luck in the world!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rebecca Campbell</p>

		<p>Let’s talk about a fun RFC that mostly did <em>not</em> make its way into current day Raku, nor is it planned for later implementation.</p>
<p>This is about <a href="https://raku.org/archive/rfc/64.html">RFC 64</a> by Nathan Wiger. Let me quote the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, Perl has had the default “everything’s global” scope. This means that you must explicitly define every variable with my, our, or its absolute package to get better scoping. You can ‘use strict’ to force this behavior, but this makes easy things harder, and doesn’t fix the actual problem.</p>
<p>Those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Let’s fix this.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems <code>use strict;</code> simply has won, despite Nathan Wiger’s dislike for it.</p>
<p>Raku enables it by default, even for one-liners with the <code>-e</code> option, Perl 5 enables it with <code>use 5.012</code> and later versions, and these days there’s even talk to enable it by default in version 7 or 8.</p>
<p>I’d say the industry as a whole has moved in the direction of accepting the tiny inconvenience of having to declare variables over the massive benefit in safety and protection against typos and other errors. Hey, even javascript got a <code>"use strict"</code> and TypeScript enables it by default in modules. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3193072/strict-mode-in-php">PHP 7 also got something comparable</a>. The only holdout in the “no strict” realm seems to be python.</p>
<p>With pretty much universal acceptance of required variable definitions, there was no compelling reason to improve implicit declaration, so no <code>scope pragma was needed.</code></p>
<p>But… there’s always a “but”, isn’t there?</p>
<p>One of the primary motivations for not wanting to declare variables was laziness, and Raku did introduce several features that allow to you avoid some declarations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameters in signatures are an implicit declaration, The RFC’s example <code>sub squre</code> could be written in Raku simply as <code>sub square($x) { $x * $x }</code>. No explicit declaration necessary.</li>
<li>Self-declaring formal parameters with the <code>^</code> twigil also imply a declaration, for example <code>sub square { $^x * $^x }</code>.</li>
<li>There are many functional features in Raku that you can use to avoid explicit variables altogether, like <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Metaoperators">meta operators</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Whatever">Whatever star currying</a> etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am glad Raku requires variable declarations by default, and haven’t seen any code in the wild that explicitly states <code>no strict</code>;. And without declarations, where would you even put the type constraint?</p>

    <p>Software engineers feel uneasy when things aren’t right.</p>

<p>Students or junior engineers are unsettled through unfamiliarity with programming concepts.
Gradually, we are unsettled by abstractions at higher and higher levels.
We’re no longer troubled by a lack of understanding, but instead when systems don’t conform to patterns we know to be sound, or worse, when systems do conform to patterns we know to be harmful.
Refined unease.</p>

<p>We learn that unease is a reliable indicator that we are heading towards a problem.</p>

<p>Good and great engineers feel this unease.
What differentiates the good from the great? Great engineers listen to their intuition, but use their conscious minds to reason about whether something should be done.
Great engineers cultivate space between unease and action.
Great engineers can tolerate imperfection.</p>

<p>All engineering decisions should be made with an understanding of the business context that surrounds them.
Why is this piece of code being written? This must inform the decisions you make.</p>

<p>Imagine that you are developing a system that operates on some data.
Should you persist some data in a database, an ordered log, or a properties file? Does it need to be persisted at all, or would it be acceptable to recompute it on start? Or even to accept that the data will be lost on restart? In a vacuum, it is impossible to argue fruitfully for one of these solutions over any other.</p>

<p>All of these solutions (and more) are reasonable, depending on the context.
They all have tradeoffs: initial implementation effort, running costs, maintenance, monitoring.
But too often I see engineers choose a too-complicated, too-expensive, option because the stupid-simple solution made them uneasy.</p>

<p>Look, I’m not arguing that you should sleepwalk into tech debt.
I’m saying that when you have many options available to you to solve a problem, and the simple option makes you feel uneasy, you should step back and consider <em>why</em>.
Often, there’s a sound reason why the simple solution doesn’t work.
Sometimes there isn’t.
When there isn’t, you save yourself the trouble of implementing the complex solution, and your teammates the trouble of maintaining it.</p>

<p>Until now, I’ve discussed only the tradeoffs involved in writing new software.
But the cardinal sin is to reject imperfection in existing code.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: it doesn’t matter what decision <em>might</em> have been made before this code was written.
The fact is, it exists.
Often it makes us uneasy.
Sometimes the wrong tradeoff was made.</p>

<p>You have a moral obligation to make the code you work on a better place for future engineers.
However, there comes a point (quickly) where re-engineering existing code is a waste of time.
Do the small things that  make the code more hospitable.
If you want to do anything more, consider carefully.</p>

<p>How many times have you heard a teammate say they’re picking up a refactor as part of their ticket only for it to get out of hand and completely halt progress on their primary goal? How many of these refactors are eventually abandoned before completion? How often does this result in two parallel models for the same thing, making the codebase even more confusing?</p>

<p>There are other advantages to tolerating imperfection.</p>

<p><a href="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/">You might not really understand why the code is the way it is</a>.
The original authors might have made the perfect tradeoff, but you can’t see that from your position.
Your unease is unfounded and more akin to that of the junior engineer or student.
Always account for the possibility that your intuition is wrong.</p>

<p>Rewriting a junior engineer’s code demoralises.
If a junior has done something that isn’t right, don’t take it upon yourself to rewrite it.
First, decide if something needs to be done.
Maybe it doesn’t.
If it does, see if you can work with the junior to work towards a better solution.
Now this is a positive learning experience.
There is nothing more discouraging than discovering that a senior silently rewrote your code.</p>

<p>You must be able to tolerate imperfection if you are to get anything done at all.
Nothing we ever do will be perfect.
It’s a fool’s errand to try to make it so.</p>

August 10, 2020 | https://www.workinproduct.com/blog/better-product-positioning-systems-over-statements | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.workinproduct.com/blog/better-product-positioning-systems-over-statements">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Whether you’re a brand new startup, an established mega corp, or somewhere in between, positioning is a critical component of your go-to-market. The difference between a growth sensation and a mega flop can come down to a number of things, but many times it’s how the product was positioned in the market.<br></p>
              <p>Like any craft, there’s an art to product positioning – it’s both a <strong>declaration</strong> and a <strong>hypothesis</strong> designed to align teams around <em>who we’re going after, with what story, and why we’ll win</em>. It takes a concerted cross-functional team effort of research and analysis combined with data and intuition to come up with a strong position, but most important of all, where you land has to be differentiated and defensible to really make an impact.&nbsp;<br></p>
              <p>Two things are of the utmost importance with any positioning exercise – <strong>focus</strong> and <strong>repeatability</strong>. It’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to be everything for everyone. It’s also easy to fall into the trap of building something that nobody (but you) cares about. Product development and positioning go hand-in-hand, and it’s a constant balancing act to make sure you’re building the right things for enough of the right people to effectively grow the business.&nbsp;<br></p>
              <p>The standard practice of product positioning has been to write out a statement based on the following template:<br></p>
              <p><em>For [target customer] who [statement of need or opportunity] the [product name] is a [product category] that [statement of key benefit]. Unlike [primary competitive alternative], our product [statement of primary differentiation].</em><br></p>
              <p>I’ve written this statement numerous times throughout my career for various products across a wide range of markets. The thing is, it never sat well with me – I always felt like I was just going through the motions, lacking real meaning or action. Then last year, I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Obviously-Awesome-Product-Positioning-Customers/dp/1999023005">April Dunford’s book <em>Obviously Awesome</em></a>, which validated my feelings while providing an alternative viewpoint. Since then, I’ve thought of <strong>positioning as a system, not as a statement</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>What is a Positioning System?</h3>
              <p>Just like a Design System forms the foundation for design teams, a Positioning System forms the foundation for go-to-market teams. Before getting to a definition, let’s first level-set on the goals of product positioning – you need to be able to answer the following questions with clarity and confidence:<br></p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Do we truly understand the motivations of our audience?</li>
                <li>Are we building the right product for our audience?</li>
                <li>Is our audience large enough to grow the business?</li>
                <li>Is our story unique enough to establish ourselves in the market?</li>
                <li>Is our value strong enough to win customers over alternatives?<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Whether your product vision is to become a market leader, create a new category, or to define a new experience, having alignment on these questions is critical. There’s a near infinite amount of considerations that could go into answering these questions, which is why it warrants a system to reconcile the ever-changing landscape of your product and your market. A simple definition is as follows:</p>
              <blockquote><em>A </em><strong><em>Positioning System</em></strong><em> contains the market intelligence and customer patterns used to uncover and define your unique value proposition that drives your go-to-market strategy and execution plan.</em></blockquote>
              <figure id="w-node-f8986614e84a-e088abcc">
                <p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e75113aa424bfd8d788abb6/5f2b58fb97b36021c5392c29_system-gtm.png" alt="Positioning System"></p>
              </figure>
              <p>The “North Star” of the business is your unique value proposition – <em>what makes you different from others, and what value does that bring to the market</em>? While you and your team are subject matter experts, your unique value proposition shouldn’t just come from a hunch, it should come from having a true understanding of your customer base. Having a system designed for deriving actionable intelligence is a better and stronger foundation to build from, and a more adaptable mechanism to iterate from – both for your product development and for your go-to-market. It takes work, but the work will most certainly accelerate your growth from the clarity and confidence you gain.<br></p>
              <p><em>Note: I’ve created this system as it relates to our business at Okta and my role leading Product Marketing for emerging products, however I do believe that this can be generally repurposed for any B2B business with modifications that match the specifics of your product and market. To be honest, though, I’m not sure how translatable this is to B2C products – I’m a dummy in that space.</em></p>
              <h3>The Elements of a Positioning System</h3>
              <p>The elements of the system consist of the market intelligence needed to identify repeatable customer patterns. It’s these repeatable patterns that feed the strategy and execution of your go-to-market plan. A shared trait of every successful product business is a well oiled go-to-market machine. Rarely does it start that way, though. It takes a lot of learnings along the way, which is what makes this market intelligence so valuable.<br></p>
              <p>Elements include:<br></p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>Market segments: </strong>the characteristics and behaviors of your target customers grouped as segments. Ex: high growth tech startups scaling the business, transformative mega enterprises adopting the cloud, old media companies building streaming services, etc. What are these companies trying to accomplish and where do you fit in the picture?</li>
                <li><strong>Customer personas: </strong>the characteristics and behaviors of the individuals involved in evaluating, purchasing, adopting, and using your product. These could be buyers, influencers, or champions of your product. What are they on the hook for and how can you help?&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Initiatives &amp; projects: </strong>the big picture themes that companies and people are focused on, and the explicit budgeted projects that go with them. Ex: Shift to remote work -&gt; adopt multifactor authentication. Migrate to the cloud -&gt; secure AWS environments. Digital transformation -&gt; instrument CI/CD pipelines.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Value drivers: </strong>the quantitative and qualitative outcomes companies and people need to solve for as a function of their initiatives &amp; projects. Ex: 2x lower TCO on a category of software, 10x faster time to delivery, a happier and more productive workforce, easier ways to achieve compliance requirements, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Competition: </strong>the products and methods within an organization that you are trying to beat, replace, or change. Competition isn’t limited to other vendors in your space – do-it-yourself or do-nothing-at-all are both viable competition for many product categories.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Note: It wouldn’t be a proper post about positioning (say that 5 times fast) if I didn’t mention that the best way to gather this information is to speak with customers and prospects. Depending on the maturity of your product and go-to-market, much of this intelligence will come through the natural course of business provided your team is taking good notes. But don’t sit back and wait for it to come, be proactive about seeking out this intelligence. Good product professionals listen to customer feedback; great ones ask for it.</em></p>
              <h3>The Patterns of a Positioning System</h3>
              <p>Market intelligence that isn’t actionable isn’t very smart. Neither is positioning that won’t grow the business. Because focus and repeatability are of the utmost importance, you need to be able to identify patterns so you can effectively scale your go-to-market around what works, and avoid wasting cycles on what doesn’t work.<br></p>
              <p>The patterns you should seek out apply to the entire customer journey – from awareness to consideration to adoption to retention to advocacy. For the purposes of this blog post, I’ve chosen five key patterns I’ve identified within my own version of this system, but the possibilities could be endless provided they are relevant and actionable to your product and market.<br></p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>Good Fit/Bad Fit Accounts: </strong>your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is the type of customer most willing, able, and eager to buy your product. But you likely won’t get too far only directly targeting your ICP - you also need to be able to quickly identify patterns about good fit/bad fit accounts so you know how to effectively qualify opportunities as they appear. Your eventual sales enablement functions will heavily depend on these patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Strongest Demand Channels:</strong> there’s a million and one ways to promote your product to drive awareness and adoption (for better or for worse). You need to be able to identify where and how your target audience discovers and evaluates new products to maximize conversion. Patterns here will feed into your Marketing &amp; Demand Gen plan – there’s nothing worse than spending big bucks on channels where your audience doesn’t hang out.</li>
                <li><strong>Most Compelling Events: </strong>company initiatives &amp; projects have varying levels of urgency. The patterns to identify are <em>what is getting the most attention from the right people</em>, and <em>where is the budget being spent</em>. Insight here will help your team build laser focused sales &amp; marketing playbooks focused on solving the top needs &amp; wants of your target audience. Without a sense of urgency, sales cycles can really lag.</li>
                <li><strong>Win/Loss Reasons: </strong>strong positioning is about confidently declaring <em>why you’ll win in the market</em>. As positioning is also a hypothesis, you’ll need evidence of this in practice so you can iterate accordingly. Are you consistently winning against certain competitors? Losing against others? Why is that? Are people choosing to stick with the status quo over your solution? Then you’ll need to adjust your message.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Business Outcomes:</strong> value drivers only matter if they are realized. Are those who adopt your product being successful with it? If so, what are their real world gains? Value selling requires proof – if you can show patterns of successful customers in practice, you’re in a great place to widen your reach.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Note: It also wouldn’t be a proper post about positioning (can you say that 5 times fast yet?) if I didn’t have a …</em></p></div></div>

<p>The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and
            “What’s wrong with SQL?”.  This post contains answers to both.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational
            model came to be, and how SQL was created.</p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql">
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>A Brief History of the Relational Model and SQL</h2>
<p>The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper
                “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” <span>[<a id="id1" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1970">4</a>]</span>.
                There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in
                terms of sets of tuples, called <em>relations</em>. Codd also invented a form of
                first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: <em>tuple
                    relational calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Codd’s ideas were revolutionary.  For the first time, a database,
                and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent
                mathematical model.  This, naturally, created lots of interest in further
                research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational
                model.</p>
<p>In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper
                <span>[<a id="id2" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-1974">2</a>]</span>, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular
                structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”.
                Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed
                at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in
                mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of
                the language would be for ad-hoc queries” <span>[<a id="id3" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-2012">3</a>]</span>.  Initially,
                the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language.  Nonetheless,
                the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had
                pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by
                their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.</p>
<p>IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time,
                so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper
                standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that
                essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations
                of SQL.  Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily
                influenced by the commercial vendors.</p>
<p>Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language.  But that does
                not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do.
                In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with
                “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with
                a baggage of severe issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="critique-of-sql">

<p>SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts,
                including Codd himself <span>[<a id="id4" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span>, as well as C. J. Date, who published a
                multitude of papers and books on the subject (<span>[<a id="id5" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1985">7</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id6" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>,
                <span>[<a id="id7" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-2009">10</a>]</span>).  While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later
                versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further
                ingrained.</p>
<p>Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific
                to a certain implementation.  We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the
                examples.</p>
<p>SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with
                        application languages and protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="lack-of-orthogonality">

<p>Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
                    of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
                    A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is
                    easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of
                    rules.  Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many
                    exceptions and caveats.</p>
<p>A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to
                    substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function
                    call, without any effect on the final result.</p>
<p>In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are <em>two</em>
                    mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>table expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a table:
                            <code>SELECT * FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>scalar expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value:
                            <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table expressions can only be used in a <code>FROM</code> clause, in a function, or with
                    an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input.
                    What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax,
                    which can be a source of further confusion.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department
                    heads in a company.  This query would do the job:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> name
<span>FROM</span> emp
<span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span></span></span></pre>
<p>Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts
                    information about a department.  An intuitive way is to simply add the
                    above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> name <span>FROM</span> emp
     <span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span> <span>AND</span> deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>This is legal, but <em>only</em> if the subquery returns not more than one row.
                    Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time.  To account for multiple
                    department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    head<span>.</span>name

<div><p>Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality.
                        Some call it an elephant on clay feet.  With each addition, its body grows,
                        and it becomes less stable.  SQL standardization is largely the domain of
                        database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests
                        or users with user interests. <span>[<a id="id8" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fatzeni-2013">1</a>]</span></p><p>Paolo Atzeni et al.</p></div>
<p>SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL
                    implementation contains <b>469 keywords</b>. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the
                    SQL:2016 standard has <b>1732 pages</b>.</p>
<p>The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be
                    an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”.  However, with the
                    growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed <em>negatively</em> to the
                    ability to write and comprehend SQL queries.  We learnt this lesson with
                    COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct
                    programming languages.</p>
<p>In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed
                    above make queries more verbose and harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-consistency">

<p>SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What
                    makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version
                    of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span> <span>from</span> <span>8</span> <span>for</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>SELECT</span> trim<span>(</span>both <span>from</span> <span>'yxSQLxx'</span><span>,</span> <span>'xyz'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> extract<span>(</span><span>day</span> <span>from</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>'2001-02-16 20:38:40'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></span></pre>
<p>There are two syntaxes that specify the ordering of the input set in an
                    aggregate function:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> array_agg<span>(</span>foo <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> rank<span>(</span>foo<span>)</span> <span>WITHIN</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The list of inconsistencies like this does not end here and can be continued,
                    but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

<div><p>In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information,
                        the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the
                        relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies
                        of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. <span>[<a id="id9" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span></p><p>Edgar J. Codd</p></div>
<p>It has been extensively argued that <code>NULL</code> is the biggest misfeature of SQL
                    (<span>[<a id="id10" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1987">5</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id11" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1986">8</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id12" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>).
                    In fact, the handling of <code>NULL</code> in contemporary SQL implementations is so
                    surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate
                    section.</p>
<p><code>NULL</code> is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# select NULL = NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In fact, almost any operation on <code>NULL</code> will return <code>NULL</code> and the
                    effect may be very subtle:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# CREATE TABLE x (a int, b text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO x(a, b)
           VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (NULL, 'three')
           RETURNING a, b;
 a |   b

 1 | one
 2 | two
   | three
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM x WHERE a NOT IN (1, null);
 a | b
---+---
(0 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>But, in some cases <code>NULL</code>
<em>is</em> equal to itself, such as in <code>DISTINCT</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# SELECT DISTINCT *

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> <em>TensorFlow’s tf.data API is a popular approach to loading data into deep learning models. Although tf.data has a lot of powerful features, it is built around sequential access to the underlying data set. This design makes it difficult to efficiently shuffle large data sets, to shard data when doing distributed training, and to implement fault-tolerant training. We argue that random access should be a key consideration when building deep learning data APIs.</em></p>

<p>There are <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/building-an-enterprise-deep-learning-platform/">many pitfalls</a> engineering teams can fall into when building an end-to-end enterprise deep learning platform. One of the most common problems involves data loading. Data loading during training is often overlooked, and it can have massive implications for throughput. Machine learning frameworks provide abstractions that attempt to make data loading straightforward, but peeking behind the curtain of these seemingly simple interfaces can reveal surprising problems. In this post, we’ll be taking you behind the scenes of a popular data loading API: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset">TensorFlow Datasets</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://determined.ai/assets/images/posts/tf-sucks-meme.jpg" alt="We’ve peeked behind the curtain of TensorFlow Datasets to reveal some glaring problems"></p>

<p>There are two fundamental patterns that a data loading interface can use, <strong>random access</strong> and <strong>sequential access</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="random-access">Random Access</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access">Random access</a> is the ability to access any element of a dataset efficiently. In Python, random access is often done by indexing into a list (i.e., <code>data[index]</code>), which calls <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__"><code>__getitem__()</code></a> behind the scenes. PyTorch uses this approach to define the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#map-style-datasets">map-style dataset</a> interface (implemented above). Random-access data loader interfaces may also require that a user specify the entire length of the dataset (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__"><code>__len__()</code></a>).</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>torch.utils.data</span>

<span>class</span> <span>RandomAccessDataset</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>utils</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>Dataset</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__len__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__getitem__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>):</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Any</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Deep learning data APIs that support random access include <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/Sequence">tf.keras.utils.Sequence</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset">torch.utils.data.Dataset (Map Style)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sequential-access">Sequential Access</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_access">Sequential access</a> is a paradigm where elements must be accessed in a predetermined order, typically through an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator">iterator</a>. In Python, sequential access is often implemented via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types">iterators</a> and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr">yield expression</a>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>sequential_dataset</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>data</span><span>:</span>
        <span>yield</span> <span>item</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Some deep learning frameworks, such as <a href="https://keras.io/">early versions of Keras</a>, natively support expressing your data input pipeline as a Python generator. Similarly, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data">TensorFlow Datasets</a> are built around sequential data access. Converting a Python generator into a TensorFlow Dataset is straightforward, if a little verbose:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>itertools</span>

<span>def</span> <span>gen</span><span>():</span>

        <span>yield</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss the drawbacks of using sequential access as a data loader.</p>

<p>TensorFlow’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data">tf.data</a> API makes it easy to structure your data loading code in an elegant way: you can chain together a stream of operations on a dataset using lazy initialization, and tf.data provides helper APIs to do common tasks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#prefetch">prefetching</a> and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance#parallelizing_data_extraction">parallel data loading</a>.</p>

<p>However, <strong>TensorFlow Dataset are fundamentally built around sequential access</strong>: each operator in a tf.data pipeline iterates over its input and produces a sequential output stream that is consumed by the next operator. The API does not support random access, which leads to some major issues trying to implement some common machine learning workflows.</p>

<h2 id="data-shuffling">Data Shuffling</h2>
<p>When training a deep learning model, the training set is often <em>shuffled</em> before being fed into the model — <a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/24511/why-should-the-data-be-shuffled-for-machine-learning-tasks">this typically improves generalization performance</a>. If our data API only supports sequential access, how can we implement random shuffling? A simple but inefficient approach would be to read as much data as we can into memory and shuffle it there. In fact, that’s exactly what <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#shuffle">tf.data’s shuffle()</a> method does!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This dataset fills a buffer with <code>buffer_size</code> elements, then randomly samples elements from this buffer, replacing the selected elements with new elements. For perfect shuffling, a buffer size greater than or equal to the full size of the dataset is required.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For datasets that don’t fit entirely into memory (the most common case in deep learning), <strong>shuffle() doesn’t actually shuffle the full dataset!</strong> This means that shuffle() doesn’t have the intended effect in most applications. Many practitioners, including us, have made this error and seen their model’s generalization performance suffer as a result. Although it is possible to <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/14857#issuecomment-347261151">shuffle your entire dataset</a> ahead of time by loading the data into memory or shuffling a list of filenames, many users might not realize this problem exists in their code!</p>
<h2 id="data-sharding">Data Sharding</h2>
<p>When doing <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/distributed-deep-learning-that-actually-works/">data-parallel distributed training</a>, each worker (typically a GPU) is trained on a fraction (or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)">shard</a>” ) of the data in each batch. To handle this common task, tf.data provides a method that seems like a perfect fit: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#shard">shard(n,i)</a> splits a dataset into n shards and returns the i’th shard for further processing in the current worker.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s a catch: <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e26286914b6d3cf7ed0c9a47f50c07391c2174a6/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/shard_dataset_op.cc#L139">shard() iterates over the entire input dataset</a>, returning every n’th record and ignoring the rest! That means that if you apply shard() to a large dataset during distributed training, each worker in the distributed training job will end up reading the entire dataset. If you’re training a model with 64 GPUs, that means you’ll be doing <strong>64x more disk I/O than you probably intended</strong>. It gets even worse if you’re doing on-the-fly data augmentation before the shard() operator in your pipeline — those data augmentation operations will be done redundantly by every worker.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#shard">TensorFlow documentation</a> acknowledges this and observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Generally it is best if the shard operator is used early in the dataset pipeline.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>TensorFlow’s recommended approach is to create a dataset of TFRecord file names and apply <code>shard()</code> to this list. Each worker receives a disjoint set of files to process, which avoids any unnecessary disk I/O. This approach works, but it has two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to split your data set into a larger number of files than the number of workers in your distributed training job. If you have a large dataset stored in a small number of files, you’re out of luck. Moreover, any size imbalances between those files will result in stragglers, hurting training performance.</li>
<li>More likely, you might not realize any of this! A lot of real-world data loading code just converts a Python generator into a TensorFlow Dataset using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#from_generator"><code>Dataset.from_generator()</code></a>. This will appear to work okay at small scale, but will quickly run into serious performance problems as your data set grows.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="saving-and-restoring-iterator-state">Saving and Restoring Iterator State</h2>
<p>If you want to build a deep learning training system that can recover from faults, <a href="https://twitter.com/neil_conway/status/1283091458069692416?s=20">a common approach is to use checkpoint-restart</a>: periodically save the state of the job to a checkpoint file, and, when a failure occurs, restore the job from the most recent checkpoint. This is particularly important for training jobs that can last hours or even days. However, saving and restoring a training job requires knowing the job’s position in the dataset.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re training on a 100,000-element dataset and the most recent checkpoint was taken after the 50,000th record, you’ll want to ensure that training resumes at the 50,001th record instead of restarting from the beginning. With a random-access interface, this is trivial: just save the index position as an integer and pick up where you left off when restoring. With a sequential-access interface, this can be really hard. Python generators are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7180212/why-cant-generators-be-pickled/7180424#7180424">notoriously hard to pickle</a>. TensorFlow datasets have <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/make_saveable_from_iterator">experimental support</a> for checkpointing and restoring some types of datasets, but not those created with <code>tf.data.Dataset.from_generator()</code>.</p>

<p>All of the above problems exist because tf.data is built around sequential access. So do yourself a favor: don’t restrict your entire data loading codebase to sequential access patterns. If you would like to apply prefetching and a functional style with a sequential access pattern, you can always wrap a random access interface as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>dataset</span> <span>=</span> <span>RandomAccessDataset</span><span>()</span>

<span>def</span> <span>sequential_access_dataset</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>index</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>dataset</span><span>)):</span>
        <span>yield</span> <span>dataset</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>It’s easy to go from random to sequential! But going the other way is much harder.</em></p>
<p>TensorFlow Datasets are currently the recommended way to load data in TensorFlow, and it doesn’t look like that is going to change any time soon. Many readers of this article might find themselves in the unfortunate position of being stuck with TensorFlow Datasets due to forces beyond their control. If this is you, we’ve been hard at work on a solution that will make your life easier—stay tuned for more next week!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> We’ve released <a href="https://github.com/determined-ai/yogadl">YogaDL</a>, a library for deep learning data loading that addresses a lot of the concerns described above.

                            	<p>For the past two years our Constellation design systems team has run a weekly drop-in clinic. </p>
                            	<p>It's proved an excellent way to get to know our consumers, increase engagement and visibility. We've had many ups and downs (and the odd dinosaur!) so I thought I would document what we've learned.</p>


							<h2> Why a drop-in clinic?</h2>
							<p>Running a drop-in was the idea of our then design systems head Lily Dart. Our <a href="https://www.gerireid.com/design-systems.html">design system</a> was new, we needed consumers, contributors and to get our message out to thousands of developers and designers across the country. </p>

<p>We decided to run a drop-in each Thursday afternoon. We would sit around a table in our London office and run a call for folks outside London. We invited product people to come and talk to us about their problems and learn how to consume our growing component library.</p>
<p>We didn't have all the answers but between us we had a broad range of product design, content, accessibility and engineering skills. We'd use the downtime between visitors to run our team show-and-tells and chat through relevant team stuff while we were all together.</p>



<h2>If you build it, they will come</h2>

<p>For the first few weeks we sat there looking eager and NO-ONE SHOWED UP. It was like being that kid who throws a party and no-one comes (apart from the kid who is there to take photos to post on Insta to cement your loser status forever).</p><p>Occasionally someone mooched past and idly nibbled our biscuits. Our UX designer went into a meeting room and phoned us and we got excited because we thought we had a real customer.</p>

<h2> Go where the people are</h2>

<p>We got feedback and realised we were in the wrong location. Most London product labs had moved to a different building so we found a room there instead. It was actually a nice shout to get the team together at a different location each week. It took us out of the day-to-day and meant we often had lunch together.</p>

<p>Word slowly spread and visitors started to trickle in with one or two teams stopping by each week. We upped our biscuit game and lured people in with donuts and stickers.</p>



<p>Gradually drop-in afternoons started to fill up. Designers realised we were an extra pair of eyes to help unpick a UX problem or help with a new pattern. Developers came with accessibility bugs off the back of testing and we were able to fix problems blocking their release. Because we got visibility over many different product journeys we were able to connect teams who were trying to solve a similar problem, like a low-budget UX dating agency.</p> 

      <p><img src="https://www.gerireid.com/img/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Designer dressed as a dinosaur">
	</p>

<p>Some afternoons were so full we joked we needed to install one those supermarket deli-counter ticketing machines. One week we even helped a dinosaur.</p>

          

<h2>Running remotely during Covid</h2>

<p>When the Covid lockdown started we continued to run the weekly call from home. It was quiet for the first couple of weeks as teams settled into a new routine but demand quickly picked up. </p>

<p>We had always run drop-in on a 'first-come-first-served' basis but we fast discovered this didn't work online. We asked teams to pre-book slots. I was reluctant to introduce a booking system as it's not really our team's vibe but I was proved wrong. Pre-booking has helped us structure the sessions and anticipate what is coming. If you don't want to book you can still phone in anytime and wait until we're free.</p>

<p>One learning from running remotely has been how unintentionally London-centric our previous efforts were. We focused on supporting London teams we could meet face-to-face and the dial-in was a bit of an afterthought. Running remotely has meant we have engaged with product teams from all over the country. We need to maintain these relationships when we move back to an office setup and make the dial-in the focus.</p>

<h2>3 most common themes</h2>

<p>After running around 100 clinics it's been interesting to see themes emerge. We see a lot of form journeys for customers to apply for products like insurance, accounts, cards and mortgages. But we've also seen our components used in ways we never anticipated which is super cool. These are the 3 most common things we see...</p>

<h3>1. Overcomplicating it</h3>

<p>80% of our advice is just suggesting designers remove stuff, simplify and consider plain text or an input box instead of a fancy widget. We see a lot of accordions. Accordions inside accordions inside accordions, like some heinous accordion inception plot.

</p><h3>2. Offering the user choice when there is no choice</h3>

<p>This is the probably the most common problem we see across journeys. The appearance of choice between options when only one choice is available based on the user selection.</p><p>"<em>Remove the illusion of choice if there is no choice</em>" sounds like something Yoda might say, if he worked on a design system.</p>

<h3>3. Our product needs a large / red / yellow / flashing / arrow-shaped button</h3>

<p>We fought this fight so many times we called on the services of a behavioural economist to prove how different colours, shapes and prominence influence consumer behaviour. It can lead user's decisions and potentially encourage outcomes that may not always be in the customer's best interest. These incremental inconsistencies also result in long term design debt. This <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/occasional-papers/op17-26.pdf">FCA paper</a> has come in handy.</p>


<h2>Drop-ins wins</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement and visibility</strong>. As a design system we are open to a good discussion, we're transparent and there for our consumers. We're here to give advice but we're not the design police. If your research and testing goes against our advice we're keen to learn from it and update our guidance.</li>

<li><strong>Contributions</strong>. We love contributions! If a pattern has tested well, is accessible to all and will be useful across many journeys then we are always keen for teams to contribute. You're our favourite customer, have a sticker AND a biscuit. 🍪</li>

<li><strong>Bug fix</strong>. Most weeks someone drops in to report a bug with our code or design libraries. We fix this for the next release and it's fixed for everyone. Small quick wins.</li>

<li><strong>Visibility</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong> across brands and products. We've been slowly able to connect teams working on similar patterns which saves time and money and builds relationships.</li>

<li><strong>Time-boxing</strong> everyone's ad-hoc requests to one afternoon a week. We all receive a lot of individual queries and it's great to be able to say "book a slot on Thursday and we'll run through together then".</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're a design systems team I would highly recommend a regular drop-in session. If you have any queries about ours <a href="https://twitter.com/gerireid">say hi</a> 👋</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>



<p>It has been brought to my attention that there was a mistake by an entry level employee. </p>



<p>So the Revenue Department itself was supposed to get all the NOCs required by going to all those offices, but an entry level employee forgot to add my file to the list of NA’s to be done.</p>



<p>So now I have been told that all the NOC’s will be taken care of by the Revenue Department, Collector Office. </p>



<p>If any legal fees need to be paid, I will be informed by the Collector office (without me requiring to go to every office) and everything will be done in less than 2 months.</p>



<p>I am thankful to everyone for sharing my experience far and wide. But now my experience stands cleared and so does this post. </p>



<p>A lot of people have helped reach this post to very very high-in-the-hierarchy people in the state and central government as well as major national political parties. I am really very thankful to everyone.</p>



<p>I will try again in a few months and keep surveying the experience of people who get their NA done. Thank you again for all the co-operation.</p>



<p>I am also writing a post about “the real process required to obtain the NA permission”. I will try to get the higher authorities from the Collector office to record a video stating the actual procedure required and will publish such article soon.</p>



<p>Again Thank You Very Much.</p>



<p>I have removed the original post. I will update with next steps soon. </p>

<p>I use Spotify on my computer from time to time but I hate when the Ads start playing.</p>

<p>I don’t mind having a <strong>break</strong> between a few songs, but I don’t wanna hear the Ads, so I decided to create a small script to hack it.</p>



<ol>
  <li>Open the application <strong>Terminal</strong>. Search it inside your <strong>Applications</strong> folder or using <strong>Spotlight search</strong> (cmd+space bar) and type <strong>terminal.app</strong></li>
  <li>
    <p>Inside that white window (that’s the terminal app) paste this command and then hit enter</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>mkdir -p ~/MuteSpotifyAds &amp;&amp; curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gdi3d/mute-spotify-ads-mac-osx/master/NoAdsSpotify.sh &gt; ~/MuteSpotifyAds/NoAdsSpotify.sh
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>This will create a new folder inside your Home folder called <code>MuteSpotifyAds</code> and will place a new file called <code>NoAdsSpotify.sh</code></li>
  <li>
    <p>To run the program just copy and paste the code below in the terminal and hit enter</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>sh ~/MuteSpotifyAds/NoAdsSpotify.sh
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Open Spotify and enjoy!</li>
  <li>After you’re done listening to your tracks you can close this application by <strong>closing the terminal app</strong>. <strong>Remember: You need to run this program the next time you open Spotify if you want to mute the Ads (steps 1 and 4)</strong></li>
</ol>


<ol>
  <li>Go to your home folder (the one with the 🏠 icon) using the <strong>Finder</strong></li>
  <li>Make sure you’re not running the program (step 6 in the list above)</li>
  <li>Find the folder called <code>MuteSpotifyAds</code> and delete it.</li>
</ol>



<p>I used to have all the Spotify Ads DNS blocked but that stopped working.</p>

<p>Besides, I was bored that Saturday noon and I wanted to give it a try.</p>



<ol>
  <li>Using OSX log system I can listen to Spotify events.</li>
  <li>Read the events and check if an Ad is about to be played.</li>
  <li>If the event is an Ad about to be played <strong>automatically mute system audio</strong>.</li>
  <li>If the next event is a song, <strong>unmute system audio</strong>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Here’s the repo if you want to know more:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My friend Juan Paucar directed me to a paper from the magnificent <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030171834">Programming Languages and Systems
28th European Symposium on Programming, ESOP 2019</a>, related to Codata. I have been very interested in codata, mainly because it relates to data in a category-theory way, but, as usual, I didn't understand many of the words involved. This paper helped me understand a lot, and also helped me understand and shape my mind on how to connect the worlds of FP and OOP. But, before that, we must go on tour over a bit of theory.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Data, better understood as Haskell's <code>data</code> declaration, is nothing more than a type and a bunch of ways (functions) to create values of that type. I'm going to use the GADT syntax just because it makes the functions visible. Here is an example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the folks that don't grasp GADTs yet, the above is equivalent to:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>Foo1</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Foo2</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But with the GADT syntax we can see the functions. <code>Foo1</code> is a constructor, but also a function. <code>Foo1</code> receives an Int and a String, and constructs a value of type <code>Foo</code>. Exactly the same happens with <code>Foo2</code>.</p>
<p>We just talked about constructors: a constructor is nothing more than a function that manufactures a value out of other values. But that pretty much defines every function as a constructor, which isn't helpful. We'll go a bit further: a constructor is a "primitive" function that makes a value of type T, and is not build out of other functions that make a value of type T. Also, a constructor is the function you define when you write a <code>data</code> declaration.</p>
<p>If there are constructors, there should be something that dismantles data, because data seems to be constructed by aggregating values. This thing that deconstructs data is called "eliminators". The universal eliminator in Haskell is the <code>case</code> statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>case</code> statement accepts a parameter (what you put between the <code>case</code> and the <code>of</code>) and returns a value of some type. That's why all the branches in a <code>case</code> statement must have the same type, because when you write a <code>case</code> statement, you are writing a function like <code>mycase :: Foo -&gt; X</code>, but with a nicer syntax.</p>
<p>This means eliminators are not always in the shape of <code>case</code> statements. In reality, eliminators are just functions, and Haskell provides special syntax for these functions to be written in a better way. But, if we go to Lisp, for example, we also have constructors and eliminators.</p>
<p>In Lisp you can manufacture a list with a new head by using the constructor <code>cons</code> (this is why these data structure is called a <code>cons-cell</code>). <code>cons</code> is just another function with two parameters: the head and the tail of the list to be constructed, and returns the list. To destructure a cons-list, you have two eliminators: <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. <code>car</code> takes a list and returns the head, <code>cdr</code> takes the list and returns the tail.</p>
<p>Haskell also offers eliminators, but everyone frowns at you if you use them too much: when you declare a record datatype, Haskell helpfully creates functions to access each of the fields:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>=</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fooField1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>fooField2</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>}</span>




</code></pre></div>
<p>Everyone frowns at you when you use these accessors because if <code>FooRecord</code> has more than a single constructor, and you use an eliminator for the other constructor, your program blows up in flames. This is no different to how <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> blow up in flames when you pass as parameter an empty list.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is that <code>data</code> is a declaration that offers a bunch of different ways to create a value, and your program chooses which one interests you for the current case.</p>
<h2>Category Theory</h2>
<p>Category Theory is a branch of Mathematics mainly used by haskellers to annoy everyone else. But, believe it or not, it's also useful to reason about programs. In Category Theory we have objects and we have arrows that interconnect the objects. For something to be a Category, its objects and arrows have to obey some rules.</p>
<p>One of the constructs of Category Theory is the co-category. A co-category is a category where the arrows have been reversed. If in category X, an arrow goes from A to B, in the category co-X, the arrow goes from B to A.</p>
<p>At this point, "codata" should be suspicious to you. It totally looks like "co-data", the co-category of "data". But, how does it actually look the category of "data"?</p>
<h3>The Category of data</h3>
<p>The "data" category is revealed to us as the <code>data</code> declaration. Let's have another look at the <code>Foo</code> example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case (but not in all categories) the types are the objects and the functions are the arrows. If we massage a little bit the code above, by using uncurrying, we can get to a data format that is a bit less arrow-ish and easier for our purposes:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now <code>Foo1</code> takes a pair of Int and String and returns a <code>Foo</code>, and <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Bool</code> and returns a <code>Foo</code>. This is pretty much what every haskeller already knows: you don't have a <code>Foo</code> via <code>Foo1</code> until you provide both the <code>Int</code> and the <code>String</code>, no matter how many arrows are in the middle.</p>
<p>And now, the case statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's massage it a little bit to turn it into a function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>fooEliminator</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Foo</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>fooEliminator</span> <span>(</span><span>myfoo</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have converted <code>case</code> into a plain old function, we don't need to do hand-waiving and magic because everything is now plain old function composition and application. Also, all the uncurrying that all the haskellers are about to complain is just going to help us.</p>
<h3>The co-Category of data: co-data</h3>
<p>I massaged all these expressions and uncurried them because, otherwise it is confusing. I mean, a co-category is a category with the arrows flipped. Which poses the question: which arrows? All of them? Some of them? Everything is easier if there is a single arrow: it means we don't have to go figuring out which one.</p>
<p>So let's flip the arrow of the <code>Foo</code> data declaration, and let's see what comes out.</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>
<span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I happily renamed <code>data</code> to <code>codata</code>, and flipped the single arrow in each line. Let's massage it a little bit more by flipping the order of the arguments so that the arrow points to the right, because we are accustomed to see the arrow functions that way:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What does this mean? Well, a lot of things at the same time, but let's go one by one.</p>
<p>We have two functions related to the <code>codata Foo</code>. The first, called <code>Foo1</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a pair of Int and String. The second, called <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a <code>Bool</code>. We have two functions that take what seems to be a composite value <code>Foo</code> and extract simple values from it of types <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code> and <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>The same way that we could call any of the two functions in the <code>data Foo</code> declaration, we can call any of the two functions in the <code>codata Foo</code>, and get an <code>(Int, String)</code> for the first case, and a <code>Bool</code> for the second. Nothing forces us to call both, and we can just call any one of them.</p>
<p>If we have a <code>Foo</code>, and by calling <code>Foo1</code> we get simple values from it, this looks a lot like a eliminator. But we can also call <code>Foo2</code>, which looks like another eliminator.</p>
<p>Trying to make sense of all of this, we reach a deep insight:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data</code> is about how we can call any of the many different constructors of a composite value.</li>
<li><code>codata</code> is about how we can call any of the many different eliminators of a composite value.</li>
</ul>
<p>From it, we can derive further insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codata looks a lot like objects and methods, where the codata value is the object, and the eliminators are the methods. There is probably some theorem out there that maps codata as a category to objects in OO programs.</li>
<li>It's not that Functional Programming is superior to Object Oriented Programming. But, the usual Functional Programmer has been an Object Oriented Programmer before. Because of this, he is likely to know <code>codata</code> from OO, and now is starting to understand <code>data</code> from FP. As a result of this, he is better armed than an Object Oriented Programmer because an Object Oriented Programmer only knows <code>codata</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further philosophical details can be extracted from the duality data-codata:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we were to find a pure FP programmer, and a pure OO programmer, they would probably have a similar level of skill, but in totally different dimensions. This would make very hard to actually figure out who is the most skilled, because their skill-sets wouldn't be comparable! How do you compare skill-set in <code>data</code> with skill-set in <code>codata</code>?</li>
<li>Data (and Functional Programming) deals on how we can construct complex datatypes from simple ones by using constructors. Codata (and Object Oriented Programming) deals on how we can extract the components from an object by calling its methods.</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem">Expression Problem</a> states that you should be able to add new cases and new functions to a datatype without losing type safety and without having to recompile.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an OO language, you can add a new case by creating another subclass and implementing the methods. But, if you want to add a new function to a datatype, you have to add it to the superclass and implement it on all the existing subclasses, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
<li>In a FP language you can add a new function to an existing datatype just by adding a function. But, if you want to add a new case, you have to add the constructor and modify all the functions that use the datatype, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turns out, with our new data-codata knowledge, that we have a deeper insight into the Expression Problem, and …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to Part 2 of my shameless attempt at explaining Docker to beginners. I struggled so you don't have to!</p>
<p>In last week's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.antoniolofiego.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-containers-a-foolproof-hands-on-docker-tutorial-part-1-ckdc4tni0031759s14z0pdd2j">article</a> we covered what Docker is, some of its jargon, and why it outperforms VMs in many use cases in today's typical software development lifecycle. This week we'll go deeper into running Docker on our machines, all while figuring out the most interesting and useful underlying technicalities.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3aGZA6WLI9Jde/giphy.gif" alt="Let's go!"></p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-docker">Getting started with Docker</h2>
<p>If you don't have Docker installed on your machine, head over to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker Download page</a> to get the version that will work on your system.</p>
<p>The Linux version is the easiest to install, given that Docker is built off of Linux utilities. On Mac and Windows, on the other hand, there are two main ways of using Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>
The newer and recommended version of Docker. It is a native solution that works directly along with your OS's processes, so we are free to interface with Docker with your favorite terminal and your favorite IDE/text editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/">Docker Toolbox</a>
This is an old version for machines that don't meet the minimum requirements for Docker Desktop. It is not a native solution as it runs on VirtualBox, so we are forced to use the tools that the Toolbox comes packaged with, making everything more cumbersome and prone to errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main catch is that Docker Desktop is not easy to install on every system. While it is straightforward on macOS 10.13+ and Windows 10 Pro, the Windows 10 Home version needs extra attention.</p>
<p>Docker Desktop on Windows leverages Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's Type 1 hypervisor and only available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. Fortunately, Windows Home supports <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), a Linux kernel developed by Microsoft that allows us to run Linux processes to run natively without emulation. Since March 2020, Docker Desktop supports WSL version 2 as a backend on Windows Home.</p>
<p>To install Docker Desktop on Windows Home we need to install WSL2 first, then install Docker Desktop specifying WSL2 as the backend during the installation process. we can find the whole process to install WSL2 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">here</a> and the subsequent Docker Desktop installation process <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/">here</a>. If you would like to see a walkthrough video of the installation process, let me know and I will work on making one available.</p>
<p>Once installed, we can open our favorite terminal and check that the installation went smoothly by typing</p>
<pre><code>docker --version
</code></pre>
<p>If this returns something the likes of</p>
<pre><code>Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
</code></pre>
<p>we are good to go!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case you are unable to make it work on your machine or if you don't want to install anything yet, Docker also offers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker">online playgrounds</a> to run your code and everything you find in this tutorial would work the same.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-run-our-first-container-">Let's run our first container!</h2>
<p>As we saw last week, to run a container we first need to find an image on the Docker registry. Like everything in the programming, Docker has a Hello World container that we can easily get from its Docker Hub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world">page</a>. As we can see on the website, the command we have to run is</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>which will welcome us with an unsightly wall of output which looks like</p>
<pre><code>Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pulling fs layer
0e03bdcc26d7: Verifying Checksum
0e03bdcc26d7: Download complete
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:49a1c8800c94df04e9658809b006fd8a686cab8028d33cfba2cc049724254202
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
</code></pre>
<p>We can see a few things that we need to cover, namely <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>layers</strong>.</p>
<p>We can check all the images that we have in our machine simply by running <code>$ docker images</code> and inspecting its output:</p>
<pre><code>REPOSITORY       TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE
hello-world      latest     bf756fb1ae65    7 months ago      13.3kB
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we have a <code>hello-world</code> image tagged latest, with a unique image ID (yours may be different) and it weighs only 13.3KB! That is where the gold is! Running a similar basic job using a VM would entail installing an entire OS just to output "Hello world!".</p>
<p>The first column of the <code>docker images</code> output is called <strong>repository</strong>. If you have ever used Git or GitHub, the name might sound familiar. In a Docker Registry, a repository is a collection of different versions of images that share the same base name. Each of the versions is identified by a <strong>tag</strong>, but images can have multiple tags as well!</p>
<p>In general, Docker images follow the naming convention of <code>username/repository:tag</code>. As a quick example, let's suppose that I built an image called <code>mysimpleapp</code> and I shared version 1.0 on the Docker Hub. You could get that image by running</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull antoniolofiego/mysimpleapplication:1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If we do not specify the tag portion, Docker will by default download the image that is tagged as <code>latest</code>. This is not a special tag, but just the one that Docker assigns by default to images when no other tags are specified at build time.</p>
<p>Now that we have the image locally, we want to run it, right? Surely enough, the command to run images is <code>$ docker run &lt;image&gt;</code>. There are mainly three ways to reference an image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By repository</strong>, but it works only if we have a single version of the image (ex: if I have two versions from the same repository, Docker will be confused about which I am referring to).</li>
<li><strong>By repository/tag combination</strong>, which solves the previous problem.</li>
<li><strong>By image ID</strong>, the preferred way, given that every image will always have a unique ID. Note, we can use just the first few characters from the ID and Docker will pick up the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Image ID method, for our <code>hello-world</code> image example we will run</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run bf756
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image that runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

</code></pre>
<p>We have successfully pulled and run our first Docker Image! 🎉 Let's recap all we learned so far by visualizing a repository structure and all the ways to pull or run an image in a simple way</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596760605560/zssexvySE.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Repo structure"></p>
<p>We know how to pull and run simple images! We just scratched the Docker surface, however. Are you ready to go to the next level?</p>

<h2 id="breaking-down-a-docker-image">Breaking down a Docker Image</h2>
<p>We know from last week that a Docker Image starts as a Dockerfile, which is a recipe that Docker follows to package our application. It is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which specifies a command that Docker needs to run in sequential order.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a Dockerfile that deploys a simple Node.js Express server and try to understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download all the code from this example via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/antoniolofiego/hashnode-dockerseries-expressapp">this</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The folder structure for this example is as follows</p>
<pre><code>📦docker-express-app
 ┣ 📂src
 ┃ ┗ 📜server.js
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜Dockerfile
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┗ 📜package.json
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the Dockerfile sits at the root level of my project folder. Let's now look at its content.</p>
<pre><code>FROM node:11-alpine

RUN mkdir app

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through each step one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>FROM node:11-alpine</code> tells Docker to download the Docker image for Node.js version 11 running on Linux Alpine, a very lightweight Linux distribution. This will be the base image used by our container.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN mkdir app</code> creates a local folder named <code>app</code> at the root of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>WORKDIR /app</code> changes the working directory for all subsequent commands to the <code>/app</code> folder that we created in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>COPY . .</code> tells Docker to copy all the files in the current folder on my machine (my <code>docker-express-app</code> folder) in the current directory of the Docker image (the <code>/app</code> directory).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN npm install</code> installs all the dependencies that I specified in my <code>package.json</code> file, in this case only <code>express</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]</code> is the command that the container will run at instantiation time, in this case, the <code>start</code> script defined in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to build the image. As you can imagine, we have a <code>docker build</code> command that does just that! The standard usage for the build command is</p>
<pre><code>docker build -t &lt;username/repository:tag&gt; &lt;path/to/Dockerfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that, when tagging an image, if we only provide a repository name Docker will assign the <code>latest</code> tag to the image by default. Let's take a look at the output.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build -t docker-express-app .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.013MB
Step 1/6 : FROM node:11-alpine

<p>As we can see, each instruction is carefully followed. On each step, Docker creates a <strong>layer</strong>. Every image is built out of several read-only layers, with each layer corresponding to certain instructions in your Dockerfile. Each step builds …</p></div></div>

  </p>


<p>This post is a collection of miscellaneous notes that I’ve collected about the American banking
system. Some caveats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s based on <em>~internet research~</em>, and so is only as accurate as whatever I can piece
together from different sources.</li>
  <li>It focuses primarily on the common cases of routable accounts, i.e. checking and savings.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve marked areas where I have outstanding questions —
if you know the answers to these questions (or know where I could find answers), I’d appreciate
it.</p>

<h2 id="account-identification">Account identification</h2>

<p>Accounts are uniquely identified by the tuple of their <strong>routing number</strong> and <strong>account number</strong>.</p>

<p>An account tied to a debit card is additionally identified by a <strong>payment card number</strong>
(alternatively <strong>primary account number</strong>).</p>

<h3 id="routing-numbers">Routing numbers</h3>

<p>An account’s <strong>routing number</strong> (or <strong>routing transit number</strong>) identifies the holding
institution, and is public (i.e., not sensitive) information. Routing numbers are nine digits
long and are maintained and allocated by the American Banking Association (the “ABA” in “ABA RTN”).</p>

<p>The ABA publishes its <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/RoutingNumberPolicy.pdf">routing number policy</a>, which
contains some interesting facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every bank has at least one ABA RTN, which is its <strong>principal
office routing number</strong>.</li>
  <li>Banks can have up to four additional routing numbers (for a total of five), and <em>may</em> have even
more with special approval.</li>
  <li>The nine digits of an ABA RTN are structured as <code>XXXXYYYYC</code>, where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>XXXX</code> is the <strong>Federal Reserve Routing Symbol</strong></li>
      <li><code>YYYY</code> is the <strong>ABA Institution Identifier</strong></li>
      <li><code>C</code> is a check digit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Federal Reserve account numbers look like ABA RTNs, but are neither indexed by the ABA nor
ACH-routable. This apparently confuses enough bankers to be worthy of a dedicated Q&amp;A item in the
ABA RTN policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a decent amount of information available online about the format of the <strong>Federal
Reserve Routing Symbol</strong>, but a quick recap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first two digits can indicate a few different things, but fall into some common cases:
    <ul>
      <li><code>00</code> indicates the US Government</li>
      <li><code>01</code> through <code>12</code> correspond to the 12 Federal Reserve banks (e.g. <code>02</code> is New York)</li>
      <li><code>21</code> through <code>32</code> correspond to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_banking">“thrift” institutions</a> in their corresponding
Federal Bank regions (<code>X - 20</code>, so <code>22</code> indicates a thrift institution registered with the NY Fed)</li>
      <li><code>61</code> through <code>72</code> are <strong>Electronic Transaction Identifiers</strong> and follow the same Federal Bank
pattern as thrifts (<code>X - 60</code>, so <code>61</code> indicates something like a payment processor or
clearinghouse registered with the Boston Fed)</li>
      <li><code>80</code> indicates a travelers’ check</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The third digit is (supposedly) the “check processing center” originally assigned to the bank that
holds the routing number. It’s not clear whether a Fed branch can have more than one check
processing center, or whether the branch itself is the center. It’s also not clear whether this
number is meaningful anymore<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>The fourth digit is <code>0</code> if the bank is in the city of the associated Fed bank, and <code>1</code> through <code>9</code>
if it is in another state in the Fed bank’s district.
<a href="https://www.frbservices.org/resources/fees/check-key-to-routing-numbers.html">This site</a> has tables
of the numbers, and suggests that the last digit is <em>not</em> unique to each state in the Fed bank’s
district. <code>0</code> also serves a (historical?) double purpose of indicating immediate funds
availability, since the institution is in the same city as its associated Fed bank. It’s not clear
whether this is still true.</li>
</ul>

<p>By way of example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1010</code> indicates a regular banking institution in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Kansas_City">10th district</a> whose
checks are/were originally processed by the first center in the Fed’s city (Kansas City, in this
case).</li>
  <li><code>6724</code> indicates a cooperative bank in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Chicago">7th district</a> whose checks are/were
originally processed by the second center in a branch city
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Chicago_Detroit_Branch">Detroit</a>, in this
case).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>ABA Institution Identifier</strong> doesn’t appear to have any (public) structure, other than
uniquely identifying the institution relative to the Fed district it belongs to.</p>

<p>An (official) table of full routing numbers for the Federal Reserve banks themselves is conveniently
provided <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/EPaymentsDirectory/reserveInformation.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The ABA also partners with registrars like
<a href="https://accuity.com/">Accuity</a> to maintain and sell complete copies of the routing database
for reference by financial institutions. In particular, Accuity maintains and sells
<em>The ABA Key to Routing Numbers</em> (better known as the “keybook”), which contains a list of all
allocated routing numbers as well as a record of recent changes (i.e., new and recently deactivated
RTNs). I couldn’t find a copy of the keybook online.</p>

<p>The Fed apparently provides a database called the “E-Payments Routing Directory” for free,
but only via <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/Electronic-Access/AccessFedLine.html">FedLine</a>, which
is some kind of business services portal. They’re kind enough to provide a
<a href="https://www.frbservices.org/assets/resources/routing-number-directory/epayments-routing-directory-cover-letter.pdf">letter template</a>
for requesting that your banking institution request the download on your behalf, but I haven’t
done it yet.</p>

<p>Someone was kind enough to upload a copy of the routing directory (as of 2015) to GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/albertico/frbs-fedwire-fedach/blob/master/fpddir.txt">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="account-numbers">Account numbers</h3>

<p>Unlike routing numbers, account numbers have no fixed length or internal structure standards. US
banks don’t confirm to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number">IBAN</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1540285">this SO post</a> NACHA stipulates that
account numbers are between 4 and 17 digits for ACH routing purposes, but there’s no
requirement (as far as I can tell) that an account be ACH-routable.</p>

<p>There’s something called a <strong>Universal Payment Identification Code</strong> (“UPIC”) that can apparently
stand in for the tuple of <em>(ABA RTN, account number)</em> for NACHA (but not FedWire ACH)
purposes. There’s a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Payment_Identification_Code">Wiki page</a>; I
didn’t look into them much beyond that.</p>

<h3 id="pcnspans-and-payment-cards">PCNs/PANs and payment cards</h3>

<p>Unlike account numbers, <strong>payment card numbers</strong> (or <strong>primary account numbers</strong>) <em>are</em> structured.</p>

<p>Also unlike account numbers, they don’t uniquely identify a particular account — instead,
they identify a card tied to a particular entity (e.g., an individual or company) at a particular
financial institution. That entity, in turn, may have multiple accounts accessible via their
PCN (e.g. being able to access both checking and savings via a bank-supplied debit card).</p>

<p>PCNs (as of 2017) are between 10 and 19 digits, with the following structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first six digits are the <strong>Issuer Identification Number</strong> (IIN) which, for financial
institutions, is the <strong>Bank Identification Number</strong> (BIN). Websites regularly use the IIN/BIN
to indicate which card provider/issuer network the PCN belongs to, e.g. by highlighting
the network’s logo during the payment process. IINs are a superset of BINs.
    <ul>
      <li>The first digit of the IIN/BIN is the <strong>major industry identifier</strong> (MII), which indicates
the general industry that the issuer belongs to. Examples: 3 indicates travel and entertainment,
4 and 5 indicate general financial issuers (like banks).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Up to) the next twelve digits are the account identifier, which serves a function similar to
the direct account number above.</li>
  <li>The last digit is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn</a> check digit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like routing numbers, IINs are maintained by the ABA and are not sensitive information. Despite
not being sensitive, access to the complete IIN registry/database is restricted similarly to
ABA RTNs and the “keybook”: only entities with allocated IINs have access to the official, complete
register.</p>

<p>Despite this, there exist a plethora of third-party services and APIs, some of which are probably
directly reselling the official register.</p>

<p>Some miscellaneous notes about PANs/PCNs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAN_truncation">PAN truncation</a> is the practice of removing
or obscuring all but the last few digits of the PAN on transaction records (e.g., paper receipts).
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI DSS</a> requires
that no more than 4 last digits be shown and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_and_Accurate_Credit_Transactions_Act">FACTA</a> requires
that no more than 5 be shown, so 4 is common.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As far as I can tell, there’s no explicit rule anywhere saying that a PAN/PCN’s account identifier
<strong>can’t</strong> be the routable account number for the underlying bank account. There’s probably no good
reason for it to be that way (since it would pointlessly complicate the process of accessing more
than one account from a single payment card), but I also can’t find any evidence that it’s
prohibited.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most payment cards in the US can now perform transactions in (at least) three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Manual imprinting using the embossed card features</li>
  <li>Magnetic stripe “swipes”</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV">EMV</a> with an embedded smart chip</li>
</ol>

<p>In-card support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment">contactless payments</a>
(which generally use EMV) are not particularly common yet; smartphone-based contactless systems
(i.e. digital wallets like Apple Pay) have seen more adoption.</p>

<h3 id="clearing-and-clearinghouses">Clearing and clearinghouses</h3>

<p>Oh boy.</p>

<p>In the US, virtually all<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> interbank credits and debits are performed (i.e., settled or “cleared”)
via the <strong>Automated Clearing House</strong>, or ACH. Other countries have their own ACH systems, but
for historical reasons the US’s has an (exceptionally?) complicated structure. It contains, at
minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ACH network itself, maintained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACHA">NACHA</a>.</li>
  <li>The ACH <em>operators</em>, who receive batched transactions and dispatch them to their destination institutions.
    <ul>
      <li>There are currently two ACH operators: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedACH">FedACH</a> and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Payments_Network">EPN</a>. It’s not clear to my why there
are two, or why one of them is private.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ACH <em>files</em>, which are batched collections of structured ACH records.
    <ul>
      <li>More on the structure of these records in a bit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Originating</strong> and <strong>Receiving Depository Financial Institutions</strong> (ODFIs and RDFIs), which
transmit and receive ACH files, respectively, from the ACH operators.
    <ul>
      <li>ODFI and RDFI refer to the direction of the ACH record, not its kind — an ODFI can issue
either a credit or a debit request.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The penultimate originating and receiving banks, which may or may not be distinct from their
ODFI and/or RDFI<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>The ultimate originator and receiver, corresponding to individual account-holding entities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The “files” in “ACH files” is <em>not</em> a metaphor — settlement via ACH is actually conducted
via text files containing structured records. It’s hard to find public information on the topology
and structure of the actual ACH network, but ingress into it (via your ODFI) is typically done by
uploading ACH files to some kind of FTP endpoint. SFTP (or FTPS) appears to be optional at most
ODFIs. J.P. Morgan is kind enough to provide some details

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been only 15 days since releasing the <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp">GraphQL API for WordPress</a>, and I couldn't help myself, so this week I added yet a new feature: the server can now execute multiple queries in a single operation.</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/executing-multiple-queries.gif" alt="Executing queries independently, and then all together as a single operation" loading="lazy" width="915" height="485"><figcaption>Executing queries independently, and then all together as a single operation</figcaption></figure><p>This is not <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/query-batching-in-apollo-63acfd859862/">query batching</a>. When doing query batching, the GraphQL server executes multiple queries in a single request. But those queries are still independent from each other. They just happen to be executed one after the other, to avoid the latency from multiple requests.</p><p>In this case, all queries are combined together, and executed as a single operation. That means that they will reuse their state and their data. For instance, if a first query fetches some data, and a second query also accesses the same data, this data is retrieved only once, not twice.</p><p>This feature is shipped together with the <code>@export</code> directive, which enables to have the results of a query injected as an input into another query. Check out <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/graphiql/?query=%23%20Run%20this%20query%20to%20execute%20all%20other%20queries%2C%20together%0Aquery%20__ALL%20%7B%20id%20%7D%0A%0A%23%20Export%20the%20user%27s%20name%0Aquery%20GetUserName%20%7B%0A%20%20user(id%3A1)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20name%20%40export(as%3A%20%22_search%22)%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A%0A%23%20Search%20for%20posts%20with%20the%20user%27s%20name%20from%20the%20previous%20query%0Aquery%20SearchPosts(%24_search%3A%20String%20%3D%20%22%22)%20%7B%0A%20%20posts(searchfor%3A%20%24_search)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20title%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D&amp;operationName=__ALL">the query below</a>, hit "Run" and select query with name <code>"__ALL"</code>, and see how the user's name obtained in the first query is used to search for posts in the second query:</p><p>(GraphiQL currently <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/1635">does not allow</a> to execute multiple operations. Hence, that <code>__ALL</code> query is a hack I added, as to tell the GraphQL server to execute all queries.)</p><h2 id="heading-how-is-this-feature-useful">How is this feature useful?<a href="#heading-how-is-this-feature-useful"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>This functionality is currently not part of the GraphQL spec, but it has been requested:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/375">[RFC] Executing multiple operations in a query</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/377">[RFC] exporting variables between queries</a></li></ul><p>This feature improves performance, for whenever we need to execute an operation against the GraphQL server, then wait for its response, and then use that result to perform another operation. By combining them together, we are saving this extra request.</p><p>You may think that saving a single roundtrip is no big deal. Maybe.

<p>Developing enterprise-grade web apps from scratch using open-source front-end and backend frameworks takes a long time. Nowadays, customers are looking for quick and cost-effective solutions and are gravitating towards using no-code and low-code app development platforms. How can full-stack developers thrive in this new world of no-code and low-code platforms?</p>



<h2><strong>No-code and Low-code Platforms</strong></h2>



<p>One purpose of these platforms is to increase the pool of available web app developers by tapping into the broader workforce of non-technical and semi-technical employees. Vendors have developed no-code platforms to be used by non-technical employees to build simple applications, and low-code platforms to be used by employees with basic technical skills (ex: SQL, JavaScript) to develop more complex enterprise applications. Secondly, these platforms can reduce web app development time by over 50% compared to the traditional web app development method.</p>



<p>Currently, there are a large number of vendors competing in the no-code and low-code market segments. No-code platform vendors include AppSheet (Google), Betty Blocks, QuickBase, Airtable, Bubble, and Microsoft PowerApps. Low-code platform vendors include Microsoft PowerApps, OutSystems, Mendix, Salesforce Lightning Platform, Nintex, Appian, and Pegasystems.</p>



<p>We won’t discuss no-code platforms because they cater to non-technical employees and are used for developing simple apps. It’s unlikely that you, as a web developer, will be asked to work on the no-code platform to build web apps.</p>



<p>Low-code platforms, on the other hand, are used to develop more complex apps. Working on developing a web app using these low-code platforms has several disadvantages for a professional web developer who is used to developing apps using open technologies such as front-end and back-end frameworks. Here is a<a href="https://medium.com/@michaelhenderson/why-outsystems-ruined-my-dev-job-3119828fd051"> blog post</a> from a professional web developer about his experiences working on one of these low-code platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Problem-1</strong>: No control over source code</p>



<p>Low-code platforms provide a visual metaphor to develop web apps. Even the app’s business logic is implemented by dragging and dropping code control statements such as if/then/else. Therefore, developers working on these platforms have little control over source code. Not having control over source code creates at least two issues: (a) It’s challenging to develop domain-driven apps with complex business logic, (b) debugging problems can be very difficult and frustrating.</p>



<p><strong>Problem-2</strong>: Career Limiting</p>



<p>Working full-time on a low-code platform can be career-limiting for professional web developers. They would lose their current technical skills in open programming languages and frameworks and gain skills in a proprietary low-code platform. Suppose this proprietary low-code platform is not widely adopted across employers, which is currently the case for any specific low-code platform. In that case, the developer’s low-code platform skills can only be used at another employer who has also adopted the same low-code platform. This severely limits the career mobility of the developer.</p>



<p>Is there a better option? Yes. Why not build a low-code platform for professional web app developers that satisfies both the employers’ need for speed and developers’ needs for control and career mobility? How do we achieve this? Read on …</p>



<h2><strong>Automate Boilerplate Code Generation</strong></h2>



<p>When developing web applications, there is quite a bit of cut/paste/modify work.</p>



<p>Most of the applications I have developed have used an N-layered architecture. In this architecture, to provide a ReST API for the CRUD operations on a database table (entity), we need to develop code for the entity, the DAO (Data Access Object) layer, the services layer, and the ReST controller layer. Similarly, to create UI screens to allow end-users to perform CRUD operations, we need to develop UI components and a front-end services layer that interacts with the back-end ReST API. Once this work is completed for a single database table (entity), similar work must be repeated for each table of the database schema. Imagine having to do this for 50 database tables – this is tedious and error-prone work.</p>



<p>A better approach would be to automate the generation of boilerplate code. To automate, we can develop an application generator that reads the database schema and generates the back-end and front-end code to allow end-users to perform CRUD operations on database tables (entities).</p>



<h2><strong>Provide Add-ons for Functional Cross-cutting Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>Over time, I have noticed that web applications have many functional cross-cutting concerns that repeat across applications. Examples of functional cross-cutting concerns include Authentication &amp; Authorization, Document management, Transactional Emails, Jobs Scheduler, User Registration, and Embedded Reporting. Almost every web application I have been involved in developing required each of these capabilities. In each case, my development team reinvented the wheel and built these cross-cutting concerns from scratch because we never thought about building generic and customizable functional cross-cutting concerns that can be used across web apps- what a waste of effort &amp; time!</p>



<p>If the base code for such functional cross-cutting concerns was already built and available, we could have re-used it and customized it as needed for each web application.</p>



<h2><strong>Provide Visual Development Tools</strong></h2>



<p>Developing enterprise applications involves developing custom functionality such as designing a database schema or domain model, building custom screens for non-CRUD operations, building enterprise-specific themes (colors, fonts), and developing integrations with external systems.</p>



<p>Professional development teams can further reduce the application development time &amp; cost by using visual development tools that accelerate the development of these custom functionality artifacts.</p>



<h2><strong>Support Development Team’s Preferred Stack</strong></h2>



<p>When developing enterprise applications, professional development teams have specific preferences over open technologies used, such as front-end and back-end frameworks, Object-relational mapping tools, UI Component frameworks, and dependency management systems. Specific technologies are preferred by teams either because they are the enterprise architecture standard or because most team members have experience using these technologies.</p>



<p>By supporting the specific technologies chosen by development teams, open low-code platforms for professional developers can help and not reduce the acceleration of application development.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The approach mentioned above allows development teams to reduce the time to develop a web app by over 50%, similar to proprietary low-code platforms. Additionally, developers have full control over the source code, eliminating their inability to develop domain-driven apps with complex business logic and easily debug issues. Finally, developers use open technologies when developing web apps, eliminating the problem of limited career mobility.</p>



<p>In summary, a low-code platform built for professional web app developers eliminates the disadvantages of proprietary low-code platforms while preserving their advantage of rapid app development.</p>

<![CDATA[Correlation vs Causation]]>
            </title>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The concepts of correlation and causation are sometimes confusing to amateur researchers. In practice, I often saw researchers considering a correlation as causation and making mistakes in conclusions. Mathematically, correlation is the necessary but insufficient condition for causation. In other words, if two things have causation relationship, these two things must have correlation relationship as well. However, if two things have correlation relationship, these two things do not necessarily have causation relationship.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would use an example to talk about the concepts of correlation and causation, how to verify causation using experiments, and the caveats in using experiments to verify causation.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Suppose we have a system containing the four variables including temperature ($t$), the volume of water Mike drinks daily ($x_1$), the volume of urine Mike has daily ($x_2$), the number of fires at California daily ($x_3$). The ground truth values are listed in the table. The underlying relationships have also been listed and we assume there is no error in the measurement during experimental data collection.</p>



<p>The ground truth relationships are listed in the relationships column in the table, and these relationships are unknown to researchers.</p>



<p>In the data collection, we only collected the data for $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, but not $t$.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Symbol</th>
    <th>Relationships</th>
    <th>Data #1</th>
    <th>Data #2</th>
    <th>Data #3</th>
    <th>Data #4</th>
    <th>Data #5</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Temperature</td>
    <td>$t$</td>
    <td>$t$</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume of Water <br>Mike Drinks Daily<br>(mL)</td>
    <td>$x_1$</td>
    <td>$x_1 = f_1(t)$</td>
    <td>500</td>
    <td>800</td>
    <td>900</td>
    <td>1500</td>
    <td>3000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume of Urine <br>Mike Has Daily<br>(mL)<br></td>
    <td>$x_2$</td>
    <td>$x_2 = f_2(x_1)$</td>
    <td>500</td>
    <td>800</td>
    <td>900</td>
    <td>1500</td>
    <td>3000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of Fires <br>at California<br>Daily</td>
    <td>$x_3$</td>
    <td>$x_3 = f_3(t)$</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>From the data, we found that each pair of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ are highly correlated. Can we say $x_1$ and $x_2$ have causation relationship and further $x_1$ caused $x_2$? Can we say $x_1$ and $x_3$ have causation relationship and further $x_1$ caused $x_3$?</p>

<h3 id="correlation-is-not-necessarily-causation">Correlation Is Not Necessarily Causation</h3>

<p>If we have some common sense, we know that $x_1$, the volume of water Mike drinks daily, caused $x_2$, the volume of urine Mike has daily. However, since Mike is just an ordinary person and does not have divine power, definitely $x_1$, the volume of water Mike drinks daily, would not cause $x_3$, the number of fires at California daily.</p>



<p>This example concretely shows that causation is the necessary but insufficient condition for correlation.</p>



<p>The next question is how to determine or eliminate the causation relationship from all the correlation relationships? The correct way is to do experiments.</p>

<h3 id="determine-causation-by-experiment">Determine Causation By Experiment</h3>

<p>In this case, if we keep $t$ the same (although we are not monitoring it), increase $x_1$, and monitor the change of $x_2$ and $x_3$. That is to say, we keep the temperature the same, ask Mike to drink more water daily, and monitor change of the volume of urine Mike has daily and the number of fires at California daily.</p>



<p>Of course, Mike would have more volume of urine daily, but the number of fires at California should not change. This experiment result confirms that $x_1$ caused $x_2$, but $x_1$ would not cause $x_3$.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>However, if we do experiments incorrectly, we might find erroneous causation relationships.</p>



<p>For example, if we are not aware $t$ is going up since we are not monitoring it, we increase $x_1$ and monitor the change of $x_2$ and $x_3$, then $x_2$ and $x_3$ would both increase. Then we would draw an incorrect conclusion that $x_2$ caused $x_3$, i.e., the volume of water Mike drinks daily caused the number fires at California daily.</p>



<p>Since we are not aware of $t$ increasing, or even did not know the existence of $t$ if we are ignorant, how do we eliminate that $x_2$ caused $x_3$? In this particular problem, it is almost impossible. However, if we have a clone of Mike which is exactly the same as Mike on any aspect, we would ask the first Mike to drink more water daily and the second Mike drink the same amount of water daily to the usual, and monitor the change of $x_2$ and $x_3$. We would find although the first Mike suggested that $x_1$ caused $x_3$, the second Mike would show that although $x_1$ remained the same but $x_3$ increases, which is inconsistent to the causation relationship that $x_1$ caused $x_3$. This rules out the causation relationship between $x_1$ and $x_3$.</p>



<p>Such experiments are called control experiments. Essentially when the control experiments show something inconsistent to the causation relationship you found, the causation relationship you found is fake. It is extremely useful, because even though you do not know how many hidden variables you could not capture, as long as you can guarantee the variables, which have no causation relationships to the variables you are experimenting with, remain the same in both control experiments and actual experiments, the causation relationships you found, if any, would be reliable.</p>



<p>However, in practice, because the system is much more complicated, and the single variable you thought you are changing might actually turn out to contain many variables. For example, when Mike starts to drink more water, he has to use the exact the same cup he used to drink the water, the water has to be the exact same water he used to drink. If the cup got changed, or the water quality got changed, in principle, the conclusion that $x_1$ caused $x_2$ and $x_1$ would not cause $x_3$ would not hold.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>The determination of causation is extremely complicated and could often go wrong. This is because there is an infinite number of variables when you are doing experiments, even with very good control experiment, you might not be aware of how many variables you have changed in the actual experiments and derive the wrong conclusion. This is essentially why a lot of sophisticated scientific findings, especially for life and biomedical science, turn out to be not true.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the key ideas in doing experiments to determine causation relationships are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Doing control experiment.</li>
  <li>Minimizing and being aware of the change to other variables while you thought you are changing only one single variable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Docable Notebooks provide a way for viewing normal markdown files in an interactive and executable format. To enable this, you simply need to add some annotations to your document. For example, let’s see a simple example markdown for making a <code>command</code> cell that can be executed in Docable:</p>
<pre undefined=""><code>This is a docable cell which represents a command:

```bash|{type:'command'}
date
```</code></pre><p>Docable notebooks will turn the markdown above into an interactive and executable document. <strong><em>To execute the cell, simply hover your mouse over the cell and press the play button</em></strong>:</p>
<hr>

<p>This is a docable cell which represents a command:</p>
<hr>

<p>Now suppose you wrote a tutorial in markdown, this is how it would look like:</p>



<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9158546/89744100-c89e4380-da77-11ea-8f34-e8e255bb5de6.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>If you’ve ever written code in JavaScript before, <code>console.log()</code> is most likely one of the first things you learned to use. <code>console</code> also provides many other methods which can be useful for basic logging of different events in you code. In this notebook, we’re going to see another method, <code>console.error()</code>, which can be useful for logging errors.</p>
<p>Let’s write a simple script (<code>./log.js</code>) to better understand these methods:</p>
<div><p>[file:]</p><div><pre data-docable="true" data-type="file" data-path="log.js"><code><span>console</span>.log(<span>'this is a log message in stdout\n'</span>);
<span>console</span>.error(<span>'this is a log message in stderr\n'</span>);</code></pre></div></div><p>Now if we simply run this script, it may look like <code>console.log()</code> and <code>console.error()</code> are doing the exact same thing:</p>
<p>So what makes these two methods different?</p>
<p>The main difference is the stream in which they write to. <code>console.log()</code> prints to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/stdout">stdout</a> while <code>console.error()</code> prints to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/stderr">stderr</a>. When we run something in terminal, we see a stream of both stdout and stderr without any visual indication for differentiating between the two. However, we can redirect these two streams to be written in separate files:</p>
<div><p>[command:]</p><div><pre data-docable="true" data-type="command" data-failed_when="exitCode!=0"><code>node log.js &gt; <span>/tmp/</span>stdout <span>2</span>&gt; <span>/tmp/</span>stderr</code></pre></div></div><p>Now if we inspect <code>/tmp/stdout</code> we can see what part of <code>./log.js</code> output was written in stdout stream:</p>
<p>We can see this is what <code>console.log('this is a log message in stdout');</code> printed.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we inspect <code>/tmp/stderr</code> we can see what was printed to stderr stream:</p>
<p>And we can see this is what <code>console.error('this is a log message in stderr');</code> printed.</p>

<div id="post-body">


<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Driving
assistance, autonomous driving systems, 100% autonomous cars... What is behind
these terms and what are the different autonomous driving Levels?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Would you be
willing to let your car manage everything for you?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0ChfMuf8XYI/XwEfC_0r88I/AAAAAAAAAss/1mwhn8IQEiY8GqxbJEUz3PrfF6FFdLcrwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/opel-corsa-e.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Autonomous driving Levels" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1200" height="426" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0ChfMuf8XYI/XwEfC_0r88I/AAAAAAAAAss/1mwhn8IQEiY8GqxbJEUz3PrfF6FFdLcrwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/opel-corsa-e.jpg" title="Autonomous driving Levels" width="640"></a></p>


<p><span lang="EN-US">The subject of the
autonomous car has been occupying car manufacturers and the media a lot in
recent months. The digital technologies embedded in the car will make the
product a connected object, an infotainment platform that in the future will
simplify the user's life. By placing the customer experience at the heart of
their various strategies (connected, autonomous, electrified cars, services),
carmakers want to adapt to the new consumption needs of customers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>




<p><span lang="EN-US">Today, practically
all mobility players, and many more, have focused on autonomous vehicles.
Tesla, the PSA group, Renault, Google Waymo, Mercedes, Uber, Volvo... all are
working on car autonomy, even if some carmakers have had to revise their
roadmap recently and redirect <b>funds</b> for research and investment in this
area to other sectors, such as energy transition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>What do autonomous driving Levels really mean?</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">When we talk about autonomous
driving, we tend to think it's all or nothing, and many manufacturers claim to
offer autonomous cars. However, there are different autonomous driving levels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Admittedly, there is
no official classification of current and future models. But the players are
basing themselves on a grid developed in 2014 by <b>SAE International, formerly
the Society of Automotive Engineers</b>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">It is at the origin
of the classification into six categories, making it possible to define what
human drivers and/or autonomous systems can and cannot do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zUjBDYGw5ak/Xvx88Nz72yI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/ucfg8SSTTh4n8ZRSf16kYlIO0djfD1TXgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/volkswagen-id-3-2019.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Autonomous driving Levels" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zUjBDYGw5ak/Xvx88Nz72yI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/ucfg8SSTTh4n8ZRSf16kYlIO0djfD1TXgCPcBGAYYCw/s640/volkswagen-id-3-2019.jpg" title="Autonomous driving Levels" width="640"></a></p>


<p><span lang="EN-US">Legislation has never
been very clear about autonomous vehicles. There was often confusion between
autopilot and autonomous piloting. Autopilot is still a very advanced driver
assistance system, but it cannot do without a human driver. The opposite is
true of autonomous driving, which must be able to do without a human presence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<blockquote>
<span lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span><b><span lang="EN-US">Defining what human drivers and autonomous systems can and cannot do</span></b></blockquote>


<p><span lang="EN-US">In 2014, SAE (Society
of Automotive Engineers) International, a professional organization of
scientists and engineers, has proposed a grid for understanding and classifying
autonomous vehicles. This grid is therefore the basis for the classification
into categories, defining what human drivers and autonomous systems can and
cannot do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">It also serves as a
reference for manufacturers and governments who regularly address the various
issues related to future mobility, sometimes directly related to autonomous
systems. <b>The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers <span>&nbsp;</span></b>has also defined a European scale with six
levels of autonomy for vehicles, a system similar to the one designed by the
SAE.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">In order to be able
to understand the subject, I suggest that you decipher the different SAE
levels, i.e. autonomous driving levels, and why it is important to know them
before choosing your next autonomous car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<h3>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Level 0: no autonomy or assistance</span></span></b></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">As its name suggests,
it is the zero level of autonomy and assistance. Understand that all driving is
done by the human driver, not assisted by the vehicle. It is therefore a
vehicle without driving assistance. Here, there is no cruise control, no
automatic emergency braking or even lane keeping assistance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">In this category, all
the visual aids of the last century are present: if your car is able to tell
you that you are running out of petrol or engine oil, it is a warning of a
danger but not a driving aid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GdD3_bY7_WM/Xv8IdjPVnfI/AAAAAAAAAlo/KhNMRvuKYSkT8Gp8UQRyubZi3-h8O8MjwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/e-tron%2BS%2BSportback.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Autonomous driving Levels" data-original-height="183" data-original-width="276" height="424" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GdD3_bY7_WM/Xv8IdjPVnfI/AAAAAAAAAlo/KhNMRvuKYSkT8Gp8UQRyubZi3-h8O8MjwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/e-tron%2BS%2BSportback.jpg" title="Autonomous driving Levels" width="640"></a></p>


<h3>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Level 1: driver assistance, eyes on-hands on</span></span></b></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span><span>This is generally
what we find on the majority of our cars today. The driver is obviously present
100% of the time and the car is not supposed to make any decision "</span><b>alone</b><span>".
The driver can have access to assistance which concerns either longitudinal
control (speed and distance from preceding vehicles) or lateral control of the
vehicle (following white lines) but not both at the same time. Level 1
equipment includes: cruise control, line-crossing radar, automatic emergency
braking, collision warning, power steering.</span></p>


<h3>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Level 2: partial automation, eyes on-hands off</span></span></b></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span><span>This is the level
that tends to become more democratic in all our modern cars. Even if the
legislator does not allow it, which is why cars regularly tell you to put your
hands on the steering wheel when you don't, you can theoretically let go of the
controls for a few seconds and let the car do the work. Of course, the driver
must keep an eye on his environment so that he can quickly regain control if a
problem occurs.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">In certain
situations, the driver can delegate both longitudinal and lateral control of the
vehicle to the system, however, the driver remains responsible for supervision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P4LWYwXRX2Y/XweoH2rjIqI/AAAAAAAAA3E/qCdxn5Pl4LUfgB1YxQzz9yKGguHSlAdGgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/audi-q4-e-tron-sportback-concept.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Autonomous driving Levels" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P4LWYwXRX2Y/XweoH2rjIqI/AAAAAAAAA3E/qCdxn5Pl4LUfgB1YxQzz9yKGguHSlAdGgCPcBGAYYCw/s640/audi-q4-e-tron-sportback-concept.jpg" title="Autonomous driving Levels" width="640"></a></p>


<p><span lang="EN-US">It is up to the
driver to keep an eye on the system at all times and monitor the vehicle
environment and regain full control if necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Aids such as adaptive
cruise control or lane keeping fall into this category, as well as their
combination. The high-end models of some manufacturers now incorporate these technologies,
such as the Audi e-tron Sportback and the Nissane Leaf, which know how to move
by themselves, but are not aware of their entire environment. Other functions
include the famous "<b>Park Assist",</b> now present on many
vehicles, which allows the car to park by itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>






<h3>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Level 3: conditional autonomy, eyes off-hands off</span></span></b></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">From this level,
vehicles are able to see their driving environment and therefore act
accordingly. Level 3 indicates that the driver must be able to regain control
of the vehicle at all times, but that the vehicle is fully autonomous under
certain driving conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">This means that
driving can be fully delegated to the machine but only under pre-defined
conditions, for example on motorways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Today, some
production cars oscillate between levels 2 and 3. This is notably the case of <b>Tesla</b>,
which until a few years ago offered a very convincing <b>automatic driving
system</b>, but today unfortunately constrained by the legislator's standards
that force the brand to revise its copy. Nevertheless, at Tesla, the car uses
cameras and radars to understand its environment and apprehend the dangers,
overtake alone when the indicator is on, maintain the course, decelerate if
necessary and keep a safe distance. This level should allow it to do all this
in complete autonomy, which is why it is still today between level 2 and 3, not
filling all the boxes of level 3.<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<h3>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Level 4: high autonomy, eyes off-hands off-mind off</span></span></b></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span><span>The vehicle is driven
completely autonomously, i.e. without even the necessary presence of a driver
on board. The system bears responsibility for all the actions it will carry
out, in particular concerning maneuvers or its decisions according to the
evolution of the environment.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">From this level, no
assistance from the "driver" is required. However, total autonomy is
limited to predefined conditions: a specific geographical area, for example a
motorway or a car park with which the vehicle is compatible, weather conditions
(snowy weather, fog-free weather, etc.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">When these criteria
are met, the driver is no longer responsible for driving, which he delegates to
the system in full. However, he is still obliged to resume driving when the
vehicle leaves this automated driving zone. In contrast to level 3, if the
driver fails to react, the vehicle must be able to exit on its own or stop on a
motorway apron.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3>
<span lang="EN-US"><o:p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br></span></o:p></span><b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Level 5: complete high autonomy, driverless</span></span></b></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Here, there is no more
human intervention or road conditions: the vehicle is 100% autonomous. The
vehicle can perform absolutely all driving tasks and is not subject to any
human intervention. Whether it is on the motorway or in the city centre, it is
capable of driving in total autonomy. All the big companies are working on
this, like Google for example and its famous Google Car, or Uber. There is not
even a steering wheel anymore, it is the car that makes all the right decisions
without human intervention. If it wishes, it can even ignore a human order if
artificial intelligence considers it dangerous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<blockquote>
<span lang="EN-US">"<i>Drivers will
be freed from the obligation to drive and will be able to focus their attention
on other activities: work, relaxation, communication, entertainment, and so on.
And this newly liberated time will blur the boundaries between home, work and
leisure, arousing the interest of a large number of players</i>," David
Weill, Vice President Strategy of Faurecia Interiors.</span></blockquote>


<p><span lang="EN-US">Human driving becomes
a pleasure option, with vehicle autonomy as the norm. Control elements such as
the steering wheel or pedals are no longer necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>When will 100% autonomous cars be available?</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Certainly not for
tomorrow, as we read all over the place a few years ago. While manufacturers
are generally well advanced in this respect, it is the legislator who will have
the last word. There are still many parameters to be taken into account and the
range of a vehicle depends not only on the vehicle itself, but also on the
environment around it. For example, cities will also have to be connected in
order to smooth traffic flow or to send information to autonomous vehicles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>




<p><span lang="EN-US">We have also recently
noted a small drop in interest from car manufacturers regarding vehicle
autonomy, especially since some short-term issues are more important, such as
those related to the energy transition. The budget dedicated to research and
development for autonomous cars has had to be cut in some cases and transferred
to other sectors, such as electric power trains or batteries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

					<p>Violent scenes are taking place this evening in Minsk, Belarus, where law enforcement officials, with President Aleksandr Lukashenko, are battling the contestants.</p>
<p>The protests began after the official exit poll released on Sunday evening at the end of the presidential election, which credits the eternal Aleksandr Lukashenko with nearly 80% of the vote, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53717834">BBC News</a> and <a href="https://tass.com/world/1187449">Tass</a>.</p>

<p>The images posted on Facebook, <a href="https://monetize.info/telegram-bots/">Telegram groups</a> and Twitter by independent journalists in Belarus show huge crowds of people in Minsk, but also in other cities of the country – Gomel, Brest or Baranovichi. In the latter two reportedly, police withdrew from the central area in front of thousands of protesters.</p>

<p>On the same evening, according to exit polls, <strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko</strong> would have won the election again by 79.7%, while opposition candidate <strong>Svetlana Tihanovskaia</strong> would have won only 6.8% of the suffrages.</p>
<p>The country’s authoritarian leader has previously said that everything will remain “under control”. However, independent journalists in Belarus say that citizens are angry and convinced that the elections have been rigged.</p>
<p>Opposition candidate Svetlana Tihanovskaia’s spokeswoman claimed her victory based on “real” results from 20 polling stations. The official asked the Central Election Commission to declare the correct results on Monday. Tihanovskaia herself urged police not to forget “that it is part of the nation.” “I know that citizens will wake up tomorrow in a new country and I hope that tomorrow will bring good news. Stop the violence. officers, I know you can do it,” the opposition candidate said. Several polling station presidents came out in front of citizens to announce what they call the “real” results of the vote. In the clip below, Tihanovskaia is announced winning by 90%.</p>

<p><strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko is in his sixth term as president of Soviet-state Belarus and has ruled the country since 1994.</strong> He is in office for the longest time of all European heads of state (except monarchs). In Belarusian society, the “Old Man” is unofficially called.</p>

<p>President Aleksandr Lukashenko’s forces are making arrests, while demonstrators are wounded.</p>

Again: all these so-called “non lethal” weapons ARE lethal at close range. <a href="https://t.co/qCgAbd9xVI">pic.twitter.com/qCgAbd9xVI</a></p>
