<p>Machine learning is increasingly popular and the increasing number of companies are harnessing the power of this new technology. Yet the knowledge about the teams themselves is yet limited – what do they use? What do they like? Who are they?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neptune has been built by data scientists for data scientist – no mumbo-jumbo in between. So when facing the challenge of missing knowledge we do the best we can do – gather the data. Benefitting from our network of contacts and readers whom of many are machine-learning specialists themselves, we have launched a poll to get the answers about most popular technologies, the nature of teams and their daily work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Results? Read below!&nbsp;</p>






<h2>Which area of Machine Learning are you working on?</h2>



<p>First question – what are teams working on? Is there any kind of hidden king behind the wall of hyping other technologies? Some peaceful leader of modern machine learning, steady growing in the sterile light of server rooms while media vendors keep chasing the over-pumped ghosts?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have divided the categories into:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Computer Vision</li><li>Reinforcement Learning</li><li>NLP</li><li>Forecasting</li><li>Tabular</li><li>Other</li></ol>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="ml_flavour_general" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>We found out that the most prominent area in teams was the <strong>NLP (Natural Language Processing), </strong>followed by <strong>Computer Vision, Forecasting, Tabular, Other, and Reinforcement Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>According to a report in 2019, <a href="https://solutionsreview.com/data-management/80-percent-of-your-data-will-be-unstructured-in-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80% of your data will be unstructured in the next 5 years</a>, and we can use this data to build machine learning models for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic segmentation, text summarization, relationship extraction – you name it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering the advances in the NLP technology more use cases will emerge soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have heard on your phone calls when you connect to a company’s service care, “This call may be recorded for quality and training purposes,” or asked to fill a survey after you have purchased a service or a product from an organization.</p>



<p>This information can be used to understand an audience’s sentiment polarity about an organization’s product or service.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="ml_flavour_sometimes" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>In the conducted surveys, 26 out of the 31 teams confirmed that they all worked with NLP to deal with textual data.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="ml_flavour_primarly" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Almost all the teams have worked in nearly all areas except for Reinforcement Learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>“Reinforcement learning is an agent-based learning that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error.”</strong></p>



<p>But that’s not really surprising considering fact that the reinforcement learning is still more academic and research area, not the business one. For a serious reason – Reinforcement&nbsp;Learning may not be suitable for a startup is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQK4ZY_gwKI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data required for reinforcement learning </a>is massive, with <a href="https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html">numerous technical challenges</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://openai.com/five/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenAIFive</a> system has an estimated batch size of over 1 million observations. This means we have over a million state-action-rewards to update on each simulation. This makes reinforcement learning samples efficient since a lot of training data is required to reach the desired performance.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AlphaGo</a>, the first AI agent who defeated world champion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lee Sedol</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GO</a>,&nbsp;was trained nonstop for a period of a few days by playing millions of games, accumulating thousands of years of knowledge in those simulations that estimated to have cost nearly <a href="https://www.yuzeh.com/data/agz-cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$3 million for computation power alone</a>.</p>



<p>AlphaGo Zero showed everyone that it is possible to build systems that can defeat even a world champ, but developing this system is still not available to most startups due to the model’s expensiveness.</p>



<p>Key takeaway – work where money are. Either at business oriented fields or for tech giants with wagons of cash for reinforcement learning.&nbsp;</p>






<h2>What type of models do you work with?</h2>



<p>We asked all of the teams about the methods they use to build a model and list them in four categories.</p>



<ol><li>Deep Learning</li><li>Boosted Trees(LightGBM, XGBoost, Catboost)</li><li>Linear Regression</li><li>Other</li></ol>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="model_flavour_general" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Deep Learning models turn out to be the winner here that is used very often by 14 teams.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="model_flavour_sometimes" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>At least 29 out of 31 teams worked with Deep Learning models at some point.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="model_flavour_primarly" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>We can again see here that Deep learning is a winner. Deep Learning is gaining much popularity due to its predictive accuracy when trained on a massive amount of datasets.</p>



<p>Deep Learning tends to work best with unstructured data, and according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gartner</a>,<a href="https://www.dataversity.net/putting-structure-around-unstructured-data/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20analysts%20at%20Gartner,of%20enterprise%20data%20is%20unstructured.&amp;text=Finding%20ways%20to%20integrate%20new,the%20data%20as%20it%20grows." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> 80% of a enterprise data is unstructured</a> in the form of texts, images, pdfs, etc.</p>



<p>Deep Learning methods are applied to social media and unstructured data to better understand the client and segment them. The financial industry is adapting deep learning methods rapidly to build systems for detecting fraudulent transactions, trading, stock predictions, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The healthcare industry is leveraging the power of deep learning for drug invention, disease diagnosis, virtual healthcare, and the list can go on and on.</p>



<p>So again – the teams stick to the technology that delivers the results while keeping its versatility. So the deep learning is a leading technology and nothing seems to change this course.&nbsp;</p>






<h2>What do you currently train your ML models on?</h2>



<p>Training a machine learning or deep learning model can be daunting sometimes due to limited computational power. On the other hand, a smart data scientist can tweak the model to be less data-hungry and use fewer resources. So we asked all 31 teams about the infrastructure they use for training or building their predictive models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can categorize them into 4 categories.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Local Machine (Laptop Or PC)</li><li>Local Cluster</li><li>Big Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)</li><li>Dedicated ML Cloud (Sagemaker, Floydhub)</li></ol>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="infra_general" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>The least used infrastructure we can see here is the<strong> Dedicated ML Cloud (SageMaker, Floydhub),</strong> and the most used is here <strong>local pc and Big Cloud(AWS, GCP, Azure)</strong>.</p>



<p>Maybe because training your models on dedicated ML cloud services sometimes can <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/why-building-your-own-deep-learning-computer-is-10x-cheaper-than-aws-b1c91b55ce8c#:~:text=There's%20a%20reason%20why%20datacenters,a%20lot%20for%20renting%20it." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">burn a hole in your pocket</a>. They are cool for teams that are heavy on cash – and there are such, but not that many.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="infra_sometimes" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Except for the dedicated ML cloud (SageMaker, Floydhub), we can see that model training on all the platforms, whether it is a local machine, Big Cloud or a local cluster were used at some point. It is not that surprising – it is common to run prototype locally at lower cost to save on trial-and-error process in the cloud – in the end, every second costs real cash.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="infra_primarly" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>We can see that the most often used infrastructure for training a predictive model is Big Cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes you may have limited RAM and GPU to train a predictive model, and you just can’t upgrade your system on your whim to meet your system needs; that’s where Cloud services come into play. Or you wish to finish your training in an hour, not in a week – money is not the only value after all.</p>






<h2>What are your favorite tools/frameworks/libraries for building and managing ML models?</h2>



<p>Data Science teams tend to have every data scientist’s machine learning tasks their own weapons in their framework’s arsenal to tackle any data science problem.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/">Excalidraw project</a>, we have decided to deprecate <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-desktop">Excalidraw Desktop</a>, an <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> wrapper for Excalidraw, in favor of the Web version that you can—and always could—find at <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">excalidraw.com</a>. After a careful analysis, we have decided that <a href="https://web.dev/pwa/">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA) is the future we want to build upon. Read on to learn more about our rationale.</p>
<!-- end -->
<h2>How Excalidraw Desktop came into being</h2>
<p>Soon after <a href="https://twitter.com/vjeux">@vjeux</a> had created the initial version of Excalidraw in January 2020 and <a href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/reflections-on-excalidraw/">blogged about it</a>, he proposed the following in <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/561#issue-555138343">Issue #561</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Would be great to wrap Excalidraw within Electron (or equivalent) and publish it as a native application to the various app stores.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The immediate reaction by <a href="https://github.com/voluntadpear">@voluntadpear</a> was to suggest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What about making it a PWA instead? Android currently supports adding them to the Play Store as Trusted Web Activities and hopefully iOS will do the same soon. On Desktop, Chrome lets you download a desktop shortcut to a PWA.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision that <a href="https://github.com/vjeux">@vjeux</a> took in the end was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We should do both :)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While work on converting the version of Excalidraw into a PWA was started by <a href="https://github.com/voluntadpear">@voluntadpear</a> and later others, <a href="https://github.com/lipis">@lipis</a> independently <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/561#issuecomment-579573783">went ahead</a> and created a <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-desktop">separate repo</a> for Excalidraw Desktop.</p>
<p>To this day, the initial goal set by <a href="https://github.com/vjeux">@vjeux</a>, that is, to submit Excalidraw to the various app stores, has not been reached yet. Honestly, no one has even started the submission process to any of the stores. But why is that? Before I try to provide an answer, let me quickly look at Electron, the platform.</p>
<h2>What is Electron?</h2>
<p>The unique selling point of <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> is that it allows you to <em>“build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS”</em>. Apps built with Electron are <em>“compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux”</em>, that is, <em>“Electron apps build and run on three platforms”</em>. According to the homepage, the hard parts that Electron makes easy are <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/auto-updater">automatic updates</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/menu">native menus and notifications</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/crash-reporter">crash reporting</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/content-tracing">debugging and profiling</a>, and <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/auto-updater#windows">Windows installers</a>. Turns out, some of the promised features need a detailed look at the small print.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, automatic updates <em>“are [currently] only [supported] on macOS and Windows. There is no built-in support for auto-updater on Linux, so it is recommended to use the distribution’s package manager to update your app”</em>.</li>
<li>Developers can create native menus by calling <code>Menu.setApplicationMenu(menu)</code>. On Windows and Linux, the menu will be set as each window’s top menu, while on macOS there are many system-defined standard menus, like the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/1428608-servicesmenu?language=objc">Services</a> menu. To make one’s menus a standard menu, developers should set their menu’s <code>role</code> accordingly, and Electron will recognize them and make them become standard menus. This means that a lot of menu-related code will make use of the following platform check: <code>const isMac = process.platform === 'darwin'</code>.</li>
<li>Windows installers can be made with <a href="https://github.com/electron/windows-installer">windows-installer</a>. The README of the project highlights that <em>“for a production app you need to sign your application. Internet Explorer’s SmartScreen filter will block your app from being downloaded, and many anti-virus vendors will consider your app as malware unless you obtain a valid cert”</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at just these three examples, it is clear that Electron is far from “write once, run everywhere”. Distributing an app on app stores requires <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/code-signing">code signing</a>, a security technology for certifying app ownership. Packaging an app requires using tools like <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge">electron-forge</a> and thinking about where to host packages for app updates. It gets complex relatively quickly, especially when the objective truly is cross platform support. I want to note that it is <em>abolutely</em> possible to create stunning Electron apps with enough effort and dedication. For Excalidraw Desktop, we were not there.</p>
<h2>Where Excalidraw Desktop left off</h2>
<p>Excalidraw Desktop so far is basically the Excalidraw Web app bundled as an <a href="https://github.com/electron/asar"><code>.asar</code></a> file with an added <strong>About Excalidraw</strong> window. The look and feel of the application is almost identical to the Web version.</p>

  <figcaption>The <strong>About Excalidraw</strong> menu providing insights into the versions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On macOS, there is now a native menu at the top of the application, but since none of the menu actions—apart from <strong>Close Window</strong> and <strong>About Excalidraw</strong>—are hooked up to to anything, the menu is, in its current state, pretty useless. Meanwhile, all actions can of course be performed via the regular Excalidraw toolbars and the context menu.</p>

<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder">electron-builder</a>, which supports <a href="https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#PlatformSpecificBuildOptions-fileAssociations">file type associations</a>. By double-clicking an <code>.excalidraw</code> file, ideally the Excalidraw Desktop app should open. The relevant excerpt of our <code>electron-builder.json</code> file looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"fileAssociations"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"ext"</span><span>:</span> <span>"excalidraw"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Excalidraw"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"description"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Excalidraw file"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"role"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Editor"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"mimeType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"application/json"</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Unfortunately, in practice, this does not always work as intended, since, depending on the installation type (for the current user, for all users), apps on Windows&nbsp;10 do not have the rights to associate a file type to themselves.</p>
<p>These shortcomings and the pending work to make the experience truly native-like on <em>all</em> platforms (which, again, with enough effort <em>is</em> possible) were a strong argument for us to reconsider our investment in Excalidraw Desktop. The way bigger argument for us, though, was that we foresee that for <em>our</em> use case, we do not need all the features Electron offers. The grown and still growing set of capabilities of the Web serves us equally well, if not better.</p>
<h2>How the Web serves us today and in the future</h2>
<p>Even in 2020, <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is still <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/javascript#libraries">incredibly popular</a>. For many developers it has become a habit to use it, despite the fact that today they <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">might not need jQuery</a>. There is a similar resource for Electron, aptly called <a href="https://youmightnotneedelectron.com/">You Might Not Need Electron</a>. Let me outline in the following why we think we do not need Electron.</p>
<h3>Installable Progressive Web App</h3>
<p>Excalidraw today is an <a href="https://web.dev/installable/">installable</a> Progressive Web App with a <a href="https://excalidraw.com/service-worker.js">service worker</a> and a <a href="https://excalidraw.com/manifest.json">Web App Manifest</a>. It caches all its resources in two caches, one for fonts and font-related CSS, and one for everything else.</p>

<p>Excalidraw is configured to run as a standalone application, so when you install it, you get an app that runs in its own window. It is fully integrated in the operating system’s multitasking UI and gets its own app icon on the home screen, Dock, or task bar; depending on what platform you install it.</p>

<h3>File system access</h3>
<p>Excalidraw makes use of <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/browser-nativefs">browser-nativefs</a> for accessing the file system of the operating system. On supporting browsers, this allows for a true open→edit→save workflow and actual over-saving and “save as”, with a transparent fallback for other browsers. You can learn more about this feature in my blog post <a href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/browser-nativefs/">Reading and writing files and directories with the browser-nativefs library</a>.</p>
<h3>Drag and drop support</h3>
<p>Files can be dragged and dropped onto the Excalidraw window just as in native applications. On a browser that supports the <a href="https://web.dev/file-system-access/">File System Access API</a>, a dropped file can be immediately edited and the modifications be saved to the original file. This is so intuitive that you sometimes forget that you are dealing with a Web app.</p>
<h3>Clipboard access</h3>
<p>Excalidraw works well with the operating system’s clipboard. Entire Excalidraw drawings or also just individual objects can be copied and pasted in <code>image/png</code> and <code>image/svg+xml</code> formats, allowing for an easy integration with other native tools like <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> or Web-based tools like <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">SVGOMG</a>.</p>

<h3>File handling</h3>
<p>Excalidraw already supports the experimental <a href="https://web.dev/file-handling/">File Handling API</a>, which means <code>.excalidraw</code> files can be double-clicked in the operating system’s file manager and open directly in the Excalidraw app, since Excalidraw registers as a file handler for <code>.excalidraw</code> files in the operating system.</p>
<h3>Declarative link capturing</h3>
<p>Excalidraw drawings can be shared by link—here is an <a href="https://excalidraw.com/#json=4646308765761536,jwZJW8JsOM75vdhqG2nBgA">example</a>. In the future, if people have Excalidraw installed as a PWA, such links will not open in a browser tab, but launch a new standalone window. This will work thanks to <a href="https://github.com/WICG/sw-launch/blob/master/declarative_link_capturing.md">declarative link capturing</a>, an, at the time of writing, bleeding-edge proposal for a new Web platform feature.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Web has come a long way, with more and more features landing in browsers that only a couple of years or even months ago were unthinkable on the Web and exclusive to native applications. Excalidraw is at the forefront of what is possible in the browser, all while acknowledging that not all browsers on all platforms support each feature we make use of. By betting on a progressive enhancement strategy, we enjoy the latest and greatest wherever possible, but without leaving anyone behind. Best viewed in <em>any</em> browser.</p>
<p>Electron has served us well, but in 2020 and beyond, we can live without it. Oh, and for that objective of <a href="https://github/com/vjeux">@vjeux</a>: since the Android Play Store now accepts PWAs in a container format called <a href="https://web.dev/using-a-pwa-in-your-android-app/">Trusted Web Activity</a> and since the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-edgehtml/microsoft-store">Microsoft Store supports PWAs</a>, too, you can expect Excalidraw in these stores in the not too distant future. Meanwhile, you can always use and install <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw in and from the browser</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Facebook often asks users to input their mobile phone numbers. Users are asked to input their mobile phone numbers for easier password recovery or for easier contacts discovery on messanger app.
Even if the mobile phone number is kept private and it is not public, the default facebook's privacy settings allows lookup of users through their mobile phone number, allowing malicious parties, such as spammers, to enumerate all those inattentive users.</p>

<p>With few lines of codes, and few facebook's account, it is possible to enumerate all the Facebook's users that didn't manually deactivated lookup by phone numbers. In few hours it is possible to populate a large database of users with respectively their name, surname, avatar photos and mobile phone numbers, along with all the public informations they input on Facebook. This database can then be used for unlegitimate purpose, such as advertising or spamming. In this brief report, i am going to show how I built a script for achieving this easily, and i put the result of my experiment.</p>

<h3>Anatomy of the search</h3>

<p>The Facebook's privacy policy that allows users to be looked up through their mobile phone number allows malicious party to make two different kind of search for ambigous purposes: 
</p><ul>
	<li>Retrieving a targeted users' phone number even if it is private;</li>
	<li>Enumerating all the users that didn't manually deactivated lookup by phone numbers, along with their phone numbers too.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, the attack vectors consist in brute forcing all the possible numbers and input them in the facebook search. Whenever a match is found, Facebook's search returns one and just one result, giving to the searcher the certainity that the searched phone numbers belong to that user.</p>

<p>We will discuss later about the facebook protections (such as request's rate limits) and how to avert them.</p>

<h3>Brute forcing all possible phone numbers in a restricted set.</h3>

<p>My experiment consisted in trying to enumerate italian facebook's users and retrieving their phone numbers. Mobile phone numbers are always composed by 10 digist, of which the first three depends on the carriers, so are usually easily predictable. Coding a script for generating all the possible phone numbers is trivial: with 32 common carrier's prefix, all the possibile italian phone numbers are 10<sup>7</sup>*32.</p>

<p>After populating locally this database, it is enough to perform a search on facebook using a browser, inspecting network's traffic and exporting the HAR (http archive). Then it is trivial to parse the request's archive and replay requests programmatically changing search's input. </p>

<p>During my experiment, using cookies from my personal facebook's account, â€¨I sent over 400 requests to Facebook in a total range of time of about 8 minutes, and matched 50 users: 50 strangers of which i got name, surname, photo and phone number, intended to be private, (and all the public info). I did not receive any limitation from Facebook.â€¨ The success rate was about 10%, so that each 10 requests searching for a random phone number a match was found.</p>

<p>Below a screenshot of the script executing on my shell:</p>

<h3>Averting rate limits</h3>

<p>Firstly saying there is not public knowledge about Facebook protections, a possible threat came to my mind: More or less Facebook receives a request from an account to â€˜search.phpâ€™ every time an user digits a character in the search input. A user searching a phone number using web user interface inputs 10 characters, so that about 10 requests are sent to Facebookâ€™s server. An user performing some searches on Facebook's website sends an huge amount of requests. This could suggest that Facebook expects many request by the same account for searches, allowing malicious searcher to perform more requests without limitations.</p>

<p>Putting a random timeout between requests helps preventing being marked by facebook as an automated tool (prohibited by facebook's policy).</p>

<h3>Making the attack more effective</h3>

<p>Using such a trivial tool it is possible to populate a large database of mobile phone's contacts. Parallelizing the searches with many accounts it is possible to slolwly query the facebook's database and retrieve all the contacts' information. The attack can be easily distribuited.</p>

<p>In order not to sent useless request to facebook's servers (searching of not existing phone numbers, for example), it is possibile to use free services such as Twilio's apis that allows to lookup phone numbers to check their existency. For a small amount of money (half cent of dollar), it is even possible to lookup the mobile carrier of a given phone number.</p>

<h3>Targeting a single user</h3>
<p>Targeting a single user to retrieve its phone number is also possible. In fact, it is enough to retreive its facebook's username (which is public), and input it in reset password form. Facebook will show the last two digits of its mobile phone number, restricting the searched space. In fact, assuming the nationality of user's mobile phone carriers, possibile permutations are: n_carriers_prefix*10<sup>5</sup>. In case of italians phone numbers, possibile phone numers are 32M. <br>
Making so many queries to Facebook's server is surely not trivial, but parallelizing the attack makes it possible. Moreover, in the meantime we find a match, we can enumerate all the users that helds the tried phone numbers.</p>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Even if Facebook's privacy policy expects such behavior, protections adopted to prevent misues seems not to be effective. Malicious users can easily populate large databases and using it for unlegitimate purposes (such as spam). Facebook, as other social networks, offers highly customizable privacy settings, but these settings have a default beahvior that in most cases could be dangerous for users' privacy. Thought most of the users are inattentive to privacy's issues, these default settings should have the most possibile privacy-preventing configurations.</p>

	<p><strong> Der Chef des TÃ¼binger Biotech-Unternehmens Curevac spricht sich dafÃ¼r aus, im Kampf gegen Corona die Patente nicht verfallen zu lassen, aber sie kurzfristig auszusetzen. So kann die Forschung schneller arbeiten. </strong></p>
	
	

















		
		
	<p> Stuttgart - Franz-Werner Haas, der Vorstandschef des Tübinger Biotech-Unternehmens <a href="https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/thema/Curevac" title="Curevac">Curevac</a>, fordert eine enge internationale Zusammenarbeit, um die Weiterentwicklung eines Corona-Impfstoffs zu fördern. <a href="https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.interview-mit-den-chefs-des-tuebinger-impfstoffherstellers-curevac-wir-kaempfengegen-das-virusund-die-zeit.8fe0d5d1-ecb6-4f64-aab3-e5e35749fd7e.html" target="_blank">Neben dem Teilen von Studiendaten zur Wirksamkeit vorhandener Impfstoffe zählt er dazu auch die Aussetzung von Patenten, sagte er unserer Zeitung</a>. Die Patente sollten zwar grundsätzlich erteilt, in der Pandemiephase aber ausgesetzt werden. Er folgt damit einer Empfehlung der Welthandelsorganisation (WTO). â€žWir brauchen einanderâ€œ, sagt auch Curevac-Gründer Ingmar Hoerr zur Bekämpfung der Pandemie. â€žDas Brett, das wir bohren, ist einfach zu dick.â€œ</p>

	<p>Curevac ist nach Biontech das zweite deutsche Unternehmen, das einen Covid-19-Impfstoff auf den Markt bringt. Die entscheidende Testphase hat in dieser Woche begonnen. Haas erwartet erste Ergebnisse im ersten Quartal 2021. Auf dieser Basis rechnet er mit einer vorläufigen Zulassung und dem Beginn der Impfung mit dem Curevac-Impfstoff im zweiten Quartal 2021. </p>
	
	

















		
		
	<p>Das Vakzin käme damit später als die Produkte einiger Wettbewerber auf den Markt, mit denen nach den neuesten Planungen noch vor Weihnachten die ersten Deutschen geimpft werden sollen. Haas begründet den zeitlichen Verzug damit, viel Zeit in eine bessere Lagerfähigkeit des eigenen Impfstoffs investiert zu haben. Der Curevac-Impfstoff kann bei Kühlschranktemperatur drei Monate gelagert werden. Hingegen muss etwa das Vakzin von Biontech bei minus 70 Grad gelagert werden, was die Impflogistik verkompliziert. Zur nachhaltigen Bekämpfung der Pandemie müsse weltweit intensiv geimpft werden, fordert Hoerr.</p>
	
	

















		
		
	<h2>Schutzbedürftige Gruppen könnten laut Haas bis Sommer geimpft sein</h2> <p>In Deutschland können nach Einschätzung von Haas bis zum Sommer besondere schutzbedürftige Gruppen geimpft sein. Bis Ende 2021 sollten auch all diejenigen geimpft werden können, für die noch spezifische Studien durchgeführt werden müssen, wie etwa Kinder oder Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen.</p>
	
	

















		
		
	<p>Bei den Corona-Impfungen haben Personen, die älter als 80 Jahre alt sind, sowie Menschen, die in Alten- und Pflegeheimen leben oder arbeiten â€žhöchste Prioritätâ€œ. So steht es im Referentenentwurf der â€žVerordnung zum Anspruch auf Schutzimpfung gegen das Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2â€œ von Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU). Der Minister hat angekündigt, die Verordnung an diesem Freitag unterzeichnen zu wollen.</p>

<!-- NOWRAPPER(!) -->          














<!-- oms_zone does not match -->

	

















		
		
	<p>In die Gruppe mit â€žhöchster Prioritätâ€œ fallen auch Personen, die von ambulanten Pflegediensten betreut werden oder die dort tätig sind. Die Impfung findet in den Zentren statt, deren Standorte die Länder festlegen. Im Land gibt es 59 Impfzentren. Seit dem 15. Dezember sind sogenannte Zentrale Zentren eingerichtet worden. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After looking at the features, components and libraries for Vue, React and Angular it’s time to do an actual comparison of the three. While in terms of popularity React is still top there are substantial differences in where each of the frameworks excels. So even if you’re already committed to one (or want to switch) it’s probably a good idea to check out exactly how they measure up against each other in a few key aspects.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Before we get to the meat it’s probably prudent to point out what these differences stem from. Each of the three frameworks has a different approach to development and aims at helping devs in a different way. <strong>React and Angular are developed by big companies</strong> namely Facebook and Google while <strong>Vue has started as a side project</strong> of a Google developer. While all are JavaScript based, each presents a slightly different syntax approach. React uses JavaScript and JSX (which combines HTML and JavaScript logic), Angular uses TypeScript (HTML and TypeScript logic is split) Vue uses JavaScript (HTML and JavaScript logic is split). All of them are component-driven, but they treat coding them differently along with a number of default features included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>React</strong> combines the UI and behavior of components, the same code is responsible for both creating a UI component and dictating its behavior. </li>
<li><strong>Vue</strong> takes the same approach and even lets you combine the UI and behavior of components from within a script. </li>
<li><strong>Angular</strong> completely separates the two, the UI parts of components are attributes of HTML tags while their behaviors are in the form of JavaScript code. </li>
</ul>

<td><strong>Vue</strong></td>

<td><em>JavaScript</em></td>
<td><em>fair amount</em></td>

<h2>Learning curve</h2>
<p>Finally the main difference in approach is probably the learning curve. Vue is the easiest to learn and can even serve as a stepping stone for learning the two others, as there is some overlap especially in handling components. Simplicity and customizability obviously have their advantages, but there are also some drawbacks as it makes it somewhat difficult to debug and test. React is middle of the road, it is harder to get into but has great documentation and an easy to follow starting guide. The drawback is it does require use of third party libraries for more complex stuff. This makes the learning curve not so steep but highly dependent on what you actually want to do and what third party libraries you’ll need to learn to do it. Angular is the complete framework, but also has the steepest learning curve requiring learning TypeScript, RxJS and MVC. The investment of time and effort may prove well worth it as mastering it will make building your app a breeze.</p>

<h2>Minimalism vs all-in-one</h2>
<p>Approach and philosophy are important and all but that’s mostly just the pitch. For a clearer picture it’s better to look at the features. As mentioned above React takes a minimalistic approach here, it provides you with a library for rendering content to the DOM. It does provide some rudimentary built-in state management support but you’ll likely need to use a state management library like Redux (which is fortunately quite easy to learn). There aren’t any other special features and if you need some other functionalities you’ll need to check out community provided solutions. That does make it a lot slimmer than the other two, but can be a hassle if you’re working on a complex project and looking to get started from the get go. Vue is the middle ground, it provides some features, but isn’t the complete package Angular is. You get built in state management as well as a built-in router. Though for form validation you’ll need something like the Vuelidate library and a library for Http client functions (there’s quite a few to choose from) Angular gives you all these features out of the box and more, there’s an official CLI which helps building, managing, updating and deploying projects even easier.</p>

<h2>Less is more</h2>
<p>The thought that comes to mind is probably, why not go with Angular, after all it has the most features. Well more isn’t always better and as mentioned the steep learning curve can be a turnoff especially if you’re looking to get started right away or working on projects requiring less complex solutions out of the box. Oh and emphasis on ‘out-of-the-box’ here, it’s not like Vue and React are useless when it comes to features. Just the opposite, they’re freely available to you when you need them, you just need to reach out to the community instead of getting them built-in with the framework. As you can see it comes to personal preference and focusing on what fits you best now and what might fit you best in the future, hopefully this little piece helped with that at least a little bit.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
<p>As <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank">SenX</a> enters its second week of remote work, I thought it would be a good time to write about the importance of time and <a href="https://blog.senx.io/working-with-geo-data-in-warp-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">geo time series</a> during a pandemic like the one we are experiencing with the coronavirus and the associated COVID-19.</p>



<p>For millions if not billions of people on Earth, <strong>some time series has become the most important thing to look at.</strong> Whether it is the #FlattenTheCurve graph or the Hammer and the dance illustration, or the various graphs showing the evolution of the number of cases, recovering patients, and unfortunately deaths, those are all-time series, i.e. graphs whose x-axis represents the time and the y-axis the evolution of tracked quantities.</p>



<figure><img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5e6aac7295ff060008467cf9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Science_Covid19-Infographic.jpg" alt="Coronavirus COVID-19 #FlattenTheCurve strategy"><figcaption>#FlattenTheCurve</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Contact Tracing</h2>



<p>But another trend about to begin will bring people exposed even more to time series. As the world learns how countries such as Singapore, South Korea, or Taiwan have dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact Tracing</a> has appeared in the media and will soon be in everybody's mouth.</p>



<p>The reaction to that notion, which is widely used in public health but may appear new to many, varies from country to country, and among countries varies with culture, political background, or religious belief. Some are considering it as the end of privacy and liberty. The others as a salvation technique or more moderate ones as a good temporary tactic for fighting the outbreak.</p>



<h3>But what exactly is contact tracing? </h3>



<p>The idea is very simple. It keeps a log of who you came close to so when someone gets tested positive with COVID-19 his or her log can be accessed. The people appearing in the log can be contacted to test them too. Logs used to be your memory, now with the advent of technology they can be tracked automatically.</p>



<p>By relying on those automated logs, the sphere of contagion of the newly discovered patient can easily be determined from the patient's own log and from those of the people that were in contact with that patient with the same process being extended as individuals are tested positive.</p>



<h3>How are the people you came in contact with identified? </h3>



<p>Well, that is rather simple, with the help of technology. Contact tracing relies on a mobile app which exploits the <strong>Bluetooth signal of the phone</strong> it is installed on. Bluetooth is a short-range radio system. It means that it cannot be transmitted more than a few meters. So technically if you can receive the Bluetooth signal from another phone, then this phone is in the vicinity of yours. </p>

<p>When that happens, the mobile application adds an entry to its log, saying it saw a signal from another application. The id logged is a random id that is assigned to your phone at the time you installed the app. <strong>Only the organization responsible for the application can associate this random id with your phone number</strong>. So yes, you should trust this organization for willing to not do evil.</p>



<p>That is all there is to it, contact tracing in a few paragraphs. </p>



<h3>Back to our own topic now </h3>



<p>The log kept by the contact tracing application has one important component, <strong>the timestamping</strong> of the entries. Because if you came in contact with someone more than 21 days ago (roughly the longest incubation period for COVID-19), then there is no need to contact that person as you were probably not contagious when you two came close. So yes, the base of contact tracing is recording time series and later analyzing them to reconstruct a timed graph of interactions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>What about Warp 10?</h2>



<p><a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10</a> is our advanced time series platform. It can be used to analyze those time series, even at a large scale, at the scale of a whole population if need be. So any agency willing to put contact tracing in place should contact us, we can help.</p>



<p>Note that beyond the contact tracing some countries have used in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be some other situations where more information may need to be collected, most notably actual location data when a pathogen agent is really contagious and can stay in the environment and spread without human to human contact. In that case, besides obvious debates about privacy or lack thereof that would be legitimate to have, the data collected are no longer simply time series but geo time series. And there again Warp 10 can help to analyze them.</p>



<p>The weeks to come will undoubtedly bring on the table the question of contact tracing. I hope this article helped you understand better how it works. The social implication of contact tracing will need to be balanced with the benefit that it can bring to fighting the ongoing pandemic. When those debates will have settled, remember that technology such as Warp 10 can help analyze those data fast.</p>



<p><strong>Keep safe, stay at home!</strong></p>



<p>The Ministry of Health of Singapore just announced it would be open-sourcing its own contact tracing application is used for fighting the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This simple psychological trick could vastly reduce tech's carbon footprint.</p><article><p>We humans are creatures of comfort. We like taking the easy route, the low-hanging fruit, the way that doesn’t make us think.</p><p>That’s why default options and standards are so powerful. We’re more likely to stick with them than go out on a limb for the bright red options just out of reach.</p><p>In this article, I’ll show you how defaults can be used to save energy and thereby reduce CO₂ emissions in technology.</p><h2>The Default Effect</h2><p>Whether you’re designing a product, service or process, <strong>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect"><em>default effect</em></a> is a powerful way to influence behavior</strong>.</p><p>Crafty webfolk use defaults to hide things from users, trick them into buying things they don’t want, giving up more personal information than they want, or signing up for newsletters they don’t need. When used to morally reproachable ends, such <a href="https://darkpatterns.org/hall-of-shame.html">dark patterns</a> can lead to quick gains. But they damage the business in the long run.</p><p>Facebook is a prime example of tricking users into sharing personal information when they assume the default settings are meant to guard their privacy. There’s even a dark pattern with its CEO’s namesake: “<a href="https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/privacy-zuckering.html">privacy zuckering</a>.”</p><p>But the default effect can also be used for good intent.</p><p>For example, in Germany you have to opt-in to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation">organ donation</a> – the default option is to be opted out. The consent rate is a meager 12%. Across the border in Austria however, the default effect works in your favor. There you’re opted in per default. The consent rate is a proud 99%.</p><p>In 2015, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/us/california-law-will-automatically-register-drivers-to-vote.html">“motor voter” law in California</a> was passed. It automatically registers new drivers to vote unless they opt out, thus nudging millions of Californians towards their civic responsibility.</p><h2>How Changing Defaults Would Save Energy</h2><p>Whenever data is stored on servers, transferred over telecommunications networks or processed on end user devices, the electronics involved consume electricity. The energy consumption of the internet may have already surpassed that of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think">airline industry</a> and is more than <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/global-warming-data-centres-consume-three-times-much-energy-next-decade-experts-warn-a6830086.html">1 ⅓ times that of the UK</a> as a whole.</p><p>So by reducing the amount of data we store, transfer or process, we reduce the energy needed. Less coal, biofuels or atom rods need to be burned, fewer windmills need to turn, fewer solar panels need to operate.</p><p>So us tech workers need to ask ourselves</p><blockquote><p>Does the default option or standard use the least amount of energy possible?</p></blockquote><h2>Low Power Mode in Devices Per Default</h2><p>When your iPhone is running low on juice, it’ll ask you to turn on low-power mode. Doing so stops automatic mail fetching and background app refreshing and reduces some visual effects. But why wait until you’re running for the next outlet?</p><p>You could, of course, set up an <a href="https://medium.com/macoclock/turn-on-low-power-mode-at-any-ios14-trick-6f5cfcb3b3cd">automation to enable Low Power Mode</a> at any battery level. But that’s more of a thing for <em>power users</em> (excuse the pun 🙃).</p><p>A greener alternative for the masses would be to have low-power mode enabled by default. The system could ask whether to turn on “High Power Mode” for tasks that need it.</p><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-dialog-low-power-mode.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DON'T:</strong></span> Ask to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery's already low.</figcaption></figure><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-dialog-high-power-mode.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DO:</strong></span> Have Low Power Mode on by default – and ask for more power only when it's needed.</figcaption></figure><p>The Mac’s energy settings are a bit complicated. There have been calls for a simpler <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/15/call-for-low-power-mode-for-macs/">iPhone-style Low Power Mode on MacBooks</a>.</p><p>Also, do Siri and Alexa really need to burn the candle at both ends, constantly waiting on your beckon call and sipping electricity throughout the night? They should just go to sleep when you do, maybe suggesting their own sleep times based on your latest/earliest interactions.</p><h2>Reduce web data with the “pull” principle</h2><p>Reducing the number of bytes you send to users not only corresponds to a smaller carbon footprint, it also means content loads faster, thus leading to happier users and better business metrics. So just how much web data are we talking about?</p><p>The <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight?start=2020_01_01&amp;end=latest&amp;view=list">HTTP Archive</a> reports on the page weight of millions of websites.</p><p>I took a look at the latest median (p50) transfer sizes of the following data types and have ranked them from smallest to largest:</p><p>Median data transfer in kilobytes by type<br>(p50, October 2020)</p><p><span>Desktop</span><span>Mobile</span></p><dl><dt>HTML</dt><dd><span>25.8</span></dd><dd><span>24.1</span></dd><dt>CSS</dt><dd><span>72.7</span></dd><dd><span>66.9</span></dd><dt>Fonts</dt><dd><span>131.4</span></dd><dd><span>111.1</span></dd><dt>JavaScript</dt><dd><span>451.7</span></dd><dd><span>412.5</span></dd><dt>Images</dt><dd><span>973.4</span></dd><dd><span>902.9</span></dd><dt>Video</dt><dd><span>1538.2</span></dd><dd><span>1867.9</span></dd></dl><p>We see that in terms of the number of bytes flying around the web, <strong>videos, images and JavaScript are the biggest energy hogs</strong>.</p><p>The best way to reduce the amount of data on the web: avoiding transferring it to the user altogether until she actively requests, or <em>pulls</em>, it from the web via interaction (e.g button click) or navigation (e.g. lazy loading).</p><p>Here are some examples.</p><h3>Don’t auto-play videos</h3><p>Videos are by far the biggest offenders when it comes to putting the Internet on an energy diet.</p><p>And video chat and entertainment have exploded due to Corona. Video chat apparently has a much <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think">lower impact than meeting in person</a>. I’d love to find similar comparisons between the home theater and the one that smells of overpriced popcorn and soft drinks.</p><p>Still, the point I’m trying to make in this post is: we still need to be aware of the cost of our data use and design system defaults to use minimal energy.</p><p>For example, Netflix makes it so easy for users to binge watch entire series. Not only do they provide stellar content, they auto-play it too.</p><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-autoplay-1.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DON'T:</strong></span> Auto-play the next 45 minutes of your life.</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blr.design/img//green-by-default-autoplay-2.svg"><figcaption><span><strong>DO:</strong></span> Add a bit of friction when it comes to data consumption.</figcaption></figure><p>By having auto-play off by default, the user would have to actively play the next video. And while that might not help you right after watching a cliffhanger, it provides just a bit of friction to avoid more data transfer.</p><p>Another way streaming sites could be green by default: saving videos locally for a period of time. My child, for example, loves watching a certain show. Instead of pulling the videos from Netflix servers each time she views them, the app could just play them from the local cache if requested within a week or two. That would require quite a bit of storage on my device – but that’s not really a problem.</p><p>If you use video on your site, think about using the default effect to limit data use: you can make sure videos don’t auto-play.

December 17, 2020 | https://unop.uk/dotnet-5-self-contained-single-file-apps-linux/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://unop.uk/dotnet-5-self-contained-single-file-apps-linux/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            

<p>.NET 5 is out <a href="https://unop.uk/dotnet-core-3-0-and-dotnet-5-0">on schedule</a> (but with a reduced scope).
The Core branding has gone but it’s the same modern cross-platform codebase and not the old Windows-only Framework.</p>

<p>I’m normally a <abbr title="Long Term Support">LTS</abbr> person (I only upgraded from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to 20.04 LTS recently, now that 20.10 is out).
As you become an experienced engineer you learn to value LTS and stop chasing the latest JavaScript framework of the week.
Most of my projects (for example, <a href="https://unop.uk/huxley-2-release/">Huxley 2</a>) will stay on 3.1 LTS until at least next year when .NET 6 LTS comes out.</p>

<p>However, there is one feature of .NET 5 that is quite interesting and I wanted to try out.
This feature is self-contained <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0/#single-file-applications">single file apps</a> and it is only available on Linux (not on mac or Windows, yet).
This is another area where Linux is a step ahead.</p>

<h2 id="octoplot">OctoPlot</h2>

<p>I’ve upgraded my <a href="https://unop.uk/octoplot-visualise-paid-energy-use-in-your-terminal/">OctoPlot</a> tool to .NET 5 and produced some self-contained single file app Linux binaries. You can stay on 3.1 and use the 5.0 SDK but the binaries are bigger. I also trimmed out any unused code from the assemblies (including <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run">R2R</a>, which is not the same AOT compilation as CoreRT or .NET Native) to get them as small as possible.</p>

<p>The result is a binary under 5MB compressed. This is by no means tiny compared to a Python script but it includes the runtime, making it easy to deploy. This is about a quarter of the size of the previous release artefacts.</p>

<p>If you want to see the results in action then you can <code>wget</code> (or <code>curl</code>) a binary from <a href="https://github.com/jpsingleton/octoplot/releases/1.0.1">the GitHub release</a>.
For example, on a Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS (e.g. a <a href="https://unop.uk/pi-hole-extended-part-2/">pi hole</a>) use the following commands (replace <code>arm</code> with <code>x64</code> or <code>arm64</code> as appropriate).</p>

<p>Download with <code>wget</code> (upper case <code>O</code>):</p>

<pre><code>wget -O octoplot.xz https://github.com/jpsingleton/octoplot/releases/download/1.0.1/octoplot-linux-arm.xz
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you prefer <code>curl</code> (lower case <code>o</code>):</p>

<pre><code>curl -L -o octoplot.xz https://github.com/jpsingleton/octoplot/releases/download/1.0.1/octoplot-linux-arm.xz
</code></pre>

<p><code>-L</code> is required to follow the GitHub redirect to AWS S3.</p>

<p>Then decompress the binary, make it executable and run it.</p>

<pre><code>xz -d octoplot.xz
chmod +x octoplot
./octoplot j
</code></pre>

<p>You should specify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_network_operator#History">region ID character</a> for the area you are interested in.
E.g. <code>j</code> for South East England, the default value is <code>p</code> (North Scotland).
Add it to your <code>PATH</code> if you want to run <code>octoplot</code> from anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<p>If you want to build it for yourself then you can install .NET 5 with your usual <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu#2004-">package manager</a>.
Before you start using it you may want to disable the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry">telemetry</a> that is on by default.
You can do this in many places, e.g. <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>export DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
</code></pre>

<p>Or in <code>/etc/environment</code> (no need for the <code>export</code> command here) for wider reach:</p>

<pre><code>DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
</code></pre>

<p>You can also alter your <code>PATH</code> here.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I use my <code>octoplot</code> tool to help me plan when the cheapest time will be to run appliances.
For example, when to set the timer on the oven for to be paid for it to pyrolytic auto-clean.</p>

<p>Our latest Agile bill from Octopus Energy put the average cost per kWh at about 8p, which is roughly half-price compared to fixed tariffs. This would save us over £300 a year if it continues.</p>

<p>You can use my <a href="https://unop.uk/octoyosu-agile-tariff-comparison-tool/">Octoyosu</a> tool to see how much you could save.
If you want to switch then you can thank me (and save £50) by using <a href="https://share.octopus.energy/witty-wave-889">this referral link</a>.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary (pun intended) as we have an <a href="https://unop.uk/ev-reading/">EV</a> (a second hand Leaf) that I typically charge overnight at weekends.
I’ll save a follow-up review after a few more months of ownership for a future post but in summary it’s best car I’ve ever driven. It’s so much fun to drive and outrageously cheap to run but it still hasn’t stopped me from walking to the shops.</p>

<p>It’s not just about cost and it’s important to reduce usage too. I don’t want to be part of the problem.</p>

<p>I’ve finished reading Clearing the Air: The Beginning and the End of Air Pollution by Tim Smedley, which is excellent and well worth a read. Although EVs produce no exhaust emissions and produce less from brake wear, they still re-suspend pollution on the road produced by fossil cars. Sitting in traffic is the worst place to be from an exposure perspective, plus there’s the obvious additional negative health implications from lack of exercise.</p>

<p>Speaking of exercise, last weekend (as a lockdown project) I lagged the loft with insulation made from recycled glass, improving what was there already.
As autumn leaves (fall) and winter arrives, this should help reduce our energy usage when the freezing temperatures come in December. It helped that I’m used to wearing a face mask now!</p>

Recently someone opened up an <a href="https://github.com/elixir-gettext">issue on Gettext</a> saying compilation of Gettext modules got slower in Erlang/OTP 23. In this article, we are going to explore how I have debugged this problem and the three separate pull requests sent to the Erlang/OTP repository to improve compiler performance.</p>
<p>
For those not familar, the Gettext project converts <code>.po</code> files like this:</p>
<pre><code># pt
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr "Olá mundo"

# pl
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr "Witaj świecie"</code></pre>
<p>
Into a module with functions:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>translate</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-1">(</span><span>"pt"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Olá mundo"</span><span>
</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>translate</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-2">(</span><span>"pl"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-2">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Witaj świecie"</span></code></pre>
<p>
While we start with an Elixir application, we end-up doing most of the work with the Erlang compiler and tools, so most of the lessons here are applicable to the wider ecosystem. Be sure to read until the end for a welcome surprise.</p>
<h2>
Isolating the slow file</h2>
<p>
When project compilation is slow, the first step is to identify which files are slow. In Elixir v1.11, this can be done like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix compile --force --profile time</code></pre>
<p>
The command above will print:</p>
<pre><code>...
[profile] lib/ecto/query/planner.ex compiled in 1376ms (plus 596ms waiting)
[profile] lib/ecto/association.ex compiled in 904ms (plus 1168ms waiting)
[profile] lib/ecto/changeset.ex compiled in 869ms (plus 1301ms waiting)
[profile] Finished compilation cycle of 95 modules in 2579ms
[profile] Finished group pass check of 95 modules in 104ms</code></pre>
<p>
Compilation of each file in your project is done in parallel. The overall message is:</p>
<pre><code>[profile] FILE compiled in COMPILE_TIME (plus WAITING_TIME waiting)</code></pre>
<p>
<code>COMPILE_TIME</code> is the time we were effectively compiling code. However, since a file may depend on a module defined in another file, <code>WAITING_TIME</code> is the time we wait until the file we depend on becomes available. High waiting times are not usually a concern, so we focus on the files with high compilation times.</p>
<p>
At the end, we print two summaries:</p>
<pre><code>[profile] Finished compilation cycle of 95 modules in 2579ms
[profile] Finished group pass check of 95 modules in 104ms</code></pre>
<p>
The first includes the time to compile all files in parallel and includes how many modules have been defined. The second is the time to execute a group pass which looks at all modules at once, in order to find undefined functions, emit deprecations, etc.</p>
<p>
Unless the “group pass check” is the slow one - which would be a bug in the Elixir compiler - we are often looking at a single file being the root cause of slow compilation. With this file in hand, it is time to dig deeper.</p>
<h2>
Timing the slow file</h2>
<p>
Once we have identified the slow file, we need to understand why it is slow. When Elixir compiles a file, it executes code at three distinct stages. For example, let’s assume the slow down was in <code>lib/problematic_file.ex</code> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span># FILE LEVEL</span><span>
</span><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>ProblematicModule</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span># MODULE LEVEL</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span># FUNCTION LEVEL</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0623758596-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
When compiling the file above, Elixir will execute each level in order. If that file has multiple modules, then compilation will happen for each module in the file, first at MODULE LEVEL and then FUNCTION LEVEL.</p>

TIP: If a file with multiple modules is slow, I suggest breaking those modules into separate files and repeating the steps in the previous section.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With this knowledge in hand, we want to compile the file once again, but now passing the <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time</code> flag to the underlying Erlang compiler, which will print time reports. One option is to do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix compile
$ touch lib/problematic_file.ex
$ ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix compile</code></pre>
<p>
Then, for each module being compiled (which includes the one in your <code>mix.exs</code>), you will see a report like this:</p>
<pre><code>core             :  0.653 s   72136.4 kB
sys_core_fold    :  0.482 s   69055.3 kB
sys_core_alias   :  0.146 s   69055.3 kB
core_transforms  :  0.000 s   69055.3 kB
sys_core_bsm     :  0.098 s   69055.3 kB
v3_kernel        :  2.250 s  169439.0 kB</code></pre>
<p>
Most compilers work by doing multiple passes on your code. Above we can see how much time was spent on each pass and how much memory the code representation, also known as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), takes after each pass.</p>
<p>
The <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix compile</code> command above has one issue though. If other files depend on the problematic file, they may be recompiled too, and that will add noise to your output. If that’s the case, you can also do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix run lib/problematic_file.ex</code></pre>
<p>
This is a rather neat trick: we are re-running a file that we have just compiled. You will get warnings about modules being redefined but they are safe to ignore.</p>
<p>
With the time reports in hand, there are two possible scenarios here:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
One (or several) of the passes in the report are slow. This means the slow down happens when compiling at the FUNCTION LEVEL and it will be associated with the generation of the <code>.beam</code> file for <code>ProblematicModule</code>    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
All passes are fast and the slow down happens before the reports emitted by <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time</code> are printed. If this is the case, the slowdown is actually happening at the MODULE LEVEL, before the generation of the <code>.beam</code> file    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Most times, the slowdown is actually at the FUNCTION LEVEL, including the one reported as a Gettext issue, so that’s the one we will explore. Performance issues at the MODULE LEVEL may still happen though, especially in large module bodies as seen in Phoenix’s Router - but don’t worry, those have often already been optimized throughout the years!</p>
<h2>
Moving to Erlang</h2>
<p>
At this point, we have found a module that is slow to compile. Given the original Gettext issue pointed to a difference of performance between Erlang versions, my next step is to remove Elixir from the equation.</p>
<p>
Luckily, this is very easy to do with the <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/decompile">decompile</a> project:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix archive.install github michalmuskala/decompile
$ mix decompile ProblematicModule --to erl</code></pre>
<p>
This command will emit a <code>Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code> file, which is literally the compiled Elixir code, represented in Erlang. Now, let’s compile it again, but without involving Elixir at all:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +time Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>
TIP: the command above may not work out of the box. That’s because the <code>.erl</code> file generated by <code>decompile</code> may have invalid syntax. In those cases, you can manually fix those errors. They are often small nits.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to try it yourself, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/josevalim/694c1799143fcf25e43aa27e3e11e4c1">find the <code>.erl</code> file for the Gettext report here</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +time Elixir.GettextCompile.Gettext.erl</code></pre>
<p>
Here are the relevant snippets of the report I got on my machine:</p>
<pre><code>...
expand_records         :      0.065 s   19988.0 kB
core                   :      3.295 s  373293.3 kB
...
beam_ssa_bool          :      1.125 s   39252.7 kB
...
beam_ssa_bsm           :      2.432 s   39263.1 kB
   ...
beam_ssa_funs          :      0.119 s   39263.1 kB
beam_ssa_opt           :      6.242 s   39298.0 kB
   ...
...
beam_ssa_pre_codegen   :      3.426 s   48897.5 kB
   ...
...</code></pre>
<p>
Looking at the report you can start building an intuition about which passes are slow. Given we were also told the code compiled fast on Erlang/OTP 22.3, I compiled the same file with that Erlang version and compared the reports side by side. Here are my notes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
The <code>core</code> pass got considerably slower between Erlang/OTP versions (from 1.8s to 3.2s)    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Going from the <code>expand_records</code> pass to <code>core</code> increases the memory usage by almost 20 times (although this behaviour was also there on Erlang/OTP 22)    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
The <code>beam_ssa_bool</code> did not exist on Erlang/OTP 22    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
In Erlang/OTP 22.3, the module takes 22 seconds to compile. On version 23.1, it takes 32 seconds. We have some notes and a reasonable target of 22 seconds to optimize towards. Let’s get to work.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
Note: it is worth saying that it is very natural for new passes to be added and others to be removed between Erlang/OTP versions, precisely because the compiler is getting smarter all the time! As part of this process, some passes get faster and others get slower. Such is life. :)  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
Pull request #1: the profiler option</h2>
<p>
The Erlang compiler also has a neat feature that alows us to profile any compiler pass. Since we have detected the slow down in the <code>core</code> file, let’s profile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +'{eprof, core}' Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code></pre>
<p>
It will print a report like this:</p>
<pre><code>core: Running eprof

****** Process &lt;0.111.0&gt;    -- 100.00 % of profiled time ***
FUNCTION                   CALLS        %      TIME  [uS / CALLS]

gen:do_for_proc/2              1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
gen:'-call/4-fun-0-'/4         1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:unforce/2              2     0.00         0  [      0.00]

v3_core:expr_map/4             1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:safe_map/2             1     0.00         0  [      0.00]</code></pre>
<p>
With the slowest entries coming at the bottom. In this Gettext module, the slowest entry was:</p>
<pre><code>cerl_trees:mapfold/4     3220377    19.14   2447684  [      0.76]</code></pre>
<p>
Jackpot! 20% of the compilation time was spent on a single function. This is a great opportunity for optimization.</p>
<p>
I usually like to say there are two types of performance improvements. You have semantic improvements, which you can only pull off by having a grasp of the domain. The more you understand, the more likely you are to be able to come up with an improved algorithm (or the more you will be certain you are already implementing the state of the art). There are also mechanical improvements, which are more about how the runtime and the data structures in the language work. Often you work with a mixture of both.</p>
<p>
In this case, the function <code>cerl_trees:mapfold/4</code> is a function that traverses all AST nodes recursively. You can also see it was called more than 3 million times. The <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/db13f8883721c7a217a80cb2c73a1e419f462d83/lib/compiler/src/v3_core.erl#L3040">caller of this function in the <code>core</code> pass has the following goal</a>:</p>

              <p>If you’re of a certain age, then you remember Pez, the candy, and even more so, the ingenious spring-loaded mechanical dispensers. They were the kid’s equivalent of a gold cigarette lighter.</p>
<p>Some things I bet you didn’t know:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Pez originated in Austria and was originally marketed as a smoking cessation aid.</li>
<li>Pez tablets started out peppermint flavored. The name comes from the first, middle, and last letters in the German word for peppermint (pfefferminz).</li>
<li>The transition from breath mint to fruit flavored candy was driven by the plan to market Pez to kids.</li>
<li>The iconic Pez dispenser design is patented.</li>
<li>Some of the rarest Pez dispensers now sell for thousands of dollars.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This is a post I've been wanting to write for a while now. I want to put down in layman's terms what various cryptographic operations represent, and common use cases for them. When designing large systems we don't need to get bogged down in details of how a Diffie-Hellman handshake works, what we need are abstractions, patterns and black boxes we can effectively use together and reason about.</p><p>With this post I hope to present terms you may or may not have heard before, hopefully with a few examples, one for anyone to understand and at least one for developers to understand.</p><p>Before we go any further it's worth mentioning the old adage - never roll your own crypto. Always build on proven, audited libraries and preferably get the implementation looked at by someone who knows what they're doing. Cryptographic operations can fail (often silently) in unpredictable ways, leaving you stuck with the assumption that what you've built is secure, when it's really not.</p><div><h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2><p>Hashing has many, many use cases in the digital world. For our purposes it can be easiest to explain hashing as a deep check for equality. Given two things (files, sentences, words, images) how do we ascertain that they are identical? This can be hard to reason about outside of computing because almost never are two items perfectly equal.</p><h5 id="in-a-system">In a system</h5><p>The most common use case almost all of us will be familiar with is password hashing. When users enter their password we don’t want to store that in plaintext, if a database of raw user passwords was leaked it’d be catastrophic. What we do instead is hash the password and store that. If the database is ever leaked the user passwords can’t be reversed from the hash.</p><p>I don’t need to provide another example for hashing because it’s so common, however let’s briefly look at how we might leverage hashing to build a custom image caching system. When we browse user profiles on a mobile application, the mobile application (hopefully) doesn’t fetch the images every time you see the image. What it <em>could</em> do, to save bandwidth, is just send the hash of the current image to the server. The server checks if this hash matches the hash of the latest upload, and only sends the new image if it doesn’t match, meaning the clients version is outdated.</p><h2 id="symmetric-encryption">Symmetric encryption</h2><p>Symmetric encryption is something most of us are probably familiar with, however if not, it’s simply the act of encrypting something with a key. If you don’t have the key, you can’t decrypt the data.</p><p>A good analogy can be to liken symmetric encryption with a safe. It’s big, heavy and you know whatever’s in there is going to be private. If you’ve got the combination - awesome - you’ve got full access to it. If not, you’re out of luck and you’re gonna have to try break it open.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-1">In a system</h5><p>As a practical example of symmetric encryption in a wider digital system, imagine you want to save data in the cloud. You’ve run out of space on your laptop and want to use Dropbox to store your data. Just sending your data to Dropbox is a recipe for disaster, anyone at Dropbox would be able to view your private information. However if you generate a symmetric key and encrypt your data with it before sending it to Dropbox, you know no one else is going to be able to see it.</p><h2 id="asymmetric-encryption">Asymmetric encryption</h2><p>Asymmetric encryption is a really powerful concept we can model entire systems around. It all boils down to there being a different key for encryption and decryption.</p><p>As a simple example, let’s liken asymmetric encryption to a letterbox. With a letterbox anyone can put mail in it, however only people with the key can read said mail. This is at odds with symmetric encryption from our previous example, where you need the key to put anything into the box.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-2">In a system</h5><p>I’ve struggled here to just pick one example to explore, but perhaps the most relevant is encrypted communication. With asymmetric encryption you have a public key (this is what others see, like the name on your letterbox) and you have a private key (like the name suggests, this one should be kept secret - otherwise anyone could open your letterbox). When two users want to communicate securely they simply encrypt their messages to the recipients public key. Now no one else other than those two can read their messages. To spell this out:</p><ul><li>User B (recipient) publishes their public key</li><li>User A (sender) encrypts a message to B’s public key</li><li>User A sends the encrypted message to B</li><li>User B receives the message and decrypts it with their private key.</li></ul><h2 id="signatures">Signatures</h2><p>Another great aspect of asymmetric cryptography is the ability to provide proof that a message came from someone in particular. To use the mail analogy again, this can be thought of as a stamp on the letter. You know that only Steve has the stamp “Steve’s stamp”, so you can trust any letter with this to be from him.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-3">In a system</h5><p>Digital signatures are used almost everywhere in the internet today. In the context of cryptocurrency and blockchains, every transaction you send it accompanied by a signature over the payload you’re sending - asserting that it came from you.</p><p>Let’s also take a moment to think about internal or external communication between various services you’ve written. How do you know when a request comes from your payments service that it’s really your payments service sending this message? When a user of your website does an action (buying an item, for example), how do you tie that action to the right user?</p><p>A common solution is signed payloads, <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a> being a popular specification to follow. A session token is any many aspects just a signature over some payload you’ve provided, an assertion that at some point this user authenticated with you. A basic user authentication flow might go:</p><ul><li>User sends you their username and password</li><li>You verify that the password hash matches the saved hash for this username</li><li>You generate a signed payload that includes their unique ID and potentially anything else you don’t want to have to read from the database for every request.</li></ul><p>Now every request that comes to your server can just verify the signature provided, and you allow them access to the system based on that.</p><h2 id="blind-signatures">Blind Signatures</h2><p>A blind signature is one where the signer doesn’t need to about the contents of the message. This can be hard to reason about but one simple example is in an election voting situation. Alice comes in to vote and proves her identity to the officials at the location. After voting (her choice remains a secret) she hands the sealed envelope to the official, who signs and submits it. In this case the signer has no idea what choice Alice has made, however later at the vote counting station we can verify that this envelope is valid because it was signed by an official.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-4">In a system</h5><p>We could improve upon the above voting example and think about payments. Imagine we’re wanting to make a payment somewhere and not have the merchant know our identity, this is where we could leverage blind signatures to make transactions privately.</p><ol><li>We go to the bank and ask for a cheque for $100</li><li>We take this cheque and send our order to a shop (anonymously), asking for $100 worth of goods</li><li>The shop can verify this blind signature with the bank and send our goods to our specified address</li><li>We’ve successfully completed a purchase without either the bank knowing what we’re buying, or the merchant knowing who we are.</li></ol><h2 id="secret-sharing">Secret sharing</h2><p>I’ve wracked my brain for hours trying to think of a good analogy for secret sharing, but I wasn’t able to come up with one. Essentially it comes down to (what seems like) magic, you and another party are able to agree on something without ever communicating, it’s pretty cool.</p><p>What we’re talking about here are Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. They underpin almost all modern communication. Most of your browser traffic these days is secured via TLS (which implies some kind of key exchange between your browser and the server) however I’d like to explore another cool use case in the context of privacy preserving applications.</p><p>Before we dive into the example, at the highest level a Diffie-Hellman key exchange works as follows:</p><ul><li><code>DH(Alice's public key, Bob's private key) = shared_secret</code></li><li><code>DH(Bob's public key, Alice's private key) = shared_secret</code></li></ul><p>This <code>shared_secret</code> is only computable by Alice and Bob, no one else would be able to figure it out.</p><h5 id="a-use-case">A use case</h5><p>Let’s explore how we could build a privacy preserving messaging platform using a centralised database. At its most basic (and totally open) a message between two parties would look like this:</p><table><thead><tr><th>from</th><th>to</th><th>payload</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alice</td><td>Bob</td><td>Hi!</td></tr><tr><td>Bob</td><td>Alice</td><td>Hey! What’s up?</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This is how most applications have been built for the last twenty years. Maybe data is encrypted at rest, but in my experience working at software companies encryption at rest means nothing, every employee still has access to this data on demand, in the worst case it’s a Jira ticket away.</p><p>Step one in our privacy preserving journey is to encrypt the data swapped between parties, Alice encrypts messages to Bob’s public key and vice-versa. Now we as the providers of this service can’t see the data being swapped:</p><table><thead><tr><th>from</th><th>to</th><th>payload</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alice</td><td>Bob</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>Bob</td><td>Alice</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>However here we can unfortunately still tell that Alice and Bob are communicating. What could we do to hide the communication between these two?</p><p>One solution I’ll propose - which also has the benefit of sender privacy, so we’re killing two birds with one stone here - would be to generate a shared secret and hash it with the recipients identifier. Now messages just have a <code>payload</code> and a <code>to</code> property. The <code>to</code></p><table><thead><tr><th>to</th><th>payload</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Bob)</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Alice)</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Bob)</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Remember only Alice and Bob can generate this shared secret, and the HASH function is some irreversible function that hides its content. Now whenever Bob wants to find messages from Alice he computes <code>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Bob)</code> and queries all messages that match that <code>to</code> field.</p><p>As you can see now we only …</p></div></div>

	<section>
		<p>Working in many different environments provided me a good perspective on what scaling models are applied by different companies. Today I'd like to spend a bunch of keystrokes on one of the worst scaling models I've ever encountered.</p><p>I call it:</p><blockquote>Scaling by bubbling the problems out</blockquote><p>A <em>'busy person'</em>, usually a leader or manager, identifies a persistent problem within the organization: something that consumes focus and time, impacts the quality, slows down the value delivery, etc. This problem is either completely new (caused by the growth) or has evolved over time, but now its severity is more apparent.</p><p>Here are a few examples (of such problems) to make sure we're on the same page:</p><ul><li><strong>the number of quality defects</strong> (for the whole product) is increasing; until now, each team had been able to deal with their deliverables' quality</li><li><strong>the quality of internal communication</strong> deteriorates - people start complaining they don't know what's happening in the org, there are more and more misunderstandings and misalignments</li><li>the engineering unit needs to grow, and the <strong>recruitment takes more time increasingly</strong> - hereby hemorrhaging the last reserves of time of the unit's manager</li></ul><p>Initially, such a problem is dealt with in an ad-hoc way (through a one-off, point-directed action). But it keeps popping up back (as due to its nature, it can't be eliminated permanently). Apparently, that kind of a problem requires continuous effort and ownership (to make sure it doesn't get out of control).</p><p>Finally, the <em>'busy person'</em> (mentioned above) decides that burying her/his head in the sand won't work anymore, so why not do what all the handbooks advise?</p><p>That sounds like a tremendous idea, but the devil is in details. The <em>'busy person'</em> doesn't delegate responsibility, function, or role. (S)he <strong>outsources</strong> the problem by creating a new (formal or no) position (or even a sub-unit) to deal with that problem, so all the annoyances are out of the <em>'busy person's'</em> back.</p><p>This way the problem is contained within some sort of a <strong>bubble</strong>, but it's someone else's bubble! Problem-related black box our <em>'busy person'</em> doesn't have to worry about.</p><p>Got it?</p><ul><li>Problem <strong>X</strong> -&gt; <strong>X</strong> Manager / <strong>X</strong> Team</li><li><strong>Quality </strong>problem -&gt; <strong>Quality </strong>Manager / <strong>Quality </strong>(Assurance) Team</li><li><strong>Communication </strong>problem -&gt; <strong>Communication </strong>Manager / <strong>Communication</strong> Team</li><li><strong>Recruitment </strong>problem -&gt; <strong>Recruitment </strong>Manager / <strong>Recruitment </strong>Team</li></ul><p>Oh, how convenient is that! If the problem re-appears, it's clear who's guilt...^M^M^M to be asked to fix the situation.</p><p>As the crisis is prevented now, the <em>'busy person'</em> continues with her/his quest, smug and oblivious to the consequences of the change just made ...</p><p>Yes, it seems that short-term, we're all good here. Putting someone in charge of the crisis sounds like a decent plan. But it's not really what happened here. A new position has been spawned <strong>not to solve</strong> the actual problem (which may be hidden and unobvious) <strong>but to patch</strong> its visible symptoms, potentially making the organization more complex, inter-dependent, and bureaucratic.</p><p>Instead of well-thought-through systemic change, we're adding a sub-unit (usually with the manager in charge) with the responsibility of dealing with problem X. If you had any hopes for getting rid of problem X permanently - abandon any faith in that. If problem X is the sole reason for the sub-unit's existence, it will subliminally act <strong>to preserve and solidify</strong> that problem (under control, but still).</p><p>In more simple words:</p><ol><li>no wider context</li><li>no holistic view (to understand the flow of work and value, or the nature of the problem)</li><li>no systemic approach (System's Theory)</li></ol><p>While in fact the solutions to before-mentioned problems may be much more simple and straightforward:</p><ul><li><strong>the quality issues</strong> may be a result of reaching the critical capacity of manual regression testing (with test automation as a likely answer) or pushing quality checks towards the end of process (e.g. by not doing proper reviews)</li><li><strong>internal communication</strong> could deteriorate because of the increasing number of actors - a good idea is to check the component/area boundaries to verify the number &amp; validity of dependencies; other potential root cause may be an underlying conflict or misaligned priorities of two (or more) parties</li><li><strong>extensive recruitment</strong> will be a problem if you centralize the 'gating' too much - although acquiring talent is manager's/leader's duty, (s)he should get a lot of control over it directly to the teams (who are looking for more members) - it's their skin in the game of getting the most proper people on board</li></ul><hr><p>Just to make sure I'm clear - what I'm saying here is not against the popular principle of <em>'single-threaded teams'</em> (ones dedicated end-to-end, exclusively to well-defined narrow topic). I'm all for crystal-clear focus and unequivocal responsibility range, but the area covered by such a team should be <strong>defined by product/service vision</strong>, instead of what kind of piece of garbage has been thrown over the fence to save you some time ...</p>

<p>I was reading the
<a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_5.10">Linux 5.10 release summary on KernelNewbies</a>, and a
section stood out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.6. Static calls for improved post-Spectre performance</p>

  <p>Static calls are a replacement for global function pointers. They use code patching to allow
direct calls to be used instead of indirect calls. They give the flexibility of function pointers,
but with improved performance. This is especially important for cases where retpolines would
otherwise be used, as retpolines can significantly impact performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time looking at the Linux kernel, but never directly at its indirect call
setup or post-<a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> mitigations. These changes sound very cool,
so I’m going to use this post to try and explain and understand them (both to myself and others).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: One of the original authors of the patchset has emailed me with some corrections
and answers to the questions that I ask below. I’ve marked each with either “Correction” or
“Update.” Thanks, Peter!</p>

<h2 id="background-indirect-calls-spectre-and-retpolines">Background: indirect calls, Spectre, and retpolines</h2>

<h3 id="indirect-calls">Indirect calls</h3>

<p>Indirect calls are one of C’s most powerful language features, and are critical for writing
higher-order code without a supplementary object or function/method dispatch system.</p>

<p>Most C programmers are familiar with the basics of indirect calls, thanks to standard and POSIX
functions like <code>qsort</code> and <code>pthread_create</code>: each takes a <em>function pointer</em>, which it then
calls internally to complete the functionality of the surrounding call:</p>

<p>Observe: our <code>call</code> goes through a memory or register operand (<code>[rbp - 8]</code>)<sup id="fnref:opt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:opt">1</a></sup> to get the target,
instead of a direct target specified by the operand value itself (like, say,
<code>call 0xacabacab ; @good_rand</code>). That’s what makes it indirect.</p>

<p>But we can go even further than this! Indeed, a common pattern in C is to declare
entire <em>structures</em> of operations, using each to parametrize a lower level set of behaviors

<p>Unsurprisingly, this technique isn’t limited to userspace: the Linux kernel itself makes
aggressive use of indirect calls, particularly in architecture-agnostic interfaces
(like the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">VFS</a> and sub-specializations
like <code>procfs</code>) and the architecture-specific internals of subsystems like
<a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><code>perf_events</code></a>.</p>

<p>So that’s neat. It’s so neat that CPU engineers got all
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor#Indirect_branch_predictor">hot in the pants</a> trying
to squeeze extra performance out of them<sup id="fnref:perf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:perf">2</a></sup>, and we ended up with
<a href="https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf">Spectre v2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spectre-v2">Spectre (v2)</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/spectre.png" alt="The Spectre logo"></p>

<p>The exact mechanism that Spectre v2 (also known as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715">CVE-2017-5715</a>) exploits is
<em>slightly</em> out of scope of this post, but at a high level:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Modern (x86) CPUs contain an <em>indirect branch predictor</em>, which attempts to guess the target
of an indirect call or jump.</p>

    <p>To actually speed things up, the CPU <strong>speculatively executes</strong> the
 predicted branch:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A correct prediction means that the indirect call completes significantly faster
 (since it’s already executing or has finished executing speculatively);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A misprediction <strong>should</strong> result in a slower (but still
 successful) indirect call with <strong>no side effects from the incorrect speculation.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words: the CPU is responsible for <strong>rolling back</strong> any side effects associated
 with any misprediction and subsequent speculation. Mis-speculation is a <em>microarchitectural</em>
 detail that should not manifest in <em>architectural</em> changes, like modified registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rolling back</strong> any mis-speculated state is a relatively expensive operation, with a lot of
microarchitectural implications: cache lines and other bits of state need to be fixed up so that
the <em>actual</em> program control flow isn’t tainted by failed speculations.</p>

    <p>In practice, rolling back the entire speculated state would undo most of the advantages
 of speculating in the first place. Instead of doing that, x86 and other ISAs will just mark
 (many) of the bits of speculated state (like cache lines) as stale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fixup behavior (either reverting or marking speculated state) results in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack"><em>side-channel</em></a>: an attacker can
<em>train</em> the branch predictor to speculatively execute a bit of code
(not unlike a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">ROP gadget</a>) that modifies
a piece of microarchitectural state in a data-dependent manner, such as a cache entry
whose address is dependent on a secret value that was speculatively fetched.</p>

    <p>The attacker can then <em>probe</em> that microarchitectural state by <strong>timing</strong> access to it:
 fast accesses indicate a speculatively modified state, disclosing the secret.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The original Spectre v2 attack focused on cache lines since they’re relatively easy to time, even
from high level (and sandboxed!) languages that don’t have access to
<a href="https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_30.html"><code>clflush</code></a> or other cache-line
primitives on x86. But the concept is a general one: it’s difficult to execute speculatively without
leaking <em>some</em> information, and subsequent vulnerabilities (like <a href="https://mdsattacks.com/">MDS</a> and
<a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/">ZombieLoad</a>) have exposed information leaks in other
microarchitectural features.</p>

<p>This is bad news: an attacker running one of the <strong>safest</strong> contexts (JavaScript or other managed
code, in a sandbox, in userspace) can conceivably train the indirect branch predictor to
speculatively execute a gadget in kernelspace, potentially
<a href="https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/">disclosing kernel memory</a>.</p>

<p>So, the kernel needed a new mitigation. That mitigation is <em>retpolines</em>.</p>

<h3 id="retpolines">Retpolines</h3>

<p>To mitigate Spectre v2, the kernel needs to prevent the CPU from speculating on an attacker
controlled indirect branch.</p>

<p>A retpoline (short for <em>ret</em>urn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_(computing)"><em>trampoline</em></a>) does exactly that: indirect
jumps and calls are surrounded by a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunk</a> that
effectively traps the speculated execution in an infinite loop, spinning it until the misprediction
is resolved.</p>

<p>Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/api-app/sites/default/files/Retpoline-A-Branch-Target-Injection-Mitigation.pdf">Retpoline whitepaper</a>
has some helpful illustrations:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/retpoline.png" alt="A visualization of speculative execution with and without a retpoline."></p>

<p>This works by converting the indirect control flow from an <em>indirect branch</em> to an
<em>indirect return</em><sup id="fnref:allreturns" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:allreturns">3</a></sup>, hence the “ret” in retpoline. Returns are <em>also</em> predicted,
but with an additional mechanism given priority: the
<a href="https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2018/04/ras-microbenchmarks/">Return Stack Buffer</a><sup id="fnref:rsb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rsb">4</a></sup>. To ensure that
the RSB can’t be maliciously trained away from the infinite loop, the retpoline begins with a
direct <code>CALL</code> that primes the RSB to always<sup id="fnref:notalways" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notalways">5</a></sup> predict the infinite loop.</p>

<p>Here’s what an indirect call retpoline <em>actually</em> looks like<sup id="fnref:ool" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ool">6</a></sup>, simplified significantly from
the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/lib/retpoline.S">kernel</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/nospec-branch.h">source</a>:</p>

<p>…all of that to replace a simple <code>call [rax]</code>!</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>There are repercussions for this kind of trickery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s slow when correctly predicted: we’ve replaced a single indirect <code>CALL</code> with at least two
direct <code>CALL</code>s, plus a <code>RET</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s <em>really</em> slow when mispredicted: we <em>literally</em> spin in place using <code>PAUSE</code> and <code>LFENCE</code>.</p>

<p>Asset valuation and, in particular, Bitcoin valuation is hard. Although Bitcoin is empirically one of the best investments of the past decade, it remains controversial. It has simultaneously been compared to the internet revolution and to the Tulip bubble. Bitcoin is an experiment; failure is still possible.</p><p><strong>What if Bitcoin succeeds? How much will it be worth 10 years from now?</strong></p><p>Investors have well-established frameworks for evaluating assets like equities, credit, and real estate. Yet there is no clear framework for Bitcoin. My opinion is Bitcoin could have an enormous upside if it catches on. In this article, you will learn why Bitcoin could hit a $1M valuation by 2030 if the adoption continues to grow.</p><h3 id="key-takeaways-">Key takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Supply/demand balance of commodities such as oil and gold</li><li>Supply/demand balance of Bitcoin</li><li>Price prediction of Bitcoin: 3 scenarios</li></ul><p><em>First time here?

</section><h2 id="the-supply-demand-balance-of-commodities">The supply/demand balance of commodities</h2><p>The first step of asset valuation is to understand fundamental economics. Equities, bonds, and real estate derive their value from cash flows (and future cash flows). Whereas commodities (such as oil, gold, or bitcoin) are utility-based, and their price depends more on supply and demand. No clear framework exists for them.</p><h3 id="oil-supply-demand-balance">Oil supply/demand balance</h3><p>Oil price is the balance between supply and demand. If the demand increases, you can expect the price to increase as well. If demand drops, price drops. The same goes with supply (in the opposite direction).</p><p>Human civilization requires a certain number of barrels of oil per day to function. That number can be estimated. On the supply side, it costs a certain amount of money to get the oil out of the ground (depending on the technology used, localization, and taxes). If it costs $50 to get a barrel worth of oil out of the ground, then the long-term oil price can't really go below that level for too long. If it does go below that floor price, oil companies will go bankrupt. Supply will decrease, and the price will correct back toward a new equilibrium level.</p><p>In the past months, because of Covid-19, the oil demand dropped (no planes, cars, less energy consumption in general) while the supply stayed the same. Oil price dropped.</p><p>The price stayed so low for so long that some oil producers could not cope with it and went out of business. The oil supply decreased, oil prices corrected and started to increase again.</p><p>The demand is still low; however, it is increasing. As more and more countries go out of lock-down. And with the vaccines coming, we see the end of the tunnel. Ultimately, my bet is the oil will not only get back to the previous level but also surpass them. Remember: Some oil companies went out of business, so the supply is lower than before the crisis. The demand is getting back to normal.</p><p>What applies to oil also applies to silver, gold, and bitcoin.</p><h3 id="gold-supply-demand-balance">Gold supply/demand balance</h3><p>Gold, unlike oil, is not consumed nor destroyed. Gold that existed thousands of years ago still is in circulation today. The global reserve of gold is, therefore, constantly increasing. For the price of gold to stay constant, you need a demand that matches the supply. There are two sources of gold supply:</p><ul><li>75% come from gold mining. Approximately 2,500-3,000 tonnes per year.</li><li>25% come from recycling, most of it comes from jewelry.</li></ul><p>According to the World Gold Council, about 175,000 tonnes have been mined since the beginning of existence. The new mining represents an inflation rate of the gold supply of about 1.7% per year.</p><p>The average inflation of the U.S. dollar is about 2-3% per year.</p><h3 id="bitcoin-supply-demand-balance">Bitcoin supply/demand balance</h3><p>Bitcoin supply is different: it is predictable. It is set in stone and won't change even if most <em>miners</em> go out of business.</p><p>Bitcoin supply is halved every 4 years. No matter what. We can compute Bitcoin current and future average inflation rate and plot it against gold:</p><figure><img src="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png" alt="Bitcoin inflation rate as a function of time (orange line) and gold average inflation rate (yellow line)" srcset="https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png 600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png 1000w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png 1600w, https://thenextwave.blog/content/images/2020/12/bitcoin_inflation_rate_vs_gold-1.png 2362w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bitcoin inflation rate as a function of time (orange line) and gold average inflation rate (yellow line).</figcaption></figure><p>On May 11, 2020, the last Bitcoin Halving dropped Bitcoin's inflation rate from 3.6% to 1.8% and will soon cross gold's inflation rate. What does it mean? Bitcoin supply will grow slower than the gold supply.</p><p><a href="https://thenextwave.blog/what-is-bitcoin-explained/">As we've seen</a>, scarcity is one of Bitcoin's (main) feature. There is a fixed supply of bitcoins that can ever be <em>mined</em>. Currently, there are over 18.5 million bitcoins in existence, and the theoretical limit is 21 million. <strong>There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins.</strong> Think about it: this is, at most, 0.003 bitcoins per human being.</p><p>This is key. Even gold does not share the same property: every year, tons of gold is mined. Yes, there is a limited supply underground, but there is also an <strong>unlimited</strong> supply in space. You think I'm joking? <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/29/metal-asteroid-psyche-nasa-hubble-images/6069223002/">Look what NASA found</a>.</p><h2 id="price-prediction-of-bitcoin-3-scenarios">Price prediction of Bitcoin: 3 scenarios</h2><p>Bitcoin has significant headroom if it continues to gain broader acceptance. How big can it grow? I based my estimates on the current worldwide value of all mediums of exchanges and stores of value comparable to Bitcoin.</p><p>Let's dive into 3 different scenarios (by increasing order of optimism).</p><h3 id="future-bitcoin-price-if-considered-a-store-of-value">Future Bitcoin price if considered a store of value</h3><p>The first milestone Bitcoin will reach the store of value status. Bitcoin does not have the history of gold as a store of value. However, do you imagine millennials buying and storing gold as some older generations did? Would they rather own Bitcoin instead? It certainly is easier to store, transport, buy, and sell. Gold does not have more reason to be considered a store of value as <a href="https://thenextwave.blog/what-is-bitcoin-explained/">Bitcoin has</a>.</p><p>For this first scenario, we compare Bitcoin's market size to gold's. Gold aggregate value is estimated to be nine trillion dollars (December 2020). <strong>If Bitcoin achieved that capitalization on a base of 21M coins, each coin would be worth ~$420,000.</strong></p><p>Beyond complementing gold's investment demand, Bitcoin may also address broader store of value markets indirectly. Consider various collectibles like art or gemstones, some of which are owned primarily as stores of value. Or consider the empty NYC apartment owned by a foreigner interested in storing value outside his or her native country. Bitcoin could plausibly address subsets of these behaviors more effectively. As it is difficult to estimate, we don't include it in our scenario.</p><p>Bitcoin offers many more possibilities compared to gold. So, what are the next steps?</p><p>As you know, it is difficult to use gold as a medium of exchange. Transporting gold on the street to buy goods is impractical. However, using Bitcoin is entirely feasible. Therefore the market demand for an asset such as Bitcoin could vastly exceed gold. Especially given the prevailing direction of global monetary policy.</p><h3 id="future-bitcoin-price-if-considered-as-money-medium-of-exchange-m1-money">Future Bitcoin price if considered as money/medium of exchange: M1 money</h3><p>The money supply is broken into different buckets: M0, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m1.asp">M1</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp">M2</a>, and MZM. M0 refers to currency in circulation. M1 is M0 plus demand deposits like checking accounts. Since M1 is readily accessible for use in commerce, we consider this bucket as a medium of exchange. It includes:</p><ul><li>Physical currency (coins and banknotes)</li><li>Demand deposits, travelers' checks, and other checkable deposits,</li><li>Negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts</li></ul><p>The global M1 Money stock by region is about:</p><ul><li><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1">$6.5 trillion</a> in the U.S.</li><li><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/money-supply-m1">$12 trillion</a> in Europe.</li><li><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/china/money-supply-m1">$9 trillion</a> in China</li><li><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MYAGM1JPM189N">$7 trillion</a> in Japan</li></ul><p>40 trillion dollars is a conservative lower-bound for global M1 Money stock (which includes M0). If Bitcoin were to achieve a 10% market penetration as a medium of exchange, its market capitalization in today's money would be 4 trillion U.S. dollars.<strong> It would lead to a $190,000 price increase per bitcoin. So about $610,000 per bitcoin.</strong></p><h3 id="future-bitcoin-price-if-considered-as-money-of-zero-maturity">Future Bitcoin price if considered as Money of Zero Maturity</h3><p>The money of zero maturity (MZM) is an even broader bucket. MZM has become one of the preferred measures of the money supply. It represents money readily available for spending and consumption. It includes:</p><ul><li>Our previously defined M1 money</li><li>Savings accounts</li><li>Money market funds</li></ul><p>The global MZM Money stock by region is about:</p><ul><li><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MZM">$22 trillion</a> in the U.S.</li><li><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/money-supply-m3">$18 trillion</a> in Europe.</li><li><a href="https://take-profit.org/en/statistics/money-supply-m1/china/">$34 trillion</a> in China</li><li><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MYAGM3JPM189N">$14 trillion</a> in Japan.</li></ul><p>100 trillion dollars is a conservative lower-bound for global MZM Money stock. If Bitcoin were to achieve 10% of this total estimate for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdax.asp">the global value of mediums of exchange</a> and store of value, its market capitalization would reach 10 trillion U.S. dollars. <strong>If Bitcoin achieved that capitalization on a base of 21M coins, each coin would be worth ~$920,000.</strong></p><p>None of the above account for the dollar's inflation rate, which is about 2%-3% per year. It will easily bring the valuation to more than one million dollars per bitcoin.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><blockquote> "All models are wrong, some are useful." – George Box (Mathematician)</blockquote><p>It is important to understand our framework's variables. From our model it is possible that Bitcoin's price will increase by orders of magnitude. But it all depends on Bitcoin's level of adoption: <strong>The most important question is: "Will people use Bitcoin?"</strong></p><p><strong>Further readings:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-price-will-bitcoin-reach-this-time?utm_source=coinmarketcap&amp;utm_medium=alert&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=btcpricepredictions&amp;utm_term=">What price will Bitcoin reach?</a></li><li><a href="https://thenextwave.blog/what-is-bitcoin-explained/">Is Bitcoin the new Gold?

Something so mind-altering that it questions your definition of what you’ve known to be true for so long. I imagine the first people to watch a film or see an airplane felt this. It’s an inexplicable energy that has the power to redefine. In many ways, artists have been at the center of challenging commonly held beliefs, and using entirely new mediums to express speculative ideas. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-fa7pc"><span><span>While never the first thing to come to mind when discussing art, creative coding is revolutionizing what art is and can be. As we enter a more digital world, creative coding may be the contemporary art movement we need in order to articulate major societal challenges we are facing as technology advances. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-gar4"><span><span>Put simply, creative coding is an emerging specialty that utilizes code and programming as a medium to create art. Programming’s versatility and ubiquitous nature makes it especially expressive, allowing it to manifest itself as digital paintings, data visualization, or even robotics. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-aesrq"><span><span>Unlike the functional focus of most uses of code - like the code lines of a navigation app - creative coding uses programming languages for a solely artistic purpose.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-bg2ev"><span><span>As artists, we generally hold a stigma regarding coding having high barriers to entry, and as engineers, we also hold a stigma surrounding the difficulties of creative expression. However, these fields no longer need to be separate entities, as they are more closely tied than people expect. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-80qt3"><span>With programming resources being incredibly open-source and <a href="https://www.editorx.com/shaping-design/article/drawing-inspiration-for-designers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>creative inspiration</u></a> democratized across the internet, getting into this field is as easy as watching some coding tutorials on Youtube and making a Pinterest board. </span></p><p id="viewer-2vgh3"><span>If you haven’t already, you can <a href="https://www.editorx.com/shaping-design/article/should-designers-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>learn to code</u></a> by picking up a coding language such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Their work touches on deep social themes and has been exhibited internationally in spaces like the MoMa. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-fduu8"><span><span><em>Audience</em>, one of their earlier pieces of work from 2008, uses motion tracking software and creative coding to create an almost uncomfortable, anthropomorphic experience. As a gallery visitor steps in front of rows of individually dancing mirrors, they instantly synchronize and lock onto the viewer. With 100 mirrors now looking right back at you, you then become the focal point of your own onlooking. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-8dmeo"><span><span>Created by Marpi Studio, New Nature is a digitally interactive petting zoo that relies on gesture-based technology and programming to create virtual organisms. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-65ego"><span><span>Through machine learning, Marpi has forged a virtual terrarium of creatures and plants that rely on the physical interactions of the viewers to come alive. As viewers engage with the digital creatures, the artwork responds with real-time computer-generated motions, simulating the movement of an organic creature being pet. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-60ee9"><span><span><em>Everything in Existence</em> questions our perceptions of reality. Using real-time data processing tools and algorithmic software, fuse* creates a living piece of art that constantly evolves and adapts depending on its interactions with onlookers. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-bna5m"><span><span>The artworks are constantly generating new visuals in response to the viewers, their social networks, sound and more. This solo exhibition by fuse*, which premiered in Washington DC in 2019, creates digitally interactive experiences independently of an artist.

<h4>Summary </h4>
<p> HF Radios are important for military communications. IP is widely used       
  and is the basis for most network communication. This paper looks at         
use of IP over HF Radio and the efficiency of different types of application     
    over IP. The key findings are:                   </p>
<ul>
  <li>That IP can be operated over HF Radio, and that doing so may be            
   useful, particularly to enable support of applications that are only          
     available to run over IP.</li>
  <li> That most IP based applications running over a HF link will make          
     very inefficient use of the HF link, and that direct application use        
       of the HF link using STANAG 5066 will give much better 
performance.</li></ul>
<p>This paper concludes that applications intended for regular use over          
 HF Radio should not use IP and should instead be directly integrated           
with STANAG 5066.</p></blockquote-wp>
<h2>IP</h2>
<p>IP (Internet Protocol) is the basis of the Internet, and the most widely      
     used protocol. It supports a number of transports, including TCP, UDP       
    and RTP, and a myriad of end applications. IP is the universal interface     
      between physical networks and application. Application writers develop     
      to IP, or to one of the standardized protocols or middleware systems       
    that run over IP. Networking technology providers seek to provide IP         
operation as a primary goal.</p>
<p>"IP Everywhere" is such a strong culture, that it is difficult           to 
appreciate the few places where IP is not the right answer. IP is           
universal and is the right answer almost all of the time. This paper           
looks at why IP is not the right solution for HF Radio. Another example          
 of where IP is not right is deep space communications, where the long  </p>
<h2>Key Factors for Good Performance over HF</h2>
<p>HF Radio is very slow with typical rates around 1200 bits per second.         
  This slow speed is usually perceived as the primary difficulty with           
using HF. For components about the modem level, speed is determined.           
There are two general issues relating to performance that are now described.</p>
<h3>Turnaround time</h3>
<p>For data applications, the most significant problem with HF is turnaround     
      time. Turnaround time is the time taken to change direction of data        
   flow, and for HF Radio this is measured in seconds or tens of seconds.        
 Turnaround time is caused by factors at multiple levels:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Modem turnaround time</li>
  <li> Interleaver completion time. This can be a significant time (e.g.,        
       2.16 seconds for STANAG 4539 short interleaver or 8.64 seconds for        
       the long interleaver).</li>
  <li> Delays due to Comsec layer.</li>
  <li> The HF Radio must switch from send to receive. (An HF Radio is            
   a simplex device, and cannot send and receive at the same time).</li>
  <li> HF Skywave latency times.</li></ol>
<p>All of this leads to a turnaround time of at least a few seconds and          
 sometimes as much as 20-30 seconds. In order to make (reasonably) efficient     
      use of an HF link, it is critical to have transmit time longer than        
   turnaround time. This has a significant impact on applications.</p>
<p>For VHF and higher frequencies, turnaround time is less, so the impact        
   is less significant. For VHF, full duplex transmission can also be used,      
     which removes the impact completely.</p>
<h3>Efficient Use of the Pipe</h3>
<p>It is important that applications use the HF link as efficiently as           
possible, as bandwidth is limited. There are a number of things that         
need to be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Compression. This will be important for most applications.            
   Compression is not discussed in this paper, but should be addressed           
    by applications operating over HF.</li>
  <li> Protocol and Header Overhead. It is important that protocols do           
    not consume undue bandwidth with headers and other information. This         
      should be optimized. The protocols discussed in this paper, and in         
      particular STANAG 5066 are well optimized.</li>
  <li> Grouping data. Where possible data should be sent together in long        
       transmissions, to minimize the effect of turnaround time.</li>
  <li> Avoiding repeat transmissions, except when data is lost. It is            
   clearly important that data is not sent twice when not needed, and            
   applications should be designed to avoid this.</li></ul>
<p>These last two points have potential for significant inefficiency,           
and are discussed in more detail in the context of relevant protocols.</p>
<h2>STANAG 5066</h2>
<p>STANAG 5066 is a NATO standard for running applications over HF Radio.        
   This is described in the Isode whitepaper <a href="http://www.isode.com/whitepapers/stanag-5066.html">STANAG 
          5066: The Standard for Data Applications over HF Radio.</a></p>
<p>An HF Modem provides a quite basic send/receive capability. STANAG           
5066 provides application oriented capabilities over this. Capabilities          
 of relevance to this paper:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decoupling. Data can be accepted from one or more applications,            
   and queued for sending. A STANAG 5066 server can then “fill             the 
  pipe” to avoid wasting capacity.</li>
  <li> Fragmentation. STANAG 5066 will break application data into blocks        
       appropriate for the modem speed (DPDUs). This is important both for       
        precedence handling and acknowledgement.</li>
  <li> Precedence handling. STANAG 5066 will send higher priority data           
    (DPDUs) first..</li>
  <li> Support for multicast, which can also be used to support nodes            
   in Radio Silence (also known as EMCON (Emission Control)).</li>
  <li> Reliable transmission is supported for non-multicast traffic, by          
     acknowledgement at the DPDU level. This means that when there is data       
        loss (e.g., due to Radio noise) that retransmission is of the lost       
        DPDUs. This is more efficient than application level 
retransmission.</li>
  <li> Minimizing turnarounds. STANAG 5066 has long transmit times (up           
    to 127.5 seconds) and works to maximize transmit time. Acknowledgements      
         are delayed wherever possible, so reliable transmission does not 
  increase             the number of turnarounds.</li></ol>
<p>The central service in STANAG 5066 is "unit data". This service           
allows transfer of a block of data, with a maximum size constrained           
set at the STANAG 5066 level (typically 2 kBytes). Applications using  </p>
<p>Unit data may be unacknowledged (best effort) or acknowledged (reliable).     
      The choice is made by the application using STANAG 5066. Unacknowledged    
       must be used where data is being sent to more than one recipient 
(broadcast           or multicast) or where the recipient is in EMCON (Emission 
Control)           and cannot transmit an acknowledgement.</p>
<h2>IP over HF Radio </h2>
<p>IP could be mapped onto HF Radio in a number of ways. There are two           
mechanisms standardized (STANAG 5066 and STANAG 4538) which are discussed        
   here. These provide similar characteristics to the IP user, and so the        
   choice of mapping does not significantly affect the analysis in this          
 paper. It is hard to conceive of alternate mappings that would lead           
to improvements.</p>
<h2>IP over HF Radio using STANAG 5066</h2>
<p>STANAG 5066 defines use of IP over STANAG 5066. This support is mandatory     
      in the current standard, although not all STANAG 5066 products support     
      it. The mapping is very simple: essentially an IP packet is mapped 
directly           onto STANAG 5066 unit data. There are two options for unit 
data, both         of which are valid for IP:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unreliable. This is a natural mapping for IP, as IP is defined as          
     an unreliable protocol.</li>
  <li> Reliable. This may be used for unicast and non-EMCON transmission. 
</li></ol>
<p>There are a number of factors in the choice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If data needs to be retransmitted, reliable will be more efficient,        
       as this can be done at the DPDU level, rather than forcing the 
  application             to retransmit the complete unit data.</li>
  <li> Some applications respond to lost data by either reducing transmission    
           rate, or by packet exchange which leads to more turnarounds. These    
           are both undesirable, and can be addressed by the reliable 
  option.</li>
  <li> A consequence of minimizing turnarounds is that in the event of           
    data loss, IP packets using the reliable option may be considerably          
     delayed. Some applications and operating respond badly to this delay,       
        and data may be retransmitted unnecessarily.</li></ul>
<p>This choice gives a flavor of the issues that will be examined in the         
  rest of this paper. The support of IP over HF radio is quite straightforward.  
         The issues arise from the interaction of applications using IP and 
consequences           of the underlying characteristics of HF Radio.</p>
<p>Where priority data is carried in IP, this can be mapped onto STANAG          
 5066 priority. Handling of priority at the IP level is discussed in           
the Isode whitepaper<a href="http://www.isode.com/whitepapers/low-latency.html"> 
Sending FLASH Messages             Quickly</a>.</p>
<h2>IP over HF Radio using STANAG 4538</h2>
<p>STANAG 4538 provides an alternate set of data link services and ARQ           
(acknowledgement mechanisms to support reliable data) to STANAG 5066.           
STANAG 4538 and associated specification is an example of 3G HF Radio.           
STANAG 4538 provides a reliable point to point data service that will           
work with very poor radio conditions. This makes it ideal for use with           
small “man pack” radios with whip aerials that will often           need to deal 
with poor signals. STANAG 4538 defines a mapping of IP           over its data 
services, which is a straightforward use of the underlying           reliable 
data transfer. It has characteristics very similar to the reliable         
mapping of STANAG 5066.</p>

<p>As part of my Ph.D. program in Software Engineering in the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> at <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I have to serve as a Teaching Assistant twice throughout the duration of the program.  Normally, the department requests that you serve as TA in two different classes, but under special circumstances you can TA the same course twice if you take on more responsibility in your second term.  These responsibilities effectively move you from a more traditional TA role, where you mainly hold recitation and correct assignments, to include giving lectures and be involved with part of the course delivery and design.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>My first time TA’ing was for <a href="http://cmu-313.github.io/">17-313 Foundations of Software Engineering</a>, co-instructed by <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/">Michael Hilton</a>, in the Fall 2019 semester.  I was selected for this TA role based on my industry experience (for those of you that don’t know, I worked many a job from 1998 - 2015 before leaving to pursue my Ph.D.) and since I was taking two courses that semester, used the TA to fill the remainder of the time while putting research off for most of the semester.  The class was sized around 32 student and it was held on campus with two recitation sections that I taught myself.  As part of this, I also delivered a single lecture on Chaos Engineering and had Tammy Butow (from Gremlin) come and give a short guest lecture to reinforce the lecture material and prepare students for an in-person class recitation on using Gremlin to put chaos into practice with the code they had been working with all semester.</p>

<p>In Spring 2020, I took CS Pedagogy at CMU, a course that is co-instructed by Michael and Charlie Garrod designed specifically for students interested in teaching.  This was a fantastic course that is only offered occasionally (and, highly recommended!) where we learned how to properly design and deliver lectures over the course of 12 weeks.  During this period, I perfected a lecture, along with several active learning activities, on Lamport and vector clocks, that I delivered as part of my final project.  However, I wanted to put into practice what I had learned in this class, so I inquired about participating in an extended TA of 17-313 where I could serve in the role as co-instructor instead of just a normal TA.</p>

<p>I was approved and it would be set that I would serve in this role for the Fall 2020 semester, in a format that none of us were prepared for: remote and hybrid learning in a quarantine setting.</p>

<h2 id="17-313-redux-fall-2020">17-313 Redux, Fall 2020</h2>

<p>Fall 2020 brought a number of changes and along with these changes came challenges.</p>

<h3 id="logistical-challenges">Logistical Challenges</h3>

<p>This year, we faced a number of new challenges around logistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, 17-313 had doubled it’s enrollment and had a waitlist. Istead of around 30 students, we’d have 60.</li>
  <li>Next, students would be participating in the course mostly online and we would be lecturing on Zoom.</li>
  <li>There wasn’t going to be another TA besides myself, because getting TA’s in a semester where many students were taking the semester off was difficult for every class at CMU.</li>
  <li>Students who didn’t travel back to Pittsburgh after the summer break would be participating remotely from wherever they were: some were in different timezones in the US, some all over the world: we had students in Africa, Singapore, and China.</li>
  <li>We would have four recitation sections.  The first would be on campus, in person, in a socially distanced setting.  The second would be hybrid, where I would Zoom from the classroom and students could come to class or participate online, and finally the final two would be completely online.  These would have to be recorded and spread over the week in between and across lectures for that week (of which, we had two.)</li>
</ul>

<p>It was scary.  First off, we’re a software engineering course.  This entire course isn’t designed around writing software, it’s designed to help students learn process, collaboration, team management, the software development lifecycle, etc.  Most of our lectures involved group-based active learning activities.  Many, an overwhelming majority, of our recitation activities relied on close group work.  We’d have to make some changes.</p>

<p>It would be new, it would be difficult, it would be challenging.</p>

<p>In the section below, I’m going to briefly outline what I’m specifically proud of this semester and some of the things we learned when running this course online.</p>

<h3 id="technical-challenges">Technical Challenges</h3>

<p>We face technical challenges every year and none of these were new because of COVID-19.  However, debugging and dealing with them asynchronously was challenging in many respects.</p>

<p>Our course is designed around using Docker to run some code in a Linux environment and every semester this is a problem with Microsoft Windows.  In Fall 2019, most of the problems we ran into were around students with Mac’s that were too old (or running too outdated of an OS) to use Docker or Windows machines where Docker ran pitifully slow because of the emulation required to run Docker inside of a VirtualBox VM without hardware support (as, most of our students do NOT have Windows Professional, which was required for Hyper-V.)  In Fall 2020, we had new Docker problems where WSL2 had gone GA about 14 days before the semester, docker-machine was no longer a supported option, and students had to spent the first week upgrading Windows to a release that supported WSL2-native Docker.</p>

<p>Outside of issues of just running Docker, this issue that <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166">I had been tracking for a year</a>  as I was an early WSL2 adopted on the development Insiders channel, on memory being reclaimed by WSL2 and not being released was a huge problem for students, who had to repeatedely restart WSL2 when they ran out of memory in Windows using Docker.  Further exacerbating that issue, students who had Windows Home with either 6 or 8GB of memory on their own laptops, sometimes could not even build their own Docker containers before running out of memory, leaving us with few options to help them.  Finally, several students just did not have enough disk space available.  Within the first two weeks, I spent hours a day Zoom’ing with students on screensharing to debug at least 15 or more unique environments students had trying to get them in a place where they had a working Docker configuration to be able to run the single container required for the course.</p>

<h3 id="recitation-challenges">Recitation Challenges</h3>

<p>Recitation sections also posed their own set of challenges.  I outline some of the things we learned below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We had to rethink how every recitation would work to ensure it worked in both a socially-distanced classroom as well as in a Zoom-based classroom.  We decided on the following.  First, for recitations that were purely in Zoom, we’d use breakout rooms.  However, in the classroom, students were instructed about how close they could have their desks to one another using indicators on the floor; therefore, we would have these students use a Zoom breakout room for screensharing or collaborate through a shared Google doc.  In Zoom, we’d used random assignment for breakout rooms; in the classroom, we’d use a 60 person classroom, adjusted for 20 students, to group students together based on their location in the classroom – opposite sides – so they could have actual discussions verbally.  Whereas smaller breakout rooms seemed to work for many activities on Zoom better, larger groups worked much better in the classroom.  Finally, since you don’t have the classroom to overhear how groups are working together, I needed a mechanism to gauge group progress: in Zoom, I would need to constantly move breakout room to breakout room to see how people were working, but given the delay required to switch rooms in Zoom, this was less than ideal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing we tried during lecture and recitation, was to have students collaborate on building design documents, etc. on shared Google Docs.  This worked well at first, but we soon learned that smaller breakout rooms didn’t work well: 60 students in a collaborative Google slide deck would cause Google to report that there were too many users on the same document and disable editing.  This got better once we moved to larger documents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of our recitation activities relied on students working together in the classroom to build something physical (or, do physical collaboration.)  One of these was our agile activity that typically involves building paper airplanes.  I completely rewrote that recitation to work in an asynchrous format that I talked about at length in a <a href="http://christophermeiklejohn.com/teaching/2020/12/08/agile.html">previous post</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For both lectures and recitations, we learned that students would mostly arrive with cameras and mics off.  We quickly learned that students would enable them in smaller breakout rooms, and therefore pushed to use breakout rooms with active learning activities early in both recitation and lecture: students would always return with cameras on and be more willing to talk afterwards, since they would turn them on in the breakout.  For the smaller recitations (2-4 people), students would immediately turn their cameras on, which seems to indicate that students are less comfortable in the larger groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recitation sizes, arguably the most challenging aspect of running recitations in this format.  For each recitation, we had roughly 10-15 students scheduled.  However, the numbers throughout the semester varied greatly.  First, students were able to choose which recitation they attended and since they were recorded, they could also attend asynchronously.  This made week-to-week predictions of the attendence difficult.  One observation was that the students in the in-person section were relatively stable: the students who came, always came (even, when the in-person recitation section went fully remote from in-person after the Thanksgiving break, per CMU policy.)  The other recitations would flucutate between either almost all students to the smallest number I ever had in a section, two students.  This made it especially difficult for …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header></header><p><code>useRef</code> allows you to keep a mutable value within a component, similar to <code>useState</code> or instance variables on a class, without triggering re-renders.</p><p>For example, this component stores the number of clicks for a button:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>RefButton</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> clicks <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>clicks<span>.</span>current <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>.</span>current<span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>This is how this component looks like (I added a re-render button so you can
actually test it out 😄):</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p>The example below is completely interactive, try clicking the "Clicks" button and then click on "Re-render".</p></div><p>As you can see, if you click the "Clicks" button it doesn't do anything. However, after click on "Re-render", it gets updated with the number of clicks we did previously.</p><h2>Difference with a variable</h2><p>You might wonder why not just use a simple variable as the example below:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>let</span> clicks <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>OutsideVariableButton</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>clicks <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And here's an interactive example for it:</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>outside variable</span></p></div><p>The button works the same way that our previous example. However, the problem arises when you have multiple instances of the same component like the example below. Try clicking just one of the buttons and then click on re-render to see the result.</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>outside variable</span><span>outside variable</span><span>outside variable</span></p></div><p>As you were able to see, the clicks are not isolated. In fact, all the examples
from this article uses the same button component, so if you click the button
from the first example and then click on "re-render" on the second example, the count it is gonna be
incremented! What a bug 🐛.</p><p>On the other hand, <code>useRef</code> values are completely isolated between components:</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>ref</span><span>ref</span><span>ref</span></p></div><h2>Difference with&nbsp;useState</h2><blockquote><p>The main difference between useState and useRef, is that useState triggers a
re-render and useRef doesn't.</p></blockquote><p>In the following example I added two buttons: one that updates its count with <code>useRef</code> and the other one with <code>useState</code>. I added some labels so you can identify them easily.</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>state</span><span>ref</span></p></div><p>You'll notice that clicking on the button with <code>useRef</code> doesn't trigger a re-render and thus, the view isn't updated. On the other side, when you click on the button that uses <code>useState</code>, it will update its clicks count immediately.</p><p>To perform imperative actions on DOM nodes, React provides a way to get a
reference to them via refs. All you have to do is to assign a <code>ref</code> property to
a node with a ref object like this:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>CustomInput</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> inputRef <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>inputRef<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>The way to get a DOM reference using refs works (informally 😅) as follows:</p><div><p><span>Today</span></p><div><p>React</p><p>Hey, what's up?<span>12:00</span></p></div><div><p>Could you give me a reference to this dom node?<span>12:00<svg style="color:#34B7F1" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 13l4 4L19 7"></path></svg><svg style="color:#34B7F1;margin-left:-12px" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 13l4 4L19 7"></path></svg></span></p></div><div><p>React</p><p>Sure, I assigned it to the 'current' property of your ref.<span>12:00</span></p></div></div><p>On the first render, <code>inputRef</code>'s value will be <code>{ current: null }</code> and in the
following renders it will have its <code>current</code> property assigned to the specified DOM
node:</p><p>However, if you only reference <code>inputRef</code> inside <code>useEffect</code> then it'll always
reference the DOM node so you don't need to worry about it being undefined.</p><p>Let's update our example to get an idea of how this works:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>AttachingToDomExample</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> inputRef <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render inputRef value:"</span><span>,</span> inputRef<span>)</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"useEffect inputRef value:"</span><span>,</span> inputRef<span>)</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>inputRef<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's the console output when rendering this component:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Render</th><th>Location</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: undefined }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see, if you access the <code>inputRef</code> inside <code>useEffect</code> then you don't
need to worry about it being <code>undefined</code> because React will assign it
automatically for you.</p><p>Let's start with a simple real-world application for refs: <code>usePrevious</code>. This
hook stores the previous value for a given state variable.
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">It is even referenced on React's docs</a> as a way to "get the previous props or state". Let's see it in
action first:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>UsePreviousExample</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>clicks<span>,</span> setClicks<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
  
  <span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span>clicks<span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setClicks</span><span>(</span>clicks <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
        Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>}</span><span> - Before: </span><span>{</span>previousClicks<span>}</span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's the output so you can play with it:</p><p>You can notice that the <code>previousClicks</code> variable stores the value for the previous render
for a given variable. Here's its implementation:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    ref<span>.</span>current <span>=</span> value
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Let's analyze how it works.</p><p>Let's simulate what happens on the first render. We can remove the call to
<code>useEffect</code> since it doesn't affect the return value on the first render:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>On the first render it is called with a value of <code>0</code>:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, <code>usePrevious</code> will return <code>undefined</code>:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>After increase the value for count, here's how the <code>usePrevious</code> call will look:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>Since <code>usePrevious</code> is called again, its effect needs to run:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  ref<span>.</span>current <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>After this, the <code>usePrevious</code> function is called again:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And so on. Here's the value for each render for both variables:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Render</th><th>clicks</th><th>previousClicks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>undefined</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Callback Refs are a different way to set refs. It gives you a fine-grain control
over when refs are attached and detached because you provide a function instead
of a ref variable. This function gets called every time the component mounts and
unmounts.</p><p><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/callback-ref-example-lqe8w?file=/src/App.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here's an example</a> that shows/hides an emoji every time you click its button.
The important thing here is the <code>ref</code> prop that we added. We use a function to log
the provided ref:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>callback</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"callback:"</span><span>,</span> ref<span>)</span>

<span>function</span> <span>App</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>show<span>,</span> setShow<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setShow</span><span>(</span><span>!</span>show<span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
        </span><span>{</span>show <span>?</span> <span>"Hide"</span> <span>:</span> <span>"Show"</span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span>{</span>show <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>callback<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>👋</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's an interactive version of the previous code (you can check the output in
the console to see that I'm not lying 🙃):</p><p><em>Note: If you use callback refs as inline functions, it will be called
twice: one with <code>null</code> and another one with the DOM element.
This is because React needs to clear the previous ref every time the function is
created. A workaround for this is to use a class method.</em></p><div><h2>Warning</h2><p><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#legacy-api-string-refs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">String refs</a> are a legacy feature and they are likely to be removed in future React versions.</p></div><p>The way it works is that you provide a string as a ref value like <code>ref="exampleRef"</code> and it automatically gets assigned to <code>this.refs</code>.</p><p><em>Note: String refs can only be used with class components.</em></p><p>Here's an usage example:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>class</span> <span>App</span> <span>extends</span> <span>React<span>.</span>Component</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>The Labeling Problem</h2><p>The efficacy of a machine learning model is limited to the quality and quantity of data being used to train the model. The most powerful models typically require massive amounts of data to train. If the target variables in the model are categorical, there is an equally massive amount of labels in the dataset. Unfortunately, most of these labels are done by hand-- a painstakingly slow and resource intensive process. The time and resources that come with labeling datasets by hand creates inefficiencies in many machine learning pipelines. The categorical datasets that data scientists and programmers often learn from – such as those hosted on the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository </a>or those preprocessed and uploaded to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> – are idealized cases that do not reflect the typical reality of handling categorical data. In these datasets, someone has already taken the time to clean and process the data, providing the labels needed to train machine models. In real-life cases, this is usually not the case.</p><p>The origin of the categorical data labels often varies with the type of data in question. For example, pattern-recognition algorithms are often trained on labels provided through crowdsourcing. An algorithm trying to distinguish dogs from cats in images relies on humans to label each image beforehand. In ambiguous images, multiple people can assign different labels, resulting in a lower confidence for each category. On the other hand, medical diagnoses are often given in degrees of confidence either by some predefined test or by the doctor themselves. Similarly, natural language processing algorithms use confidence metrics to evaluate which definition of a word to employ (and, therefore, which meaning is intended) based on the context in which it is used. Despite the apparent categorical nature to these use cases, the reality can be quite the opposite.</p><p>Common in all of these cases is the association of a <em>probability </em>with the label. Whether the probability is simply an ensemble of multiple labels or intrinsic to the labeling methodology, the machine learning algorithms that train on these datasets must be able to handle probabilistic data labels. In some sense, the probability of a label is more informative than the label itself, as it also conveys the degree of confidence for a given observation. Understanding how to take advantage of this, and which approaches to handling these probabilistic data labels produce better models is a practical skill for data scientists and programmers encountering real-world categorical datasets. Additionally, tools that speed up or automate the labeling process in the machine learning pipeline resolve the inefficiencies that come with human labeling. Programmatically labeling is one such approach to do so.</p><p>In this tutorial, I use Python to walk through several different approaches to using probabilistic data labels to train machine learning models. I use a dataset that has both probabilistic labels and true labels to show that, if the probabilistic labels are of high quality, they are more than sufficient in constructing high performance machine learning models.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>To follow along with the code in this tutorial, you’ll need to have a recent version of Python installed. I use the <a href="https://anaconda.org/">Anaconda Navigator</a> for all my programming needs, but the code used in this tutorial is generalized to work with any Python 3.7 distribution. To install Anaconda, go <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">here</a>. &nbsp;You can find all of the code and data used on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/dsblendo/prob_data_labels">GitLab repository</a>.</p><p>All of the packages I will be using are prebuilt into the Anaconda distribution, except for the <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras package</a>. Keras provides us with the building blocks to construct our neural nets. To install for use in Anaconda, we can use <a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a> (you may also have to <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html">install conda-forge</a>):</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;conda install -c conda-forge keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>Alternatively, if you are using another Python distribution, you can install Keras with pip:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pip install keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>To import the necessary packages and functions that we will use, in Python run:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;<strong>import</strong> numpy <strong>as</strong> np<br><strong>import</strong> pandas <strong>as</strong> pd<br><strong>import</strong> matplotlib.pyplot <strong>as</strong> plt<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> accuracy_score<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> precision_recall_fscore_support <br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.model_selection <strong>import</strong> train_test_split<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.feature_extraction.text <strong>import</strong> TfidfVectorizer<br><strong>from</strong> keras.models <strong>import</strong> Model<br><strong>from</strong> keras <strong>import</strong> optimizers<br><strong>from</strong> keras.layers <strong>import</strong> Input, Dense, Dropout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>If any error indicates that a package cannot be found, simply install it using the same syntax as above, switching out the package name as needed. <br>‍</p><p>The data I will be working with is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wanderfj/enron-spam">Enron Spam classification dataset</a> from Kaggle. The dataset contains the text from 33,715 emails that are classified as either wanted (ham) or unwanted (spam). &nbsp;As can be seen below, the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; column contains the text of each email. We will use this text to train our model to classify the email as either ham or spam. </p><p>The &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column contains the ‘gold’ labels included in the original <em>.csv</em> file from Kaggle: 0 for ham and 1 for spam. There is an additional column that is not in the original Kaggle dataset: the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Pred&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;<em> </em>column<em>.</em> This column contains probabilistic labels from 0 to 100 (rather than the binary labels in the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column) that indicate the probability of each email belonging to the spam class. </p><p>These probabilities were programmatically labeled using <a href="https://www.watchful.io/">Watchful</a>, without looking at the original gold labels. It would take days for a human to label each email to by hand, while Watchful accomplished this in around 3 hours. &nbsp; </p><p>To import the dataset, we can use the<em> </em>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; package:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;file_path = 'watchful_export.csv'<br>email_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)<br>email_df.head()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>The output should look something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c4e081336a4_lMVu2dmf4RMJnd1IEucaulz17cuRIdK4qweUknWLuduEplP55gg4a9TYNu-OtnZW5uvadw8pTtl3fFnq3gPXhlkg4zbzD2azXTUmdcV5YOBF1R5BYANjItlhYmXjNmjbbkUR0zJD.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>All set? Let’s go.</p><h2>Exploring the Data</h2><p>Before we get to the model implementation, it is always a good idea to explore the data we are working with. We can also compare the probabilistic data labels provided by Watchful with the original gold labels and evaluate how well the algorithm did. In most real-life cases, this is not possible, as the true labels are either limited to a few observations, not known at all, or have poor quality. </p><p>First, it is worth looking at the distribution of spam and ham emails in the gold labels and the probabilistic labels. This gives us an idea of the balance of the dataset, as well as how well the probabilistic labels match up to the gold labels. &nbsp;</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;gold_col_name = 'Spam_Gold'<br>pred_col_name = 'Spam_Pred'<br>text_col_name = 'Text'<br>pct_spam = email_df[gold_col_name].sum() / email_df.shape[0]<br>pct_ham = 1 - pct_spam<br>pct_spam, pct_ham&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c78a41336c8_VtYibTj6IYwpv8vQnofsEzLXZknIAdMi-NyTfM8ep6hDCBAIm1-nF7ZJGwK2hGhgq-Kv2n4XKObnIri8Nd9vTg8g8Jocgok0BPzgRvey6eUbl1xuCBdEanlQdeESi2KdGvf7yHlK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>So, the dataset has nearly an equal distribution of spam and ham emails. Dealing with sparse data is not trivial for most machine learning algorithms. Fortunately, we don’t have to worry about it. As, expected, the histogram of gold labels is nearly equal in height:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[gold_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c35f4133692__jnMfpcDBpKOL_PUwnyz0kWOWBaZaRA2v8hf5CsFdfQBMSTqqmR7qFd2chzDdjsKYgwmaUqsF_EZ_wPPfgxwp-Ylb0Y6IW8y8XqSSVaEPKIk63E6mKwMKt2rC4cdQXP9nrCRJ-Fp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And for the probabilistic labels:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[pred_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551ccb721336ec_fcbwX4G08cR9jGH2dHljz611Pmh4PXe1xLE_1hRmApL3Bx-qTG5nMZwTQS9g141qSpW2Bk6JktXXrvBjayV8Hw41vqpGso3MBR8Hi8Lni2nwtlaObjuu2IbQKwr_Y6NCP_Hs-dGc.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distributions are pretty similar. This is an indication that the probabilistic labels assigned by Watchful are well aligned with the gold labels – a promising sign for being solely generated by the email text. </p><p>‍</p><p>From a qualitative perspective, certain characteristics of the emails are bound to correlate with either being spam or ham. For example, one could imagine that curt, plain text is probably not an advertisement for some product and is therefore an indicator of a ham email. On the other hand, text that is long and superfluous is generally more common in advertisements, and may indicate a spam email. </p><p>To get an idea of the distribution of the number of words used in the emails, we can take advantage of Python’s list comprehension syntax:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;lengths = np.array([len(doc.split()) <strong>for</strong> doc <strong>in</strong> email_df[text_col_name]])<br>pd.DataFrame(lengths).describe()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c243c1336b6_EYN_5xU56hJ15QgNOLP3EmEqd6gF-mP-PgWbdv-JyDiBLvPYUFapSe0m5yP1tZ_gS-OeoWU-JQrhyjCf04-MSbqO0DO30rd-X22ToTLL8M9bcYFkRTxlua8mGFmeB31oa226knO9.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And to visualize the email length distribution:</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(lengths[lengths &lt; 1000])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c99b21336da_yrc6gT2jZBziyvh20WyReaApqY-f8qhxSmFPhCQCQI6wuX7bouHAKja3bGZlMy8knBZcVrh-9Qtlgnmc6GWxyv61Fz5YEGbK5DniKzEJmf7_wLRdUg3eSbGHnqk8JbGX-od97H__.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distribution is heavily skewed, as expected for a text-based communication medium – most emails are relatively short, and the probability of a longer email scales inversely with the length. It is also worth looking at the number of unique words used in each email. This distribution should mimic the right-skewed distribution of the email word length. </p><div><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;vocabs = np.array([len(set(doc.split())) <strong>for</strong> doc <strong>in</strong> email_df[text_col_name]])</p><p>pd.DataFrame(vocabs).describe()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p></div><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c88f91336fd_X4k57jF3VKR00pfNdxr0-ORZUR-251vs9tYtt_a1eS0qHzaZzbYzd70XF8woxKHUTIK8WWiXVT8fKhkhz2zU-DU0a6zWgIjreGsU3UJU1Y_HIekb1m_LuiOrrrVKstQwOdaxXXs5.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(vocabs[vocabs &lt; 500])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c5422133707_or_uT0Z79lUjkht-xysIgvUqg6HoUvC-9EeyNSthoNmR_MvnxdxNlfhNDsi8d3ZyLcOYOglhndXgBIA9Zi3bmADhcXj4qcPMP1rOot2lrsndJ4u7THPsbl58L1RnIpAKUUrMVCNc.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distribution is reasonable relative to the email length distribution. One would expect that common articles (‘a’, ‘the’, ‘and’, etc.) &nbsp;are repeated several times in a given email, and the true number of unique words is 2-4x lower than the total number of words. We can also check how well the probabilistic labels align with the gold labels, assuming a probability higher than 50% indicates a spam. &nbsp;</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;email_df[pred_col_name] = email_df[pred_col_name].apply(<strong>lambda</strong> r: 0 <strong>if</strong> r &lt; 50 <strong>else</strong> 1)<br>accuracy_score(email_df[gold_col_name], email_df[pred_col_name], <strong>True</strong>)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c6a16133706_Q83d1T3H5OHW4HC4iQ84zH8JVqFP9q83zDKUmhtQL21ZHkoJSBBmY5dXGJKjksN-Lt1Uvue8HguhFTD327Aziu14VYr25kjDwhiyvxUZzUDuqRoxqw3GGRW_I6RIyWhcCNm2Adts.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The agreement is pretty good assuming a simple 50% threshold.

		<h2>Passing of a Great Mind</h2>
<h3>John von Neumann, a Brilliant, Jovial Mathematician, was a Prodigious Servant of Science and his Country</h3>
<p><em>by Clary Blair Jr</em>. –&nbsp;<em>Life Magazine</em>&nbsp;(February 25th, 1957)</p>
<p>The world lost one of its greatest scientists when Professor John von Neumann, 54, died this month of cancer in Washington, D.C. His death, like his life’s work, passed almost unnoticed by the public. But scientists throughout the free world regarded it as a tragic loss. They knew that Von Neumann’s brilliant mind had not only advanced his own special field, pure mathematics, but had also helped put the West in an immeasurably stronger position in the nuclear arms race. Before he was 30 he had established himself as one of the world’s foremost mathematicians. In World War II he was the principal discoverer of the implosion method, the secret of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>The government officials and scientists who attended the requiem mass at the Walter Reed Hospital chapel last week were there not merely in recognition of his vast contributions to science, but also to pay personal tribute to a warm and delightful personality and a selfless servant of his country.</p>
<p>For more than a year Von Neumann had known he was going to die. But until the illness was far advanced he continued to devote himself to serving the government as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, to which he was appointed in 1954. A telephone by his bed connected directly with his EAC office. On several occasions he was taken downtown in a limousine to attend commission meetings in a wheelchair. At Walter Reed, where he was moved early last spring, an Air Force officer, Lieut. Colonel Vincent Ford, worked full time assisting him. Eight airmen, all cleared for top secret material, were assigned to help on a 24-hour basis. His work for the Air Force and other government departments continued. Cabinet members and military officials continually came for his advice, and on one occasion Secretary of Defence Charles Wilson, Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles and most of the top Air Force brass gathered in Von Neumann’s suite to consult his judgement while there was still time. So relentlessly did Von Neumann pursue his official duties that he risked neglecting the treatise which was to form the capstone of his work on the scientific specialty, computing machines, to which he had devoted many recent years.</p>

<p>His fellow scientists, however, did not need any further evidence of Von Neumann’s rank as a scientist – or his assured place in history. They knew that during World War II at Los Alamos Von Neumann’s development of the idea of implosion speeded up the making of the atomic bomb by at least a full year. His later work with electronic computers quickened U.S. development of the H-bomb by months. The chief designer of the H-bomb, Edward Teller, once said with wry humor that Von Neumann was “one of those rare mathematicians who could descend to the level of the physicist.” Many theoretical physicists admit that they learned more from Von Neumann in methods of scientific thinking than from any of their colleagues. Hans Bethe, who was director of the theoretical physics division at Los Alamos, says, “I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like Von Neumann’s does not indicate a species superior to that of man.”</p>

<p>The foremost authority on computing machines in the U.S., Von Neumann was more than anyone else responsible for the increased use of the electronic “brains” in government and industry. The machine he called MANIAC (mathematical analyzer, numerical integrator and computer), which he built at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., was the prototype for most of the advanced calculating machines now in use. Another machine, NORC, which he built for the Navy, can deliver a full day’s weather prediction in a few minutes. The principal adviser to the U.S. Air Force on nuclear weapons, Von Neumann was the most influential scientific force behind the U.S. decision to embark on accelerated production of intercontinental ballistic missiles. His “theory of games,” outlined in a book which he published in 1944 in collaboration with Economist Oskar Morgenstern, opened up an entirely new branch of mathematics. Analyzing the mathematical probabilities behind games of chance, Von Neumann went on to formulate a mathematical approach to such widespread fields as economics, sociology and even military strategy. His contributions to the quantum theory, the theory which explains the emission and absorption of energy in atoms and the one on which all atomic and nuclear physics are based, were set forth in a work entitled <em>Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics</em>&nbsp;which he wrote at the age of 23. It is today one of the cornerstones of this highly specialized branch of mathematical thought.</p>
<p>For Von Neumann the road to success was a many-laned highway with little traffic and no speed limit. He was born in 1903 in Budapest and was of the same generation of <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/">Hungarian physicists</a> as Edward Teller, Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner, all of whom later worked on atomic energy development for the U.S.</p>
<p>The eldest of three sons of a well-to-do Jewish financier who had been decorated by the Emperor Franz Josef, John von Neumann grew up in a society which placed a premium on intellectual achievement. At the age of 6 he was able to divide two eight-digit numbers in his head. By the age of 8 he had mastered college calculus and as a trick could memorize on sight a column in a telephone book and repeat back the names, addresses and numbers. History was only a “hobby,” but by the outbreak of World War I, when he was 10, his photographic mind had absorbed most of the contents of the 46-volume works edited by the German historian Oncken with a sophistication that startled his elders.</p>
<p>Despite his obvious technical ability, as a young man Von Neumann wanted to follow his father’s financial career, but he was soon dissuaded. Under a kind of supertutor, a first-rank mathematician at the University of Budapest named Leopold Fejer, Von Neumann was steered into the academic world. At 21 he received two degrees – one in chemical engineering at Zurich and a PhD in mathematics from the University of Budapest. The following year, 1926, as Admiral Horthy’s rightist regime had been repressing Hungarian Jews, he moved to Göttingen, Germany, then the mathematical center of the world. It was there that he published his major work on quantum mechanics.</p>
<h4>The young professor</h4>
<p>His fame now spreading, Von Neumann at 23 qualified as a <em>Privatdozent</em>&nbsp;(lecturer) at the University of Berlin, one of the youngest in the school’s history. But the Nazis had already begun their march to power. In 1929 Von Neumann accepted a visiting lectureship at Princeton University and in 1930, at the age of 26, he took a job there as professor of mathematical physics – after a quick trip to Budapest to marry a vivacious 18-year-old named Mariette Kovesi. Three years later, when the Institute for Advanced Study was founded at Princeton, Von Neumann was appointed – as was Albert Einstein – to be one of its first full professors. “He was so young,” a member of the institute recalls, “that most people who saw him in the halls mistook him for a graduate student.”</p>

<p>Although they worked near each other in the same building, Einstein and Von Neumann were not intimate, and because their approach to scientific matters was different they never formally collaborated. A member of the institute who worked side by side with both men in the early days recalls, “Einstein’s mind was slow and contemplative. He would think about something for years. Johnny’s mind was just the opposite. It was lightning quick – stunningly fast. If you gave him a problem he either solved it right away or not at all. If he had to think about it a long time and it bored him, hist interest would begin to wander. And Johnny’s mind would not shine unless whatever he was working on had his undivided attention.” But the problems he did care about, such as his “theory of games,” absorbed him for much longer periods.</p>
<h4>‘Proof by erasure’</h4>
<p>Partly because of this quicksilver quality Von Neumann was not an outstanding teacher to many of his students. But for the advanced students who could ascend to his level he was inspirational. His lectures were brilliant, although at times difficult to follow because of his way of erasing and rewriting dozens of formulae on the blackboard. In explaining mathematical problems Von Neumann would write his equations hurriedly, starting at the top of the blackboard and working down. When he reached the bottom, if the problem was unfinished, he would erase the top equations and start down again. By the time he had done this two or three times most other mathematicians would find themselves unable to keep track. On one such occasion a colleague at Princeton waited until Von Neumann had finished and said, “I see. Proof by erasure.”</p>
<p>Von Neumann himself was perpetually interested in many fields unrelated to science. Several years ago his wife gave him a 21-volume Cambridge History set, and she is sure he memorized every name and fact in the books. “He is a major expert on all the royal family trees in Europe,” a friend said once. “He can tell you who fell in love with whom, and why, what obscure cousin this or that czar married, how many illegitimate children he had and so on.” One night during the Princeton days a world-famous expert on Byzantine history came to the Von Neumann house for a party. “Johnny and the professor got into a corner and began discussing some obscure facet,” recalls a friend who was there. “Then an argument arose over a date. Johnny insisted it was this, the professor that. So Johnny said, ‘Let’s get the book.’ They looked it up and Johnny was right. A few weeks later the professor was invited to the Von Neumann house again. He called Mrs. von Neumann and said jokingly, ‘I’ll come if Johnny promises not to discuss Byzantine history. …</p></div></div>

All I know is this: Where the topic of GNOME’s health goes, accurate data rarely follows. Of course, there <em>is</em> data — lots of it in fact, in public source code repositories. Though flawed in many ways, it allows us to make comparisons to the past — and maybe predictions for the future: Are a few organizations carrying most of the workload, making them critical points of failure? Are new contributors able to pick up the slack from those who leave? Is the project graying (i.e. increasingly dominated by veterans)?</p><p>In one of my occasional fits of hubris, I set out to process this data to see if I could shake out anything meaningful. I’m usually fine with just satisfying my own curiosity and leaving it at that, but it’s one of those times where the results seem interesting enough for a blog post. So here we are.</p><p>I’m going to lead with the nice graphs and follow on with a <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#methodology">section on methodology</a>. The latter is long, boring, and mandatory reading.</p><h2 id="contributors">Active contributors</h2><h3>By generation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>The stacked histogram above shows the number of contributors who touched the project on a yearly basis. Each contributor is assigned to a generational cohort based on the year of their first contribution. The cohorts tend to shrink over time as people leave.</p><p>There’s a special “drive-by” cohort (in a fetching shade of off-white) for contributors who were only briefly involved, meaning all their activity fits in a three-month window. It’s a big group. In a typical year, it numbers 200-400 persons who were not seen before or since. Most of them contribute a single commit.</p><p>According to this, GNOME peaked at slightly above 1,400 contributors in 2010 and went into decline with the GNOME 3.0 release the following year. However, 2020 saw the most contributors in a long time, even with preliminary data — there’s still two weeks to go. Who knows if it’s an anomaly or not. It’s been an atypical year across the board.</p><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per month, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>This is the same histogram, but with per-month bins. There’s a clear periodicity caused by the semiannual release cycle. The peak month was March 2011, right before the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/press/2011/04/gnome-3-0-released-better-for-users-developers-3/">GNOME 3.0 release</a>. About 450 contributors got involved that month.</p><p>The drive-by cohort is relatively smaller on a monthly basis. This makes sense, as it has little overlap from month to month, and the per-year bins tend to add them all up.</p><h3>By affiliation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, top-15 domain cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>Above, the top 15 affiliations of active contributors.

It’s safe to say that GNOME is dependent on paid developers in a big way. Specifically, and to no one’s surprise, it leans heavily on Red Hat.</p><h2 id="observations">General observations</h2><p>A few observations can be made with confidence:</p><ul><li>By F/OSS standards, the project is not <em>un</em>healthy. It has hundreds of experienced and first-time contributors every year. It is well-organized and arguably well-funded compared to its peers. But:</li><li>Every metric has the project peaking around 2010.</li><li>A diminishing number of veterans is doing an increasing share of the work.</li><li>Although recruitment is stable, newcomers don’t seem to be hitting their stride in terms of commits.</li><li>Corporate sponsorship is probably necessary to keep the project going, but the field of sponsors has kept thinning.</li></ul><p>I think GNOME is addressing the risk factors competently by modernizing infrastructure (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/">Discourse</a>). This has obvious value even in the absence of quantifiable results, but it’ll be interesting to see if the effect can be measured over the next couple of years.</p><p>Diminished enthusiasm may also be due to there being fewer ways for a new contributor to make their mark or assume a role of responsibility. GNOME has become more conservative, certainly much more so than it was a decade ago in the run-up to GNOME 3. The rationale and phrasing in <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/new-gnome-versioning-scheme/4235">the announcement of the new versioning scheme</a> (e.g. <em>“Radical technological and design changes are too disruptive for maintainers, users, and developers”</em>) seems indicative of this trend<sup>1</sup>.</p><h2 id="methodology">Notes on methodology</h2><p>So what’s wrong with this analysis? If you’re so inclined, you can find the details under the next couple of subheadings and pass harsh, harsh judgement.</p><p>I’ve set the unscientific rigor bar high enough to hopefully yield something useful, but low enough that I could do it in my spare time and not get stuck in the dreaded state commonly known as “90% done”.</p><h3>Module selection</h3><p>I aggregated data from <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-repos">189 Git repositories</a>. The vast majority of these are hosted on <code>gnome.org</code>, with a handful from <code>freedesktop.org</code> and <code>github.com</code>. Commits are uniquely identified by their commit hash, meaning trivial duplicates are counted only once.</p><p>GNOME has always been a decentralized, big-tent project, so it’s not obvious how to delineate it. I’ve tried to be fair by including most of the repositories from a full meta-gnome-desktop jhbuild, including fairly low-level dependencies like Cairo, Pango, and Pipewire, as well as past, present and would-be flagship applications under the GNOME umbrella. Documentation and infrastructure is represented, as are many archived projects (e.g. ORBit2, Bonobo, Sabayon, GAL).</p><p>I was a little uncertain about what to do with X.Org and Wayland. In the end I decided to include the latter, but not the former, since Wayland has close ties to GNOME (it even references GTK+ in its TODO file), while X.Org has its roots in the much older XFree86.</p><p>Mono is another project I resisted including; its development was tangential to GNOME proper, diverging completely in the most recent decade. However, I did include GtkSharp and several GNOME-hosted C# applications common on desktops in the 2005-2010 time frame.</p><p>Since I haven’t established hard criteria for module selection, it’s subject to various biases. Older code is probably underrepresented, since providers of important functionality were more loosely attached to the project early on (e.g. GNOME Online Accounts and Telepathy got pulled in, should I have included Gaim or Pidgin too? How about XChat?).</p><p>Anyway, the list isn’t terrible, but there’s room for improvement.</p><h3>Contributor identities</h3><p>Similar studies often identify contributors by their e-mail addresses. I used full author names instead, since there’s good reason to think they’re more stable over a 20-year time span. We’re fairly consistent in spelling our own names, and we change them rarely (often never). On the other hand, e-mail addresses come and go with different hosting arrangements, employers, etc.</p><p>An added challenge with this approach is that sometimes different people have the exact same name. In practice, I’m not aware of any instances of this happening in GNOME. It seems to be rare enough that I doubt it’d introduce significant error in most projects.</p><p>I should add here that the drive-by cohort depends on a fair amount of hindsight (you never know when someone might come back with more contributions, but the likelihood drops off quickly as time passes). This means the cohorts for 2020 are preliminary. They’ll be a lot more accurate with another run late next year.</p><h3>Domain names</h3><p>I’m using e-mail domain names as a proxy for organizations in some of the graphs. This is a notoriously unreliable approach for at least three reasons:</p><ol><li>Contributors often use personal e-mail addresses for paid work, leading to significant undercounting in general.</li><li>Specific companies may require their employees (or ask them nicely) to use company e-mail for collaboration. Out of the listed companies, I know of at least one that definitely did this. However, there are many that don’t, and these will be comparatively less well represented.</li><li>The mapping between DNS and organizations isn’t one-to-one. A company may operate under multiple names or TLDs (e.g. <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.com</code>).</li></ol><p>Despite these weaknesses, it’s common to slice the data this way. It’s difficult to do better without access to semi-closed data troves, and depending on your views on privacy and ability to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a> safely, it might not be something you’d want to get into anyway. But I bet you’d be well-positioned for it if you were, say, the corporate owner of both LinkedIn and GitHub.</p><p>When grouping by organization, the goal is to get an idea of which outside entities are sponsoring contributions. Therefore, I’ve filtered out addresses from the biggest mass e-mail providers like <code>@gmail.com</code> and project-centric providers of personal accounts (e.g. <code>@gnome.org</code>, <code>@gtk.org</code>).</p><p>I took the liberty of reassigning the personal domains of a few extra prolific authors who would’ve otherwise showed up as individual organizations. Since there’s no way I’m doing it for everyone, this introduces some bias. The full details are in <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-meta.json">the project’s metadata file</a> (see: <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#code">code</a>).</p><h3>Version control systems</h3><p>Changeovers in version control systems divide GNOME’s VCS history into three eras with noticeable discontinuities between them.</p><h4>Before 1998: Dark ages</h4><p>In the Bad Old Days, Free Software would often use plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">RCS</a> or no version control at all.

        <p>Published on: 2020-12-16</p>
        
<p>I'm going to consider a fairly unpopular idea: most efforts towards "explainable AI" are essentially pointless. Useful as an academic pursuit and topic for philosophical debate, but not much else.</p>
<p>Consider this article a generator of interesting intuitions and viewpoints, rather than an authoritative take-down of explainability techniques.</p>
<p>That disclaimer aside:</p>
<hr>
<p>What if almost every problem for which it is desirable to use machine learning is unexplainable?</p>
<p>At least unexplainable in an efficient-enough way to be worth explaining. Whether it is an algorithm or a human that is doing the explanation.</p>
<p>Let's define "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">explainable AI</a>" in a semi-narrow sense, inspired by the DARPA definition, as an inference system that can answer the questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why was that prediction made as a function of our inputs and their interactions?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under what conditions would the outcome differ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How confident can we be in this prediction and why is the confidence such?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why might we be unable to answer the above questions in a satisfactory manner for most machine learning algorithms? I think I can name four chief reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some problems are just too complex to explain. Often enough, these are perfect problems for machine learning, it's exactly their intractability to our brains that makes them ideal for equation-generating algorithms to solve.</li>
<li>Some problems, while not that complex, are really boring and no human wants or should be forced to understand them.</li>
<li>Some problems can be understood, but understanding in itself is different for every single one of us, and people's culture and background often influence what "understanding" means. So explainable for one person is not explainable for another.</li>
<li>Even given an explanation that everyone agrees on, this usually puts us no closer to most of what we want to achieve with said explanation, things like gathering better data or removing "biases" from our models.</li>
</ol>
<h2>I - Unexplainable due to complexity</h2>
<p>Let's say, physicists, take in 100 PetaBytes of experimental data, reduce them using equations, and claim with a high probability that there exists this thing called a "Higgs Boson" with implications for how gravity works, among other things.</p>
<p>The resulting Boson can probably be defined within a few pages of text via things such as mass, the things it decays into, its charge, its spin, the various interactions it can have with other particles, and so on.</p>
<p>But if a luddite like myself asks the physicists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did you predict this fundamental particle exists?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will either get a "press conference answer" which carries no meaning other than providing a "satisfying" feeling, but it doesn't answer any of the above questions.</p>
<p>It doesn't tell me why the data shows the existence of the Higgs Boson, it doesn't tell me how the data could have been different in order for this not to be the case, and it doesn't tell me how confident they are in this inference and why.</p>
<p>If I press for an answer that roughly satisfies the explainability criteria I mentioned above, I will at best get them to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, the standard model is a fairly advanced concept in physics, so you first have to understand that and why it came to be. Then you have to understand the experimental statistics needed to interpret the kind of data we work with here. In the process, you'll obviously learn quantum mechanics, but to understands the significance of the Higgs boson specifically it's very important that you have an amazing grasp of general relativity, since part of the reason we defined it as is and why it's so relevant is because it might be a unifying link between the two theories. Depending on how smart you are this might take 6 to 20 years to wrap your head around, really you won't even be the same person by the time you're done with this. And oh, once you get your Ph.D. and work with us for half a decade there's a chance you'll disagree with your statistics and our model and might think that we are wrong, which is fine, but in that case, you will find the explanation unsatisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are fine with this, since physics is bound to be complex, it earns its keep by being useful and making predictions about very specific things with very tight error margins, its fundamental to all other areas of scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>When we say that we "understand" physics what we really mean is that there are a few dozen of thousands of blokes that spent half their lives turning their brains into hyper-optimized physics-thinking machines and they assure us that they "understand" it.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the edges of physics are a black box, I know physics works because Nvidia sells me GPUs with more VRAM each year and I'm able to watch videos of nuclear reactors glowing on youtube while patients in the nearby oncology ward are getting treated with radiation therapy.</p>
<p>This is true for many complex areas, we "understand" them because a few specialists say they do, and the knowledge that trickles down from those specialists has results that are obvious to all. Or, more realistically, because a dozen-domain long chain of specialists combined, each relying on the other, is able to produce results that are obvious to all.</p>
<p>As long as there is a group of specialist that understands the field, as long as those specialists can prove to us that their discoveries can affect the real world (thus excluding groups of well-synchronized insane people) and as long as they can teach other people to understand the field... we claim that it's "understood".</p>
<hr>
<p>But what about a credit risk analysis "AI" making a prediction that we should loan Steve at most 14,200$?</p>
<p>The model making this prediction might be operating with TBs worth of data about Steve, his browsing history, his transaction history, his music preferences, a video of him walking into the bank... each time he walked into the bank for the last 20 years, various things data aggregators tell us about him, from his preference about clothing to the likelihood he wants to buy an SUV, and of course, the actual stated purpose Steve gave us for the credit, both in text and as a video recording.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the "AI" has been trained on previous data from millions of people similar to Steve and the outcomes of the loans handed to then, thus working with petabytes of data in order to draw the 1-line conclusion of "You should loan steve, at most, 14,200$, if you want to probabilistically make a profit".</p>
<p>If we ask the AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is the maximum loan 14,200$? How did the various inputs and their interactions contribute to coming up with this number?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the real answer is probably something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, I can explain this to you, but 314,667,344,401 parameters had a significant role in coming up with this number, and if you want to "truly" understand that then you'd have to understand my other 696,333,744,001 parameters and the ways they related to each other in the equation. In order to do this, you have to gain an understanding of human-gate analysis as well as how its progress over time relates to life-satisfaction, credit history analysis, shopping preference analysis, error theory behind the certainty of said shopping preferences, and about 100 other mini-models that end up coalescing into the broader model that gave this prediction. And the way they "coalesce" is even more complex than any of the individual models. You can probably do this given 10 or 20 years, but basically, you'd have to re-train your brain from scratch to be like an automated risk analyst, you'd only be able to explain this to another automated risk analysts, and the "you" "understanding" my decision will be quite different from the "you" that is currently asking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even the above is an optimist take assuming the "AI" is made of multiple modules that are somewhat explainable.</p>
<p>So, is the "AI" unexplainable here?</p>
<p>Well, not more so than the physicists are. Both of them can, in theory, explain the reasoning behind their choice. But in both cases, the reasoning is not simple, there's no single data point that is crucial, if even a few inputs were to change slightly the outcome might be completely different, but the input space is so fast it's impossible to reason about all significant changes to it.</p>
<p>This is just the way things are in physics and it might be just the way things are in credit risk analysis. After all, there's no fundamental rule of the universe saying it should be easy to comprehend by the human mind. The reason this is more obvious in physics is simply because physicists have been gathering loads of data for a long time. But it might be equally true in all other fields of inquiry, based on current models, it probably is. It's just that those other fields didn't have enough data nor the intelligence required to grok through it until recently.</p>
<h2>II - Some problems are boring</h2>
<p>There is a class of problems that is complex, but not as complex as to be impenetrable to the vast majority of human minds.</p>
<p>To harken back to the physics example, think classical mechanics. Given the observations made by Galileo and some training in analysis, most of us could, in principle, understand classical mechanics.</p>
<p>But this is still difficult, it requires a lot of background knowledge, although fairly common and useful background knowledge and a significant amount of times. Ranging from, say, a day to several months depending on the person.</p>
<p>This is time well spent learning classical mechanics, but what if the problem domain was something else, say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out if a blotch on a dental CT scan is more likely to indicate a streptococcus or a lactobacillus infection.</li>
<li>Understanding what makes an image used to advertise a hiking pole attractive to middle-class Slovenians over the age of 54.</li>
<li>Figuring out, using l2 data, if the spread for the price of soybean oil is too wide, and whether the bias is towards the sell or buy.</li>
<li>Finding the optimal price at which to pre-sell a new brand of luxury sparkling water based on yet uncertain …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Up to now, I have used vi as an example for modal text editor, mostly because
I expect most programmers have at least heard of it. However, I don’t believe
vi and clones are the best modal text editor out there.</p>
<p>I have been working, for the last 5 years, on a new modal editor called
Kakoune. It first started as a reimplementation of Vim (the most popular vi
clone) whose source code is quite dated. But, I soon realized that we could
improve a lot on vi editing model.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_improving_on_the_editing_model">Improving on the editing model</h3>
<p>vi basic grammar is <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong>; it’s nice because it matches
well with the order we use in English, "delete word". On the other hand,
it does not match well with the nature of what we express: There is only
a handful of <strong>verbs</strong> in text editing (<strong>d</strong>elete, <strong>y</strong>ank, <strong>p</strong>aste,
<strong>i</strong>nsert…​), and they don’t compose, contrarily to <strong>objects</strong> which can be
arbitrarily complex, and difficult to express. That means that errors are
not handled well. If you express your object wrongly with a delete verb,
the wrong text will get deleted, you will need to undo, and try again.</p>
<p>Kakoune’s grammar is <strong>object</strong> followed by <strong>verb</strong>, combined with instantaneous
feedback, that means you always see the current object (In Kakoune we call
that the selection) before you apply your change, which allows you to correct
errors on the go.</p>
<p>Kakoune tries hard to fix one of the big problems with the vi model: its
lack of interactivity. Because of the <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong> grammar,
vi changes are made in the dark, we don’t see their effect until the whole
editing <strong>sentence</strong> is finished. <code>5dw</code> will delete to next five words, if
you then realize that was one word too many, you need to undo, go back to
your initial position, and try again with <code>4dw</code>. In Kakoune, you would do
<code>5W</code>, see immediately that one more word than expected was selected, type
<code>BH</code> to remove that word from the selection, then <code>d</code> to delete.  At each
step you get visual feedback, and have the opportunity to correct it.</p>
<p>At the lower level, the problem is that vi treats moving around and selecting
an object as two different things. Kakoune unifies that, moving <strong>is</strong> selecting.
<code>w</code> does not just go to the next word, it selects from current position to
the next word. By convention, capital commands tend to expand the selection,
so <code>W</code> would expand the current selection to the next word.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_multiple_selections">Multiple selections</h3>
<p>Another particular feature of Kakoune is its support for, and emphasis
towards the use of multiple selections. Multiple selections in Kakoune
are not just one additional feature, it is the central way of interacting
with your text. For example there is no such thing as a "global replace" in
Kakoune. What you would do is select the whole buffer with the <code>%</code> command,
then select all matches for a regex in the current selections (that is the
whole buffer here) with the <code>s</code> command, which prompts for a regex. You would
end up with one selection for each match of your regex and use the insert
mode to do your change. Globally replacing foo with bar would be done with
<code>%sfoo&lt;ret&gt;cbar&lt;esc&gt;</code> which is just the combination of basic building blocks.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Multiple selections provides us with a very powerful to express structural
selection: we can subselect matches inside the current selections, keep
selections containing/not containing a match, split selections on a regex,
swap selections contents…​</p>
<p>For example, convert from <code>snake_case_style</code> to <code>camelCaseStyle</code> can be done
by selecting the word (with <code>w</code> for example) then subselecting underscores
in the word with <code>s_&lt;ret&gt;</code>, deleting these with <code>d</code>, then upper casing the
selected characters with <code>~</code>. The inverse operation could be done by selecting
the word, then subselecting the upper case characters with <code>s[A-Z]&lt;ret&gt;</code>
lower casing them with ` and then inserting an underscore before them with
<code>i_&lt;esc&gt;</code> This operation could be put in a macro, and would be reusable
easily to convert any identifier.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Another example would be parameter swapping, if you had <code>func(arg2, arg1);</code>
you could select the contents of the parenthesis with <code>&lt;a-i&gt;(</code>, split the
selection on comma with <code>S, &lt;ret&gt;</code>, and swap selection contents with <code>&lt;a-)&gt;</code>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It is as well easy to use multiple selections for alignment, as the <code>&amp;</code>
command will align all selection cursors by inserting blanks before
selection start</p>

<p>Or to use multiple selections as a way to gather some text from different
places and regroup it in another place, thanks to a special form of pasting

<div>
<h3 id="_interactive_predictable_and_fast">Interactive, predictable and fast</h3>
<p>A design goal of Kakoune is to beat vim at its own game, while providing a
cleaner editing model. The combination of multiple selections and cleaned up
grammar shows that it’s possible to have text edition that is interactive,
predictable, and fast at the same time.</p>
<p>Interactivity comes from providing feedback on every command, made possible by
the inverted <strong>object</strong> then <strong>verb</strong> grammar. Every selection modification
has direct visual feedback; regex-based selections incrementally show what
will get selected, including when the regular expression is invalid; and even
yanking some text displays a message notifying how many selections were yanked.</p>
<p>Predictability comes from the simple effect of most commands. Each command is
conceptually simple, doing one single thing. <code>d</code> deletes whatever is selected,
nothing more. <code>%</code> selects the whole buffer. <code>s</code> prompts for a regex and
selects matches in the previous selection. It is the combination of these
building blocks that allows for complex, but predictable, actions on the text.</p>
<p>Being fast, as in requiring fewer keystrokes, is provided by carefully designing
the set of editing commands so that they interact well together, and by sometimes
sacrificing beauty for useability. For example, <code>&lt;a-s&gt;</code> is equivalent to
<code>S^&lt;ret&gt;</code>: they both split on new lines, but this is such a common use case that
it deserves to have its own key shortcut. As shown in <a href="http://github.com/mawww/golf">http://github.com/mawww/golf</a>,
Kakoune manages to beat Vim at the keystroke count game in most cases,
using much more idiomatic commands.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_discoverability">Discoverability</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs tend to be at a disadvantage compared to GUI
applications because they are less discoverable; there is no menu bar on
which to click to see the available options, no tooltip appearing when you
hover above a button explaining what it does.</p>
<p>Kakoune solves this problem through the use of two mechanisms: extensive
completion support, and auto-information display.</p>
<p>When a command is written in a prompt, Kakoune will automatically open a menu
providing you with the available completions for the current parameter. It
will know if the parameter is supposed to be a word against a fixed set
of word, the name of a buffer, a filename, etc…​ Actually, as soon as <code>:</code>
is typed, entering command prompt mode, the list of existing commands will
be displayed in the completion menu.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kakoune will display an information box, describing what the
command does, what optional switches it can take, what they do…​</p>
<div>
<p>Command discoverability</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/discoverability.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">

</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>That information box gets displayed in other cases, for example if the <code>g</code>
key is hit, which then waits for another key (<code>g</code> is the <strong>goto</strong> commands
prefix), an information box will display all the recognized keys, informing
the user that Kakoune is waiting on a keystroke, and listing the available
options.</p>
<p>To go even further in discoverability, the auto information system can
be set to display an information box after each normal mode keystroke,
explaining what the key pressed just did.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_extensive_completion_support">Extensive completion support</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs are much easier to work with when they provide
extensive completion support. For a long time, completion has been prefix
based, and that has been working very well.</p>
<p>More recently, we started to see more and more programs using the so called
fuzzy completion. Fuzzy completion tends to be subsequence based, instead
of prefix based, which means the typed query needs to be a subsequence of
a candidate to be considered matching, instead of a prefix. That will generate
more candidates (all prefix matches are also subsequence matches), so it
needs a good ranking algorithm to sort the matches and put the best ones first.</p>
<p>Kakoune embraces fuzzy matching for its completion support, which kicks in both
during insert mode, and prompt mode.</p>
<div>
<p>Word completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Insert mode completion provides completion suggestions while inserting in the
buffer, it can complete words from the buffer, or from all buffers, lines,
filenames, or get completion candidates from an external source, making it
possible to implement intelligent code completion.</p>
<div>
<p>Language specific completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/cpp-completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Prompt completion is displayed whenever we enter command mode, and provides
completion candidates that are adapted to the command being entered, and to
the current argument being edited.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_a_better_unix_citizen">A better unix citizen</h3>
<p>Easily making programs cooperate with each others is one of the main strength
of the Unix environment. Kakoune is designed to integrate nicely with a POSIX
system: various text editing commands give direct access to the power of POSIX
tools, like <code>|</code>, which prompts for a shell command and pipe selections through
it, replacing their contents with the command output, or <code>$</code> that prompts for
a command, and keeps selections for which the command returned success.</p>
<div>
<p>Using external commands as filters</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/filters.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">

</p>
</div>
<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg. Kakoune is very easily controllable from</p></div></div></div>

  <p>Author's Note: The latest version of this essay is now a chapter in <a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/#learn-more">the Coding Career Handbook</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are often told that <strong>Knowledge is Power</strong>. This is mostly true - except for at least two points in your career.</p>
<p>Have you thought about how <strong>Ignorance can be Power</strong> too? I can think of at least two stages in a career when you can wield lack of knowledge as a form of power (in the neutral, <em>ability to influence others to do what you need</em> sense, not in the petty <em>dominating over others</em> sense).</p>
<p>And we'll talk about how you can wield ignorance throughout the rest of your career too - with <strong>Lampshading</strong>!</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="when-youre-very-senior"><a href="#when-youre-very-senior">When you're very senior</a></h2>
  <p>First, when you're in <strong>senior management</strong>, typically at least a couple layers removed from individual contributors. Beyond a certain level you are not being paid to have the right answers - that's what your reports are for. It's your job to ask the right <em>questions</em>, and to enable your team to figure out how to get the answers.</p>
  <p>In my career so far I've often noticed that it is <em>senior management</em>, not middle or junior people, that are most likely to say "Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't understand what's going on here. <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/eli5/">Can you explain like I'm five?</a>" Done right, it can expose weak reasoning and bust bullshit, particularly when framed with the (mostly correct) belief that <a href="https://www.passiton.com/inspirational-quotes/3363-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont">"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</a>.</p>
  <p>Note I'm not absolving incompetent management of the need to know domain knowledge necessary to be an effective leader. I'm simply observing that at senior levels you are <em>not</em> expected to know everything, and that's an interesting violation of "Knowledge is Power" you have probably experienced.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="when-youre-new"><a href="#when-youre-new">When you're new</a></h2>
  <p>Second, <strong>when you're new</strong>, typically entry level in a career or a new joiner to a community or company. At this level, again, nobody expects you to know <em>anything</em>. Sure, you needed to know <em>enough</em> to fool someone into hiring you. But so long as you never lied or lied-by-omission, nobody is going to turn around and fire you for having holes in your knowledge.</p>
  <p>Of course, there are cases where this doesn't apply. Junior talent are the most expendable, and some companies don't have a healthy attitude to mentorship and hiring. But in general, I find the tech industry a lot better for mentoring than, say, finance. Tech companies generally place explicit responsibility on seniors/team leads to mentor juniors, especially as part of their career progression goals.</p>
  <p>You might imagine, having restarted my career 2-4 times depending how you count it, that I have a good deal of personal experience with being a total newbie.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="storytime"><a href="#storytime">Storytime!</a></h2>
  <p>Here I can tell you about my first day on my new dev job, fresh out of bootcamp.</p>
  <p>My team all joined on the same day - 3 new hires (me and 2 more experienced devs). My new boss, a confident senior dev who had had a long tenure with the firm, was walking us through our tech stack. All of a sudden he paused, and said, "oh by the way, we're going to use TypeScript. You all know TypeScript, right?". Coworker 1 nodded, Coworker 2 nodded. There was that unspoken sense of <em>duh, we're all professionals here, of course we use TypeScript</em>.</p>
  <p>And then all eyes were on me.</p>
  <p>I don't do well with peer pressure. In Gretchen Rubin's <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/2015/01/ta-da-the-launch-of-my-quiz-on-the-four-tendencies-learn-about-yourself/">4 Tendencies</a> model, I'm an Obliger - I like to please people and put my own concerns aside. Of course my bootcamp hadn't taught TypeScript, we'd only had 3 months to learn fullstack JS! And of course I wanted to say yes!</p>
  <p>I had a probably visible moment of panic, before going with "no I don't know TypeScript." My boss simply nodded, saying, "you can learn on the job", and moved on.</p>
  <p>I think in my first few months I probably had a dozen little tests like that. Did I know how to do professional code reviews? (No) Did I know how to do BEM naming? (No, and I proudly still don't) Did I know what Clean Code was? (eh.. nope).</p>
  <p>Every time I confessed ignorance, they gave me what I needed to learn, and I caught up. If I made a mistake, they taught me what I did wrong. What were they gonna do, fire me? They knew what they were doing when they hired me out of bootcamp.</p>

  <h2 id="lampshading"><a href="#lampshading">Lampshading</a></h2>
  <p>So we see that confessing ignorance works at both the senior and junior stages of careers. But it also works in isolated situations as well, for example when you caveat what you don't know while <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public">learning in public</a>.</p>
  <p>Given my casual interest in creative writing, I often compare this technique with <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshading</a>. To quote from TV Tropes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lampshade Hanging (or, more informally, <strong>Lampshading</strong>) is the writers' trick of dealing with any element of the story that threatens the audience's Willing Suspension of Disbelief, whether a very implausible plot development, or a particularly blatant use of a trope, <strong>by calling attention to it and simply moving on</strong>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Applied to real life: You call out your own weakness, so that others can't.</p>
  <p>In fact, by most functional team dynamics, others are then obliged to help you fix your weakness. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power">soft power</a>.</p>
  <p>Many Americans (of a certain age) immediately sympathize with this by linking it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHE0wmgljco">the final battle in 8 Mile</a>. In it, Eminem kicks off by naming every single weakness of his that his opponent Papa Doc was going to, literally stealing all the words from Papa Doc's mouth and turning himself into a sympathetic character. <strong>Weakness is strength</strong> here purely because of lampshading.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="the-stupid-question-safe-harbor"><a href="#the-stupid-question-safe-harbor">The Stupid Question Safe Harbor</a></h2>
  <p>In real life, I often lampshade by invoking the "Stupid Question Safe Harbor" (SQSH).</p>
  <p>A "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor_(law)">Safe Harbor</a>" is a legal idea that explicitly okays some behavior that may be in a grey zone due to unclear rules. So I use it as an analogy for how we act when someone says "I have a Stupid Question".</p>
  <p>When we invoke the "Stupid Question Safe Harbor", we are acknowledging the question is potentially stupid, AND that we all know that there's not really such a thing as a stupid question, but we'll just get it out of the way to ask something really basic - because getting mutual understanding is more important than saving face.</p>
  <p>The trick here is you actually are saving face - now you've invoked the SQSH, people understand you’re roleplaying, you're explicitly invoking a well understood mode of conversation, and you're not <em>ACTUALLY</em> that stupid. Right? Right?? <em>nervous laughter</em></p>
  <p>When you are in a group scenario, the SQSH has positive externalities. There may be multiple people wondering the same thing, but only one person has to "take the hit" of asking the "stupid question", and yet all benefit. I like performing this role of <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1096645037788618752">Stupid Questions as a Service</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="advanced-lampshading"><a href="#advanced-lampshading">Advanced Lampshading</a></h2>
  <p>Once you learn to look out for <strong>Lampshading</strong>, you may see powerful users of it out there in the wild who use it to Learn in Public:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kyle Simpson famously was told "You Don't Know JS" in an interview, and turned that into his <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">primary claim to fame</a>, controversial title and all.</li>
    <li>I eventually took my own TypeScript learnings, explicitly lampshaded that I was learning, and put them online and that became the <a href="https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet/">React TypeScript Cheatsheets</a></li>
    <li>I <em>frequently</em> lampshade my mistakes during my talks. Clicker not working? Call attention to it. Joke didn't land? Call myself out. Self aware, self deprecating humor is always appreciated by the audience, and fills dead air. But you can also use it to set up <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/91029-every-great-magic-trick-consists-of-three-parts-or-acts">a Pledge, in advance of a Turn and the final Prestige</a>, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJP1E-Y-xyo">exactly how I set up my own livecoding talks</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Nicolemens/status/1229610008167383040?s=20">This woman lampshading to ward off all trolls</a></li>
    <li><em>who else lampshades very well? let me know</em></li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dec 2020 Edit: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-power-of-lampshading/">Chris Coyier chimes in</a> with some very kind commentary of his own.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><figure id="w-node-062ee8588b39-d1412f6c"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f3e7f710351ee0491efb21b/5fd8e8a511c36679f08ad7a7_Article%20Image.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The lifeblood of any great technology company is their talent. Unfortunately, when it comes to competing for talent, private companies have always been at a disadvantage to public companies. Let’s imagine a scenario where an employee has two competing offers where the cash offer is the same.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Private Company:</strong> $100K worth of stock, 100% YoY Growth</li><li><strong>Public Company:</strong> $100K worth of stock, 35%YoY Growth</li></ul><p>On paper, the private company offer looks better. The company is doubling every year so the stock will grow much faster. In practice, however, people discount the stock because it’s illiquid. That puts the private company at a significant disadvantage.&nbsp;</p><p>We think there’s a better way. <a href="http://www.angellist.com/recurring-transfers">Recurring Transfers</a> enables private companies to offer recurring liquidity as a way to attract and retain great talent. We built the product to provide maximum control on who gets to sell how much and when. </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Control the process while reducing overhead:</strong> set parameters for incoming LPs, percentages individuals can sell, and more, while AngelList manages the entire process end-to-end on a recurring basis</li><li><strong>Streamline the cap table, future voting, and signatures:</strong> the buying entity will vote with the majority of non-conflicted holders of the same class and only a single signature is needed from AngelList for all buyers</li><li><strong>Protect private information:</strong> information rights are held by the single block and not provided to the underlying investors</li><li><strong>Offer recurring liquidity</strong> as a benefit to employees to differentiate compensation offerings from competitors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href="http://www.pipe.com/">Pipe.com</a> uses Recurring Transfers to make sure their employees can get liquidity on a recurring annual basis - something private companies historically haven't actively promoted. </p><p><strong>Harry Hurst, co-founder and co-CEO said, </strong></p><blockquote>“At Pipe, we believe that our entire team should have the same access to liquidity usually only afforded to founders. Everyone at the company may go through life-changing events such as buying a house or starting a family, we want to make sure that our team can get access to liquidity along the way to provide the financial cushion they need and deserve. AngelList's reputation for being startup-friendly gave us the confidence to choose them as our trusted partner.” </blockquote><p>Furthermore, companies can attract investors and talent by offering liquidity as part of a compensation package, reducing pressure for early investors and employees. </p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://angellist.com/blog/introducing-transfers-the-company-friendly-liquidity-solution?_ga=2.224275995.1222680455.1608045226-1365692428.1604910835">we introduced Transfers</a>, which enabled companies to take control of their liquidity options, while reducing operations, time, and expenses. With Recurring Transfers, we've further streamlined the process allowing for end-to-end liquidity management on a recurring basis. This added flexibility permits companies to offer shareholders liquidity on a recurring basis without having to incur extra overhead.</p><p><a href="http://www.angellist.com/recurring-transfers">Recurring Transfers</a> allows companies to manage their liquidity without having to manage the process periodically. Interested companies that have a <strong>$100M+ valuation and notable VC investors</strong> should <a href="https://go.pardot.com/l/853403/2020-12-11/77jr6">contact us</a> to learn more.</p></article><div><p>Disclosures</p><p>This blog post and the information contained herein is provided for informational and discussion purposes only and is not intended to be a recommendation for any investment or other advice of any kind, and shall not constitute or imply any offer to purchase, sell or hold any security or to enter into or engage in any type of transaction.

<p>Being a manager can be extremely hard, it can feel isolating at times especially if you don’t have a good support network of peers. But how do you cultivate this team of peers when your days are filled with 1:1s, meetings, code reviews and other things you need to get done?</p>



<p>Earlier this year I was struggling with this question. I needed to expand and nurture my peer group but was too busy with the day to day tasks of leading multiple teams to do anything regularly. That’s when I found this excellent post on <a href="https://blog.danielna.com/starting-an-engineering-management-book-club/">starting an engineering manager book club</a> by Daniel Na. I asked my peers if they’d be interested in starting a book club for engineering managers. They said yes and I got started thinking about what it could look like.</p>



<p>I wanted the book club to, first and foremost, be a place where we could help one another with challenges in our day to day jobs. Sometimes helping someone is as simple as listening to their problems. Sometimes you have experience and can offer more targeted advice and sometimes people just need to vent. I wanted a place where this could happen freely. I also wanted us to grow as a team, learning new ways to manage our engineers, new techniques to motivate and help grow people’s careers.</p>



<p>Having now led a few of these I thought I’d share some tips that have worked well.</p>



<p><strong>1. Keep it small, 8 people or less</strong></p>



<p>One of the goals is to allow everyone a chance to discuss the book and talk about how that’s impacting their day to day challenges. If the group is too big it can make it difficult for a couple of reasons. One reason, logistically speaking, is that it’ll be hard to get everyone a chance to talk in the allotted time. The other problem is a little more nuanced. As the group grows people can be worried about sharing their opinion with a large audience. You may also have someone who dominates the conversation. It’s the job of the moderator to keep the loud ones from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-couch/201204/5-steps-dealing-people-who-talk-too-much">talking too much</a> and to get the quiet ones to share their opinions. Keeping the group smaller helps with both of these.</p>



<p><strong>2. Choose the book together</strong></p>



<p>It can be easier to want to read your favourite management book. You know it’s great and will help others just like it helped you. It’s important to choose the book as a group though because it broadens the potential list of books and gives everyone an opportunity to suggest their favourite book. I asked for people’s favourite management books and then did a Slack poll allowing people to vote for their top three. We then read the most voted on the book. This helped ensure the majority of people were actually interested in the book club and helped with attendance.</p>



<p><strong>3. Schedule every meeting from the start</strong></p>



<p>One of the things that worked really well was scheduling every meeting in advance. I planned out every chapter that we’d be reading and scheduled it for the same time every week. We all have busy calendars and planning in advance made it easier to carve out a chunk in everyone’s day. It also helped me plan for days that didn’t work for the majority and allowed me to not have to skip a week because I couldn’t find a time slot that worked.</p>



<p><strong>4. Have the meeting early in the morning</strong></p>



<p>This one is very team and timezone dependent. We found that early mornings before the rush of the day started worked best. People were less likely to have conflicts or meetings that went long and it helped set the tone for the day. I always felt refreshed after the book club, feeling like I could be a better manager to my team.</p>



<p><strong>5. Keep it manageable each week (1 or 2 chapters)</strong></p>



<p>This one is very book dependent. Some books throw a lot of discussable content into each chapter. Some books have very short chapters with themes that span multiple chapters. Plan the book to read 30-60 pages a week.</p>



<p><strong>6. Have some prepared questions but allow the conversation to flow</strong></p>



<p>The goal of a moderator is to guide the conversation. Sometimes that means letting people go where they need to go and sometimes that means guiding the conversation with specific questions. I usually find 3 or 4 questions is the right number for an hour-long discussion with &lt;8 people.</p>



<p>Icebreakers are a good way to get everyone comfortable talking. I like asking questions like “What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?” or “What’s the most pressing decision you need to make right now”. Sometimes these icebreakers take the entire meeting and that’s ok! If you’re looking for some good icebreakers Vanessa Van Edwards has a <a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/meeting-icebreakers/">great article on them</a>.</p>



<p>It’s also ok to have periods of silence. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/averyblank/2017/06/20/6-ways-leaders-use-silence-to-increase-their-power-that-you-can-do-too/?sh=75b5922427c8">Silence is a tactic</a> you can use to empower others to participate, to drive home an important answer or just to figure out what you want to say next.</p>



<p><strong>7. Call on the quiet people</strong></p>



<p>Not everyone is comfortable sharing. Some people take longer to warm up than others and some people feel like they have nothing valuable to share. Every manager has a unique perspective on things and when they contribute the whole group grows. It’s the job of the moderator to know who’s participating and who isn’t and call on the quiet ones to provide their opinion.</p>



<p><strong>8. Vegas Rules</strong></p>



<p>What happens in the book club stays in the book club. One of the most important rules of running a book club is creating psychological safety. If people don’t feel safe in sharing their management challenges then the discussion will never move past superficial conversation. If the group commits to open and honest conversation that stays within the walls of the book club you can really make something great.</p>



<p><strong>9. Know when to quit a book</strong></p>



<p>Not every book is a winner. You and your book club don’t have to power through a book that isn’t working for you. After the first few meetings, it’s a good idea to check in on everyone and see how they’re enjoying the book. If it feels like you’re trying to pull teeth getting people to share it may be time to move on to another book.</p>



<hr>



<p>These are the things that helped our group have a successful book club. I hope you all can level up your peer group with your own book club and I’d love to hear how it goes.</p>

<p><strong>What this guide is for:</strong> This guide is laser-focused on one thing: showing how to get a working informational website up and running as fast
as possible using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, using only the GitHub website. <em>Informational website</em> is an informal term meaning that the emphasis is on
function (structured text with simple formatting, links, images) and not form (intricate page design). It goes step by step from the very beginning
and assumes very little knowledge on your part.</p>

<p>You don’t need to learn command-line programs like Git, or install anything
on your own computer. Everything taught here does apply to advanced use patterns when you get more experienced.</p>

<p>GitHub Pages is free if your repository (file storage area) is public.</p>

<p><strong>Ways to view this site</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/">Github Pages</a></li>
  <li>Directly on <a href="https://github.com/tomcam/least-github-pages/">Github</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you were pointed here by an employer or well-meaning friend and aren’t quite sure why, 
you can find plenty of reasons in <a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/why-use-github-pages.html">Why Use GitHub Pages?</a></p>

<p><strong>What you can get out of this guide:</strong>  If you follow through the steps in this guide you’ll have a small website demonstrating everything you need to put up an attractive, easy to maintain site using words, links, and images. 
Not covered are advanced topics such as using Git on the command line, custom themes, SEO, version control,
and advanced features of GitHub-flavored Markdown.</p>

<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h2>

<p>GitHub Pages uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a publishing system based on the Ruby programming language. The Jekyll documentation is excellent, especially if you already know Jekyll, program in Ruby, and have both Ruby and Jekyll installed on your local computer. The GitHub Pages documentation is comprehensive and excellent–if you’re already a Jekyll expert.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/">The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages</a> is designed for people who don’t happen to know Jekyll already but who need to get up to speed in GitHub Pages quickly to get a job done <em>now</em>. It tells you not only <em>what</em> to do step by step,
but also briefly explains <em>why</em> you’re doing it.</p>

<p>You probably don’t want to use GitHub Pages on sites that require complex, individual formatting on a per-page basis. 
GitHub Pages uses Markdown, which has some limited formatting information but not a lot.
GitHub Pages then uses Jekyll to turn that Markdown into HTML, based on the Jekyll theme you’ve chosen. Generally speaking this approach is
absolutely ideal for blogs, technical documents and instructional materials that require versioning and collaboration, where the
main work product is words and pictures. It is not a good fit for things like boutique pages, restaurant menu sites, consumer product sites, and so on where
custom formatting is the norm.</p>

<p>I found this thought exercise in the book <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Happy-More-Less-Everything-Absolutely-ebook/dp/B01HE7TG7Y?sa-no-redirect=1">Happy</a> by Derren Brown.</p>



<p>Imagine <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/07/how-easily-our-lives-could-have-gone-differently/">suddenly everyone disappears</a>, but all of the world’s infrastructure and food supply magically continues to work. So you are the only person on Earth and you don’t have to worry about finding food/water/shelter. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/21/non-fluffy-brainstorming-questions-for-long-term-career-planning/">What would you do all day</a>? </p>



<p>It’s a forcing function to make us realize how much of our behavior is driven by status seeking. It might be fun to drive a Ferrari and live in a mansion with no one around to stop you. You could sleep in the Oval Office! But without anyone else to see it, what’s the point? Once the novelty wore off, what would be left?</p>



<p>Would I still <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/09/running-advice-i-wish-id-gotten/">exercise</a> or eat well if I didn’t have anyone to look good for? Would I still want a nice house, or would I end up somewhere tiny and easy to clean? Would I even care about cleaning if nobody was around to think I’m a slob? Would I have <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/07/01/learning-to-crochet-as-a-32-year-old-man/">hobbies</a> with no one to try to impress or even talk to about them? Would I travel to beautiful places if I had no one to share them with? Would I bother taking pictures of those places if no one else could see them?</p>



<p>What could I <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/10/what-the-heck-do-i-even-want/">possibly care about</a>? I honestly have no idea. Does that mean everything I do is status seeking? Or just that without community, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">the human condition</a> does not exist? </p>

<hr>
<p>
There are four distinct steps involved in transforming a C or C++ source file into an executable binary: <i>preprocessing</i>, <i>compiling</i>, <i>assembling</i>, and <i>linking</i>.
</p>
<p>
In theory each step is the responsibility of a dedicated tool: the preprocessor <code>cpp</code>, the compiler <code>cc</code>, the assembler <code>as</code>, and the linker <code>ld</code>. In practice the compiler will happily orchestrate all four steps for us and we can build a simple C or C++ program using a single command:
</p>
<pre>$ cc source.c
</pre>
<p>
By default the resulting executable will be given the rather unappealing name of <code>a.out</code> — short for <i>assembler output</i> — but we can fix this by specifying a custom output name:
</p>
<pre>$ cc -o name source.c
</pre>
<p>
We'll look briefly below at each step of the compilation process and summarize some of the most useful options available.
</p>
<p>
The interface we'll describe was developed originally for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">GCC</a>  — the GNU C Compiler —  and its supporting toolchain. This interface was later mimicked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang">Clang</a>, which aimed to be a drop-in replacement for GCC, and so now applies to both. It's a little crufty and inconsistent but the desire for backwards compatibility means we're stuck with it for the foreseeable future.
</p>
<p>
(To avoid repeating the awkward "C or C++" all the time we'll assume below that we're compiling a C program, but the steps and options are identical for both. Just substitute a <code>.cpp</code> extension in place of <code>.c</code> for C++ source files.)
</p>
<h3 id="preprocessing">
Preprocessing
</h3>
<p>
The C preprocessor <code>cpp</code> is responsible for executing <code>#</code> directives and expanding macros. It takes a <code>.c</code> source file as input and outputs an expanded source file, still written in C.
</p>
<p>
Preprocessed files typically aren't retained, but when they are the convention is to give them a <code>.i</code> extension. (I have no idea why.)
</p>
<p>
We can use the compiler's <code>-E</code> flag to view the preprocessed source. Output is printed to standard out by default unless we also use the <code>-o</code> flag to specify an output filename.
</p>
<pre>$ cc -E source.c
</pre>
<p>
The following preprocessor options are available (and can be passed directly to the compiler):
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-C</code>
</td>
<td>
Retain source comments in the output.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-D&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>
</td>
<td>
Define the named symbol before preprocessing. If no value is specified the symbol will have a default value of 1.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-I&lt;directory&gt;</code>
</td>
<td>
Add the specified directory to the search path for <code>#include</code> files.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-P</code>
</td>
<td>
Omit debugging information from the output.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-U&lt;name&gt;</code>
</td>
<td>
Undefine the named symbol before preprocessing.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="compiling">
Compiling
</h3>
<p>
The compiler <code>cc</code> translates a source file written in C into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly language</a>.
</p>
<p>
Assembly language is a human-readable representation of the binary machine code that actually runs on the computer's hardware; as such it's specific to the CPU architecture of the target system.
</p>
<p>
Assembly language files typically aren't retained but we can view them using the compiler's <code>-S</code> flag which halts the compilation process after they've been generated.
</p>
<pre>$ cc -S source.c
</pre>
<p>
This will generate a <code>.s</code> assembly file for each input file provided.
</p>
<h3 id="assembling">
Assembling
</h3>
<p>
The assembler <code>as</code> translates source files written in assembly language into executable binary code. It outputs a single <code>.o</code> object file for each input file provided.
</p>
<p>
The compiler defaults to automatically deleting these object files but we can retain them using the <code>-c</code> flag.
</p>
<pre>$ cc -c source.c
</pre>
<p>
This instructs the compiler to compile and assemble the object files but stop before linking them into an executable.
</p>
<h3 id="linking">
Linking
</h3>
<p>
Linking is the final stage of the compilation process. The linker <code>ld</code> combines multiple object files into a single executable file. It also links in code from the standard library and any other external libraries referenced by the files.
</p>
<p>
The C standard library is linked in automatically. To link in a static library <code>libfoo.a</code> located on the default library search path we use the <code>-l</code> flag:
</p>
<pre>$ cc source.c -lfoo
</pre>
<p>
Note that the standard <code>lib</code> prefix and <code>.a</code> (<i>archive</i>) extension are omitted. To link to a library that isn't on the default search path we have two options:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
We can specify the library's full filepath as if it were a source or object file:
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre>$ cc source.c /path/to/lib/libfoo.a
</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>
We can add the containing directory to the search path using the <code>-L</code> flag:
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre>$ cc source.c -L/path/to/lib -lfoo
</pre>
<p>
Note that libraries must be specified <i>after</i> the source or object files that reference them.
</p>
<h3 id="multiple-files">
Multiple Files
</h3>
<p>
The compiler will happily accept multiple input files in varying stages of compilation:
</p>
<pre>$ cc src.c asm.s obj.o
</pre>
<p>
In this case <code>src.c</code> will be compiled and assembled, <code>asm.s</code> will be assembled, and the two resulting object files will be linked with <code>obj.o</code> into an executable.
</p>
<h3 id="warnings-standards">
Warnings &amp; Standards
</h3>
<p>
Turn on compiler warnings with the following flags:
</p>
<pre>-Wall -Wextra --std=c99 --pedantic
</pre>
<p>
The <code>-Wall</code> and <code>-Wextra</code> flags turn on most of the compiler's available warnings. The <code>--std=c99</code> flag instructs the compiler to use the C99 standard (available options include <code>c90</code> and <code>c11</code>). The final <code>--pedantic</code> flag turns on a number of additional warnings specific to the particular standard chosen.
</p>
<p>
Warnings can be turned off individually, e.g.
</p>
<pre>-Wno-unused-parameter
</pre>
<p>
will tell the compiler to stop bugging us about unused parameters.
</p>
<h3 id="compiling-static-libraries">
Compiling Static Libraries
</h3>
<p>
A static library is simply a collection or <i>archive</i> of object files. Static libraries are created using the <code>ar</code> (<i>archiver</i>) tool and by convention are given a <code>lib</code> prefix and <code>.a</code> extension.
</p>
<pre>$ ar -rv libfoo.a one.o two.o three.o
</pre>
<p>
Static libraries are built into the executable at compiletime — they do not have to be present on the system at runtime.
</p>
<h3 id="compiling-dynamic-libraries">
Compiling Dynamic Libraries
</h3>
<p>
A dynamic or <i>shared object</i> library is a special collection of object files that can be loaded by a program at runtime. Dynamic libraries are created using the compiler's <code>--shared</code> flag and by convention are given a <code>lib</code> prefix and <code>.so</code> extension.
</p>
<pre>$ cc --shared -o libfoo.so one.o two.o three.o
</pre>
<p>
Dynamic libraries can be used in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
An executable can be linked against a dynamic library at compiletime. Multiple executables can then share a single library instance, which must be available on the system at runtime.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
An executable can dynamically load and unload library files at runtime using the system's dynamic linking functions. Libraries used in this way can form the basis of a plugin system for an application.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

                          <p>Version 1.0.  It’s here.  After three and a half years of development,
we are happy to announce the release of version 1.0 of Sequoia!</p>
<p>The release includes the low-level crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sequoia-openpgp"><code>sequoia-openpgp</code></a>, and a
program to verify detached signatures geared towards software
distribution systems called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sequoia-sqv"><code>sqv</code></a>.</p>
<p>We will support this API with security updates for at least one year.
In 9 months, we will announce whether we will extend this commitment.
The two main criteria will be our financial situation (please
<a href="https://pep.foundation/support-pep/index.html">donate</a>, or sponsor a developer or two), and the number of users.</p>

<p>We actually <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sequoiapgp/103364362621954545">almost released</a> version 1.0 about a year ago.  All of the
features that we had planned for version 1.0 were implemented, we had
good test coverage, and we even had a few users.  But, we decided to
wait.  We decided to wait not because we thought of another feature,
or because we became aware of a significant bug, but because <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/465">we</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/466">decided</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/467">to</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/468">take</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/469">some</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/470">time</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/471">to</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/472">improve</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/473">our</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/474">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal was to make sure that every module had a helpful
introduction, and all public methods had a useful description, a link
to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880">the standard</a>, when appropriate, and a meaningful example.
Dividing the task between five people, we figured it would delay the
release by a month, perhaps two.  In the end, well, it took nearly a
year, and we had to scale our ambitions back a bit.  Nevertheless,
we’re quite happy with <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/cert/index.html">the</a> <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/parse/stream/trait.DecryptionHelper.html">result</a>.</p>
<p>First, the documentation is much better.  It’s of course hard to
quantify its quality.  But, we can distill a few numbers.  When we
started our documentation effort shortly after we released version
0.14, the Sequoia library had just over 11k lines of comments
including 53 documentation tests, and 37 kSLOC including 12 kSLOC of
unit tests.  The 1.0 release has over 33k lines of comments (190%
more) including 464 documentation tests (780% more), and 44 kSLOC (21%
or 7.5 kSLOC more) including 8k SLOC of additional unit tests.</p>
<p>Second, in the process of documenting our public API and writing
examples, we discovered many minor annoyances, some inconsistencies,
and more than a few bugs.  Since we hadn’t yet commited to a stable
API, we could and did fix them.</p>
<p>Finally, as the rate of change of the API had decreased, more projects
were willing to try out Sequoia.  They provided additional useful
feedback, which we integrated.</p>
<p>All in all, we feel that with version 1.0 we’ve not only checked the
<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-disaster-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-it-gets-worse">right boxes</a>, but we also have a high-quality API and implementation
that we can be proud of.</p>

<p>Sequoia was started 3.5 years ago by Justus Winter, Kai Michaelis and
me, Neal Walfield.  Prior to working on Sequoia, the three of us had
worked together at <a href="http://www.g10code.de/">g10code</a> on <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>.  The <a href="https://pep.foundation/">p≡p foundation</a> hired
us not only to create a new OpenPGP implementation using a new
architecture and programming language, but to improve the ecosystem
around privacy-preserving tools as a whole.</p>
<p>The Sequoia library is a first step in that direction.  But it is not
our end goal.  Indeed, over the past three years, we’ve helped other
OpenPGP implementations.  We’ve reported bugs that we’ve found (thanks
in particular to our <a href="https://tests.sequoia-pgp.org/">OpenPGP interoperability test suite</a>), and even
contributed some fixes to other OpenPGP implementations.</p>
<p>And, we’ve invested in tooling.  We developed <a href="https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid">Hagrid</a>, a new
verifying OpenPGP key server, which powers <a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">keys.openpgp.org</a> and is
now maintained by Vincent Breitmoser.  We’ve helped <a href="https://openpgp-ca.gitlab.io/openpgp-ca/">OpenPGP CA</a>, a
tool written by Heiko Schaefer to create <em>federated</em> CAs for groups
like activists, lawyers, and journalists, but also companies, who
don’t want to trust centralized infrastructure whose primary
incentives are monetary.  OpenPGP CA significantly simplifies key
discovery and authentication for unsophisticated OpenPGP users.  We’ve
developed <a href="https://gitlab.com/koverto/koverto">Koverto</a>, an SMTP proxy, which makes it easy to sign and
encrypt mails sent by services that don’t support OpenPGP out of the
box, like most CMSes.  We developed a tool, <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/keyring-linter"><code>sq-keyring-linter</code></a>
(<a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/sq-keyring-linter">Debian</a>), to help users update their OpenPGP Certificates, so that
we can <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/Rp-inhYKT8A9H5E34iLTrc9I0gc/">finally get rid of SHA-1</a>.</p>
<p>We’re thinking big.  We’re thinking not only about mail encryption or
even encryption in general, but also about integrity and
authentication.  And, we’re thinking in particular, about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI</a>.  If
users can’t easily find the <strong>right</strong> certificate for a communication
partner, encryption and digital signatures are worthless, and possibly
even dangerous.</p>

<p>In designing Sequoia, we took a library-first approach.  Although we
have a command-line tool, <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sq/index.html"><code>sq</code></a>, which we are not yet releasing, we
intend for the library to always provide a richer, more expressive
interface.  We agree that there is value in process separation, but we
want to avoid the dangerous complexity of <em>safely</em> shelling out to
another program.</p>
<p>The sequoia-openpgp crate (Rust’s terminology for a library) is a
low-level, policy-free OpenPGP implementation.  Our goal was to
implement all of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880">RFC 4880</a>, and provide an API that can be used to
access and modify pretty much everything, but is simultaneously secure
by default.</p>
<p>We understand low-level to mean not only an API that provides getters
and setters, but an API that provides interfaces to parse and
serialize those fields, and can combine them in ways intended by the
standard, and needed by users.  For instance, the <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/struct.Cert.html"><code>Cert</code></a> data
structure encapsulates an OpenPGP certificate (casually referred to as
an OpenPGP key).  It canonicalizes the structure, and makes it easy to
<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/cert/struct.ValidCert.html#method.revocation_status">query its properties</a>.  But, it does so in such a way that it is
still possible for a user to inspect and modify the low-level bits
themselves without reimplementing the rest of the functionality.
Another example is the <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/parse/stream/trait.DecryptionHelper.html"><code>DecryptionHelper</code></a>, which makes it easy to
parse and decrypt an OpenPGP message.</p>
<p>An example of how we make the API safe by default is that it is hard
to accidentally export secret key material.  In Sequoia, you have to
explicitly <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/struct.Cert.html#secret-keys">opt-in to export it</a>.  Similarly, when <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/packet/signature/struct.SignatureBuilder.html">updating a
signature</a>, the creation time, hash algorithm, and issuer are
automatically updated.  This is usually what the user wants, but is
easy to forget, and hard to debug when forgotten.  Critically, it is
easy to opt out when that behavior is not desired.</p>
<p>While developing Sequoia, we spent a lot of time thinking about
extremes and corner cases.  For instance, OpenPGP supports
notarizations (signatures over signatures), but as far as we know no
OpenPGP implementation supports them.  We implemented support for it
anyway, and it improved the ergonomics of the common case.</p>
<h2 id="notable-details">Notable Details</h2>
<p>The devel is in the details.  And while deviloping Sequoia, we paid
attention.  Here are a few noteworthy details:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a> has been broken since 2005.  And, in 2011 NIST deprecated its
use.  Initially, we decided to simply reject any signature that used
SHA-1.  However, we were recently forced to <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/Rp-inhYKT8A9H5E34iLTrc9I0gc/">reevaluate</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/595">that
decision</a>: 22% of Debian developers use a certificate that relies on
SHA-1 as do 63% of Arch developers.  Even the Fedora release keys use
SHA-1.</p>
<p>We decided that we couldn’t simply reenable SHA-1.  After some
consideration, we’ve opted to <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/policy/enum.HashAlgoSecurity.html">permit it</a> in contexts where collision
attacks similar to the one presented in <a href="https://sha-mbles.github.io/">SHA-1 is a Shambles</a> are
harder.  We also use a variant of SHA-1 called <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sha1collisiondetection">SHA1CD</a> (SHA-1
Collision Detection), which detects and neutralizes the known attacks
against SHA-1.  Among others, <a href="https://github.blog/2017-03-20-sha-1-collision-detection-on-github-com/">GitHub uses it</a>.  And, we have also
decided to <strong><a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/policy/struct.StandardPolicy.html#method.reject_hash_at">start rejecting SHA-1 by default</a> at the beginning of
2023</strong>, i.e., in a bit more than two years.  This will hopefully give
Debian developers and others sufficient time to <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/keyring-linter">fix</a> or replace their
certificates.</p>
<p>When we create a signature, we include a <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/597">salt</a>.  This makes it harder
for an attacker to predict what data a user will sign.  And, it foils
attacks where an attacker needs multiple signatures over the same
message.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20190621081455">OpenSSH</a>, we <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/crypto/mem/struct.Encrypted.html">encrypt secret key material</a> while it is in
memory.  This frustrates side-channel attacks.</p>
<p>Sequoia supports <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/serialize/stream/padding/index.html">padding messages</a> to obfuscate an encrypted
message’s length.  We include support for the <a href="https://bford.info/pub/sec/purb.pdf">padmé</a> scheme, but
other schemes can be plugged in.</p>
<p>To allow users to control the policy while still using higher-level
functionality, Sequoia uses a <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/policy/index.html">policy object</a>.  A policy object is
passed to any method that checks something for validity.  For
instance, when a method needs to determine whether a binding signature
should be used, it invokes the policy object’s <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/policy/trait.Policy.html#method.signature"><code>signature</code> callback</a>.
Our experience suggests that this approach greatly simplifies dealing
with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern">cross-cutting concern</a> in a highly flexible manner.</p>
<p>Policy objects can also be embedded in other objects.  For instance, a
<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/cert/struct.ValidCert.html"><code>ValidCert</code></a> encapsulates a <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/struct.Cert.html"><code>Cert</code></a> and a policy object.  This
ensures that the application of the policy is consistent, and hard to
forget to apply.</p>
<p>In Sequoia, we prefer the use of formal grammars rather than ad-hoc
parsing when doing any non-trivial parsing.  For instance, when
verifying the structure of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-11.1">OpenPGP Certificates</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-11.3">OpenPGP
Messages</a>, we use <a href="https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop">LALRPOP</a>, a parser generator, to generate the
parser.</p>
<p>Sequoia implements a streaming API.  If not careful, this can lead to
a consumer processing unauthenticated data, which was exploited by
<a href="https://efail.de/">EFAIL</a>.  To mitigate this type of failure, the <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/parse/stream/trait.DecryptionHelper.html"><code>DecryptionHelper</code></a>
withholds the last <code>O(1)</code> bytes of data, and only releases it if the
message can be authenticated.  This makes it harder for an attacker to
control what is released.  And for short messages, nothing is released
since the whole message is buffered.</p>
<p>We’ve tried to ensure that data structures that may be used in a
side-channel sensitive context use constant time comparisons.</p>
<p>Where possible, we use a device driver-style API so that it is
straightforward to add new backends.  For instance, our <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/crypto/trait.Signer.html"><code>Signer</code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/parse/stream/struct.Decryptor.html"><code>Decryptor</code></a> traits make it easy to implement alternative signing and
decryption backends.  In addition to the in-memory implementations, we
already have implementations that use secret key material managed by
<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_ipc/gnupg/struct.KeyPair.html">gpg agent</a>.</p>
<p>We tried hard to provide helpful error messages.  This is particularly
difficult …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wow! Yesterday the EU published the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">Digital Markets Act</a>, a legislative proposal seeking to protect the fundamental rights of users in the digital world. &nbsp;This proposal has the potential to be a major catalyst for the emergence of a unifying communications layer for the open web.<br></p><p>Indeed the Digital Markets Act is pushing interoperability between messaging apps, which is a major win for consumers.</p><p>People will no longer be forced into - or trapped within - walled gardens like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. Instead, they should be able to choose any app they prefer, and then communicate with anyone - just like you can choose your email provider and still email people that use a different one; or call people on different phone networks.<br></p><p>In fact, when you think about it, it’s crazy that messaging apps don’t already interoperate.<br></p><p>To quote the EU’s proposal:<br></p><p><em>Concretely, the Digital Markets Act will[...]:</em></p><ul><li><em><em><em>Require gatekeepers to proactively put in place certain measures, such as targeted measures allowing the software of third parties to properly function and interoperate with their own services;</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>Impose sanctions for non-compliance, which could include fines of up to 10% of the gatekeeper's worldwide turnover, to ensure the effectiveness of the new rules.</em></em></em><br></li></ul><p><strong>An idea whose time has come</strong><br></p><p>That’s something that occurred to us back in 2014, when we started development on <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>. We saw the way the web was increasingly centralised and that the general public were being robbed of their privacy. We set about creating a disruptive, decentralised open communications network that would put ordinary people back in control of their online conversations. Through Matrix, they would be able to host their app wherever they wanted. Instead of having to leave it on the servers of a proprietary walled garden app; leaving it there, under the ownership of the service provider, free to be monetised, datamined (or breached, or anything else).<br></p><p>We thought that tech-savvy, early-adopters would propel the project forward and we were right, to an extent. We have a fantastic community behind us, who have supported us through thick and thin. <br></p><p>We then quite quickly realised that governments were very interested in decentralised real time communications, because it assured them of their digital sovereignty. Our first flagship deployment, the French government’s <a href="https://static.element.io/pdfs/case-study-france-embraces-matrix-to-build-tchap.pdf">Tchap platform</a>, was proof of that; along with a slew of similar deployments around the world. Most of those have been on-premise deployments. We’re now seeing open source companies and security-conscious commercial firms adopting Element and Matrix, mainly through <a href="https://ems.element.io/">Element Matrix Services</a>; our Matrix-based hosting service.<br></p><p>What we didn’t foresee, especially in such a short timeframe, was that those centralised platform giants would become so dominant that legislators would also disrupt the marketplace. For the EU, it’s not just about igniting innovation in a dominated marketplace. It’s also a push to improve online privacy, stronger personal data ownership and raise security standards.</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png 1750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>This is for everyone</strong><br></p><p>These serendipitous improvements will take place because consumers will be able to pick a messaging app based on <strong>what</strong> it offers, not <strong>who</strong> it offers. And people are far more likely to choose privacy-respecting apps, where their data isn’t mined and sold off to advertisers or exploited to swing elections. Privacy - and security - should improve as a result. <br></p><p>It’s an initial blow to the likes of Facebook and Google whose business model is based on collecting and harvesting users’ data. But hopefully, they will commit to interoperability and compete on features, rather than locking people into their proprietary systems.<br></p><div><p>Indeed, instead of slipping into a comfortable middle age, they will be kept on their toes by a changing landscape and a new breed of competitors who can challenge not just those incumbents but the very notion of centralised technology.</p></div><p><strong>The interoperability the EU wants already exists</strong><br></p><p>For Element, and Matrix, this is a significant moment. Europe is looking to transform a centralised, siloed, gatekeeper-centric digital landscape into a new era of competitive, interoperable and privacy-centric communications.<br></p><p>Matrix - as both a protocol and a network - already exists. It offers digital sovereignty, interoperability and security. It can even operate on a peer-to-peer basis; independent of traditional internet infrastructure and able to connect the unconnected in the world’s most rural places.<br></p><p>As the internet giants react to Europe’s new direction - and step through the stages of denial, anger and bargaining - once thing they cannot deny is that an open standard for communication interoperability already exists. <br></p><p>Technically, we can have interoperability between all messaging apps in place before Spring 2021. Let’s see how long the politics - company politics - take to play out.</p></div></div>]]>

Some masks were as much as 79 percent effective at blocking particles that could carry the virus. UNC scientists researched the protectiveness of various kinds of consumer-grade and modified masks. Researchers used an approach based on the OSHA Fit Test to determine the fitted filtration efficiency of facemasks. The top-of-the-line N-95 mask proved to be 98 percent effective.</p><p>Fitted filtration efficiency tests were conducted in a custom-built exposure chamber. Masks were fitted with sampling probes using a Fit Test Probe Kit for Disposable Facepieces 8025-N95 (TSI) to allow sampling of aerosol inside the face mask. Three respirator sterilization methods were tested on used masks: ethylene oxide (EtO), steam (121 °C, 15 minutes), and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (8 g/min, 260 PPM, 100-minute cycle) The FFE of these sterilized, used masks was measured after a single sterilization cycle as described above.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/251456_web.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/251456_web.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/251456_web.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/251456_web.jpg 1440w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>CREDIT: UNC School of Medicine, Medical procedure mask and modifications designed to enhance mask fit or comfort for the wearer.

However, availability of these items may be compromised during periods of high demand, such as in a pandemic. Recently, sterilization and decontamination of face masks has emerged as a novel method to prolong the limited supply of existing respirators. The study evaluated particle penetration for commonly available face masks and alternatives. The most effective face mask achieved only 79.7% FFE, and masks with elastic ear loops were the least effective when moving the head left and right (21.2% F FE) and bent at the waist and looked up and down.</p><p>The most penetrating particle size was found to be 30 to 60 nm, which is similar in size to those used for measurements in this study. A limitation of this study is the decision to test each mask on a single man (and woman for a few comparisons) rather than a large number of individuals with a full range of facial configurations.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_2187.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/IMG_2187.jpeg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/IMG_2187.jpeg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_2187.jpeg 1057w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Man wearing a black mask" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@gmalhotra?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Gayatri Malhotra</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even face masks with less than 95% FFE (eg, surgical masks) are effective in preventing acquisition of epidemic coronaviruses.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>After two and a half years of being independent, I am returning to Google.</p>

<p>The time off was really valuable. I was still feeling residual effects from burnout on the Android team in late 2015, and also drained by family and personal things that were happening and needed more time and energy. I got that, and return recharged and with some insights that I hope will be useful. I’ll touch on a few of those in this post. Each could probably be its own blog post, but today I want to briefly note the event.</p>

<p>I am now a research software engineer on the Google Fonts team, working on a number of topics in font technology, including font design tools, GPU-accelerated font rendering, and evolution of font file formats to be more efficient and capable.</p>

<h2 id="on-open-source-sustainability">On open source sustainability</h2>

<p>Much has been written on open source sustainability, notably <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/">Nadia Eghbal</a>’s <em>Working in Public.</em> I won’t speak to open source more broadly (except to note how impressed I am with Blender and Krita), but for the specific task of building an ecosystem for a library, I think there is one model that actually works: being hired by a company that depends on that ecosystem.</p>

<p>To some extent, that’s an indictment of our capitalist system. In an ideal universe, there would be strong institutions dedicated to the public interest where open source developers could develop, researchers could research, and spend an absolute minimum of time and energy hustling for support. For software, in any case, universities are not that (as demonstrated by <a href="https://blog.cocalc.com/2019/04/12/should-i-resign-from-my-full-professor-job-to-work-fulltime-on-cocalc.html">William Stein’s experience with Cocalc at University of Washington</a>), otherwise I’d be quite tempted. In the actual world, working for a company like Google is about as close as you can come.</p>

<p>I remain skeptical of patronage-style platforms such as Patreon or Github Sponsors. I think it’s possible to make them work, but only for a small number of fortunate people, and even then, the incentives for creating maximum value aren’t that well aligned with the incentive structure of hustling on social media.</p>

<p>So me (re-)joining Google full time is basically a statement of confidence in this model of being employed to work on open source. Other models can work, and people should definitely find what works for them, but particularly for the projects I’m interested in, it makes sense.</p>

<h2 id="on-rust">On Rust</h2>

<p>I continue to love Rust, and believe it offers a stronger foundation for building software. I feel like I started my Rust journey in the early ’90s, when I was working on retrofitting <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/pldi95.pdf">static memory management</a> to ML, using explicit lifetime regions.</p>

<p>Rust adoption is trending up, including at Google. The language is in good shape, but the library ecosystem is still fairly immature, missing a number of critical pieces. Building up that ecosystem is an incredibly rewarding project.</p>

<p>I am particularly excited about Rust for font technology and infrastructure. Today, Python rules on the font design and production side, partly to the connection of typeface designer <a href="https://medium.com/type-thursday/learning-python-makes-you-a-better-designer-an-interview-with-just-van-rossum-8d4758c192d8">Just van Rossum</a> being Guido’s brother. The flexibility and expressiveness of Python makes it a good fit, but we’ve also gotten to a place where the <em>production</em> of fonts is done in Python, and the <em>consumption</em> is in C++.</p>

<p>Rust lets us build reliable, performant code that can also be deployed in production, and can be the basis of fluidly interactive UI tools. I’m not the only one who sees this potential; YesLogic is building their next-generation font shaper <a href="https://github.com/yeslogic/allsorts">Allsorts</a> in Rust, for many of the same reasons.</p>

<p>The Google Fonts team has been interested in adopting more Rust for a while, and part of my role is to facilitate that. I’m really looking forward to it.</p>

<h2 id="on-research">On research</h2>

<p>I have rebranded myself somewhat as a researcher, but that doesn’t <em>quite</em> capture the whole story either. I have always loved research, and that love sustained the energy to complete my <a href="https://levien.com/phd/phd.html">PhD</a>, but I also love building real things, and actually feel that many of these practical problems are more interesting than many of the abstract topics fashionable in academia. Just as much as writing papers and so on, I’m trying to build open source software and community around that. There isn’t really a word for this role, but even without such a word I’m trying to consciously create it for myself, and am grateful that Google is allowing me to try.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-work">On the work</h2>

<p>This is the most exciting part for me. I have a very long-term interest in 2D graphics, font technology, and UI, and have been doing a bunch of interesting things on all these fronts. I expect to spend most of my time continuing to advance research on all these frontiers.</p>

<p>The scope of these projects is large, and more ambitious than one person could really do. That’s one reason I’ve been consciously developing an open source community around them. That will continue.</p>

<p>Most of the day-to-day work on <a href="https://github.com/linebender/druid">Druid</a> and <a href="https://github.com/linebender/runebender">Runebender</a> will be done by Colin Rofls, though I very much enjoy getting my elbows in the code too and will be doing some of that.</p>

<p>A major focus will be building out the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/piet-gpu/blob/master/doc/vision.md">piet-gpu vision</a>. I believe a high-performance 2D rendering engine will be a great thing for the Rust ecosystem and with potential for large impact. It feels like good research; whether it goes into production at scale or not, I expect the things we learn from doing it will help inform the next generation of UI technology. That’s equally true for research into fundamental UI principles, for example the <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/druid/2020/09/25/principled-reactive-ui.html">Crochet</a> architecture for Druid.</p>

<p>There are also really exciting advances in <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline">spline</a> technology in the pipeline. I think these have the potential to be a more appealing and productive basis for drawing fonts than cubic Béziers. The next big step is to validate whether they actually work as well as I’m hoping. That involves polishing the UX and integrating them into Runebender. If that turns out really well, a longer term (but more speculative) aspiration is to get them into a font format, where they could reduce binary size while increasing quality. It’s obvious the Google Fonts team is the best home for this work.</p>

<p>I have a lot of work in front of me, but am more excited than ever. On to an old new adventure, and may 2021 be a time of healing and renewed energy for all.</p>

  <p><span>14 Dec 2020</span></p><p>An application is a living, breathing code base that will continually change over time. As the application evolves, early decisions won’t scale, and shortcuts taken will reveal technical debt. When the time comes to address these problems, one thing you can start doing today to make refactoring tomorrow easier is using encapsulation.</p>



<p>Imagine your application has a <code>User</code> model, and the <code>User</code> can have a role. The role is stored as a column on the model.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># == Schema Information</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Table name: users</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#  id                     :bigint(8)        not null, primary key</span>
<span>#  email                  :string           default(""), not null</span>
<span>#  first_name             :string</span>
<span>#  last_name              :string</span>
<span>#  role                   :string</span>
<span>#  created_at             :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#  updated_at             :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>class</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might have actions in your controller where you check if a user has a specific role. You might decide to directly access the role attribute and compare it with the role you care about:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ItemController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>update</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>role</span> <span>==</span> <span>'admin'</span> <span>||</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>role</span> <span>==</span> <span>'operations'</span>
       <span>update_item</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>:item_id</span><span>])</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While this seems harmless at first, it becomes painful to refactor when you have to extend the relationship so a user can have many roles.</p>

<h2 id="extending-role-to-its-own-model">Extending Role To Its Own Model</h2>

<p>Imagine your product manager asks you to support users having multiple roles. You will have to move the role attribute from the <code>User</code> model to its own model.</p>

<h3 id="models">Models</h3>

<p>The resulting model design might look like the following. The <code>User</code> model now has a <code>has_many</code> relationship through a joining class (<code>UserRole</code>) to a <code>Role</code> model.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># == Schema Information</span>
<span>#</span>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>Instead of checking if a <code>user.role</code> is equal to a role, we’ll now check if a specific role is in the list of roles attached to a user.</p>

<p>When we refactor the <code>ItemController</code> to use these new models and methods, we first want to bring all methods into the <code>User</code> class and then update usages.</p>

Too often their responses are confused, slow, ambivalent, contradictory or downright illiberal.</p><p>Take, for example, St. John’s University in Queens, New York. It <a href="https://www.stjohns.edu/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-provost/policies-procedures-and-reports">advertises</a> “freedom of inquiry.” But earlier this fall, it found a professor <a href="https://www.thefire.org/teaching-history-not-permitted-st-johns-bulldozes-academic-freedom-punishes-professor-for-posing-question-about-columbian-exchange/">guilty</a> of “bias, discrimination, and harassment” for asking his introductory history class if the positives of expanding global trade in the 15th and 16th centuries justified the negatives. The slave trade was part of this phenomenon, so some people judged the question off-limits, and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CE9udVzpYkC/">group</a> of self-declared radicals petitioned to have him fired. Now, adjunct professor Richard Taylor, a former 9/11 first responder, cannot even serve as a guest lecturer about 9/11—<a href="https://www.thefire.org/update-st-johns-limits-academic-freedom-of-history-department-in-ongoing-effort-to-punish-professor-for-asking-question/">he’s barred from teaching</a>.</p><p>Then there’s the case from earlier this year at Babson College. Administrators demonstrated that they understood comedy as poorly as they understood free expression when it came to Professor Asheen Phansey, who made a private, satirical joke on Facebook. He was responding to President Donald Trump’s threat to bomb 52 Iranian locations, including cultural sites. “In retaliation,” Phansey quipped, “Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? …Kardashian residence?” The administrators <a href="https://www.thefire.org/babson-college-abandons-freedom-of-expression-fires-professor-over-facebook-post-criticizing-trump-threat-to-bomb-iran-cultural-sites/">fired</a> him.</p><div><p>College leaders please nobody when they try to please everybody in a cancel campaign. So why try? Instead, why not defend the core enlightenment mission of a college, which the University of Chicago describes as the “discovery, improvement, and dissemination of knowledge”? That language appears in the <a href="http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/pdf/kalverpt.pdf">Kalven Report</a>, which the university commissioned in 1967 to address the tension between open inquiry and activism in a university environment. The report states that “a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures.”</p><p>Living up to these values may be hard but, with sufficient courage, it’s possible. Perhaps the best example of a college president with backbone when faced with an effort to banish a professor comes from 20 years ago, before “cancel culture” was part of our popular lexicon.</p></div><div><p>In December 2000, the renowned poet and University of Alaska Professor Linda McCarriston published a poem called “<a href="https://www.thefire.org/linda-mccarristons-indian-girls-2/">Indian Girls</a>,” about alcoholism and the sexual abuse of children in Native American communities. Students protested, including some in McCarriston’s class. They <a href="https://www.thefire.org/professors-poem-draws-fiery-conflict/">argued</a> that the poem was insulting and stereotyping of Native communities. Then came the investigation. That is, until the university president, Mark R. Hamilton, heard about it. </p><p>Hamilton was a <a href="https://www.alaska.edu/uajourney/presidents/1998-2010-mark-r.-hamilto/">retired U.S. Army major general</a> who brokered peace negotiations in El Salvador and Somalia. He was also an admirer of the First Amendment’s protection for freedom of speech, and knew it was his job as a government official leading a public university system to guarantee that protection. </p></div><p>Besides the “Indian Girls” imbroglio, there was also a controversy around an invited campus speaker, and an open letter from faculty members written to President Bill Clinton against a proposal to drill within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The open letter prompted Alaska’s governor to call Hamilton to complain: What are you going to do about it?</p><p>Responding to all three matters at once, Hamilton wrote an <a href="https://www.thefire.org/president-hamiltons-memo/">open letter of his own</a>. “What I want to make clear and unambiguous is that responses to complaints or demands for action regarding constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech CANNOT BE QUALIFIED,” he wrote. </p><p>“Attempts to assuage anger or to demonstrate concern by qualifying our support for free speech serve to cloud what must be a clear message. Noting that, for example, ‘The University supports the right to free speech, but we intend to check into this matter,’ or ‘The University supports the right of free speech, but I have asked Dean X or Provost Y to investigate the circumstances,’ is unacceptable. There is nothing to ‘check into,’ nothing ‘to investigate.’ ” </p><p>Case closed.</p><p><strong>For years, we at the <a href="http://thefire.org/">Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> (FIRE) </strong>have worked to defend free speech and academic freedom on campus. Two observations we can make are: 1) colleges used to get in front of these controversies faster and more categorically than they do now; and 2) when they do remove the possibility of punishment and assert their values from the beginning, the demands tend to peter out, often quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Qualifying free-speech defenses, we find, only prolongs the fight and emboldens would-be censors. What’s more, leaders at public colleges need to be careful: Investigating protected speech can result in legal liability. As the University of Alaska president Hamilton wrote, when it comes to speech protected by the First Amendment, “There is nothing to ‘check into,’ nothing ‘to investigate.’”</p><p>While rarer, we do see shades of Hamilton’s response from some of today’s more courageous college presidents.&nbsp;Last year, the president of University of the Arts in Philadelphia, David Yager, rejected calls to fire Professor Camille Paglia over her statements surrounding the #MeToo movement and transgender people: “Across our nation it is all too common that opinions expressed that differ from another’s—especially those that are controversial—can spark passion and even outrage, often resulting in calls to suppress that speech,” he wrote <a href="https://www.uarts.edu/node/43674">in a letter</a> to the university community. “That simply cannot be allowed to happen.”&nbsp;</p><p>The would-be censors called his letter “<a href="https://www.change.org/p/uarts-president-david-yager-uarts-support-transgender-students-and-survivors-of-sexual-assault">wildly ignorant</a>.” But the controversy soon fizzled and the demands stopped, much as they did at the University of Alaska. Yager’s letter, like Hamilton’s, left no room for compromise.</p><p>Most recently, the University of Chicago president, Robert Zimmer, wrote a community-wide email of his own, rejecting calls to punish a geophysical sciences professor, Dorian Abbot, for videos he had made critiquing diversity initiatives. A total of 129 students, alumni, and staff wrote <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fCOezNmxmaeVLSirrYp9y2nzy7m9Yr-rgPulwW-eNDw/edit">an open letter</a> to his faculty alleging that Abbot’s videos “threaten the safety and belonging of all underrepresented groups” and “represent an aggressive act towards the research and teaching communities of which Professor Abbot is a member.”&nbsp;</p><div><p>To this, Zimmer <a href="https://president.uchicago.edu/page/statement-faculty-free-expression-and-diversity">wrote</a> to the campus community: “The University does not limit the comments of faculty members, mandate apologies, or impose other disciplinary consequences for such comments, unless there has been a violation of University policy or the law.” (Under normal circumstances, that last clause about “University Policy” might worry us, but Chicago receives <a href="https://www.thefire.org/schools/university-of-chicago/">a “green-light” rating</a> from FIRE, which means it does not maintain any policies that threaten free expression.)</p><p>Sometimes, college leaders—or, more often, those at the center of the controversy—make matters worse by apologizing for hurt feelings. In a perfect world, a heartfelt, genuine apology would settle matters and placate the mob. But during a cancel campaign, apologies tend to be received as confessions that you <em>are</em> a witch deserving of further persecution.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Research backs this up. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-public-policy/article/does-apologizing-work-an-empirical-test-of-the-conventional-wisdom/D34F1D89E6FF6A6E32C22C75F0C5FE24">A 2019 study</a> of whether apologizing works found that “when a prominent figure apologizes for a controversial statement, individuals are either unaffected or become more likely to desire that the individual be punished.” The scholar Cass Sunstein, of Harvard Law School, conducted a similar study and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/opinion/sunday/when-should-a-politician-apologize.html">found</a> that “an apology tended to decrease rather than to increase overall support for those who said or did things that many people consider offensive.”</p><p><strong>So what is the antidote to campus cancel campaigns? </strong>A strong, unequivocal defense of the right to free inquiry and expression <em>after</em> the campaign begins is important. But much of the groundwork for a successful defense begins <em>before</em> the campaign. Here are three vital practices.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stop violating the law</strong>. Public colleges in the United States are bound by the First Amendment, yet <a href="https://www.thefire.org/resources/spotlight/reports/spotlight-on-speech-codes-2021/">85% of them maintain speech codes</a> that restrict speech protected by the Constitution. We have a group of lawyers whose full-time job it is to work collegially with campus administrators to help them fix restrictive speech codes. We are happy to help.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commit and recommit to free speech and inquiry</strong>. Faculty and administrators should seek out opportunities to enshrine protections for free speech and inquiry in campus policy. These policies should be adopted publicly and conspicuously. The <a href="https://www.thefire.org/get-involved/student-network/take-action/adopting-the-chicago-statement/">Chicago Statement</a>—a freedom-of-expression declaration from the University of Chicago in 2014—is one such policy that colleges can easily adopt and adapt, and <a href="https://www.thefire.org/chicago-statement-university-and-faculty-body-support/">78 have already done so</a>. Same goes for the aforementioned <a href="http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/pdf/kalverpt.pdf">Kalven Report</a>. (There’s a reason <a href="https://www.thefire.org/research/publications/student-surveys/2020-college-free-speech-rankings/2020-college-free-speech-rankings-view-rankings/">student survey data</a> finds the University of Chicago to be the number one school for free speech in the country.) </p></li><li><p><strong>Teach students about free speech from day one</strong>. Principles of free speech can run counter to our moral intuitions, and may be taken for granted. But the principles are essential if colleges are to fulfill their core missions. Sadly, few incoming students are aware of these principles and their role in the larger project of human knowledge. Only a handful of colleges teach them in their orientation programming. That is why we joined with New York University’s First Amendment Watch to create <a href="https://www.thefire.org/resources/free-speech-freshman-orientation/">a series of orientation modules and videos</a> that are ready for colleges to use right away.</p></li></ul><p>Fighting cancel culture isn’t easy for campus leaders. It’s a fight that seems to get more challenging every day. But, while the war might be neverending, individual battles can be won. Courageous leaders have shown us a way—it’s up to others to follow it.</p><p><strong>Greg Lukianoff is president and chief executive and Nico Perrino is vice president for the <a href="https://www.thefire.org/">Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> (FIRE). Both are producers of the recently released free-speech documentary, <a href="http://mightyira.com/">Mighty Ira: A Civil Liberties Story</a>.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

I have selected most of the text, and on the right side you can see two copy&amp;paste results. In the upper half is the result directly after scanning, right after the bundled ABBYY FineReader that comes with the iX500 did its magic. In the lower half is the result <strong>after</strong> modifying (removed a blank page) and saving that same PDF in <em>Preview</em>.</p><p>Hard to believe, but that’s <a href="https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/odd-pdf-behavior/21400">not</a> <a href="http://www.documentsnap.com/ocr-text-macos-sierra-preview/">the</a> <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8010687">first</a> time Apple <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/12/21/more-macos-preview-pdf-trouble/">messed this up</a>. Sure, even Apple can’t account for all use cases when changing complex stuff like internal PDF handling. But:</p><ul><li>The iX500 is an insanely popular and common scanner</li><li>I don’t know any OCR software that is more popular than ABBYY FineReader</li><li>macOS used to be the absolute best in class OS for dealing with PDFs by a <strong>long</strong> shot</li><li>IT HAPPENED BEFORE</li></ul><p>I wish Apple was still charging for OS updates, so I could at least refund it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This is such a nasty bug – if you don’t already know to expect it, you will only find out months or possibly years later. I almost missed it this time, because even after modifying and saving the file it’s still not happening. You have to completely close the file and reopen it, only then will you realize that it has been destroyed.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Yes, I blame only Apple for this. I’ll repeat what I told Philipp (noted Apple apologist!) when we argued about this last week after I discovered the problem: ABBYY says they don’t support Big Sur yet, that’s fine. But Apple didn’t tell me that I can’t upgrade to Big Sur when I use ABBYY. I’d be a lot less angry if there was a changelog or release notes <em>from Apple</em> where it says there is a known problem with OCR’ed PDFs in Preview. <em>Their</em> software is broken, <em>they</em> need to tell me. I don’t care if it only worked because they had workarounds for super shitty PDFs that ABBYY possibly produces, I just need my OS to keep working for me. This bug could hit me without even owning a scanner at all – someone sending me a PDF that I then unknowingly break before archiving it. That’s the part I’m mad about. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></div></div>]]>

<p>After nearly 20 years in this business, I've become convinced that everything you need to know about scheduling and project planning is contained in Scott Berkum's <a href="https://scottberkun.com/making-things-happen/">Making Things Happen</a> and this article.</p>

<p>This article joins Richard Gabriel's <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WIB.html">Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big</a> as not just a great article on Lisp, but a model on how to think about the evolution and social stresses on programming languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/low-contrast/">Low-Contrast Text Is Not the Answer</a> by Katie Sherwin </p>
<p>Low-constrast text has been a pox on the internet since the Netscape defaulted to a gray background for all websites. I'm tired of it. I keep this article handy to help me argue my point for people who need something written and official instead of looking at the evidence in front of their eyes.</p>
<p><a href="http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/06/07/forked/">Don't Mix threads and forks</a> by Rachel</p>
<p>Rachel (whose last name I don't know) is a veteran of the silicon valley darlings, and groks systems more than anyone else I've ever read. Her blog posts are succinctly written deep dives into the obscure causes of common bugs. This post on threads and forks is one of the best.</p>

<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/06/12/a-weird-system-call-process-vm-readv/">How to spy on a Ruby program</a> by Julia Evans</p>
<p>Julia Evans' blog is one of the best programming blogs out there.</p>
<p>Most blogs make confident statements of absolute truth. Julia Evans is different, she shows the journey and the questions that guide her. The result is years of slowly watching a novice programmer become a master.</p>
<p>This post is one of her best, and resulted in a open source project of her own.</p>

<![CDATA[Setting up my blog – why I opted for static content over a CMS]]>

December 16, 2020 | https://blog.tietokone.io/setting-up-this-blog/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.tietokone.io/setting-up-this-blog/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>When I decided to start this blog, one of the first decisions I had to make was, what stack should I use to build it? There are basically three different approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build the site from scratch</li>
  <li>Use a CMS (there are many solutions out there, including Drupal, Wix and WordPress)</li>
  <li>Use a static site generator such as Jekyll</li>
</ul>

<p>As a web developer, building the site from scratch would have been no problem, but was it really necessary for something as simple as a blog? Almost certainly not, and as I was keen to get going as quickly as possible, I discarded that solution.</p>

<p>This reduced the choice to one between a CMS and a static site generator.  To make my decision, I considered the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functional support (does it do what I need?)</li>
  <li>Ease and cost of set-up and hosting (how quickly and cheaply can I get going?)</li>
  <li>Framework complexity (how much is going on behind the scenes when the site runs?)</li>
  <li>Performance (how quickly do the pages load?)</li>
</ul>

<p>When evaluating these criteria, it was important to consider my use-case - a simple, static blog that supports a moderated comments section, possibly Google analytics, and not much else. It’s always important to bear in mind what you’re actually trying to do - <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">YAGNI</a> applies here. If I needed to build something more complex, with a shopping cart, badge system and authorisation, for instance, the results would have been different. However, the criteria and general evaluation approach would have remained the same.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>For the evaluation, I decided to compare two representative technologies: WordPress (CMS) and Jekyll (static site generator).</p>

<h3 id="functionality">Functionality</h3>

<p>Both approaches were more than adequate. WordPress was frankly overkill for my use-case, and Jekyll comfortably met my needs.</p>

<p><em>Verdict: draw</em></p>

<h3 id="setup-and-hosting">Setup and hosting</h3>

<p>There are free hosted solutions for both WordPress and Jekyll. A number of companies offer <a href="https://smartblogger.com/free-wordpress-hosting/">free WordPress hosting</a>. Most of them have bandwidth limits of 5-30GB, although WordPress.com offer unlimited bandwidth. The setups are of varying levels of complexity, with WordPress.com offering one of the simplest, albeit with a some bloat that needed to be removed.</p>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is a popular solution for hosting Jekyll, offering 100GB bandwidth. It’s exceptionally easy to set up - I simply forked <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">this example repo</a>, updated the markdown file for the first post, and was on my way, all on my phone. The downside for non-technical people is that you need to be familiar with markdown and GitHub, but for me this was a positive, rather than a negative.</p>

<p><em>Verdict: draw (depends on your preference for WYSIWYG vs. markdown)</em></p>

<h3 id="framework-complexity">Framework complexity</h3>

<p>This one was easy: WordPress is a full-blown CMS backed by a database and a framework to dynamically turn database content into html pages, whereas Jekyll compiles a set of static html and css files. For each request, a WordPress site is simply doing a lot more processing than an equivalent Jekyll-generated site.</p>

<p><em>Verdict: Jekyll</em></p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Since WordPress does a lot more processing per request than a Jekyll-generated site, you’d expect it to be slower. However, in IT, you should never make assumptions without measurement - there could be all sorts of reasons why WordPress sites worked out quicker <em>in practice</em>, such as use of CDNs and caching, better hosting, etc.</p>

<p><em>WebNiyom</em> does an interesting <a href="https://webniyom.com/jekyll-wordpress-speed/">comparison</a> of two self-hosted sites, where Jekyll came out the clear winner (it was around 50% quicker). However, to do a fair comparison, I decided to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed insights</a> to compare sites hosted using two common simple solutions: WordPress.com and GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://tietokonetest.wordpress.com/">recreated the blog</a> on <em>wordpress.com</em>. PageSpeed insights gave it a <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftietokonetest.wordpress.com%2F&amp;tab=mobile">score</a> of <strong>82</strong> for <em>mobile</em> and <strong>94</strong> for <em>desktop</em>. The Jekyll site had a <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.tietokone.io%2F&amp;tab=mobile">perfect score</a> of <strong>100</strong> for both. (Note that each run will give slightly different scores, and this blog will have changed considerably since I did the test.)</p>

<p><em>Verdict: Jekyll</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>An objective evaluation of both approaches led me to the conclusion that Jekyll/GitHub Pages was the best solution <em>for my use-case</em>. For owners of simple, static blogs, I’d strongly recommend eschewing heavy CMS platforms in favour of much more lightweight static site generators. However, the most important thing for me is to evaluate technologies objectively based on my specific use-case, to measure what can be measured (e.g. performance), and to come to a conclusion based on the evidence, not on preconceptions.</p>

<p>In my next post, I’ll be talking about <a href="https://github.com/lukedawilson/tanagra">tanagra.js</a>, my open-source, lightweight Javascript serialiser.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
<p>Arjan Dijk, Google’s former VP of marketing and global executive sponsor of Gayglers (Google’s LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group) said in a 2018 post on <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/adding-lgbtq-friendly-and-transgender-safe-space-attributes-google-my-business/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/adding-lgbtq-friendly-and-transgender-safe-space-attributes-google-my-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google’s blog</a>, announcing a feature allowing businesses to tag whether they were LGBTQ-friendly or provided an LGBTQ safe space, “There’s little that compares to the feeling of walking into a place and being immediately comfortable—your shoulders loosen, your breathing slows, you physically relax, knowing you can be yourself. Finding those spaces has often been hard for the LGBTQ+ community. We want to help celebrate those spaces of belonging and make them easier to find.”</p>



<p>The tech giant, whose mission it is “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” and whose tagline is “Do the right thing,” has fallen short of its professed ideals. Instead, it fiercely protects its advertising customer interests and threat to its advertising revenue, at the expense of its publishing clients, content creators and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656540/googles-youtube-lgbtq-employees-harassment-policies-pride-month" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656540/googles-youtube-lgbtq-employees-harassment-policies-pride-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own LGBTQ employees</a>. With changes to its advertising policies that have disenfranchised various LGBTQ media companies and content creators, in 2019 some of its employees demanded Google do better and stand firm behind its commitment to support the LGBTQ community.</p>



<p>With more than lip service, they wanted Google to show them that it, too, offered a “safe space” – not just when it’s convenient during Pride month. They also wanted Google to affirm that it wouldn’t unfairly silence, censor or discriminate against LGBTQ media companies and content creators and the safe spaces they create. This follows dismay by LGBTQ employees months prior on Google’s initial response to not penalize a right-wing YouTube commentator for his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/05/right-wing-youtuber-hurled-racist-homophobic-taunts-gay-reporter-company-did-nothing/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/05/right-wing-youtuber-hurled-racist-homophobic-taunts-gay-reporter-company-did-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continual homophobic harassment</a> of a gay Vox media journalist and other complaints about how Google handles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual harassment claims</a>. Some 20,000 of its employees internationally walked out in protest.</p>



<p>Admittedly, Google’s discriminatory algorithm and the black box application of its policies hit close to home. <em>Freshfruit</em> had been actively trying to sign up for both Google AdSense and Ad Manager (GAM) accounts for nearly two months, a process that can be approved in a matter of days or weeks. Google’s ad suite, including GAM (its ad serving technology), AdSense (a plug-and-play ad monetization solution) and Ad Exchange (a marketplace with greater publisher controls) are the favored ad products in the market for internet publishers to maintain and grow their advertising business. While previously all of these services operated as separate products on an opt-in basis, Google made the decision in 2018 to <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ads/new-advertising-brands/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.google/technology/ads/new-advertising-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebrand</a> and bundle them. Therefore, in order to get a GAM account, you need to get AdSense first. While Ad Exchange is an add-on feature, it cannot be used without GAM. To partake in any of these services as a new publisher requires an application and meeting <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9335564?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9335564?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google’s strict publisher policies</a>.</p>



<p>Although hard to substantiate in the U.S., Google has roughly <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4023d242ed56/Final_report_1_July_2020_.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4023d242ed56/Final_report_1_July_2020_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90% percent</a> market share among ad serving technology companies in the United Kingdom, which should be roughly the same prevalence in the U.S. Google also has over <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/advertising-networks--9/google-ads-market-share" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/advertising-networks--9/google-ads-market-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">80 percent</a> market share among publisher ad networks between its AdSense and Ad Exchange products, which is how publishers make money outside of their direct advertising business. Given that online media companies primarily rely on ad spend to fund their operating costs, Google is in many ways a requisite partner to have, since over decades it has inserted itself as an intermediary between the publishing community and their direct advertisers with its offer of efficiency and yield management tools. Therefore, the vast majority of the publishing ecosystem, including LGBTQ media businesses, would find it incredibly hard to fund critical journalism without Google. Suffice to say, the inherent irony and ethical concerns shouldn’t be lost on anyone that Google both facilitates the potentiality of free speech and its censorship by acting as an arbiter via its technology and policies.</p>



<p>Over the past two months, <em>Freshfruit</em> had been back and forth with Google’s automated system and human reviewers that had flagged various policy “violations” that were not clear and were up to Google’s interpretation. As requested, we had removed any possible textual references and any images that could be deemed to be explicit, although it is our opinion that none of our content met that criteria or were unlike what you can find on other mainstream media websites. Yet, there were still issues.</p>



<p>Example of potentially flagged content includes “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://freshfruitmag.com/dirty-sex/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://freshfruitmag.com/dirty-sex/" target="_blank"><em>Dirty Sex</em></a>” about the stigmatization of HIV after the AIDS epidemic in contrast to current considerations of the coronavirus disease pandemic, or “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://freshfruitmag.com/blood-work/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://freshfruitmag.com/blood-work/" target="_blank"><em>Blood Work</em></a>” about an artist who uses human blood to protest the FDA ban against gay, bi and transgender men from blood donation. Google’s policy bans keywords that can be categorized as “explicit” and also “shocking content,” such as blood. The most suggestive images we used were of a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG6NY4eHPdm/?igshid=1dp03x47vyptm" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG6NY4eHPdm/?igshid=1dp03x47vyptm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banana covered by a medical face mask</a> for a piece, where three subjects spoke in their words about dating during the pandemic, entitled “<em><a href="https://freshfruitmag.com/love-and-sex-in-the-time-of-corona/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://freshfruitmag.com/love-and-sex-in-the-time-of-corona/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Love and Sex in the Time of Corona</a></em>;” for the same story, an image of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/love-and-hugs-family-and-relationships-three-sexy-men-gm1015470990-273280528" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/love-and-hugs-family-and-relationships-three-sexy-men-gm1015470990-273280528" target="_blank">man’s torso</a> with two sets of hands hugging him; and an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG6Q4TlHzyZ/?igshid=1cy5nu59ppj8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG6Q4TlHzyZ/?igshid=1cy5nu59ppj8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">illustration</a> of two gay men kissing for an advice column about the alarming number of straight women who watch gay porn—a topic also covered by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a44494/girls-who-like-boys-who-like-boys/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a44494/girls-who-like-boys-who-like-boys/" target="_blank"><em>Cosmopolitan</em> magazine</a>. Google’s response was to provide their policy for <em>Freshfruit</em> to review, which we combed through and found ourselves at an impasse. We didn’t see where we were not adhering to their policies and Google didn’t specify what needed to be fixed. Throughout this process, there is no human interaction. If rejected, they offer no appeals process or a way to escalate. Your only option is to post or sift through <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2581949?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2581949?hl=en" target="_blank">community support boards</a> to see how others have dealt with a similar set of circumstances. However, when you are an advertiser, the opposite is true. There are ample resources, a call center, a support team, and dedicated account management if you generate considerable revenue. In fact, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/contact-us/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/contact-us/" target="_blank">they invite you to contact them</a> with your concern and they respond.</p>



<p><em>Freshfruit</em> encountered similar issues on Facebook’s platform as well; where their algorithm blocked our website on Facebook and Instagram (as well as the same torso image), resulting in all of our Facebook content being expunged. Much of this content was already reviewed and approved to run in Facebook Ads Manager, yet its algorithm codified <em>Freshfruit</em> as “spam.” It took nearly one month to address through a circuitous and nebulous process, where a human being was able to observe that there was no issue and restored our content in a matter of minutes. The reason given was that it was a “false positive” flag. Unlike Google, Facebook offered a human escalation point to resolve the matter.</p>



<p>There have been various reports of LGBTQ content creators on YouTube who have faced similar issues, having to do with its algorithm and policies. YouTube and Google are both owned by their parent company, Alphabet Inc. Led by married couple Celso Dulay and Chris Knight, co-founders of <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://glitterbombtv.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://glitterbombtv.com/" target="_blank">GlitterBombTV</a></em>, 12 individual LGBTQ content creators have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g3t7ofhmg3asc9m/%231%20LGBTQ%2B%20v%20Google-YouTube%20complaint%20FILED%20%28case%20%235-19-cv-4749%20%29.pdf?dl=0" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g3t7ofhmg3asc9m/%231%20LGBTQ%2B%20v%20Google-YouTube%20complaint%20FILED%20%28case%20%235-19-cv-4749%20%29.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">sued</a> the technology company for discrimination, alleging that its machine learning algorithm inhibited, outright blocked, or demonetized their publishing or advertising content or caused them financial harm in their ability to generate advertising revenue. The lawsuit alleges that Google’s algorithm and its system of human reviewers discriminated against YouTube channels that incorporated words such as “gay,’ “trans” or “bisexual” in the title. For many this meant that their content was no longer showing up in YouTube’s Explore pages or were not being recommended alongside similar videos by YouTube’s recommendation engine.</p>



<p>The lead plaintiffs in the case had also sought to advertise <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.youtube.com/glitternewsSF" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.youtube.com/glitternewsSF" target="_blank">GNews</a></em>, their new YouTube show – a gay version of E! Network’s <em>Talk Soup</em>. After attempting to build an audience by running ads about their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji6tJcYIYSo&amp;t=3s" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji6tJcYIYSo&amp;t=3s" target="_blank">Christmas ‘holigay’ show</a> and lineup via Google AdWords, their ads were flagged as problematic. After inquiring with Google AdWords’ call center for the fifth time on why their 9th ad had been rejected, which Knight recorded and <em>Freshfruit</em> has listened to, they were told that their content was flagged as “shocking” and violated Google’s policy. The supervisor on the call explained to them that the advertisement, which he himself had reviewed and saw no issue with, did not meet Google’s standards not because of its actual content but because the show was a gay show and considered “sexual,” despite the fact that it was not about sex and had no sexual references.</p>



<p>“Everywhere you went we were running into walls and we were running into these obstacles,” said Dulay. “More than frustrating, it was debilitating to people’s incomes. It was keeping us from reaching our audience. People were now saying they couldn’t find us any longer. Before that, we had a lot of correspondence with people who said that we were a touchstone to the community because they lived in a place where they didn’t have any. So, we were giving them access to information and all this other stuff. So, with that sort of dwindling, we did our own website because we still wanted to keep the show going even though we were having so many issues with YouTube.”</p>



<p>Stephanie Frosch, an LGBTQ+ YouTuber with about 370,000 subscribers who is also affiliated with the suit told <em>Freshfruit</em> that she’s barely making $100 per month down from a high of $23,000 annually in 2009.</p>



<p>“When this first happened,” said Frosch, “I was invited to the YouTube [offices] with several other creators from very niche-specific genres from gaming to parenting to food people from the different facets of YouTube. And we were all voicing our concerns about the new algorithm and how it was …</p></div></div>

Do you have any gadgets on your network that are vulnerable to exploitation? Maybe you have any devices you do not recognize? If you own an IoT-device then you should be curious about how it talks to the Internet and how security is taken care of.</p>
</section><article><section><p>We've all heard the horror stories. Whether it's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/stranger-hacks-baby-monitor-tells-child-i-love-you-n1090046">hacked baby monitors</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/14/retailers-urged-to-withdraw-toys-that-allow-hackers-to-talk-to-children%20">talking toys</a>, <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/surprised-turns-out-consumers-dont-trust-iot-security/%20">consumers and developers seem to agree</a> on one thing; <em>don’t trust your IoT-devices</em>. This article tries to explain common security flaws with IoT-devices and includes a comprehensive "do-it-yourself" guide on how you can minimize the security threat.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the guide, what is an IoT-device and what security concerns should we be aware of?</p>
<h2>IoT-devices in your home</h2>
<p>The Internet of things promises us connected devices in your home talking to each other and the Internet. The connectivity enables your printer, fridge, vacuum cleaning robot or floor-heaters to be automated while you are on-the-go and not at home. Maybe even more efficient home-management. But should we put our trust into the vendor of our IoT coffe-machine that they won't leak our data, won't get hacked and has privacy and GDPR as their core focus? What priorities do these vendors have and how does that affect us?  </p>
<h2>Security concerns</h2>
<p><strong>Default / Weak passwords</strong></p>
<p>"Box fresh" devices often have a default password. If your device has a weak or easy to guess password then it will be susceptible to guessing attacks. Default passwords are <a href="https://www.routerpasswords.com/">easily obtained from the Internet</a></p>
<p><strong>Missing security updates</strong></p>
<p>IoT-devices are often built on pre-existing technologies such as the Linux operating system or using HTTP services such as Apache or NGINX. Over time, flaws are discovered in all software products which should be addressed. Failure to update against known vulnerabilities in supporting software will increase the chances of a remote attacker being able to compromise the device.</p>
<p><strong>Insecure web administration</strong></p>
<p>Some devices offer some form of web application to provision and administer the device. These interfaces are vulnerable to the same risks as enterprise applications or Internet sites. </p>
<p><strong>Use of insecure protocols</strong></p>
<p>An insecure protocol includes (but is not limited to): ftp, telnet, http or SNMP. The protocol is said to be insecure if it employs no transport layer encryption or has known security weaknesses. Those listed all fall into the first category. </p>
<p>It is common to offer administration functions over most of the listed protocols. The impact of using insecure protocols is that an attacker on the same network would be able to conduct a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) exploitation to compromise the device.</p>
<p><strong>Bad configuration</strong></p>
<p>All networked services are potential avenues for an attacker to target your device. A vulnerability assessment of these networked services would uncover known flaws. Most likely your device is powered by an embedded operating system. To gain defence in depth review the operating system for configuration weaknesses such as: processes with elevated privileges, file permissions etc. </p>
<p><strong>Insecure data storage</strong></p>
<p>If your device can store data locally then you need to be aware of the risks of doing so. Are your controls robust enough to prevent trivial retrieval of sensitive information? Do you use some form of encryption to protect data while the device is powered off?</p>
<h2>"Do-it-yourself" security checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Change default passwords:</strong> </p>
<p>Refer to the manual, do an online search, or contact the manufacturer for advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for firmware and system updates:</strong> </p>
<p>Even a brand new device could need a security update. Refer to the manual, do an online search, or contact the manufacturer for advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply updates regularly:</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers patch bugs and flaws on an ongoing basis – and so should you.Sign up for automatic updates or software update alerts when possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set up a guest WiFi network for IoT-devices to connect to:</strong></p>
<p>Isolate your IoT-devices from your home computers to reduce risk to important data. If you need advice, start with an online search for your WiFi router model. Many devices make it easy to set up a guest network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disable Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) functionality:</strong></p>
<p>Some IoT-devices can leave your home firewall vulnerable to attack via UPnP. Unless you specifically need it for an IoT-device, turn off UPnP. An online search can help you find advice for your specific model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google <em>{name of the device}</em> + CVE:</strong></p>
<p>You should see if there exists one or more <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) </a> for your device. If there is, see if the manufacturer of your device has patched the CVE in one of the software updates, or consider sending them an email letting them know. If the CVE is serious, you should consider turning your IoT off until there is a fix available. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for open ports:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/rsperl/321aac3d529aa8f8c7924fd12d581b67">Nmap-cheatsheet</a></p>
<p>First obtain the IP-address of your device. This can be done by looking for "connected devices" on your router or do a network scan with <a href="https://nmap.org/">nmap</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your device expose any ports? </li>
<li>What does that port do? (google port + {port number})</li>
<li>Can you connect to your device through the port? For example through your web browser, ftp client, ssh?</li>
<li>Example of a generic scan for performing host discovery on your subnet:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24</code></p>
<p>Secondly do a full service scan on your device. Grab a cup of coffee, this usually takes some time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example of a specific scan to find printer's open ports on your subnet:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>nmap -p 515,9100 192.168.1.0/24 -oG - | grep open</code></p>
</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em>Major feature changes have successfully pushed Lambda workloads into the mainstream, even if FaaS purists feel betrayed</em></p><p>Is serverless winning?</p><p>If you ask AWS, they’ll say <em>definitely</em>. Nearly half of all new applications built inside Amazon this year are <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/11/30/exclusive-aws-chief-andy-jassy-wakeup-call-cloud-adoption/">running on Lambda</a>. Andy Jassy took time in his re:Invent keynote to call out the thousands of enterprises who now run Lambda workloads in production, but perhaps most interesting was that this year the new serverless feature announcements graduated to Jassy’s keynote — a spot usually reserved for the flashiest, most strategic reveals of the year. AWS, at least, clearly believes that serverless is now one of the primary selling points for its cloud.</p><p>(On the other hand, there’s <a href="https://thenewstack.io/adoption-of-aws-lambda-serverless-stalls/">this odd article</a>, which spends most of its length demonstrating FaaS growth, but ran under the headline “Serverless Adoption Stalls” because … Kubernetes teams say they aren’t using as much Lambda? In other news, cats report eating fewer vegetables.)</p><p>What’s not in debate is that Lambda, still the 900-pound gorilla of FaaS, looks a lot different today than when it went GA in 2015. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestbrazeal/">loud, weird niche of engineers</a> who bought into serverless early have always had <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/1336765475615879181">very specific ideas</a> about what good serverless systems look like … and lately, Lambda’s been rattling their assumptions.</p><h2 id="h-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-serverless-manifesto">The Decline and Fall of The Serverless Manifesto</h2><p>Those original ideals of FaaS purity didn’t just materialize out of thin air. As recently as 2016, AWS serverless leadership was talking up something they called the Serverless Compute Manifesto. This was a radical vision for how Functions-as-a-Service should, uh, function. The manifesto showed up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCOgc3MRUrs">all sorts of talks</a>, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Serverlessconf/status/735839492431548418">at ACG’s ServerlessConf</a>. Here are its key tenets:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2016)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</em></li><li><em>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</em></li><li><em>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</em></li><li><em>Scales per request; Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</em></li><li><em>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</em></li><li><em>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</em></li></ul><p>This manifesto formed a shocking and highly countercultural blueprint for how to build and deploy software. It attracted a small but vibrant community of true believers and a somewhat larger and much louder set of skeptics.&nbsp;</p><p>But in retrospect, the serverless compute manifesto had trouble penetrating beyond that small, engaged nucleus. The bold vision just left out too many existing, legacy workloads and teams.</p><p>So, gradually, like the commandments in Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm, </em>AWS’s non-negotiables of serverless compute began to change. Let’s run through each point of the manifesto and see if Lambda still adheres to it.</p><p><strong>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling?</strong></p><p><em>Sorta, but not strictly. </em>You can deploy multi-function Lambda Layers to manage large binaries, or (now in preview) Lambda Extensions to plug in third-party agents that I’ve been told should definitely not be thought of as “sidecars for Lambda”.</p><p><strong>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>As of re:Invent 2020, Lambda <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/packaging-aws-lambda-functions-as-container-images">now allows you to bring your own containers</a> instead of just shipping a ZIP file of code.</p><p><strong>Permanent storage lives elsewhere?</strong></p><p><em>Not necessarily. </em>Lambda now integrates with EFS, which I guess is technically “elsewhere”, but no more so than any other NFS share attached to a server is “elsewhere”. It’s a persistent filesystem mounted to your compute.</p><p><strong>Scales per request?</strong></p><p><em>Yes!</em> Now that Lambda can run containers, I believe the request model is now the biggest remaining conceptual difference between Lambda and a managed container service like AWS Fargate. Lambda gives you a new execution environment per concurrent request, whereas a Fargate-like service will still process multiple concurrent requests on the same (long-lived) container.</p><p><strong>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>Meet Provisioned Capacity, which trades your cold start problem for a hot cost problem. (I snark, but Provisioned Capacity is way better than running your own Lambda pre-warming job, which a LOT of people used to do.)</p><p><strong>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true – </em>not if you use Provisioned Capacity or EFS, anyway.</p><p><strong>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere?</strong></p><p><em>Ehhhh. </em>This one is about abstracting away availability zones, which a lot of higher-level AWS services besides Lambda (including Fargate!) now do. That said, we’re starting to hear more guidance from AWS that really, the fault domain you need to be thinking about is regions. That’s right: regions are the new availability zones, and savvy Lambda developers are rolling their own (very un-managed) multi-region architectures as we speak.&nbsp;</p><p>To reinforce the trend, let’s check in with two other defining early features of Lambda:</p><p><strong>Intentional time and space constraints?</strong></p><p><em>Less and less true</em>. Function disk sizes, runtime limits, and CPU and memory sizes have steadily increased over the last 5 years. Today you can run a Lambda function for 15 minutes with 10 GB of memory and 6 vCPUs – a hefty enough blob of compute to make you think seriously about multi-threading, multi-purpose functions, and other things that are against the old ideals of FaaS.</p><p><strong>Zero-trust networking?</strong></p><p><em>Only if you want it. </em>In the old days, Lambda architectures biased heavily toward IAM security rather than using VPCs, partly for ideological reasons but also because attaching functions to custom ENIs added tremendous cold start overhead. Today, innovation from AWS has made customer-managed VPCs much more compatible with Lambda.</p><p>So what we have now is an updated manifesto that looks like this:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2020)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><s>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</s></em></li><li><em><s>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</s></em></li><li><em><s>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</s></em></li><li><em>Scales per request; </em><em><s>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</s></em></li><li><em><s>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</s></em></li><li><em><s>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</s></em></li><li><em><s>Intentional time and space constraints</s></em></li><li><em><s>Zero-trust networking</s></em></li></ul><p>I feel like Willy Wonka at the end of the chocolate factory tour, looking around to see where all the children went. Of all those ideological principles, those lines in the sand, <em>per-request scaling is the only thing left.&nbsp;</em></p><p>You can still build according to the original serverless manifesto, of course. But the service doesn’t <em>require </em>you to.</p><p>If you had to distill the revised value prop of Lambda down into a single maxim, <em>Animal Farm-</em>style, what would you even say at this point? “<em>All workloads are managed, but some are more managed than others?</em>“</p><h2 id="h-the-rise-of-serverless-for-everyone">The rise of serverless for everyone</h2><p>This seems like the right time to clarify that I mostly like the additions to Lambda. I think they are necessary and in many cases, an unmixed good.</p><p>I wouldn’t have said that four years ago. I was much more of a FaaS purist at that time. What changed my mind was years of hearing a very particular type of statement from engineering teams, repeated over and over in different variations:</p><p><strong><em>I would love to use Lambda, if only it …</em></strong><em> </em>[connected back to my on-prem VPC, was big enough to run my workload, let me use the same language or developer tooling as my other systems, was always warm, supported some form of shared storage, etc, etc]</p><p>My first reaction to these statements was: Why would you want to use Lambda if you can’t or won’t embrace stateless, containerless, scale-to-zero functions? That’s the whole <em>point </em>of Lambda. It sounded to me like those Kubernetes cats from the New Stack survey, saying they’d really like to eat vegetables if they only contained more meat.</p><p>But I’ve since come to understand that the really powerful part of that statement is the beginning part. It’s a statement of longing.</p><p><em>I’d love to use Lambda, if only …</em></p><p>What is it about Lambda, and serverless compute in general, that inspires this reaction in so many people? Why does a brand-new baby computing paradigm spark such compulsive interest everywhere from tiny startups to big ol’ legacy enterprises?</p><p>Because more than any specific technical detail, serverless computing is an idea. An idea expressed in a simple phrase: <em>Own less, build more. </em>All the serverless doctrine, all the technical guidance boils down to this goal. Lambda is an aspirational lifestyle.</p><p>Lambda, circa 2016, was massively ahead of its time, and to some extent still is. But because of the new feature additions, up to and including container support, it’s making the <em>own less, build more </em>identity more accessible to more builders than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>What AWS is doing is, one by one, taking away the <em>if only</em>s<em>. </em>They’re removing reflexive objections to serverless by providing reassuring options — shared storage, provisioned capacity — for teams that need them. <em>I’d love to use Lambda!</em></p><h2 id="h-guiding-the-future">Guiding the future</h2><p>Will some teams use these features out of confusion or inertia, not realizing that they could build something more radical, more manifesto-like? Yes, and I think this is an area where AWS can do a lot more to help.</p><p>Look, the Lambda console is a mess – you know it, I know it, AWS knows it. It’s got more tacked-on feature creep and incoherent UX paths than a 2001 VCR. And say what you will about infrastructure-as-code, the console is still how people explore new services. It’s how they form feelings about what kind of builders they want to be.</p><p>A console redesign is needed for sure, but not just an arbitrary facelift. We need one that foregrounds the Lambda features that support the original manifesto: code-level programming abstractions, function-level deployments. And then a careful reveal of progressive complexity as you push up against the limits of the manifesto or your own organizational constraints. (Is there such a thing as “regressive complexity”? Because that’s the current console.)</p><p>What you want is for builders to be confronted with the simpler, more managed options every time they start a new …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on society and healthcare systems turned fine fault lines into gaping canyons. Reflecting on <a href="https://omarmetwally.blog/2015/07/03/if-hospitals-were-run-like-startups/">my writings about U.S. hospitals 5 years ago</a>, I asked myself what had changed and what still must change to rebuild a healthcare system that can deliver medical care wherever and whenever it’s needed. What problems were prevalent in the healthcare system before the pandemic, and how did the pandemic highlight these deficiencies? In my day-to-day work as a doctor, what diverts my time and energy away from the most important and fulfilling aspect of doctoring – patient care?</p>



<p>Direct and effective communication with patients is the most important aspect of healthcare, in my view. A doctor working in the community who is licensed and certified has demonstrated a body of knowledge and skills to provide medical care within a certain scope of practice. Someone with a health concern is arguably not seeking the smartest doctor they can find; they want a doctor with whom they can communicate their concerns, understand their health issue, and make a mutually acceptable treatment plan. In daily practice, I feel that 95% of my time and energy are consumed by tasks that do not relate directly to patient care. Even more unfortunate is the fact that these 95% of tasks are the ones by which doctors are evaluated and compensated: clicking through electronic health records (EHR), wrestling with flawed communication systems (such as hospital phones, pagers, texting, and email) to receive and share information with other members of the healthcare team, answering “queries” from hospital administration for the purpose of billing patients and insurance companies, and wasting life-years trying to wrangle health information systems as mandated by hospital administrators and insurance companies.</p>







<p>1. The world wide web</p>



<p>The pandemic pushed the role of “telemedicine” (healthcare rendered by phone or digitally) into the foreground as a way to deliver healthcare efficiently while reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Regrettably the first and biggest problem with healthcare is internet connectivity and how EHR software sends and receives information between a doctor’s phone/computer and the hospital server. Even in the year 2020, reliable, high-speed internet is a scarce resource in the United States. Most Americans have no choice of internet service provider, if they are lucky to even have access to one.  In a time where human resources are stretched thin and inefficiently used, trying to reach a human in the event of a service interruption can easily waste hours if not days waiting on hold or confined to chatbot purgatory. Many doctors now work remotely to a large extent, if not entirely. Reliable, fast internet is prerequisite to being able to deliver good healthcare. This is especially true because of the nature of EHRs, which use “Virtual Machines” and “Remote Desktops” that require a reliable, low-latency, high-speed internet connection. A client that runs at a snail’s speed and frequently disconnects, requiring 10 minutes to repeat the authentication process before dropping the connection again, is severely detrimental to patient care.</p>



<p>2. Electronic Health Records</p>



<p>EHRs are essentially spreadsheets in fancy packaging. They’re not smart in the sense that a phone is smart; they don’t learn, predict, or automate tasks. In fact software that is slow, requires a lot of clicking and non-intuitive behavior, and which wastes a lot of time with authentication and logging in, is not much better than typing text into the simplest text editor and saving it in a rudimentary database. That is the core of a hospital or clinic’s information system: text and media files saved chronologically and accessible to the right people at the right time. I prefer to type or dictate notes freestyle rather than use templates because it’s faster for me, gives me more control over the document, and helps me communicate my assessment and treatment plan more effectively than relying on a template created by someonen else who may conceptualize a diagnostic process and treatment plan much differently than their peers. An ideal EHR to me would simply be typed into a Unix terminal (for a reader unfamiliar with Unix, imagine a black screen with a flashing white cursor) and piped into a hospital server, which would then use the text to help doctors appreciate the clinical Gestalt or “big picture”: what could harm or kill the patient in the next few hours? And beyond the first 12-24 hours, how to safely discharge the patient? As an EHR user, I don’t want a fancy front-end trickling through a lagging virtual machine; I want a simple, low-latency, text-focused interface and a smart backend, in other words, very simple software that looks dumb but is actually smart. </p>



<p>3. Communication</p>



<p>On top of the pressure of having to synthesize a huge amount of dynamic information to make fast and sound decisions about patient care, doctors are inundated and constantly interrupted by communications from other members of the care team. Doctors work closely with nurses, aids, phlebotomists, lab and radiology technicians, doctors from different specialties, clerks, social workers, insurance companies, and hospital administrators. There is a lot of information constantly moving back and forth in real-time between all parties. This flow of information is often like a waterfall rather than a water faucet – the communications are not prioritized and frequently fail to reach the right person at the right time. There are times when a doctor’s attention should be focused entirely on the task at hand, for example when assessing or speaking with a patient at bedside. This is no time to be interrupted with billing queries or non-urgent questions about other patients’ care. A constant stream of unprioritized and unfocused information can make it extremely difficult to focus on the critical 1% of information which can hurt patients if this information is not processed correctly at the right time. In order to hold people accountable for their decisions, they need to be given a fair chance, with tools that work without draining life out of the users. A page or phone call that may or may not find the intended recipient, and a note left in the EHR saying, “tried to call you but you didn’t answer your phone,” is subjective and not constructive without a way for all parties to track communications from their origin to their destination.</p>

<p>In addition to the right tools, there is a need for sound systems. A doctor’s extensive education and training culminates in a highly specialized set of skills and knowledge. Doctors should take pride and joy in their work; they endured long, grueling training out of a desire to help humanity. Out of training, doctors traditionally became their own bosses, working in community hospitals or private clinics, practicing medicine the way they were taught in a style that becomes their own. Nowadays doctors are managed by administrators who are not doctors. There is a reason why healthcare systems look and function the way they do, an evolutionary end-product of decades of legislative, financial, operational, and societal forces exerting themselves on doctors and hospitals. Back in the day, doctors saw their own patients in their own clinic and treated their patients when they were hospitalized too. This is exceptional nowadays. There was no, “I’m your doctor for today,” or “I’m your doctor this shift, until 8pm.” The reality is that this mode of doctoring has become rare. Having experienced the modern-day flavor of corporate medicine in urban areas and the more traditional model in rural areas, I appreciate the pros and cons of both models. “I’m your doctor, period” can be spoken by a doctor lucky enough to escape corporate medicine, but also a doctor prepared to withstand the stress of not having any personal or protected time away from work. Too many talented doctors nowadays burn out after short-lived clinical careers, depriving patients of the care of great doctors who fell victim to the 95% non-clinical burden on top of the already stressful 5% clinical work.</p>



<p>4. More communication</p>



<p>There is a clear line between “outpatient” and “inpatient” medicine in most doctors’ minds, that is, healthcare delivered in a clinic, where a patient goes to an appointment and returns home, compared to a hospital, where a patient stays overnight. Patients don’t think in terms of “inpatient” and “outpatient.” A patient who wakes in the middle of the night with a fever and shortness of breath, or a patient with a growing breast lump, have concerns that needs to be addressed immediately by someone who actually cares. It sounds obvious, but I could not copy and paste this phrase too many times: by someone who actually cares. Not a voice menu, not a chatbot, not “Due to unusually high call volumes…,” and not a tired, under-paid clerk who is poorly equipped to do their job. A doctor has the knowledge to assess whether a problem is urgent or not urgent, concerning or likely harmless. It’s not fair or realistic to expect patients, lacking specialized knowledge, exposed to the vast informational waste littering cyberspace, biased by personal experience and anxiety about a health condition, to make those calls.</p>



<p>“Due to unusually high call volumes…” has become this year’s mantra. Nearly every call I attempt to place to an insurance company, hospital, or clinic is met with this phrase and indefinite wait times, now nine months since the start of the pandemic.  Most negative feedback about doctors and hospitals relates to what goes on beyond the few minutes a doctor spends interacting directly with the patient: a medical assistant having a bad day, a disorganized clinic, the insurance labyrinth, bills…human …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="divbodyholder">  <div id="divbody"> <div> <h3> Entropy loss for reinforcement learning </h3> <p> September 20, 2018 — Chris Foster </p> <p>Reinforcement learning agents are notoriously unstable to train compared to other types of machine learning algorithms. One of the ways that a reinforcement learning algorithm can underperform is by becoming stuck during training on a strategy that is neither a good solution nor the absolute worst solution. We generally refer to this phenomenon as reaching a “local minimum” in the space of game strategies.</p> <!-- Content Breaker --> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima">Local minima</a> under traditional supervised learning occurs when gradient descent finds a parameter set that results in lower error than expected, and the near parameters all result in an increase of error. Although there is a better set of parameters in a different location of the parameter space, gradient descent isn’t able to find it and becomes stuck in the local minimum. Some methods, such as training with momentum, help with this.</p> <p>In reinforcement learning, a similar situation can occur if the agent discovers a strategy that results in a reward that is better than it was receiving when it first started, but very far from a strategy that would result in optimal reward. This might often manifest as the agent deciding to take a single move, over and over. Entropy loss, I believe first discussed in a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.54.3433&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">1991 paper</a>, is an additional loss parameter that can be added to a model to help with local minima in the same way that momentum might and to provide encouragement for the agent to take a variety of moves and explore the set of strategies more.</p> <p>For example, take a game like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">snake</a>. In this environment, the snake must learn to navigate the environment it exists in without crashing into itself or a wall. The agent will have four moves available to it: up, right, down, and left. The agent receives +1 reward for every step it takes successfully and -1 reward for each time it crashes into either a wall or a snake’s tail. We ignore food in this simple example.</p> <p>In this environment, the randomly initialized weights will yield immediate death 1/4 of the time when the snake “moves back” onto its own tail. One of the first things the agent should learn is to avoid doing this. So lets train it and see a few example runs!</p> <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" width="300"> <source src="https://fosterelli.co/file/entropy-loss-for-reinforcement-learning/before.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support this video. </video> <p>It learns this very well! Unfortunately, it learns to avoid its tail by restricting its movement in only one or two directions. By moving in that fashion it does ensure the snake will never go back on its tail, but this strategy is clearly suboptimal as the agent only lasts a short period before crashing into the wall.</p> <p>As the agent progresses learning, its average move distribution will grow closer and closer to predictions where either a single move is guarenteed (<code>[ 1 0 0 0 ]</code>) or two moves are split equally (<code>[ 0.5 0.5 0 0 ]</code>). With a very low or zero probability, it’s unlikely to ever explore moving a different direction when faced with a wall. Because it reaches this local minima state, the agent never learns to understand how to avoid itself or that it must avoid walls.</p> <p>To solve this, we will encourage the agent to vary its moves by adding a new loss parameter based on the entropy of its predicted moves. The equation for entropy here is:</p><p> \[H(x) = -\sum_{i=1}^n {\mathrm{P}(x_i) \log_e \mathrm{P}(x_i)}\] </p><p>At each timestep, we will calculate the entropy of the softmax prediction output from the policy network. When we calculate the training loss at the end of the epoch, we’ll subtract the entropy loss over all of the timesteps from the reward-based policy and value losses.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>beta</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.05</span> <span># Hyperparameter that controls the influence of entropy loss
</span><span>entropy_loss</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>(</span><span>entropy_losses</span><span>).</span><span>sum</span><span>()</span> <span># Sum of H(X) from all steps

</span><span>loss</span><span>.</span><span>backward</span><span>()</span> <span># Standard gradient update
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Intuitively, a lot of predictions such as <code>[ 1 0 0 0 ]</code> are going to have very low entropy, and our entropy loss component will be more positive. This encourages the network to only make strong predictions if it is <em>highly</em> confident in them, that means that the actor critic network will have to have a low enough loss from the policy and value loss parameters to offset the more positive entropy loss sufficiently so that the global loss remains low.</p> <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" width="300"> <source src="https://fosterelli.co/file/entropy-loss-for-reinforcement-learning/after.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support this video. </video> <p>When we train the same network with this new entropy loss component, we get an agent that learns a significantly more diverse strategy and can survive without hitting walls!</p> <p>Entropy loss is a clever and simple mechanism to encourage the agent to explore by providing a loss parameter that teaches the network to avoid very confident predictions. As the distribution of the predictions becomes more spread out, the network will sample those moves more often and learn that they can lead to greater reward.</p> <p>While this is discussed briefly by the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf">Atari deep RL paper</a>, I found that entropy loss can be critical to having effective agents in some circumstances and applies to more than just the network design mentioned in the paper. I couldn’t find much explanaining the intution behind entropy loss, though it pops up in lots of places, so hopefully helps elaborate on a real example of how it can take an agent from “not learning anything” to “solved the game” in some environments.</p>  </div>  </div> </div></div>]]>

December 16, 2020 | https://solitaired.com/killing-our-help-center-improved-customer-satisfaction-and-revenue | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solitaired.com/killing-our-help-center-improved-customer-satisfaction-and-revenue">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/Helpcenter.png"></center>
<p>Being card game geeks, we run <a href="https://solitaired.com/">our solitaire site</a> as a fun hobby. As we gained some users though over the last year and launched a subscription service to generate some side income, we had to make sure we had reasonable customer support. </p>
<p>It was a no brainer to create a help center because we didnâ€™t want to spend time managing customer support tickets, and having a workflow where users could be self-directed and answer questions on their own was ideal. </p>
<h2 id="whenirealizedihatedhelpcenters">When I realized I hated help centers</h2>
<p>I had an issue with one of our service providers, and went to their site to figure out how to solve the problem. For 30 minutes, I hopped around their own help center with no luck finding the answer to my question. </p>
<p>I then started looking for a support line. After digging through various questions and hitting â€œNo, this did not answer my question,â€� I  found  that it was discontinued and the page redirected me back. </p>
<p>Needless to say, I wasnâ€™t happy. </p>
<p>It made me realize that instinctually, I always want to talk to someone. Whether it be over email, the phone, or chat, knowing that I was getting personalized attention would give me comfort and confidence that my issues will be resolved. </p>
<p>I decided then and there: We will get rid of our help center!</p>
<h2 id="removingourhelpcenterandimprovingourcustomersatisfactionscoreby12">Removing our help center and improving our customer satisfaction score by 12%</h2>
<p>We analyzed where users visited most in our help center. We found that three issues dominated 95% of requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>We had launched a subscription service and users wanted to understand how to cancel. Having run subscription businesses in the past, this wasnâ€™t too surprising. </li>
<li>How to report bugs in the game. Invariably, users came across some fringe bugs, especially for our <a href="https://solitaired.com/freecell">Freecell</a>, <a href="https://solitaired.com/klondike-solitaire">Klondike</a>, and <a href="https://solitaired.com/spider">Spider Solitaire</a> games, and wanted to report it. </li>
<li>Requests for more games. </li>
</ol>
<p>Addressing these questions were relatively simple, and we figured we can spend a few minutes a day responding to anything that came in. </p>
<p>We responded on average within two days and found that our customer satisfaction score (CSAT) improved from 65% to 73%. </p>
<h2 id="improvingcustomersatisfactionanother22">Improving customer satisfaction another 22%.</h2>
<p>We hypothesized that response time played a major role in improving customer satisfaction. </p>
<p>For the next week we decided to respond within 24 hours and we found that CSAT improved from 73% to 78%.</p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/24hours.png"></center>
<p>Realizing that response time makes a difference, we promised and communicated on our site that weâ€™d respond within 2 hours during business hours. CAST went up 82%. </p>
<p>We didnâ€™t want to stop, and we decided to add live chat and respond immediately during business hours. CSAT shot up to 89%!</p>
<h2 id="improvingrevenueby11">Improving revenue by 11%</h2>
<p>As we started responding and talking to our customers, we learned that many users would cancel their subscription because they didnâ€™t know how to access certain games, customization features, and due to some unknown bugs. </p>
<p>Operating a help center only gave users instructions on how to cancel, and did not give us an opportunity to understand why and course correct.</p>
<p>When we started understanding all the reasons our users were canceling, we were able to address this, improving our retention. In the first month, this improved our very modest subscription revenue by 11%. If you compound the impact of retention, it will likely be more over time. </p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/Retention.png"></center>
<h2 id="ourcustomersupportsetuptodayandidealsolutions">Our customer support set up today, and ideal solutions</h2>
<p>Because we run the site for fun, itâ€™s difficult for us to commit to a SLA when someone responds. Today, we just have a simple contact us page. We try to get back within a day generally, but sometimes we miss that and sometimes weâ€™re able to respond earlier depending on competing priorities. </p>
<p>This has taught us though that many consumers want to talk to someone and want a response right away. With that said, some people are totally fine skipping the human interaction. We think an ideal set up is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a help center that covers very simple questions, like how to use certain features. On those pages, there should be an option to quickly talk to a customer service agent. </li>
<li>Have a page on cancellation, but have a CTA talk to someone with a quick response. This will help you understand issues for paying customers and address it</li>
<li>Have a chatbot in lieu of a help center with similar works flow described above. However, set it up in a way where users understand they are talking to a bot, and at any point they can talk to someone</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, everyone has resource limitations. If you were to protoize KPIs like revenue, as I imagine you would, find a way to quickly talk to your paying customers or those most likely to pay to support your business goals.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

            <!-- content --><p>At the Intel Memory and Storage Moment 2020, the company is finally unveiling its newest Optane SSD. Dubbed the Intel Optane P5800X, the new PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD utilizes Intel’s next-gen technology to put up impressive if not downright game-changing performance figures.<span id="more-49341"></span></p>
<h2>New Intel Optane P5800X 100 DWPD SSD</h2>
<p>The new Intel Optane P5800X SSD, as we already noted pushes the 100 DWPD barrier. Effectively, it is designed not just as a high-endurance SSD, but it is designed to be an easy-to-integrate write buffer for almost any high-speed write application. Let us get right to the specs of this new PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49345"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=49345" rel="attachment wp-att-49345"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs.jpg" alt="Intel Optane SSD P5800X Key Specs" width="955" height="510" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs.jpg 955w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs-400x214.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs-800x427.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs-696x372.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs-786x420.jpg 786w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49345">Intel Optane SSD P5800X Key Specs</figcaption></figure>
<p>Intel is putting up some absolutely awesome write performance figures here in the 6.2GB/s range while maintaining 7.2GB/s read speeds. With its next-gen Optane media, it is able to hit 1.5M read or write random 4K IOPS. It can do even better in mixed workloads due to PCIe Gen4 being bi-directional so it can go faster than the speed limits of PCIe Gen4 in all read or all write directions when running in the 70/30 usage patterns. These drives are designed for 400GB, 800GB, 1.6TB, and 3.2TB capacities. When One has 3.2TB and a 100 DWPD rating, that means that these drives can be rated at over 2PB/ week of write endurance.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49346" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49346"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=49346" rel="attachment wp-att-49346"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-QoS.jpg" alt="Intel Optane SSD P5800X QoS" width="941" height="467" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-QoS.jpg 941w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-QoS-400x199.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-QoS-800x397.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-QoS-696x345.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-QoS-846x420.jpg 846w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-QoS-324x160.jpg 324w" sizes="(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49346">Intel Optane SSD P5800X QoS</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the big drivers here is that Intel’s cloud customers are looking at how they can have local caches for block storage and provide excellent QoS. The company’s direction is that one can use these high-endurance 400GB drives in smaller quantities to get the level of performance required for 100Gbps networks. As such, although one spends more per GB, using fewer drives and at lower capacities means one can more efficiently deploy resources. That is one of the more interesting marketing pitches for what is likely significantly pricier storage than the company’s TLC NAND offerings.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49344"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=49344" rel="attachment wp-att-49344"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth.jpg" alt="Intel Optane SSD P5800X High IOPS And Bandwidth" width="942" height="499" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth.jpg 942w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth-400x212.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth-800x424.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth-696x369.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth-793x420.jpg 793w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49344">Intel Optane SSD P5800X High IOPS And Bandwidth</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to highlight the latency versus load performance, one can see that the new Optane SSD goes well beyond the older Optane P4800X limited by first-gen technology, PCIe Gen3, and a relatively paltry 60 DWPD rating.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49349" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49349"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=49349" rel="attachment wp-att-49349"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load.jpg" alt="Inte Memory And Storage Moment 2020 Optane P5800X Performance Latency V Load" width="1057" height="612" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load.jpg 1057w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load-400x232.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load-800x463.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load-696x403.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load-725x420.jpg 725w" sizes="(max-width: 1057px) 100vw, 1057px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49349">Intel Memory And Storage Moment 2020 Optane P5800X Performance Latency V Load</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the consistent performance, we would expect, Intel is also showing off the performance per GB. Using the smaller SSD sizes, Intel is able to push the IOPS per GB of storage while maintaining low latency and excellent tail latencies.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49350"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=49350" rel="attachment wp-att-49350"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance.jpg" alt="Intel Memory And Storage Moment 2020 Optane P5800X Performance" width="1054" height="570" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance.jpg 1054w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-400x216.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-800x433.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-696x376.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-777x420.jpg 777w" sizes="(max-width: 1054px) 100vw, 1054px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49350">Intel Memory And Storage Moment 2020 Optane P5800X Performance</figcaption></figure>
<p>Technology is moving forward in a big way as Intel as a company gets behind PCIe Gen4 with Ice Lake Xeons later in 2021.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Yes, these are fast SSDs, and probably will be the fastest storage with decent capacity on the market for some time. Something interesting that we noticed is that Intel is only announcing the U.2 drives on the spec page. Not only is it interesting that the company is using U.2 NVMe here, but it is showing something else not mentioned explicitly. In the last image above, shown as part of the keynote, Intel has what appears to be an E1.S Optane P5800X drive. Since many hyper-scalers have migrated to the newer form factor that we highlighted in pieces such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/facebook-introduces-next-gen-cooper-lake-intel-xeon-platforms/">Facebook Introduces Next-Gen Cooper Lake Intel Xeon Platforms</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/hands-on-with-the-1u-half-petabyte-supermicro-edsff-server/">Hands-on with the 1U Half-Petabyte Supermicro EDSFF Server</a>, it makes sense that we are seeing Intel with next-gen form factor options.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, the P5800X is going to be the SSD to beat for raw performance.</p>

        <h2>Praise</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "I’ve been fortunate enough to be a part of the Google team that helped create Knative and bring Cloud Run
            to market. I’ve watched Cloud Run mature as a product over the years. I’ve onboarded thousands of customers
            and I wrote a framework to help Go developers build Cloud Run applications faster--and even I learned a
            thing or two from this book. What took me three years to learn, Wietse delivers in less than a dozen
            chapters."

        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <p>If you have experience building web applications on traditional infrastructure, this hands-on guide shows you
            how to get started with Cloud Run, a container-based serverless product on Google Cloud.

            Through the course of this book, you'll learn how to deploy several example applications that highlight
            different parts of the serverless stack on Google Cloud. Combining practical examples with fundamentals,
            this book will appeal to developers who are early in their learning journey as well as experienced
            practitioners (<a href="#review">learn what others say about the book</a>).</p>
        
        <h2>Who this Book is For</h2>
        <p>If you build, maintain or deploy web applications, this book is for you. You might go by the title of a
            software engineer, a developer, system administrator, solution architect, or a cloud engineer. I carefully
            balance hands-on demonstrations with deep dives into the fundamentals so that you’ll get value out of it
            whether you’re an aspiring, junior, or experienced developer. </p>

        <p>I tried to stay as programming language agnostic as possible and I use Go for the code listings, because it is easy to read if 
            you haven't worked with it before.</p>

        <h2>Full Chapter Outline</h2>
        <p>Chapter 1 gives a general overview of what a serverless application is, introduces you to Google Cloud and
            their serverless products without going too much in depth. If you are new to Google Cloud, this will be a
            great introduction.</p>
        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp1.png">
        </p>
        <p>Chapter 2 is a hands-on introduction to Cloud Run. I’ll show you how to get started with Google Cloud and
            deploy your first Cloud Run service. While the first part of the chapter focuses on using Cloud Run, in the
            second part I explain the runtime characteristics of Cloud Run and how they influence the way you build your
            application. I’ll also compare Cloud Run with the other serverless runtimes on Google Cloud: App Engine and
            Cloud Functions.</p>

        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp2.png">
        </p>

        <p>In Chapter 3 you’ll find a thorough introduction to application development with containers. In this chapter
            I show you how to run containers on your local machine with Docker, create your own container images (with
            and without Docker), and dive into the fundamentals of containers. </p>

        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp3.png">
        </p>
        <p>The containers on Cloud Run are disposable. This requires you to store data you need to persist beyond the
            lifetime of a single request in a database or another downstream system. In Chapter 4 I dive into the
            managed product Cloud SQL (managed relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL), in Chapter 5 I follow
            up with MemoryStore (Redis). I discuss scalability and reliability, as Cloud Run can scale to 1,000
            containers very fast.</p>

        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp4.png">
        </p>

        <p>Especially if you are building a more serious application, you’ll want to make sure that every Cloud Run
            service in your system only has the permissions to do exactly what it needs to do. In information security,
            this is also known as the principle of least privilege: it helps to reduce the impact of a vulnerability in
            one part of the system. This is why I introduce you to Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Chapter
            6. </p>

        
        <p>Most applications have the need to schedule tasks to be executed later, either immediately after handling an
            HTTP request or at a scheduled time. In Chapter 7 I introduce you to Cloud Tasks when I cover patterns to
            use for task scheduling. </p>
        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp5.png">
        </p>

        <p>In Chapter 8 I’ll show you how to work with Terraform, an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool. Terraform lets
            you recreate your entire project using one command, which proves useful if your application grows beyond
            “Hello World”. If you are still getting started with building applications, you might want to skip this
            chapter and the last two chapters for now, to come back to them later.</p>

        <p>I want to make sure that you have proper visibility over what is going on in your system when you go live for
            end users. This is why I cover structured logging and tracing in Chapter 9. Doing this right is
            fundamentally important when you run a system in production. </p>

        <p>Finally, I move beyond the day-to-day concerns and think about the future in Chapter 10. If you build your
            application on top of a vendor-controlled platform, you should consider portability.</p>

        <h2 id="review">Review</h2>
        <blockquote>This is the most comprehensive, yet approachable guide to getting started with Cloud Run (and its
            vast array of accompanying tools and technologies) that currently exists - no small feat for a technology
            that's seen rapid evolution over the past 12 months. From introducing the concept of containers, to
            discussing the real-world considerations when deploying Cloud Run as part of a microservices-based
            architecture, Wietse has written a book that will appeal to both newcomers to Google Cloud and veteran
            developers alike.
            <br><b>Chris Tippett - Principal Consultant at Servian (UK)</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Wietse Venema's book goes into significant technical depth while also keeping the reader grounded
            with realistic scenarios. I had the opportunity to review it, and look forward to purchasing a copy of my
            own so that I can read it again. Google Cloud Run may be the most interesting compute platform you'll use in
            the years ahead, and this book will help you build up the knowledge you need to successfully use it.
            <br><b>Richard Seroter, Director of Outbound Product Management at Google Cloud</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>What can I say... this guy definitely knows what he's talking about. He is as enthusiastic about the
            subject as most people are about little puppies, and manages to explain it in a way that anyone can
            understand it.
            His diagrams are a strong part of the book. They help you understand topics that can be daunting and
            difficult to comprehend, especially for junior backend developers like myself. Go buy this book, it will
            make your life running in the cloud a whole lot easier!
            <br>
            <b>Femke Buijs - Software Engineer at Mollie</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Get ready for what I believe is going to be the de facto reference book for Google Cloud Run. Wietse
            Venema explores and explains every facet of the product and goes into details of building production-grade
            serverless apps. As a Cloud Run Product Manager, I helped review every chapter for accuracy.
            <br><b>Steren Giannini, Cloud Run Product Manager at Google Cloud</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Wietse has an engaging and personal style that makes this book a pleasure to read. What I like
            especially, is that apart from essential knowledge about Cloud Run, it also contains plenty of anecdotes,
            best practices and useful advice to make you a better application developer. Highly recommended!
            <br><b>Robbert Brak - Principal Software Engineer at 4me</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Developers looking to future proof their career for the next decade will love this book because: #1
            It is a practical, easy to read and concise guide on Cloud Run (the technology that finally closes the gap
            between Serverless and Containers). #2 The author covers a broad set of managed services on Google Cloud
            Platform to help you become productive quickly (even if you're new to GCP). #3 If you're skeptical about
            vendor lock-in, you will appreciate the section on how to take your serverless containers and "move out" of
            the Google Cloud.
            <br><b>Daniel Zivkovic, Solution Architect and Organizer of Serverless Toronto User Group</b>
        </blockquote>

<p>Chuken, a Japanese Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/chukenDr">influencer</a> with over 12,000 followers, promises to teach his fans how to escape poverty — not by learning personal finance hacks or leaning on welfare programs, but by using loyalty points.</p>



<p>Chuken, which means “loyal dog,” calls himself one of Japan’s top-tier point stars, someone well-versed in the complicated art of “point alchemy.” The loyalty rewards he’s accumulated have helped him pay for everything from utility bills and vacations to the occasional trip to the salon. “I’m one of probably up to 100 people in Japan who earn more than 1 million yen [nearly $10,000] a year from points,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Despite being the birthplace of payment technology like the QR code, Japan is still <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fdbdb92c-a6ea-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04">stubbornly addicted</a> to using cash: Around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-boj/nearly-20-of-japan-households-using-e-money-but-cash-still-king-idUSKBN1XS0Q1">80% of people in the country</a> say they choose it over debit cards or payment apps for small purchases. The generous rewards programs that Chuken promotes are a way for digital payment companies to encourage consumer adoption. But the incentives have also given rise to an enthusiastic <em>poikatsu</em>, or “point activities,” subculture that wants to max out as much as possible.</p>



<p>“Considering how cash-dependent Japan is, for mobile payments to take off, there needs to be a change in consumer behavior,” said Celeste Goh, a financial technology analyst at the market intelligence firm S&amp;P Global. That’s where loyalty points enter the picture.</p>



<p>A doctor by day, Chuken, who asked to be identified only by his Twitter alias for privacy reasons, first became interested in rewards programs after experiencing his own financial struggles. He’s one of thousands of physicians at university hospitals in Japan who have gone <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/606/">regularly unpaid</a>, even during the Covid-19 pandemic. At first, Twitter was where he swapped tips with other poikatsu enthusiasts, but the hobby soon evolved into a full-fledged lifestyle.</p>



<p>Chuken is just one of many poikatsu personalities that have emerged on Japanese social media in recent years. The biggest stars produce content a few times a week, and also earn additional income from sponsored posts and YouTube advertisements.</p>



<div><p>On Instagram there’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jojo_secco_point/">Setsuko Kikuhara</a>, or Sekko, who describes herself as a “poikatsu-obsessed woman.” The single mother of a 5-year-old, Sekko caters her content primarily toward other parents. One of her popular hacks is teaching followers how to nab year-long passes to Hong Kong Disneyland. Her extreme point collection even landed her on a popular Japanese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwueZH3NcnU">talk show</a>.</p><p>One of the most successful poikatsu influencers is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ryogakucho/">Ryogakucho</a>, a YouTube creator with more than 600,000 followers who posts step-by-step guides to point hacking. He regularly preaches the gospel of R-Points, a program run by e-commerce giant Rakuten, which rewards consumers for purchases made on its platform. A cartoon lion cheers on subscribers in every video.</p></div>

<div><p>Two years ago, a Japanese think tank <a href="https://www.nira.or.jp/pdf/cashless.pdf#page=15">surveyed 3,000 people in the country, the vast majority of whom said they used rewards points programs at least sometimes</a>. 37% said a major reason they did so was because it was fun. “It’s just like a math problem, game, or sport, but you’re spotting the loopholes of service providers,” said Chuken. “Poikatsu is a hobby that earns you money, rather than loses you money. The better you get, the more it benefits your life.”</p><p>The popularity of poikatsu is in part a result of Japanese consumers’ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-cashless-idUSKBN1XF0BT">notorious</a> resistance to cashless technology. Even as neighboring countries like South Korea and China quickly adopted digital payments, Japan has clung to physical currency, said Arnie Cho, a fintech analyst at the research firm GlobalData. In early 2020, upwards of <a href="https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/">700 million consumers</a> were using mobile payments in China, often relying on WeChat Pay and Alipay’s QR code systems. In Japan, that <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/news/fnn20191214001/the-little-known-story-of-the-birth-of-the-qr-code.html">homegrown technology</a> has rarely been used in fintech, and Chinese tourists have actually <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/smartphone-wielding-chinese-tourists-challenge-cashs-reign-11551609002">helped foster</a> its adoption in the country.</p></div>



<p>International commentators often <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/japan-holdout-asia-cash-free-future/">recycle cultural generalizations </a>to explain Japan’s devotion to cash, but some of the real reasons for the phenomenon may be purely pragmatic. A highly developed banking infrastructure in the country keeps ATMs close, whereas many markets in Southeast Asia are turning to mobile payments to serve the unbanked, said Cho. <a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/d3d72e3f-6cd9-4fef-9f64-15f4aea79d98#:~:text=There%20is%20minimal%20risk%20from,three%20robberies%20per%20100%2C000%20individuals">Low petty-crime rates</a> also allow the average consumer to feel comfortable carrying a wallet full of cash. Fintech services, meanwhile, <em>have</em> needed to combat problems with fraud. In 2019, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/7-eleven-japan-7pay-hackers-passwords-2019-7">over $500,000 was stolen</a> from 7pay, 7-Eleven Japan’s debut in the mobile payment space. Almost three months after it launched, the company shuttered the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rewards programs can be expensive for payment apps, but they’re also a reliable way to convince reluctant consumers to give their services a chance. The social media giant Line has relied heavily on point schemes over the past few years, after struggling to get the majority of Japan’s population who already use its messaging platform onto its digital wallet, Line Pay. “Point rewards are an easy-to-understand way to incentivize users,” said Line Pay spokesperson Mayu Kamioka.</p>



<div><p>Line introduced aggressive rewards campaigns in 2018 and 2019 for Line Pay, shortly after the Japanese government set a goal to increase digital payments to <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/12/03/reference/japan-grudgingly-heads-toward-cashless-society/">40% of all transactions by 2027</a> (it later <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2018/0703_001.html">updated</a> the target to 2025). The strategy included the <a href="https://linecorp.com/ja/pr/news/ja/2020/3151">Line Point Club</a>, a tiered system that rewards users based on the number of purchases they make with Line Pay over a six-month span. The company has also used sporadic <a href="https://linecorp.com/ja/pr/news/ja/2019/2672">“Pay-Toku” campaigns</a>, flash deals that give rebates of up to 20% for Line Pay purchases.</p><p>Line said the incentives are working. In a <a href="https://www.linebiz.com/jp/column/research/20200219/">survey</a> the company’s research arm conducted in February, around 38% of smartphone owners said they used a mobile device to make a payment in brick-and-mortar shops in the past 12 months, an increase from 13% from the year before.</p></div>



<p>Line Pay is competing with over a dozen other payment apps in Japan, including PayPay, a service jointly operated by SoftBank and Yahoo! Japan. PayPay said it <a href="https://about.paypay.ne.jp/pr/20201021/01/">doubled its registered users</a> from 10 million to 20 million in three months last year, as it was relying on short-term cash-back <a href="https://image.paypay.ne.jp/pdf/pr20190204_en.pdf">programs</a>, which cost the company around $94 million (10 billion yen) each to run. As <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/08/03/business/corporate-business/yahoo-japan-line-to-postpone-merger-pandemic/">Line and Yahoo! Japan consider a merger next spring</a>, these competing promotions may end up benefiting both companies.</p>

<p>Japanese media outlets have dubbed ongoing fights between payment apps as the “Cashless Sengoku Period,” a nod to Japan’s warring feudal era dating back to the 1400s. Some influencers take it upon themselves to chart the competing campaigns, like Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/haiji_doctor">Haiji Hakase</a>, who is known for his rewards chart featuring color-coded breakdowns of the 12 major payment services and what they’ll be offering over the next few days. “The best deals have changed so rapidly as poikatsu booms. It’s fun to find the best solutions amid the moving targets,” he said.</p>



<p>Yuzuhiko, a 31-year-old office worker in the southwestern city of Fukuoka, who asked to use only his first name, posts poikatsu vlogs on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgIUiYo9N8nmubnLNV6DBzA/">YouTube channel</a> three times a week. In his videos, he explains the latest digital payment trends while speaking through a 3D-animated avatar of a brown tabby cat in a samurai helmet. “I am the only ‘cashless VTuber,’” he said, referring to “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181002-the-virtual-vloggers-taking-over-youtube">virtual YouTubers</a>” who use computer-generated avatars, a popular genre in Japan.</p>



<p>Yuzuhiko said he’s noticed a big bump in video views this year. In October 2019, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/01/business/tax-rebate-small-retailers-cashless-payments/">a government rebate program</a> began awarding 5% back on some cashless payments, in an effort to boost adoption before the since-postponed 2020 Olympics. The increased popularity may also be due to Covid-19. “Because the pandemic brought financial difficulties to some households, now they might care more about making the most of the available point services,” Yuzuhiko said.</p>



<p>It’s not clear how long the boon in poikatsu content will last. The incentives offered by companies like Line and PayPay are designed to lure new users and could be discontinued once the companies establish a core base of customers. “Now might be the fad season for poikatsu,” said Chuken, “but I’m not sure if this trend will still be around in four to five years.”</p>

                <center><em><p>Making 3D graphics code safer by telling vectors where home is</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Tuesday, December 15, 2020 · 3 min read</h4>
<p>When I took Pat and Matt’s wonderful graphics class CS348B (yay PBRT!), one of
the most frustrating debugging journeys I had was related to interpreting
vectors in the wrong coordinate systems. At the time I’d come up with an idea
to catch such bugs statically, and now, 1.5 years later, I finally have found
time to write down the idea.</p>
<p>Here is the problem: A vector only has “meaning” with respect to a coordinate
system. In graphics, a vector could be in all sorts of coordinate systems:
<em>world space</em>, or <em>object space</em>, or <em>camera space</em>, or <em>screen space</em>, or
<em>normalized device coordinate (NDC) space,</em> or <em>raster space</em> (some of these
are self-explanatory, but see <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Camera_Models/Projective_Camera_Models.html">PBR
§6.1.1-6.2</a>
for definitions). This leads to bugs. If you interpret a “camera-space” vector
as if it were in “world space,” your math will be <em>all wrong!</em>  You need to
apply the affine transformation <code>cameraToWorld</code> before doing any world-space
computation on a camera-space vector. But what if you forget to do that? Your
C++ code will happily compile, but your poor bunny might look like chicken soup
instead… (I learned this the hard way!).</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/pbrt-coordinate-system-diagram.png" alt="some pbrt coordinate systems"></p>
<p>This got me thinking: perhaps a safer <code>Vector3f</code> should know <em>at the type
level</em> what coordinate system it is in. Rather than a <code>Vector3f</code>, perhaps what
we really want is a <code>Vector3f&lt;WorldSpace&gt;</code>. You simply can’t add a
<code>Vector3f&lt;CameraSpace&gt;</code> to a <code>Vector3f&lt;WorldSpace&gt;</code> — that’s a <em>type error!</em>
The compiler <em>makes</em> you call <code>cameraToWorld</code> if you want to do anything with
these two vectors. (All this is very much in the spirit of
<a href="https://github.com/kach/torchsaber">torchsaber</a>, by the way.)</p>
<p>I think there are broadly two ways you might want to implement something like
this. One way is to treat <code>CameraSpace</code> as a purely formal symbol, just a
<em>name</em> or an <em>annotation</em>. The compiler’s job is to check these annotations.
You’d have to explicitly break this abstraction inside the implementation of
<code>cameraToWorld</code>, but from a pedagogical perspective I think that is exactly
what you want.</p>
<p>The other way is for the tag <code>CameraSpace</code> to somehow encode the actual
geometry of what <em>camera space</em> “means.” For example, each vector could also
carry around the <code>Transformation</code> that gets you to its host coordinate system
from <code>WorldSpace</code>. Given this information, the compiler could even be able to
<em>infer</em> the implementation of <code>cameraToWorld</code> for <em>free!</em> Of course, this comes
at a cost, which is that the compiler might not be able to statically check
equality of <code>Transformations</code>, because the matrices might not be materialized
at compile-time.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the rest of this post I’ll quickly literate-ly program option (1) as a proof
of concept. It is short and sweet (at least, as “sweet” as any bit of C++
hacking can be).</p>
<p>First, we define our coordinate system “annotations” as dummy classes.</p>
<pre><code>class Space {};
class WorldSpace : public Space {};
class CameraSpace : public Space {};
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we design a <code>Vec3</code> template class that takes in such a “tag” as a
template parameter (<code>CoordinateSystem</code>), and enforces that the tags are the
same on operations. I’ve implemented the “<code>+</code>“ operator but you can imagine the
rest — there is nothing sneaky going on here! In fact, this is exactly how
one implements a generic <code>Vector3</code> that can be specialized over numeric types
(e.g.  <code>Vector3&lt;float&gt;</code>, <code>Vector3&lt;int&gt;</code>, and so on).</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;class CoordinateSystem&gt;
class Vec3 {
  static_assert(
    std::is_base_of&lt;Space, CoordinateSystem&gt;::value,
    "Vec3 annotation must derive from Space"
  );

public:
  double x, y, z;
  Vec3(double x, double y, double z)
    : x(x), y(y), z(z) {};

  // the '+' operator!
  Vec3&lt;CoordinateSystem&gt; operator+(
    Vec3&lt;CoordinateSystem&gt;&amp; other
  ) {
    return Vec3(
      this-&gt;x + other.x,
      this-&gt;y + other.y,
      this-&gt;z + other.z
    );
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that you need to <code>#include &lt;type_traits&gt;</code> to get <code>std::is_base_of</code>, which
is there just to protect you from trying to make a <code>Vec3&lt;string&gt;</code> or something
else uncouth like that. Completely optional.)</p>
<p>…actually, that’s it! We can already get some mileage out of this. For
example, this should be okay:</p>
<pre><code>Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt; p(0, 0, 0);
Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt; q(1, 1, 1);
auto r = p + q; // ok!
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, this is perhaps <em>not</em> okay:</p>
<pre><code>Vec3&lt;CameraSpace&gt; s(2, 2, 2);
auto t = r + s; // NOT OK!
</code></pre>
<p>And indeed, the compiler complains <em>and</em> gives a helpful error message!</p>
<pre><code>test.cc:40:14: error: no match for 'operator+'
(operand types are 'Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt;'
and 'Vec3&lt;CameraSpace&gt;')
   40 |   auto t = r + s; // NOT OK!
      |            ~ ^ ~
      |            |   |
      |            |   Vec3&lt;CameraSpace&gt;
      |            Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt;
</code></pre><p>Of course! How <em>dare</em> we add a camera-space vector to a world-space vector? We
need to transform <code>s</code> to world-space…</p>
<pre><code>Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt; cameraToWorld(
  Vec3&lt;CameraSpace&gt;&amp; vec
) {
  return Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt;(
    vec.x * 2, vec.y - 4, vec.z + 8 // or whatever
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>…and now <code>g++</code> is happy. :)</p>
<pre><code>auto u = r + cameraToWorld(s); // ok!
</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps this trick will make its way into PBRT someday!</p>

			<h3><span>Introduction</span></h3>
<p><span>When I was starting Akita, my team and I spent a lot of time talking with software developers and security engineers about how to improve data security in modern web applications.</span></p>
<p><span>Almost every time, it came up that a security team’s success depended on their ability to change developer behavior. And that communicating clearly about technical objectives was extremely helpful towards this.</span></p>
<p><span>This led to another question: especially given the popularity of “shifting left” in security, where can more automation help improve communication and align goals? This led Akita to become the API dev tools company we are today.</span></p>
<p><span>In this post, I’ll talk about what it would look like for security tooling to be more aligned with developer interests and workflows and why mapping out the API graph will get us there.</span></p>
<h3><span>What developers want</span></h3>
<p><span>What software engineers need from security teams makes a lot of sense, and is in fact what Snyk has been doing for open-source vulnerabilities, config files, and more:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Getting a prioritized list of issues. </b><span>Both the security teams and software teams told us that instead of knowing </span><i><span>all </span></i><span>possible ways a system can go wrong, getting a smaller set of alerts that are high-priority makes it more likely that any fixes occur.</span></li>
<li><b>Getting an actionable list of issues.</b><span> The easier it is for a developer to know </span><i><span>why</span></i><span> something is happening, for instance why an API is releasing access tokens when it shouldn’t be, the more likely it is that the developer will fix this issue.</span></li>
<li><b>Being informed of issues as soon as possible. </b><span>The longer a bug is in production before being fixed, the more expensive it is to fix: the developer is more likely to have lost context of the original code; the fix is likely to impact the development schedule more; the fix is likely to involve additional actions like scraping logs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It turns out, however, that it gets pretty hard to do this for data security issues including stray passwords and personally identifiable information (PII). We’ll get into this next—</span></p>
<h3><span>Why it’s hard to give developers what they want</span></h3>
<p><span>Let’s walk through a concrete example to illustrate why scanning code, configs, or the network is often not enough when it comes to data security.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s say you’re working on an API that returns information about users. To comply with regulations, you omit user phone numbers from the response to prevent callers of your API from storing this information in a scattered fashion that makes it hard to process service deletion requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, your API might look like:&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><code>type User struct {
&nbsp;&nbsp;ID string `json:”id”`

&nbsp;&nbsp;// Don’t return phone number for regulation reasons!
&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone string `json:”-”`
}

func main() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;...
&nbsp;&nbsp;http.HandleFunc("/users/json", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w.WriteHeader(200)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enc := json.NewEncoder(w)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enc.Encode(myUsers)

&nbsp;&nbsp;})

&nbsp;&nbsp;...
}

</code></pre>
<p><span>One day, your colleague adds a new version of the endpoint that returns YAML instead of JSON because they want to introduce some competition in the data serialization market.&nbsp; A very reasonable implementation of the YAML endpoint produces a PR</span><a href="https://github.com/akitasoftware/akita-change-management-demo/pull/4/files"> <span>like this</span></a><span>:</span></p>
<pre><code> http.HandleFunc("/users/yaml", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/x-yaml")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w.WriteHeader(200)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enc := yaml.NewEncoder(w)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defer enc.Close()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enc.Encode(myUsers)
&nbsp;&nbsp;})</code></pre>
<p><span>A code reviewer without insider knowledge is very likely to gloss over the fact that yaml.Encode(…) does something different than json.Encode. However, when someone actually uses this new endpoint, they get now get users’ phone numbers in the response! 🙊</span></p>

		</div>
	</div><div>
		<div>
			<p><span>There are a few reasons bugs like this one defy existing tooling:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Issues like these are hard to prioritize. </b><span>Whether this change leads to a data leak depends on whether the phone numbers end up somewhere they are not supposed to go, like logs, API responses, or calls to third-party SaaS. This is hard to know without having the bigger picture of how different services are interacting.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Issues resulting from changes like these are often not actionable. </b><span>The data leak that this change causes may not have to do with this service at all, making it difficult to identify the root cause using only tools that scan logs, APIs, and third-party calls.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Issues like these are hard to catch before running the code. </b><span>It takes a careful reviewer to catch that a new string encoding could cause phone numbers to leak. Catching this issue using a linter or static analysis requires either having a rule matching on exactly the change we described, or to flag all changes to string marshalling. The former is unlikely; the latter would produce reports so noisy they would almost definitely get ignored.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As a result, data leaks like this one are often caught in production, long after they have been introduced, without context about what led to them.</span></p>
<h3><span>How the API graph will help</span></h3>
<p><span>At Akita, we believe that mapping the graph of API interactions is the key to improving communication and aligning goals across security and software engineering teams. The API graph will show 1) what endpoints are actually getting called, 2) what data is being sent to those endpoints, and 3) the bigger pictures of how endpoints are interdependent on each other. Being able to capture the API graph allows us not only to get visibility into a system at a particular point in time, but to track changes at fine granularity. Mapping the API graph allows us to identify potential data security issues with high precision by </span><b>giving context to data flows</b><span> and </span><b>allowing us to use that context to detect changes over time</b><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>When we first set out to build the API graph, we wanted something that was 1) blackbox, language-agnostic, and 2) integrated easily with existing systems. Over the last couple of years, we have figured out how to do this by watching API traffic, building dynamic models of API behaviors that we capture as API specs, and connecting the dots on how APIs across a system depend on each other. Check out our </span><a href="https://docs.akita.software/docs?utm_source=2020_12_snyk_post&amp;utm_campaign=2020_testing&amp;utm_medium=snyk"><span>docs here</span></a><span>.</span></p>

						<p>Amazon's Self-Driving Taxi Company, Zoox, has unveiled a self-driving car with no steering wheel that can drive day and night on a single charge. </p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg 1800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>By 2021, Zoox plans to launch an app-based ride-hailing service in cities like San Francisco and Las Vegas. Zoox, once an independent company, was acquired by Amazon in June. </p><p>Today, several of Zoox's quirky-looking mint-green vehicles are already being built at a facility in Fremont, Calif where the factory has the capacity to eventually produce 10,000 to 15,000 units annually. </p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The unveiling of a production car marks a significant step for the company. Zoox's concept car does away with pedals, mirrors, and even the steering wheel. The ride uses cameras, lidars, and other sensors to help it navigate. If needed, Zoox employees can manually operate the vehicles remotely and communicate with passengers in real time.</p><p>“This is really about re-imagining transportation,” said Zoox CEO Aicha Evans on Bloomberg Television. “Not only do we have the capital required, we have the long-term vision.”</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Evans added that the company would also introduce ride-hailing in other countries. Managers didn't tell how much rides will costs, but that the services offered by Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. were "affordable" and competitive. Nor did they say that it wouldn't happen in 2021 when the service would start, but confirmed it. Evans used the Zoox app in a video released on Monday to hail the car outside the Fairmont hotel in San Francisco and spin around the block.</p><p>Zoox is one of the companies competing to put autonomous vehicles on the road. Many retrofitted traditional cars are being tested on public roads, and few are deployed commercially. </p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In October, a completely driver-free taxi service in the suburban Phoenix was introduced by Alphabet Inc. General Motors-backed Cruise is also evaluating autonomous vehicles in San Francisco—recently with no safety drivers behind the wheel—using a Chevy Bolt based electric vehicle fleet.</p><p>While several years have passed since their use, several of the peculiarly mint-green vehicles at the Zoox in Fremont, Calif are still being installed. The factory will produce between 10,000 and 15,000 units a year the managers said. Suppliers submit pre-assembled key components and Zoox then assembles final stages.</p>

<p>There’s this narrative in the Bitcoin community that you may have heard: The government doesn’t care about you and is printing money with no conscience. Preserve your wealth with Bitcoin! Money printers go brrrr! </p>



<p>It makes Bitcoin sound virtuous. </p>



<p>But it’s a sales pitch.</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll talk about how Bitcoin stacks up to gold as a hedge against inflation and why we don’t think wealth preservation is what really motivates most Bitcoin investors.</p>



<p>Table of Contents:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#Why-Bitcoin-Is-Compared-to-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Compared to Gold</a></li><li><a href="#Why-Bitcoin-Is-Better-Than-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Better Than Gold</a></li><li><a href="#The-Store-of-Value-Argument">The “Store of Value” Argument</a></li><li><a href="#Is-Preserving-Wealth-What-People-Really-Care-About">Is Preserving Wealth What People Really Care About?</a></li></ul>



<h2 id="Why-Bitcoin-Is-Compared-to-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Compared to Gold</h2>



<p>People call Bitcoin “digital gold” because both Bitcoin and gold have a limited supply. Unlike fiat/paper currency, which can be printed at the discretion of the government, Bitcoin will only ever have 21 millions coins unless +51% of its miners agree to change the protocol (which is highly unlikely). As for gold, there’s only so much that can be mined out of the earth.</p>



<h2 id="Why-Bitcoin-Is-Better-Than-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Better Than Gold</h2>



<p>Many believe Bitcoin is superior to gold because:</p>



<ol><li>It’s digital so potentially harder to get seized by the government or stolen by a criminal. (Of course, if someone knows you own Bitcoin, they could still threaten you with force or violence to access it). </li><li>It’s easy to send. Anyone with a basic internet connection and some sort of computing device can send/receive Bitcoin. But gold is not because it’s a physical object and a heavy one at that.</li><li>It’s easily verifiable through cryptographic technology.</li><li>It’s infinitely divisible, which of course gold is not. There’s actual a unit of currency called a Satoshi, and 1 Bitcoin equals 100 million Satoshis.</li><li>It is somewhat programmable (though not nearly as advanced as a <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/why-invest-in-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>).</li></ol>



<p>But Bitcoin has some important disadvantages:</p>



<ol><li>It’s not fully private. Because the Bitcoin ledger aka blockchain is open to the public, Bitcoin transactions can reveal information about the senders and recipients. Authorities have taken advantage of this lack of complete anonymity to catch criminals.</li><li>It’s not as widely accepted or trusted: by society, financial institutions, governments, etc.</li><li>It’s very speculative &amp; volatile and has a much shorter a track record.</li></ol>



<h2 id="The-Store-of-Value-Argument">The “Store of Value” Argument</h2>



<p>Because both Bitcoin and gold are scarce, people think Bitcoin can serve the same purpose as gold: act as a better store of value over paper money and hedge against inflation.</p>



<p>You may have heard worries over inflation because of governments printing money to provide financial relief due to Covid-19. Some notable investors, like Raoul Pal and Ray Dalio, have said so, too.</p>



<p>So in the eyes of many Bitcoin enthusiasts, one of the most compelling arguments in support of Bitcoin is the fact that it can preserve wealth from being inflated away.</p>



<p>(NOTE: We know <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-07/paul-tudor-jones-buys-bitcoin-says-he-s-reminded-of-gold-in-70s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Tudor Jones</a> says that a store of value must have purchasing power, trustworthiness, liquidity and portability. But scarcity is what the majority of folks focus on).</p>



<h2 id="Is-Preserving-Wealth-What-People-Really-Care-About">Is Preserving Wealth What People Really Care About?</h2>



<p>Let’s rephrase this question a bit: Let’s say inflation was high at 10% per year. But a total stock market ETF gave a 15% return on the year. Would anyone give a rat’s ass about Bitcoin, if it kept up with inflation but <em>didn’t</em> beat the market?</p>



<p>We think not. Because, let’s be honest, the excitement around Bitcoin <em>as an “investment</em>” is its outstanding returns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people promote Bitcoin, arguing that it is the best inflation hedge. But protecting against inflation is not as important to them as seeing the price of Bitcoin go up. Because Bitcoin is scarce, getting more people to adopt Bitcoin as an inflation hedge drives up the price. So the justification is your wealth preservation. But the motivation is their wealth accumulation.</p>



<p><em>Now, does this detract from Bitcoin as a financial innovation? </em>No.</p>



<p><em>Does this mean Bitcoin does NOT act as a hedge against inflation? </em>No, it can despite other people’s ulterior motives advocating for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Does this stop us <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto Prudes</a> from buying and hodling Bitcoin? </em>Not at all.</p>



<p>We just think it’s important to have clear eyes when betting on Bitcoin because Bitcoin as a “store of value” is not what is truly motivating current investors. The truth is they wanna see Bitcoin beat the pants off all other investments. Otherwise, nobody would really give a shit (us included). </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>
									Welcome to the third interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most interesting founders in technology and commerce - Tobi Lütke, Founder
									and CEO of Shopify. This interview was published on December 16th, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Tobi is one of the most thoughtful and first principles oriented founders I've met and
								this was a fascinating conversation. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Tobi Lütke.</strong></em>
							</p><p>
								Here’s the honest answer: obviously I have a schedule and people helping me manage my
								time, however, I think a lot about where to devote my attention. In this way, there is
								no typical day.

							</p><p>My attention is the most liquid and valuable resource that I have. Even back in the day
								when Shopify went public, I spent a good deal of time pre-selling the various investors.
								During meetings, I would say, “Hey, I'm here, and we've been doing this roadshow, but I
								actually spend a lot of my time on the product.” This was to set expectations because I
								knew I wasn't going to attend very many investor conferences. Fundamentally, my
								attention belonged to the product, not to the sales and marketing of it. </p><p>A day in my life really depends on what's happening. That said, usually I have themes.
								For instance, I have a priority list, and I have decision logs that chronicle all the
								things I am trying to figure out. </p><p>
								These cover different questions. For example, if I had just taken the company over, how
								would I change it? How would I build a company to potentially disrupt Shopify? I try to
								make my calendar match these bigger topics and other urgent priorities. In a way, the
								calendar is nothing more than a strategy. Although it's incredibly easy—and it has
								happened to me quite a lot—to have circumstances dictate the calendar. Because of this,
								there’s this constant tug of war between the actual priorities of the company and the
								kind of things that have to be done.

							</p><p>So, I end up trying to insert themes into my days. Like today, for instance, I have a
								meeting with my small team to begin the week; I reserved my afternoon for product
								reviews—what we call “greenpathing exercises”—where, oddly, I'm trying to discern how
								everyone is thinking about the main things we're working on. I do this because
								oftentimes I feel as though I am the connective tissue combining operations, finance,
								and more formal business functions with the product itself. This connection helps me to
								make good decisions.</p><p>Lastly, on Wednesdays, Shopify doesn't do scheduled meetings. Usually, I have a list of
								memos to read or reactions to record to various mock-ups and so on. This is basically my
								very loosely defined schedule.</p><p>
								<b><i>How do you work with your so-called “expansion pack team” on reallocating your
										portfolio management on time? What does that loop look like?
									</i></b>
							</p><p>
								A lot of this is almost automatic by just having a good color coding system, which is
								really fun.
								<i>[laughs]</i>

							</p><p> At one point, I started complaining about blue weeks where every single time slot was
								taken. And someone said, “Well, if you don't like blue, I can make any color.” And I
								replied, “Well, how about we color based on leverage?” And that’s just what we did. </p><p>
								We ended up labeling my product-related things red, investor/Board of Director-related
								things some kind of teal color, et cetera. And the thing I’m looking for is a balanced
								week; a week where, ideally, I manage to devote about 30% of the time—at least—to the
								product and then as much as possible to things like recruiting, bigger picture projects,
								and one-on-ones.

							</p><p>
								And so, if my calendar becomes too external or too much of anything, it's the first
								thing we see when we sit down for our priorities meeting. This makes scheduling a lot
								easier.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										This is a very natural segue to my next question. One of the theories behind
										this whole set of interviews is diving into the atomic bits of how we spend our
										time in meetings. This time compounds over the long term and has a massive
										effect. What does a good meeting with Tobi look like? Alternatively, what does a
										bad meeting with you look like?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<p>So actually, agendas are not terribly successful with me. I admire how other CEOs I’ve
								spoken with always have a strict agenda where everyone has a speaking slot. I find that
								absolutely fascinating. Even if I really set myself to an agenda and say, “Okay, great,
								this is going to happen,” I can't get through half of a meeting like this. Partly
								because a good meeting is, for me personally, when I learn something.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>..when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
										just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
										incorrect...<em>
									</em></p>
								</blockquote>
							<p>
								I started a company because I love learning. I went into programming because I found it
								fascinating. During meetings, I just love to hear the things that teams have discovered.
								When you're discussing an idea or a decision, I want to know what has been considered.
								To be honest, I find myself more interested in the inputs of an idea than the actual
								decision. I say this because when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
								just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
								incorrect. This is actually something that I have to explain to people that I work with.
								If I like someone's idea, I tend to do the same thing: I try to poke holes in it.
							</p>

							<p>I usually say, “Well, the implication of this choice means you've made the following
								assumptions. What inputs did you use to make these foundational assumptions?”
								Effectively, I'm trying to figure out if an idea is built on solid fundamentals. I find
								that shaky fundamentals tend to be where things often go wrong. The decision being
								discussed could be the perfect decision according to the various assumptions that
								everyone came into the room with. But if those assumptions are faulty, the seemingly
								perfect decision is faulty too. Interestingly, assumptions are rarely mentioned in the
								briefing docs or in the slide deck. Usually, I'm trying to make sure those are rock
								solid. Through this process, I invariably end up learning something completely new about
								a field. That gives me great confidence and comfort both in the decision and the
								direction.</p>

							
							<h2 id="enneagrams"><b>On Enneagrams and Comprehensivists</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>Two words have come up a lot in preparatory conversations: comprehensivist and
										enneagrams. Could you talk about both?

									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>Interesting.</p>
							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								I feel like I'm becoming known for pointing people towards the enneagram. I actually
								don't think it's that valuable on its own. The valuable thing about any of these
								personality-type constructs is that they do a really good job of teaching people that
								other people are very different. That realization is probably one of the biggest growth
								moments for people in general. It tells you that different people play different roles.
								On that note, I do think that, ideally, people should play their own roles really,
								really well.

							</p>
							<p>
								I play the role of challenger, personally. I find that the enneagram helps me remind
								myself that with different people I have to talk about the same things in different
								ways. I think it allows you to skip some time which would otherwise be touch and go at
								the beginning of a relationship and helps build trust better. In short, it enables us to
								have fruitful and effective conversations.
								And comprehensivist, I mean, that's a fancy word.
							</p>
							<p>

								<i>[Laughs]</i> I don't think I've ever used it outside of putting it into my Twitter
								bio when I was reading Buckminster Fuller. That said, I do like range. I find that the
								first 80% of every field is pretty quick to learn—it’s equivalent to the Pareto
								principle—and I think that creativity generally is people using lessons from one field
								in another field in different ways. Because of this, I find learning fascinating.

								</p><blockquote>
									<p>..creativity generally is people using lessons from one field

							<h2 id="decisionmaking"><b>On Time and Attention on Shopify<br></b></h2>
							<p>
								<b><i>
										You try and design how your company spends time and attention. One particular
										incident came up recently which I found really fascinating. You wrote a script
										to delete every recurring meeting at Shopify. Talk about why you did that, and
										what you ended up learning from it.

							</p>


							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								So, going back a little bit further there—you know what, I should talk about books. One
								thing that is interesting is how people have accused Shopify of being a book club thinly
								veiled as a public company.

							</p>
							<p>We tend to read a lot and talk about a lot of books. We read Nassim Taleb’s books and one
								person on my team began talking about Antifragile and gave an outline. He said, “I think
								Nassim is putting a word to the thing that you keep talking about…” </p>

							<p>Now, I come from an engineering perspective. One of my biggest beefs with engineers, in

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="whats-in-this-post">What’s in this post?</h2><p>Enough about the insides of Postgres indexes to impress your coworkers at the coffee machine or recruiters at a job interview 🤓.</p><p>We’ll have a look at B-Tree, Hash, GIN, GiST, BRIN indexes and focus on demystifying them.</p><h2 id="why-the-hell-do-i-even-need-an-index">Why the hell do I even need an index?</h2><p>Indexes are at the core of any querying in relational databases (the classic SQL databases like Postgres or MySQL). Therefore it is very rewarding and important to have an idea of how they work.</p><p>An illustration is worth a thousand words so let’s take an example. Let’s say we have a <code>user</code> table containing 1M million entries (or rows):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span> (
  id   SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name TEXT,
  age  INTEGER
);
</code></pre></div><p>We want to know how many of our users are above 30. We run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Without any extra index, the database would have to go over the 1M entries one by one, look at their age and increment a counter for all the users above 30:</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/scan.png" alt="scan"></p><p>If it feels like an inefficient way of getting the result it’s because it is 💁‍♀️. It would be a slow query (called a “full table scan”, as every row needs to be scanned).</p><p>That’s where indexation comes into play. It will allow us to quickly locate the users we’re interested in, without having to lookup all the rows.</p><p>In Postgres, there are 5 types of indexes:</p><ul><li>B-Trees</li><li>Hashes</li><li>GINs</li><li>GiSTs</li><li>BRINs</li></ul><h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2><h3 id="naming">Naming</h3><ul><li><strong>Row</strong>: An entry in the database (e.g. a user). Also called tuple.</li><li><strong>Column</strong>: An attribute of a row (e.g. the first name of a user).</li><li><strong>Table</strong>: A collection of rows (e.g. a user table).</li><li><strong>TID</strong>: Tuple ID. It’s an internal Postgres ID. It describes where to find the row on the disk.</li><li><strong>Operator</strong>: Reserved keyword representing operations on data (e.g. <code>AND</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>=</code>).</li><li><strong>Statement</strong>: Database operation (e.g. <code>CREATE TABLE user (name TEXT);</code>).</li><li><strong>Query</strong>: Statement that returns data (e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM user;</code>)</li></ul><h3 id="core-assumptions">Core assumptions</h3><ul><li>In general, an index needs to be able to fit in RAM to be fully efficient. That’s why having very large indexes can be problematic.</li><li>Fetching the row behind a <code>tid</code> is easy and relatively cheap to do. We consider it roughly equivalent to getting an element from an array by index (e.g. <code>var a = array[i]</code>).</li><li>We’ll only talk about read operations (queries). How to propagate writes to indexes is a whole other story.</li><li>Everything is more complex and complicated in real life, this post tries to explain things on a very high level and may be approximate on some parts. For more details, one should have a look at the <code>Further explanation</code> links.</li></ul><h2 id="b-tree-indexes">B-Tree indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase">Usecase</h3><p>So we want to index this query. We want to make it faster:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>We create a B-Tree index on the <code>age</code> column.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age);
</code></pre></div><p>No need to specify anything, B-Tree is the default index for Postgres and many other databases including MySQL, Oracle or SQL Server.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h3><p>A binary search tree (<strong>different from a B-Tree</strong>) is a well known data structure where every node of the tree has two children nodes. The values of the left and right children being respectively smaller and larger than their parent’s value.</p><p>A B-Tree is a generalised binary search tree where every node can have more than two children.</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/tree_comparison.png" alt="tree comparison"></p><p>A very helpful property of these trees is that their values are sorted. It makes it easy to lookup values. Exactly what we need to speed up our query!</p><p>Now a B-Tree index is slightly more than just a B-Tree. It is a linked list of tids, sorted by value and linked to a B-Tree.</p><p>Let’s run our query again and see how it looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/btree.png" alt="btree"></p><p>That was much easier! By using the sorting of the tree nodes, we can now quickly find the first user being above 30 and count from there. Remember? The linked list at the bottom is sorted by age!</p><p>As a side note, you may be wondering about multicolumn indexes, like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age, height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way to visualize it is to imagine it as being roughly equivalent to a monocolumn index like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age<span>+</span><span>'-'</span><span>+</span>height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The B-Tree mechanism stays the same, but the values that are being sorted are now for example <code>28-182</code>.</p><p>This explains why the index wouldn’t help with trying to run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>In the tree, values like <code>28-182</code> are not sorted by height. They are sorted by age, and then for every individual age they are sorted by height.</p><p>On the other hand, the index would help us with this query:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>AND</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><h3 id="tldr-too-long-didnt-read">TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read)</h3><ul><li>B-Tree is the default index in many databases.</li><li>Is it so popular because it’s fast, efficient and flexible.</li><li>It makes operations like <code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code> or even <code>LIKE</code> faster.</li><li>A rule of thumb would be: if you need to speed up the above operations, use a B-Tree index unless there is a specific reason not to.</li></ul><h3 id="further-explanation">Further explanation</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/">https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/</a></li><li><a href="https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284">https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284</a></li></ul><h2 id="hash-indexes">Hash indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase-1">Usecase</h3><p>We’re only querying using the <code>=</code> operator and we’re having very specific scaling/performance issues (e.g. our table is huge and a B-Tree would be too large to fit in memory).

</code></pre></div><p>This time, we need to specify it explicitely by adding <code>USING HASH</code> to our statement.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work-1">How does it work</h3><p>Let’s think of our <code>user</code> table as a Java array for one second. We consider the position in the array to be equivalent to a <code>tid</code> in Postgres:</p><p>That’s how we’d naively lookup the users having the name <code>Souleymane Laurence</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java">User<span>[]</span> userTable <span>=</span> <span>{...}</span>

<span>int</span> i<span>;</span>

		foundTids<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is slow because we have to go over all the entries of the table one by one (remember, they could be hundreds of millions in a database).</p><p>Now couldn’t we find a way to remove this big for loop and predict in advance where are our rows going to be located in the array? Yes! And it’s called a <strong>hash function</strong>.</p><p>A hash function is capable of taking any input and translating it into a smaller subset of values:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>// Returns an int between 0 and 256.

<span>-&gt;</span> 147

List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;[]</span> hashIndex <span>=</span> <span>new</span> List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;[</span>256<span>];</span> <span>// 256 hash values

</code></pre></div><p>We just created our own hash index. Let’s now run our query again:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>// Our new index.

There have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-with-the-apple-m1-a-seriously-fast-x86-competitor/">several</a> <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Apple-M1-Chip-Everything-We-Know">impressive</a> <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/12/13/arm-macbook-vs-intel-macbook-a-simd-benchmark/">benchmarks</a> around its performance relative to its Intel-based predecessors, but we were interested in putting it through its paces on a machine learning (and, specifically, a computer vision) workload.</p><p>While Apple <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/11/accelerating-tensorflow-performance-on-mac.html">announced support for TensorFlow</a> training on the M1, the toolchain isn't quite ready yet. With some effort, we were able to <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks-on-a-mac-m1/">get Jupyter notebooks running on Apple Silicon</a>, for example, but the <a href="https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos">pre-release version of TensorFlow for Mac</a> wasn't ready for primetime just yet (notably SciPy is not yet compatible with the M1 which is required for <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/train-a-tensorflow2-object-detection-model/">TensorFlow's Object Detection API</a>).</p><p>Instead, we used <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/createml">Apple's CreateML</a> to perform our benchmarks. This should be a fair comparison of the relative performance you will be able to expect for training machine learning models once the compatibility quirks are eventually sorted out in a few months. <em>(Presumably, Apple has already done the work in optimizing CreateML for both for their Intel and M1 devices.)</em></p><p>Unfortunately, since CreateML is not compatible with NVIDIA chips, it still doesn't give us a good head-to-head comparison between the new M1 and the 3090 or 2080ti for example (Apple claims 11 trillion operations per second on the M1's neural engine vs. NVIDIA's claim of 14.2 TOPS on the 2080ti).</p><p>As you decide whether or not to purchase the new M1 laptop – <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/macbook-m1-december-sales">which just got a "surprise price cut"</a> – we set out to estimate how well the Apple M1 laptop performs against their previous generation machines' Intel CPUs and AMD Radeon GPUs. Is it worth it?</p><blockquote>TL;DR: if you're looking to tackle machine learning and computer vision problems on your Mac, the Apple M1 may be worth the upgrade once the software you require is compatible but it's not yet ready to replace a discrete GPU.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/unpackaging-macbook.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Unboxing my new MacBook M1.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-test-machines">The Test Machines</h2><p>We used three recent MacBook Pro machines to do our comparison:</p><ul><li>MacBook Pro 13-inch (November 2020) M1 integrated system on a chip with 8GB memory. $1,499</li><li>MacBook Pro 13-inch (May 2020) 1.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 with 16GB memory and Intel Iris Plus Graphics 645 (1536MB graphics memory). $1,699</li><li>MacBook Pro 16-inch (2019) 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 64GB memory and AMD Radeon Pro 5500M (8GB graphics memory). $3,899</li></ul><h2 id="test-methodology">Test Methodology</h2><p>To compare performance, we used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml/">Create ML</a> to tackle a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBn7Cd8Z8yE">no code object recognition</a> problem.

However, 5,000 iterations is enough for us to get a good sense of how the two systems perform against each other.</p><p>On this object detection task in Create ML, <strong>the 13" Apple M1-powered Macbook Pro performed significantly better than the 13" Intel Core i5 but underperformed the 15" i9 with its discrete Radeon Pro 5500M GPU</strong>.</p><ul><li>The Intel Core i5 took 542 minutes to run through 5,000 iterations (CPU training).</li><li>The Apple M1 took 149 minutes &nbsp;to do the same (8% GPU utilization).</li><li>The Intel Core i9 with Radeon Pro took 70 minutes (100% GPU utilization).</li></ul><p>Notably, training was unable to take advantage of the integrated Intel Iris graphics card to accelerate training but it was able to partially utilize the integrated graphics card on the M1.

Despite being faster on paper, it still needs more software improvements to capitalize on its hardware.

It should eventually be able to fully utilize its GPU during just like the i9 was. At which point it would likely handily outperform it.</p><p>There are plenty of things to consider when purchasing a new laptop; fitting an object detection model with Create ML is only one. But when pitting these two laptops purchased in 2020 against each other on this task, the Apple M1 appears to be a promising architecture that should be superior as the software is updated to take advantage of it. But, for now, I plan to hold off while things are ironed out.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBn7Cd8Z8yE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>Go through the whole process of training and deploying a CreateML model to your iPhone via <a href="https://bit.ly/rf-yt-sub">our YouTube</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>

  <p><img alt="DeskPi Pro Raspberry Pi case" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/deskpi.jpg"></p>

<p>Despite having worked on a <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2006/03/more-amstrad-e3-joy.html">number</a> <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2006/10/progress-with-the-balloon.html">of</a> <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/01/mapleboard.html">ARM</a> <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2020/09/rb3011-mainline.html">platforms</a> I’ve never actually had an ARM based development box at home. I have a Raspberry Pi B Classic (the original 256MB rev 0002 variant) a coworker gave me some years ago, but it’s not what you’d choose for a build machine and generally gets used as a self contained TFTP/console server for hooking up to devices under test. Mostly I’ve been able to do kernel development with the cross compilers already built as part of Debian, and either use pre-built images or Debian directly when I need userland pieces. At a previous job I had a <a href="http://macchiatobin.net/">Marvell MACCHIATObin</a> available to me, which works out as a nice platform - quad core A72 @ 2GHz with 16GB RAM, proper SATA and a PCIe slot. However they’re still a bit pricey for a casual home machine. I really like the look of the <a href="https://www.solid-run.com/arm-servers-networking-platforms/honeycomb-workstation/">HoneyComb LX2</a> - 16 A72 cores, up to 64GB RAM - but it’s even more expensive.</p>

<p>So when I saw the existence of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/8gb-raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-at-75/">8GB Raspberry Pi 4</a> I was interested. Firstly, the Pi 4 is a proper 64 bit device (my existing Pi B is ARMv6 which means it needs to run Raspbian instead of native Debian armhf), capable of running an upstream kernel and unmodified Debian userspace. Secondly the Pi 4 has a USB 3 controller sitting on a PCIe bus rather than just the limited SoC USB 2 controller. It’s not SATA, but it’s still a fairly decent method of attaching some storage that’s faster/more reliable than an SD card. Finally 8GB RAM is starting to get to a decent amount - for a headless build box 4GB is probably generally enough, but I wanted some headroom.</p>

<p>The Pi comes as a bare board, so I needed a case. Ideally I wanted something self contained that could take the Pi, provide a USB/SATA adaptor and take the drive too. I came across the pre-order for the <a href="https://deskpi.com/products/deskpi-pro-for-raspberry-pi-4">DeskPi Pro</a>, decided it was the sort of thing I was after, and ordered one towards the end of September. It finally arrived at the start of December, at which point I got round to ordering a Pi 4 from <a href="https://cpc.farnell.com/">CPC</a>.</p>

<p>Total cost ~ £120 for the case + Pi.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>First, let’s get the bad parts out of the way.</p>

<p><img alt="Broken USB port (right)" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/deskpi-broken-usb.jpg"></p>

<p>I managed to break a USB port on the Desk Pi. It has a pair of forward facing ports, I plugged my wireless keyboard dongle into it and when trying to remove it the solid spacer bit in the socket broke off. I’ve never had this happen to me before and I’ve been using USB devices for 20 years, so I’m putting the blame on a shoddy socket.</p>

<p>The first drive I tried was an old Crucial M500 mSATA device. I have an adaptor that makes it look like a normal 2.5” drive so I used that. Unfortunately it resulted in a boot loop; the Pi would boot its initial firmware, try to talk to the drive and then reboot before even loading Linux. The DeskPi Pro comes with an m2 adaptor and I had a spare m2 drive, so I tried that and it all worked fine. This might just be power issues, but it was an unfortunate experience especially after the USB port had broken off.</p>

<p>(Given I ended up using an M.2 drive another case option would have been the <a href="https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-m-2-case-for-raspberry-pi-4.html">Argon ONE M.2</a>, which is a bit more compact.)</p>

<h2 id="the-annoying">The Annoying</h2>

<p><img alt="DeskPi Pro without rear bezel" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/deskpi-open.jpg"></p>

<p>The case is a little snug; I was worried I was going to damage things as I slid it in. Additionally the construction process is a little involved. There’s a good set of instructions, but there are a lot of pieces and screws involved. This includes a couple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_flat_cable">FFC cables</a> to join things up. I think this is because they’ve attempted to make a compact case rather than allowing a little extra room, and it does have the advantage that once assembled it feels robust without anything loose in it.</p>

<p><img alt="DeskPi Pro with rear bezel and USB3 dongle" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/deskpi-rear.jpg"></p>

<p>I hate the need for an external USB3 dongle to bridge from the Pi to the USB/SATA adaptor. All the cases I’ve seen with an internal drive bay have to do this, because the USB3 isn’t brought out internally by the Pi, but it just looks ugly to me. It’s hidden at the back, but meh.</p>

<p>Fan control is via a USB/serial device, which is fine, but it attaches to the USB C power port which defaults to being a USB peripheral. Raspbian based kernels support device tree overlays which allows easy reconfiguration to host mode, but for a Debian based system I ended up rolling my own dtb file. I changed</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include "bcm283x-rpi-usb-peripheral.dtsi"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include "bcm283x-rpi-usb-host.dtsi"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in <code>arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts</code> and then I did:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cpp -nostdinc -I include -I arch -undef -x assembler-with-cpp \
    arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts &gt; rpi4.preprocessed
dtc -I dts -O dtb rpi4.preprocessed -o bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the resulting <code>bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb</code> file replaced the one in <code>/boot/firmware</code>. This isn’t a necessary step if you don’t want to use the cooling fan in the case, or the front USB ports, and it’s not really anyone’s fault, but it was an annoying extra step to have to figure out.</p>

<p>The DeskPi came with a microSD card that was supposed to have RaspiOS already on it. It didn’t, it was blank. In my case that was fine, because I wanted to use Debian, but it was a minor niggle.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>I used Gunnar’s <a href="https://raspi.debian.net/">pre-built Pi Debian image</a> and it Just Worked; I dd’d it to the microSD as instructed and the Pi 4 came up with working wifi, video and USB enabling me to get it configured for my network. I did an <code>apt upgrade</code> and got updated to the Buster 10.7 release, as well as the latest 5.9 backport kernel, and everything came back without effort after a reboot. It’s lovely to be able to run Debian on this device without having to futz around with self-compiled kernels.</p>

<p>The DeskPi makes a lot of effort to route things externally. The SD slot is brought out to the front, making it easy to fiddle with the card contents without having to open the case to replace it. All the important ports are brought out to the back either through orientation of the Pi, or extenders in the case. That means the built in Pi USB ports, the HDMI sockets (conveniently converted to full size internally), an audio jack and a USB-C power port. The aforementioned USB3 dongle for the bridge to the drive is the only external thing that’s annoying.</p>

<p>Thermally things seem good too. I haven’t done a full torture test yet, but with the fan off the system is sitting at about 40°C while fairly idle. Some loops in bash that push load up to above 2 get the temperature up to 46°C or so, and turning the fan on brings it down to 40°C again. It’s audible, but quieter than my laptop and not annoying.</p>

<p>I liked the way the case came with everything I needed other than the Pi 4 and a suitable disk drive. There was an included PSU (a proper USB-C PD device, UK plug), the heatsink/fan is there, the USB/SATA converter is there and even an SD card is provided (though that’s just because I had a pre-order).</p>

<p>Speaking of the SD, I only needed it for initial setup. Recent Pi 4 bootloaders are capable of booting directly from USB mass storage devices. So I upgraded using the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/releases/tag/v2020.09.03-138a1">RPi EEPROM Recovery image</a> (which just needs extracted to the SD FAT partition, no need for anything complicated - boot with it and the screen goes all green and you know it’s ok), then created a FAT partition at the start of the drive for the kernel / bootloader config and a regular EXT4 partition for root. Copies everything over, updated paths, took out the SD and it all just works happily.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>My main complaint is the broken USB port, which feels like the result of a cheap connector. For a front facing port expected to see more use than the rear ports I think there’s a reasonable expectation of robustness. However I’m an early adopter and maybe future runs will be better.</p>

<p>Other than that I’m pretty happy. The case is exactly the sort of thing I wanted; I was looking for something that would turn the Pi into a box that can sit on my desk on the network and that I don’t have to worry about knocking wires out of or lots of cables hooking bits up. Everything being included made it very convenient to get up and running. I still haven’t poked the Pi that hard, but first impressions are looking good for it being a trouble free ARM64 dev box in the corner, until I can justify a HoneyComb.</p>

<p>First we’ll give you an <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/overview">overview</a> of Kubernetes, discuss what it means to <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/secure-cluster-looks-like">secure a
cluster</a>, and talk about the end
goal here.</p>

<p>We’ll list a number of <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/tooling-up">solid tools</a> to get you
started, which will be used throughout this guide.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-your-environment">Understanding Your Environment</h3>

<p>You need to <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/understanding-your-environment">understand your environment</a> before you can secure it, so we start
there. We’ll quickly dive in to ways that you can collect information, and which information is relevant in the big picture.</p>

<p>We want to see what your cluster looks like, how you’re <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/how-deploying">deploying it</a> (managed vs self-hosted), what’s running
<a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/whats-running-in-cluster">inside</a> and <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/whats-running-nearby-cluster">nearby</a>, and what services are at risk of being compromised throughout the cluster’s lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-your-risk">Understanding Your Risk</h3>

<p>With all this information we will run through a simple risk analysis that helps us determine how likely an exploit would occur and determine how your cluster will hold up. Finally building
an overall risk baseline for the environment.</p>

<p>We’ll examine:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/understanding-your-risk">Access controls</a>: who can deploy and how are workloads being deployed?</li>
  <li>Which <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/services-exposed">services are exposed</a> publicly or internally?</li>
  <li>Do we have visibility into the cluster, and is our <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/how-vulnerable-is-cluster">cluster vulnerable</a> due to configuration mistakes or networking-related vulnerabilities?</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll conclude by discussing <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/common-compromise-scenarios">common compromise
scenarios</a>: a pod being
compromised, a developer compromising a cluster, and a developer being
compromised by an attacker. And some stories of what I’ve seen in the real world
during my consulting work, for good measure 😎</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>In the end, we’ll <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/putting-it-together">put it all together</a>,
and you will hopefully have enough information to get started reviewing your
cluster environment to identify gaps, vulnerabilities, and just questionable
areas that will need further inspection.</p>

<p>Once you have a risk assessment complete, it’ll be your job to continue onto the
risk management phase and find out what mitigations will best fit in to address
all the issues you found.</p>

<p>And of course, we conclude with a variety of <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/further-reading">further
resources</a> on Kubernetes threat modeling,
additional tools, and some of our favorite conference talks.</p>



<p>My name is Mark Manning and I’m currently a security architect at <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>. I’ve spent years as a security consultant for a global security consulting firm where I assessed, reviewed, attacked, and sometimes, helped fix problems on a wide range of Kubernetes projects (among other types of projects). I was excited for the opportunity to collaborate with <em>tl;dr sec</em> and write about a topic I’ve dealt with repeatedly over the last 4 years, Kubernetes risk.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with customers just getting started with Kubernetes, cloud providers deploying their own Kubernetes platforms, and large organizations that have invested much of their business into embracing the “digital transformation.”</p>

<p>Today I’m working with Snowflake by focusing some of my experiences and offensive skills towards helping solve some really interesting security challenges. Part of that is Risk Management of Kubernetes clusters at scale.</p>

<p>I’ve seen how things can go right, and wrong, in the real world, in a vast variety of companies. While I don’t have all the answers, I enjoy sharing what I do know with the public, and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/antitree">on Twitter</a> or at <a href="https://www.shmoocon.org/speakers/#kubectl">hacker conferences</a>.</p>

<p>My hope is that some of us will continue to work heavily on Kubernetes security so that even if we don’t fix everything, the rest of the infosec industry can level-up to meet the challenges of securing these modern platforms.</p>

It's yet another <em>soft rule</em> to consider for having more self-descriptive JavaScript variables.</p><h2 id="javascript-naming-conventions-class"><a href="#javascript-naming-conventions-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="javascript naming conventions class permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>JavaScript Naming Conventions: Class</h2><p>A JavaScript class is declared with a PascalCase in contrast to other JavaScript data structures:</p><pre><pre><p><span>class</span><span> </span><span>SoftwareDeveloper</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>firstName</span><span>,</span><span> lastName</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>firstName </span><span>=</span><span> firstName</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>lastName </span><span>=</span><span> lastName</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>var</span><span> me </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>SoftwareDeveloper</span><span>(</span><span>'Robin'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Wieruch'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Every time a JavaScript constructor is called to instantiate a new instance of a class, the name of the class should appear in Pascal Case, because the class has been declared with Pascal Case in the first place.</p><h2 id="javascript-naming-conventions-component"><a href="#javascript-naming-conventions-component" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="javascript naming conventions component permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>JavaScript Naming Conventions: Component</h2><p>Components are not everywhere in JavaScript, but commonly found in frontend frameworks like <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-fundamentals-react-requirements/">React</a>.

Naming Conventions: Private</h2><p>Rarely you will find an underscore (_) in front of a variable/function/method in JavaScript. If you see one, it is <em>intended</em> to be <em>private</em>. Even though it cannot be really enforced by JavaScript, declaring something as private tells us about how it should be used or how it should not be used.</p><p>For instance, a private method in a class should only be used internally by the class, but should be avoided to be used on the instance of the class:</p><pre><pre><p><span>class</span><span> </span><span>SoftwareDeveloper</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>firstName</span><span>,</span><span> lastName</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>firstName </span><span>=</span><span> firstName</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>lastName </span><span>=</span><span> lastName</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>_getName</span><span>(</span><span>firstName</span><span>,</span><span> lastName</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>_getName</span><span>(</span><span>firstName</span><span>,</span><span> lastName</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>${</span><span>firstName</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>${</span><span>lastName</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>var</span><span> me </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>SoftwareDeveloper</span><span>(</span><span>'Robin'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Wieruch'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>var</span><span> name </span><span>=</span><span> me</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> me</span><span>.</span><span>_getName</span><span>(</span><span>me</span><span>.</span><span>firstName</span><span>,</span><span> me</span><span>.</span><span>lastName</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>A private variable/function can occur in a JavaScript file as well.

As hinted before, no one enforces one to not change the variable here, except a <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/const-let-var">const declaration of the variable for primitive data structures</a>, but it's capitalized naming suggests avoiding it.</p><h2 id="javascript-naming-conventions-global-variable"><a href="#javascript-naming-conventions-global-variable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="javascript naming conventions global variable permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>JavaScript Naming Conventions: Global Variable</h2><p>A JavaScript variable is globally defined, if all its context has access to it. Often the context is defined by the JavaScript file where the variable is declared/defined in, but in smaller JavaScript projects it may be the entire project. There are no special naming conventions for global JavaScript variables.</p><ul><li>A global JavaScript variable is declared at the top of a project/file.</li><li>A global JavaScript variable is written in camelCase if it is mutable.</li><li>A global JavaScript variable is written in UPPERCASE if it is immutable.</li></ul><h2 id="javascript-naming-conventions-underscore"><a href="#javascript-naming-conventions-underscore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="javascript naming conventions underscore permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>JavaScript Naming Conventions: Underscore</h2><p>So what about the underscore and dash in JavaScript variable namings? Since camelCase and PascalCase are primarily considered in JS, you have seen that the underscore is only rarely used for private variables or constants.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
      

      

      

      


      <p>There's a well-known quote by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>:
        "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I like it because it doesn't
        attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get
        you 90% of the way there 90% of the time. Wikipedia describes the book the quote
        is from (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He explains...the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western
          framework through which we intellectualize the value of food <strong>is more a religious
and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and
reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That...sounds familiar.</p>
      <h2 id="write-code">Write code </h2>
      <p>Code, like food, has value. I think those of us who write it can (hopefully)
        agree on that. Some, though, are so afraid of writing/eating
        <em>too much</em> that they avoid writing/eating what they should.</p>
      <p>In the context of programming, I think this translates to an unhealthy fear
        (again, for some) of duplication. A little bit of duplication - writing
        something in a way that doesn't completely maximize conciseness - isn't the end
        of the world. Sometimes it's the best path forward. Sometimes it's okay to
        copy-and-modify here and there, especially when you're still figuring out what
        your application will end up being.</p>
      <h2 id="not-too-much">Not too much </h2>
      <p>Of course too much code, like too much food, can also be a bad thing. This is
        a well-trodden topic so I don't feel the need to go too far into it here.</p>
      <p>Just be aware of your project's "appetite": write what needs to be written,
        and then try not to over-indulge.</p>
      <h2 id="mostly-functions">Mostly functions </h2>
      <p>By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure
        functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel
        that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional
        subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly
        always a win for the long-term health of the project.</p>
      <p>Of course the qualifier is "mostly": this isn't a dogma. Writing a 100%
        functional system ("going vegan", if you will) often requires you to jump
        through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking
        at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not
        be worth it.</p>
      <p>And then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need
        a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient
        deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not
        be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or
        performance-sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
      <h2 id="%22real-code%22">"Real code" </h2>
      <p>Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food
          stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat
          only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have
          recognized as food.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is
        "code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what
        they do". Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don't get too clever,
        "manufacturing artificial ingredients". Use the primitives that are there, when
        possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Federated Learning (FL) is catching traction and it is now being used in several commercial applications and services. For example, Google uses it for mobile <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02903.pdf">keyboard prediction</a>, while Apple uses FL to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/11/131629/apple-ai-personalizes-siri-federated-learning/">improve Siri</a>. In this blog post, I will first give a primer on FL by comparing it against a standard datacenter setup. Then, I'll motivate the use of Federated Learning on embedded devices and, end this blog post by providing a walk-through on how you can set up and run FL applications on embedded devices using Flower.</p><p>By the end of this post, you will understand the key difference between distributed and federated learning as well as how to apply federated learning to a real problem.</p><h2>What is Federated Learning?</h2><p>We will start by giving a brief overview of what are the unique aspects of Federated Learning (FL) and how it differs from other forms of learning such as datacenter-based distributed learning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Distributed learning:</strong> Under this setting clients are compute nodes (e.g. a server with a few GPUs) and the dataset is controller by whoever manages the datacenter, thus it can be shuffled and balanced across clients. All clients are almost always available and typically there are 1-1000 of them. The learning process is centrally orchestrated by another server in the datacenter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federated learning:</strong> By contrast in an FL setting, the clients are independent and often much more constrained compute nodes (e.g your smartphone) that <strong>own</strong> the data and never send it to the central server. In this way, learning happens locally in each node using their own data and, once the on-device learning stage is completed, the nodes send their updates to the central server, where the results get aggregated. Finally, the central server generates a new <em>global model</em>. The number of clients in FL can reach millions of nodes, but only a fraction of them might be available for a given round of training. The amount and quality of data might vastly differ from client to client. Because clients own the data, FL can offer privacy guarantees that aren't possible in datacenter-based learning approach where privacy is mostly based on a trust agreement.</p></li></ul><p>The diagram bellow illustrates the key differences (left: federated learning, right: classical distributed training in datacenter):</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-b7d6672412df666c1cc1d865dcbeb644.webp" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-3717f1fd49de4f57238436b6834188a6.webp" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-a369975bc78b7ba6d4f503b3d8e10cb0.webp" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-7742c1738e0b8935883cb64f9de350ea.webp" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-682846e2e914876775cc51a6d7971561.png" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-45202bd75244e2af964f56d786bf6834.png" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-83386a049a9605e0a6a543d8d4822645.png" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-dae913420dfe5e5ec3e868d9287fa636.png" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><img src="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-dae913420dfe5e5ec3e868d9287fa636.png" alt="Intro Diagram"></picture></div></div><blockquote><p>For a more in-depth analysis of different training setups please check <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04977.pdf">Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning, Kairouz et al. (2019)</a></p></blockquote><h2>Motivating FL on Embedded Devices</h2><p>Here I present a hypothetical example showing how Federated Learning brings value in privacy sensible contexts such as smart appliances using computer vision. I'll use this example to motivate the use of Federated Learning on embedded devices.</p><p>Let's assume there is a company out there that offers a service by which you can easily keep track of what's in your fridge. Such service only requires you to (1) install a small camera with an embedded computer inside your fridge (we'll refer to this device as a "FridgeCam") and (2) connect the device to your WiFi network. Upon installation, the FridgeCam will download a pretrained model from the server offering the service of detecting and classifying the items in your fridge.</p><p>However, this initial classification model isn't very good. The main reason being that there are not publicly available datasets that capture the wide variety of items that can be found inside a fridge as well as the different levels of occlusion, viewing angles and, illumination conditions. Because of this, the service provider offers an opt-in program for users to collaborate with the images captured by their FridgeCams and use them to build a better classification model.</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-3e4885cd589d501ac7a08cd83f782911.webp" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-c437da742eac9221e9c23455edfb0113.webp" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-3581e47721403c07542c3039b03b26e4.webp" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-3fb3cfc661b335b882c9e83c811bf100.webp" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-50459349e7715d687e896e0b58deb2ba.png" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-de054442d7f2ee9a0cb2e1dbb549edab.png" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-6bfab7c98cb8e339fe6099181c14f9fe.png" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-7d66966788856236c27a8003121310d1.png" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><img src="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-7d66966788856236c27a8003121310d1.png" alt="FridgeCam Diagram"></picture></div></div><p>Privacy is an obvious concern here. As a result, many users might not want to share the content of their fridge. For example, some might not want to share images showing alcoholic drinks, others would be worried about sharing some medication that needs to be stored in the fridge. Whatever the reason is, Federated Learning with its privacy guarantees is currently the best way of training a better global model without sharing any data with the service provider.</p><p>If a sufficiently large pool of users with their FridgeCams joins the service and, if they are willing to contribute towards the FL learning process (which will also involve some regular image annotation effort from their side), this long-awaited service of keeping track of what's on your fridge could become a reality :relieved:.</p><h2>Using Flower on Embedded Devices</h2><p>Using embedded devices as FL clients could be cumbersome as it might require substantial configuration to get the machine learning framework (e.g. PyTorch or Tensorflow) running efficiently on these devices. How can I automate this process as well as setting up the communication with the server?</p><p>With Flower you can <a href="https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded_devices">run FL on embedded devices</a> after a minimal setting up process. We have dockerized the Flower clients to make the process of adding them to the FL pool of clients as seamless as possible. This means that the only requirement to use Flower clients is to install Docker in your embedded device (e.g. a Raspberry Pi). We provide a step-by-step guide on how to do this <a href="https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded_devices">here</a>. Once Docker is up and running, everything is ready to launch an FL training pipeline that trains on-device an image classification model. The following diagram illustrates the setup for this example.</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-3ae27e7892c0bbcbbe3b93a3105b2881.webp" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-035688095262cea6c213a03ea8520013.webp" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-625fba5beee330cebada9a0610fbe9ac.webp" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-b3383612702a6119acde5f4640bdacd3.webp" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-0fad80335f0842adfd9fbd3ec8897e2e.png" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-9814f1da2d7e15c2522882f7c63f6e9c.png" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-536fd0cf9c552493921f8c656c31311b.png" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-aa32a501ac7d3a407b4e1ade63e08363.png" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><img src="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-aa32a501ac7d3a407b4e1ade63e08363.png" alt="Demo Diagram"></picture></div></div><p>In the example we provide, we present a simpler scenario from what was described in the previous section using FridgeCams. Instead, we will show how to train an image classifier for <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10 dataset</a> in a Federated Learning fashion. An equivalent setup could be used to make FridgeCams a reality so, if this idea sounds exciting to you, feel free to <a href="https://flower.dev/join-slack">join our Slack channel</a> to discuss it! In the meantime, you can run our CIFAR-10 example by:</p><p>First, launch the server in your machine (i.e. your laptop) by specifying your machine's IP address, the number of FL rounds and, the model to use: </p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># launch your server. It will be waiting until two clients connect</span><span>
</span>$ python server.py --server_address &lt;YOUR_SERVER_IP:PORT&gt; --rounds 3 --model Net
</code></pre></article></div><blockquote><p>If you have just one device around to act as a client you can still run this demo by supplying <code>--min_num_clients=1</code> and <code>--min_sample_size=1</code> when you launch the server. Please refer to this example's repository for additional details.</p></blockquote><p>Then, launch the Raspberry Pi client:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># where `cid` is your unique client id, and `model` is the architecture to use</span><span>
</span>$ ./run_pi.sh --server_address=&lt;SERVER_ADDRESS&gt; --cid=0 --model=Net
</code></pre></article></div><p>Then, launch the Jetson client:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># make sure the --cid is unique</span><span>
</span>$ ./run_jetson.sh --server_address=&lt;SERVER_ADDRESS&gt; --cid=1 --model=Net
</code></pre></article></div><p>Internally, <code>run_pi.sh</code> and <code>run_jetson.sh</code> are identical with the exception that the former pulls a Docker image with PyTorch compiled for Arm CPUs and the latter pulls another with GPU support for NVIDIA-Jetson devices.

<p>In the 1850s, San Francisco experienced a massive gold rush that brought people all around the world to the city. While the rush itself came from gold deposits discovered inland in Coloma, many started their journey in San Francisco, and many settled there after the boom ended in 1855.</p>
    
<p>The Gold Rush brought fame and fortune to many, and transformed San Francisco from a town of 500 to a city of 150,000 between 1847 and 1870. Local Indigenous groups, however suffered immensely from racial violence and territorial disputes. </p>

</section>
<p>When I took my first real management role as <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/packback-engineering">Packback’s Head of Engineering back in 2015</a>, I inherited a great team of engineers who were hired before my promotion. Later that year, when the time came for me to do some of my own hiring, I had to quickly adopt a process for finding and onboarding new software engineers.</p>
<p>I started with the framework my predecessor used and brought in some heavy influences from <em><a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/peopleware">Peopleware</a></em> and Josh Tyler’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/1XQAfT7">Building Great Software Engineering Teams</a></em>. Over the years, I’ve refined my hiring process - mostly through trial and error - to come up with the iteration described here.</p>
<p>My approach is a little unconventional, but I hope it inspires you to think outside the box. This is going to be a long read, so I’ve broken it down into five sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#the-problem-with-hiring-software-engineers">The Problem with Hiring</a></li>
<li><a href="#skills-i-look-for-in-software-engineers">Skills I Look For</a></li>
<li><a href="#how-i-find-software-engineers">How I Find Candidates</a></li>
<li><a href="#how-i-hire-software-engineers">How I Hire Engineers</a></li>
<li><a href="#mistakes-ive-made-when-hiring-software-engineers">The Mistakes I’ve Made</a></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: If you’re looking for some books to help you on your journey as a software engineering manager, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/reading-for-engineering-managers">here are some of my favorites</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-hiring-software-engineers">The Problem with Hiring Software Engineers</h2>
<p>Any <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/engineering-manager">engineering manager</a> who’s hired people in the past will tell you that it’s hard.</p>
<p>There are lots of constraints, no way to fairly compare two candidates, and suitable candidates for one team may be horrible for another. Because it’s so hard, the process has evolved to favor people who think like the interviewers, who know someone at the company, or who perform well in high-pressure interviews. It leaves people with non-traditional backgrounds struggling, often works against diverse candidates, and is nothing like the day-to-day work that most engineers do.</p>
<p>For example, a typical interview may require a phone screen with a recruiter who tests for “soft skills.” Next, an engineering manager may screen for baseline technical skills, and then the candidate may be asked to complete an independent project or come into the office for a whiteboarding session. In either case, <strong>the interview is nothing like a typical day working as an engineer</strong> (although the “take-home” project may be the closest in some environments).</p>
<p>Soft skills are important, but “tell me about a time when…” questions favor people who are quick to make things up, and they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/03/04/why-i-hate-behavioral-interviewing/#7229c954693c">don’t demonstrate real judgment or problem-solving skills</a>. It’s impossible to assess someone’s character in a 30-minute phone screen, so at best, you can weed people out who are completely unreliable or have poor verbal communication skills.</p>
<p>Similarly, it’s very hard to judge a person’s technical ability in all things during a 1-hour tech screening. The field of web development (and software engineering in general) is so vast that nobody is going to match your requirements perfectly. You can ask them what technologies they’re familiar with and see if they can have a coherent conversation about technical topics, but you probably can’t bump up against the edges of all of their knowledge, especially if it doesn’t overlap with your own.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ve never done whiteboarding or live coding sessions with candidates, but <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1166/programmers-are-confessing-their-coding-sins-to-protest-a-broken-job-interview-process">a lot of people really hate them</a>, and I think there’s a good reason for that. In the real world, programmers pushed in front of an audience to solve a problem with an obscure algorithm, no time for independent research, and no access to resources. I would never do this job if that were my day-to-day.</p>
<p>Testing programmers at something they don’t need to be good at and expecting to learn something about how they would work at your company is delusional. These kinds of interviews only serve to make the hiring team feel superior and ensure better outcomes for engineers with traditional CS backgrounds.</p>
<h2 id="skills-i-look-for-in-software-engineers">Skills I Look for in Software Engineers</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FfOzjCZ.jpg" alt="Software Engineering Skills"></p>
<p>In an effort to redesign our hiring process around the skills that actually matter in software engineering, I took the problem down to <a href="https://fpt.guide/">first principles</a>. What skills do I need in a team of software engineers?</p>
<h3 id="initiative">Initiative</h3>
<p>I have never liked micromanaging people. I remember being a team lead at a restaurant in college and getting irrationally annoyed with people who would stand around while customers were lining up at the register. “Go, take an order or something!”</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>Most software engineers who are looking for a job have a certain level of initiative, but great software engineering candidates go the extra mile all the time. For example, I worked with a guy at Packback who had built a website and extremely popular Twitter account to follow the chatter on police scanners. He did all this to learn new things for fun.</p>
<p>Software engineers who take initiative don’t wait for the hiring manager to email them back, they ask about next steps, and they read about the company before they show up for an interview. It’s not really that hard, but it does take time, and very few candidates do it.</p>
<h3 id="reliability">Reliability</h3>
<p>Initiative is a start, but <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hero-myth">I don’t want a hero</a>. I want to build a team of consistently reliable engineers who improve over time.</p>
<p>Candidates with a history of staying in jobs for a long time, strong references, and commitment to projects usually make it to the top of my list when hiring.</p>
<h3 id="competency">Competency</h3>
<p>When I was a new engineering manager, I over-indexed on technical skills. It’s easy to fall into the trap of grading engineers based purely on their technical knowledge, but arcane trivia does not make a sound engineer.</p>
<p>I’ll talk more about how I gauge a candidate’s competency later in this post, but the key question I ask is, <strong>do I think this engineer can learn to solve the problems we are facing?</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about whether they know all the answers on day one, but instead, I look for curious people who are lifelong learners with a drive to improve themselves. If they have that, I’ll find a way to get them the information they need to succeed in this role.</p>
<h3 id="interest-in-the-mission">Interest in the Mission</h3>
<p>I used to call this “passion,” but after a <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/exceptions-welcome/building-a-resilient-career-dea4tx69g32/">lively conversation on the Exceptions Welcome podcast</a> I decided to rebrand this skill.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I only want to hire software engineers who care about our industry, the problems we’re solving, and the method we’re using to get there. If we aren’t pointing in the same direction before they join, I don’t want to spend the first six weeks convincing them.</p>
<p>While I don’t want unquestioning loyalty or people who live at the office, I do think it’s important that software engineers are actually interested in the work they will be doing. It’ll make them happier, and that positivity rubs off on everyone.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-find-software-engineers">How I Find Software Engineers</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bTlxNvy.jpg" alt="Finding Software Engineers"></p>
<p>I’ve used several methods for finding and recruiting software engineers over the years. While I don’t have a ton of data to back up these methods, here’s what I’ve found works for me.</p>
<h3 id="job-listings">Job Listings</h3>
<p>Job listings are the <em><a href="https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/">landing page</a></em> for job hunters.</p>
<p>A compelling job listing should outline the tools and languages the candidate should know, the projects the candidate will work on, and as much information about day-to-day expectations as is reasonable. I try to make job listings interesting and creative, so I typically use a GitHub repository with lots of information about our team, our company, and the job interview process (<a href="https://github.com/thegraidenetwork/job-openings">here’s an example of the repo I set up for The Graide Network</a>).</p>
<p>Remember that you won’t just share this listing with candidates. You’ll also be emailing it out to everyone in your network, sharing it on social media, and linking to it from your website. It’s a public-facing document that should be good looking and functional.</p>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p>I’ve never paid money to promote a job listing, but I doubt it’s worth it, and here’s why:</p>
<p><strong>The best software engineers are never <em>actively</em> looking for a job on job boards.</strong></p>
<p>They’re locked away behind gatekeepers called “their network,” which includes former managers and coworkers, friends, and people who know them from professional organizations. They jump ship when someone they trust tells them about a great opportunity or when they decide to ask around. Senior software engineers often laugh about how many Linkedin messages we get from naive recruiters.</p>
<p>So, what’s the trick to building a network full of software engineers?</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<p>People are surprised when I tell them that <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">I spend 4-8 hours per week building and maintaining my network</a>, but the dividends on that investment have been enormous. Whenever I have a new job opening, I write up a job listing and start passing it around. I keep a huge list of people I’d like to work with someday, so I go through it and find an excuse to get lunch.</p>
<p>If you’re not actively building your network right now, start <a href="https://ctocraft.com/blog/how-to-use-writing-to-build-a-solid-talent-pipeline/">writing</a>, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/speaking-guide">speaking</a>, and taking meetings with interesting people. It’s the best investment you can make in your career.</p>
<h3 id="cold-outreach">Cold Outreach</h3>
<p>Another unpopular recruiting tool for finding software engineers is cold outreach. I’ve found that it can work, but you have to be careful. It’s easy to come off as spammy or annoying.</p>
<p>Treat cold outreach as an excuse to grow your network rather than jumping straight to “the ask.” Reach out to people, ask them genuine questions; do some research on their background; get to know them. You’re just having a conversation, and eventually, you might slide in a mention that you’re keeping an eye out for software engineers.</p>
<p>End each call by asking if you can follow up in a few months and (shocker!) actually do it. I’ve met some outstanding people this way, even if we never ended up working together.</p>
<h3 id="recruiters">Recruiters</h3>
<p>Recruiters get a bad name in the software engineering world because they can be pretty annoying. I’ve had junior recruiters cold call me at work or send job requests to my company email. Not a good look.</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are a few well-networked and honest tech recruiters out there. Just be ready to pay big bucks as the best likely work on a <a href="https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/contingency-vs-retained-recruiters-what-difference/">retainer rather than contingency</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you do get a recruiter, you need to keep recruiting too. If your recruiter doesn’t have any luck, you don’t want all your leads to dry up with them.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>In 2013 I decided to quit my career in astrophysics, move back “home” and become a data scientist. The <a href="http://www.marcelhaas.com/index.php/2018/03/30/leaving-the-field-becoming-an-extronomer/">blog post</a> I wrote about my decision was probably my best read publication as a professional astronomer and it was moving to read all the reactions from people who were struggling with similar decisions. I meant every word in that blog post and I still agree with most of what I said. Now, 7 years after the fact, it is time to confess: I deeply regret quitting.</p>



<p>This post is meant to give my point of view. Many people who left academia are very happy that they did. Here I present some arguments why one might not want to leave, which I hope will be of help for people facing decisions like these.</p>



<p><span>I miss being motivated.</span> In the first few years after jumping ship many people asked me why I would ever wanted to <em>not</em> be a professional astronomer. I have always said that my day-to-day work wasn’t too different, except that what I did with data was about financial services or some other business I was in, rather than about galaxies and the Universe, but that the “core activities” of work were quite similar. That is kind of true. On an hour by hour basis, often I’m just writing (Python) code to figure things out or build a useful software product. The motivation to do what you do, though, is very <em>very</em> different. The duty cycle and technical depth of projects are short and shallow and the emphasis of projects is much more on getting working products than on understanding. I am doing quite well (in my own humble opinion), but it is hard to get satisfaction out of my current job.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="340" src="http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/academic_hat.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/academic_hat.png 546w, http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/academic_hat-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></p>



<p><span>I miss academic research.</span> The seeds of astronomy were planted at very young age (8, if I remember correctly). The fascination for the wonders of the cosmos has changed somewhat in nature while growing up but hasn’t faded. Being at the forefront of figuring things out about the workings of the Universe is amazing, and unparalleled in any business setting. Having the freedom to pick up new techniques that may be useful for your research is something that happened to me only sporadically after the academic years. The freedom to learn and explore are valuable for creative and investigative minds and it doesn’t fit as well in most business settings that I have seen.</p>



<p><span>I miss working at academic institutions.</span> The vibe of being at a large research institute, surrounded by people who are intrinsically motivated to do what they do was of great value to me. Having visitors over from around the globe with interesting, perhaps related work was a big motivator. That journal clubs, coffee discussions, lunch talks, colloquiums etc. are all “part of the job” is something that even most scientists don’t always seem to fully appreciate. Teaching, at the depth of university level classes, as a part of the job is greatly rewarding (I do teach nowadays!).</p>



<p><span>I miss passion and being proud of what I do.</span> The <a href="https://www.google.nl/search?hl=nl&amp;q=sexiest+job+of+the+21st+century">internet </a>says I have ”the sexiest job of the 21<sup>st</sup> century”, but I think my previous job was more enjoyable to brag about at birthday parties. I can do astro as a hobby, but that simply doesn’t give you enough time to do something substantial enough.</p>



<p><span>I don’t miss …</span> Indeed, the academic career also had its downsides. There is strong competition and people typically experience quite some pressure to achieve. The culture wasn’t always very healthy and diversity and equality are in bad shape in academia. Success criteria of your projects and of you as a person are typically better motivated in business. The obligatory nomadic lifestyle that you are bound to have as an early career scientist were a very enjoyable and educational experience, but it can easily become a burden on your personal life. The drawbacks and benefits of any career path will balance out differently for everybody. If you get to such a point, don’t take the decision lightly.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/decision.png" alt="" width="89" height="89" srcset="http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/decision.png 200w, http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/decision-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 89px) 100vw, 89px"></figure></div>



<p>The people who questioned my decision to become an extronomer were right. I was wrong. It seems too late to get back in. I think I have gained skills and experience that can be very valuable to the astronomical community, but I know that that is simply not what candidates for academic positions are selected on. On top of that, being geographically bound doesn’t help. At least I will try to stay close to the field and who knows what might once cross my path.</p>

<![CDATA[A year's worth of learnings from adopting Mob programming]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At FARFETCH, teams are encouraged to try new development methodologies so that they can deliver even better results while also improving productivity. As a fairly new team, we have continuously been looking for different methodologies that best fit our needs, such as avoiding knowledge silos or a slow-paced reviewing process. Although not every approach that we have tried has worked, the ones that did are now part of our daily development workflow and play a key role in the outcome of the tasks that we deliver.</p><p>A year ago, our team was first introduced to <a href="https://mobprogramming.org/" target="_blank">Mob Programming</a>, and we have been using it since then. The concept that was once hard to fathom is now the go-to approach when dealing with most of our sprint tasks. Although being able to use Mob Programming daily has come with many different types of challenges, the results have been surprisingly good.&nbsp;</p><p>When using Mob Programming, instead of having each team element working on its own task, the whole team gathers together to tackle the same task. It includes using a single workstation and only one person typing - <span>the Driver</span> - while the remaining people are describing the path that should be taken.</p><blockquote><p><span>Itâ€™s a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. - Woody Zuill (2014)</span></p></blockquote><p>Mob Programming is somewhat similar to Pair Programming. While the latter consists of having two team members sharing the same workstation, Mob Programming goes a bit further and implies having the entire team focused on a single task. Even though Pair Programming is a great tool to share knowledge, improve communication and even bring better outcomes (as a consequence of having multiple people thinking about the same problem), it confines these advantages to only two elements on a team. On the other hand, Mob Programming can amplify these benefits to the whole team.</p><p>Yet, having an entire team working on the same problem brings its own challenges. It's imperative that the team establishes a set of well-defined procedures and rules. Furthermore, Mob Programming may not be suitable for all kinds of tasks or teams. Depending on the task the team is tackling, it should first be established whether Mob, Pair or Solo Programming is the appropriate methodology. None of the three is suitable for all situations. It's up to the teams to give them a try and figure out when to use them.</p><p>A typical Mob Programming setup consists of moving the team to an isolated space (e.g. a meeting room) and bringing one computer that should be connected to either a large monitor or a projector. Having a whiteboard to write down possible solutions and describe the next steps is great to empower collaborative brainstorming. Seats and tables for everyone is a must, as everyone should be comfortable during the session, this is particularly relevant as these sessions tend to be time-consuming. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have adapted our ways of working to facilitate Remote Mob Programming sessions - but more to come on that later.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.farfetchtechblog.com/fotos/editor2/Dinis_Peixoto/Image_01.png" alt=""></p><p>Two key roles must be considered when using Mob Programming: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the person at the keyboard, responsible for moving the codebase forward. The Navigator understands what the group has decided to aim for and provides instructions to the Driver. The Navigator shouldn't dictate the actual code that the Driver has to write down, only the expected solution. Sometimes, the Navigator role may not be needed. It is up to the Driver to opt-in or out. Nonetheless, when there's no Navigator, the Driver may get lost by having multiple people explaining what to do. These roles should rotate between all team members at regular intervals (usually monitored by a timer).</p><p>The session should be held continuously until the task is done. Quick breaks, like coffee or bathroom, are allowed and shouldn't require the session to stop. Some longer breaks like lunch must be agreed between the team so that everyone does it at the same time to prevent distractions and absences.</p><div><p>The first thing that may come to one's mind is that Mob Programming jeopardizes the team's overall productivity. After all, having an entire team working on the same task certainly means that both the team's velocity and throughput will be compromised, right?</p></div><div><p>More often than not, people tend to forget that delivering a task includes a lot more than just writing code. It's common that most of the time spent on a particular task is on coming up with the right solution or waiting for the team to review what was done. In our case, each task requires approval from 3 different people, which implies that they stop what they are doing, get up to speed, and finally review the result.</p></div><div><p>When using a development workflow like Solo Programming, once a developer puts the task up for review, the team has to understand all the requirements and review what was done, while also trying to identify what was the problem-solving process that the author took. The fact that the team has to go through someone elseâ€™s work without being completely aware of the decisions behind the proposed solution might take longer and prevent some mistakes from being identified.</p></div><p>Whereas when using Mob Programming, taking advantage of insights and knowledge from the whole team may lead to the task being delivered quicker while also with a better solution. When it comes to the review process, it will also be straightforward as everyone owns the decisions that were made and the solution path that was taken.&nbsp;</p><p>We have been using Mob Programming for over a year. Over this period, we have been trying to refine our methodology so that we can make the most out of our sessions. Some of the phases that have improved our workflow are described below.</p><ol><li><span>Task scouting:</span> each team member should, individually, check the task details prior to the session. Investing time on exploring the task beforehand will considerably shorten the time required on the next phase.</li><li><span>Purpose clarification: </span>at the beginning of the session, someone should present the problem at hand and make sure that everyone has a clear grasp of what the team is trying to achieve. Any questions about the purpose of the task should be raised at this time.</li><li><span>Work breakdown:</span> with the purpose of clarified, it's now time to identify the work blocks that have to be monitored during the session. The different tasks that result from this analysis should be prioritized and can be split into even smaller tasks if needed.</li><li><span>Execution:</span> based on the tasks identified previously, the team must try to work on each task by following the agreed order. The team should expect new tasks to surface throughout the session. If it happens, the order of the tasks can be adjusted.</li><li><span>Debriefing:</span> at the end of the session, the team will need to look at the initially defined tasks and check if everything was tackled. The solution should be carefully reviewed together before submitting it for team review. It's highly recommended to provide some time for an individual review to address groupthink problems.</li></ol><p>Equally important are the rules that our team has defined so far. Periodically, we revisit them and discuss whether or not some updates are required. Trying to make this an iterative process is extremely important to enhance the overall experience of our Mob Programming sessions over time.</p><ol><li><span>Driving/navigation time:</span> each team member will be in the Driver/Navigator role for 15 minutes. If a discussion comes up, the timer should stop so that both the Driver and Navigator can participate.</li><li><span>Complete focus on the session:</span> everyone in the room has to be focused on the session. If someone needs to work on something else, they must leave the room to avoid distracting the team.</li><li><span>Mandatory and optional breaks:</span> there are three mandatory breaks where the session must be stopped: morning coffee, lunch and afternoon coffee. Additional breaks are allowed but should be minimized to reduce the impact on focus. These sessions are very demanding on every team member so, if one cannot focus on the current tasks, taking a break is completely acceptable.</li><li><span>Research time:</span> whenever research is required, it should be done primarily by the Driver with the help of the team. Parallel research streams are allowed, as long as the team is aware of them.</li><li><span>Identify Mob Programming tasks ahead of time:</span> we always try to decide upon whether a specific task is going to be tackled through Mob Programming or not. It facilitates any coordination required during our sprint.</li></ol><p>Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, we had a new challenge ahead of us: <a href="https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/" target="_blank">Remote Mob Programming</a>. As a consequence, we had to go through the rules above and update them as a means to adapt to the reality of having the whole team working remotely.</p><ol><li><span>Driving/navigation time:</span> this should be increased, in our case, we adjusted it to 45 minutes, due to the extra work required when changing the Driver (e.g. setting up the environment, sync with git's remote repository). It might take up to 5 minutes and wouldn't be worth it to do it every 15 minutes.</li><li><span>Video sharing:</span> everyone should keep the camera on during the session and, when possible, look directly at it. Itâ€™s as close as we can get to face-to-face interaction.</li><li><span>Driver handover:</span> every time a Driver handover is required, the current Driver has to ensure that changes made during their turn are properly committed and pushed to the remote repository. To have a better sense of the changes and their history, usually, the Driver's name is kept on the commit description.</li></ol><p>When it comes to the tools that we use during our mob sessions, it depends on if we are doing it in-person or remotely. When having in-person sessions, the only tool that we make use of is <a href="https://github.com/dillonkearns/mobster" target="_blank">Mobster</a>, which allows us to keep track of the Driver timer, the active and next up Drivers. Whereas when having remote sessions, on top of Mobster we also benefit from <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> for video/screen sharing and live annotations (i.e. being able to …</p></div></div>

Each contributor is assigned to a generational cohort based on the year of their first contribution. The cohorts tend to shrink over time as people leave.</p><p>There’s a special “drive-by” cohort (in a fetching shade of off-white) for contributors who were only briefly involved, meaning all their activity fits in a three-month window. It’s a big group. In a typical year, it numbers 200-400 persons who were not seen before or since. Most of them contribute a single commit.</p><p>According to this, GNOME peaked at slightly above 1,400 contributors in 2010 and went into decline with the GNOME 3.0 release the following year. However, 2020 saw the most contributors in a long time, even with preliminary data — there’s still two weeks to go. Who knows if it’s an anomaly or not. It’s been an atypical year across the board.</p><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per month, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>This is the same histogram, but with per-month bins.

It’s safe to say that GNOME is dependent on paid developers in a big way. Specifically, and to no one’s surprise, it leans heavily on Red Hat.</p><h2 id="observations">General observations</h2><p>A few observations can be made with confidence:</p><ul><li>By F/OSS standards, the project is not <em>un</em>healthy. It has hundreds of experienced and first-time contributors every year. It is well-organized and arguably well-funded compared to its peers. But:</li><li>Every metric has the project peaking around 2010.</li><li>A diminishing number of veterans is doing an increasing share of the work.</li><li>Although recruitment is stable, newcomers don’t seem to be hitting their stride in terms of commits.</li><li>Corporate sponsorship is probably necessary to keep the project going, but the field of sponsors has kept thinning.</li></ul><p>I think GNOME is addressing the risk factors competently by modernizing infrastructure (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/">Discourse</a>). This has obvious value even in the absence of quantifiable results, but it’ll be interesting to see if the effect can be measured over the next couple of years.</p><p>Diminished enthusiasm may also be due to there being fewer ways for a new contributor to make their mark or assume a role of responsibility. GNOME has become more conservative, certainly much more so than it was a decade ago in the run-up to GNOME 3. The rationale and phrasing in <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/new-gnome-versioning-scheme/4235">the announcement of the new versioning scheme</a> (e.g. <em>“Radical technological and design changes are too disruptive for maintainers, users, and developers”</em>) seems indicative of this trend<sup>1</sup>.</p><h2 id="methodology">Notes on methodology</h2><p>So what’s wrong with this analysis? If you’re so inclined, you can find the details under the next couple of subheadings and pass harsh, harsh judgement.</p><p>I’ve set the unscientific rigor bar high enough to hopefully yield something useful, but low enough that I could do it in my spare time and not get stuck in the dreaded state commonly known as “90% done”.</p><h3>Module selection</h3><p>I aggregated data from <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-repos">189 Git repositories</a>. The vast majority of these are hosted on <code>gnome.org</code>, with a handful from <code>freedesktop.org</code> and <code>github.com</code>. Commits are uniquely identified by their commit hash, meaning trivial duplicates are counted only once.</p><p>GNOME has always been a decentralized, big-tent project, so it’s not obvious how to delineate it. I’ve tried to be fair by including most of the repositories from a full meta-gnome-desktop jhbuild, including fairly low-level dependencies like Cairo, Pango, and Pipewire, as well as past, present and would-be flagship applications under the GNOME umbrella. Documentation and infrastructure is represented, as are many archived projects (e.g. ORBit2, Bonobo, Sabayon, GAL).</p><p>I was a little uncertain about what to do with X.Org and Wayland. In the end I decided to include the latter, but not the former, since Wayland has close ties to GNOME (it even references GTK+ in its TODO file), while X.Org has its roots in the much older XFree86.</p><p>Mono is another project I resisted including; its development was tangential to GNOME proper, diverging completely in the most recent decade. However, I did include GtkSharp and several GNOME-hosted C# applications common on desktops in the 2005-2010 time frame.</p><p>Since I haven’t established hard criteria for module selection, it’s subject to various biases. Older code is probably underrepresented, since providers of important functionality were more loosely attached to the project early on (e.g. GNOME Online Accounts and Telepathy got pulled in, should I have included Gaim or Pidgin too? How about XChat?).</p><p>Anyway, the list isn’t terrible, but there’s room for improvement.</p><h3>Contributor identities</h3><p>Similar studies often identify contributors by their e-mail addresses. I used full author names instead, since there’s good reason to think they’re more stable over a 20-year time span. We’re fairly consistent in spelling our own names, and we change them rarely (often never). On the other hand, e-mail addresses come and go with different hosting arrangements, employers, etc.</p><p>An added challenge with this approach is that sometimes different people have the exact same name. In practice, I’m not aware of any instances of this happening in GNOME. It seems to be rare enough that I doubt it’d introduce significant error in most projects.</p><p>I should add here that the drive-by cohort depends on a fair amount of hindsight (you never know when someone might come back with more contributions, but the likelihood drops off quickly as time passes). This means the cohorts for 2020 are preliminary. They’ll be a lot more accurate with another run late next year.</p><h3>Domain names</h3><p>I’m using e-mail domain names as a proxy for organizations in some of the graphs. This is a notoriously unreliable approach for at least three reasons:</p><ol><li>Contributors often use personal e-mail addresses for paid work, leading to significant undercounting in general.</li><li>Specific companies may require their employees (or ask them nicely) to use company e-mail for collaboration. Out of the listed companies, I know of at least one that definitely did this. However, there are many that don’t, and these will be comparatively less well represented.</li><li>The mapping between DNS and organizations isn’t one-to-one. A company may operate under multiple names or TLDs (e.g. <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.com</code>).</li></ol><p>Despite these weaknesses, it’s common to slice the data this way. It’s difficult to do better without access to semi-closed data troves, and depending on your views on privacy and ability to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a> safely, it might not be something you’d want to get into anyway. But I bet you’d be well-positioned for it if you were, say, the corporate owner of both LinkedIn and GitHub.</p><p>When grouping by organization, the goal is to get an idea of which outside entities are sponsoring contributions. Therefore, I’ve filtered out addresses from the biggest mass e-mail providers like <code>@gmail.com</code> and project-centric providers of personal accounts (e.g. <code>@gnome.org</code>, <code>@gtk.org</code>).</p><p>I took the liberty of reassigning the personal domains of a few extra prolific authors who would’ve otherwise showed up as individual organizations. Since there’s no way I’m doing it for everyone, this introduces some bias. The full details are in <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-meta.json">the project’s metadata file</a> (see: <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#code">code</a>).</p><h3>Version control systems</h3><p>Changeovers in version control systems divide GNOME’s VCS history into three eras with noticeable discontinuities between them.</p><h4>Before 1998: Dark ages</h4><p>In the Bad Old Days, Free Software would often use plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">RCS</a> or no version control at all.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The global pandemic changed everything in 2020. Now it is going to change everything forever. This is part of "The Future of" series, in which BNN Bloomberg looks at what is next for our transformed economy and daily lives.</em></p>

<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Max Zhu had what can only be described as a hellish commute. It started with a 10-minute drive from his Oshawa, Ont., home to the local commuter GO-Train station, then a 70-minute (if there were no delays) train ride to Torontoâ€™s Exhibition station, and finally a 10-minute walk to the Liberty Village offices of First Capital where he works as a senior financial analyst. Thatâ€™s an hour-and-a-half of travel each way from Monday to Friday â€” or a total of 15 hours in transit per week.</p>

<p>Working from home over the past nine months, Zhu says heâ€™s been happy to have those hours back and would like to continue the arrangement post-pandemic â€” but only on a part-time basis. He misses the water-cooler chat and collaboration that can only take place face-to-face, but would prefer to return to the office only two or three days a week.&nbsp;â€œWe had so many get-togethers and industry working groups where all this expertise could come together in one place and we could bounce ideas off each other â€” it was incredible,â€� says the 26-year-old Chartered Professional Accountant. â€œThat made the long commute worth it.â€�</p>

<p>Zhuâ€™s perspective reveals one of the major long-lasting changes expected to come out of the pandemic. While thereâ€™s still a need for workers to be physically present for the purposes of problem-solving and innovation, the days of everyone rushing into the city en masse at the same time each morning â€” only to sit in front of a computer or attend progress update meetings â€” are over.<br>
&nbsp;</p>



<p>â€œThatâ€™s a waste of time and energy on both the part of the employee and the employer,â€� says Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Torontoâ€™s Rotman School of Management and School of Cities, and one of the worldâ€™s leading urban theorists. â€œThe whole idea of separating work from home, the way we did in the industrial revolution, and enduring long commutes is starting to finally at long last decline.â€� He expects about 20 per cent of the workforce to continue to work from home full time post-pandemic, with another 30 per cent telecommuting part of the week.</p>

<p>Instead of the usual rat race, people will only come into the city when it provides an experience they canâ€™t get at home.&nbsp;â€œJust like retail has been transformed into an experience, the office will have to be transformed into an experience, in order to get people back into the office,â€� Florida says.</p>

<p>But the coming farewell to the harried commute downtown for all workers five days a week wonâ€™t only be felt within the walls of Canadaâ€™s urban workplaces. This shift will also usher in a transformation to our cities as a whole, allowing for more affordable housing, walkable neighbourhoods, multi-use public spaces and repurposed transportation routes. Here are the trends to watch.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>RISE OF THE 15-MINUTE NEIGHBOURHOOD</strong></h2>

<div contenteditable="false" data-video-custom-description="" data-video-custom-title="" id="video-1536785-1608132356601-wrapper">

                    
                    

        

        

        

        <p>COVID-19 forced us to rethink the way we use space: Banff mayor </p>
        <p>Banff Mayor Karen Sorenson joins BNN Bloomberg and says Alberta's new COVID-19 restrictions will be challenging to Banff but that mandating outdoor mask wearing downtown, creating winter pedestrian zones and opening more skating rinks are creative ways in which they are trying to keep the community safe.</p>
            
</div>

<p>Many urban experts, including Florida, expect the shift to working from home will reduce demand for office space in central business districts. But that could be a good thing for cities. â€œMany of those office towers can be turned into much-needed affordable housing,â€� he says. â€œInstead of being a 9-to-5 neighborhood, it can be a 24/7 neighbourhood.â€�</p>

<p>That sounds great to Zhu, who wouldnâ€™t hesitate to move to Toronto if he could afford it. He likes the concept of a 15-minute neighbourhood â€” in which shops, restaurants and services are all within a short walk or bike ride from where residents live and work. â€œWhere I live in Oshawa, Iâ€™d have to drive 20 minutes just to get to the gym,â€� he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Itâ€™s still unclear, however, whether a decline in demand for urban office space will truly come to pass. According to PwCâ€™s Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2021, thereâ€™s a fair bit of uncertainty about what commercial tenants will do long term. Some predict that everything will go back to the way it was pre-pandemic, while others expect a renewed interest in suburban office development, as some employees look to work closer to home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That, in turn, would help create 15-minute neighbourhoods in suburbs, which have typically been a place where people live but not work. â€œOne can see a lot of those old, abandoned office parks and malls turned into much better versions of co-worker spaces, restaurants, cafÃ©s and workout facilities,â€� says Florida.</p>

<p>Right now, however, tenants are hedging their bets by taking short-term leases on office space, says Frank Magliocco, national real estate leader at PwC Canada. Magliocco also expects there will be a structural change in the way commercial real estate is used. â€œEmployers are going to take a hard look at their offices and ask themselves what role that space should serve going forward,â€� he says.</p>

<p><img alt="Embedded Image" height="349" src="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1536946!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/default/the-future-of-cities-working-from-home.png" width="640"></p>

<h2><strong>MORE COLLABORATIVE WORKPLACES</strong></h2>

<p><br>
Tonya Surman, CEO of the Centre for Social Innovation, says she thinks the office of the future will resemble the co-working model her organization first brought to Canada 15 years ago, which companies like WeWork have since taken mainstream.</p>

<p>â€œCommunity is going to become even more important,â€� she says. Smaller employers, in particular, will downsize but maintain enough space so staff can come in a few times a week, hold meetings, train staff and reconnect.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong><em>â€œThe whole idea of separating work from home, the way we did in the industrial revolution, and enduring long commutes is starting to finally at long last decline.â€�</em></strong></h2>

<p><br>
Florida agrees office designs will have more of a focus on common spaces and collaboration. â€œThe office as workspace â€” where you have a desk or a cubicle â€” will give way to the office as meeting space or interaction space,â€� he says, adding that there will be spaces for people to work out, do yoga or meditate, and more outdoor spaces for people to congregate.</p>

<p>And for those whose employer decides to go completely virtual or move to the suburbs to avoid the high cost of downtown commercial real estate, niche third-party co-working spaces such as CSI will fill the void, says Surman. Where CSI provides networking and business development opportunities for individuals who want to make the world better, other co-working spaces will become networking hubs for communities with other personal or professional interests, she says.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>DEDICATED PUBLIC SPACES</strong></h2>

<div contenteditable="false" data-video-custom-description="" data-video-custom-title="" id="video-1536764-1608132387576-wrapper">

                    
                    

        

        

        

        <p>Growth to be driven by skilled people from around the world reaching their goals in Canada: CIBC CEO </p>
        <p>Victor Dodig, president and CEO of CIBC, joins BNN Bloomberg to discuss his business leadership style as the bank continues to navigate through the pandemic. Dodig also speaks to what he believes is needed to stimulate economic growth in Canada. </p>
            
</div>

<p>An end to the rat race commute could also lead to a permanent change in the way roads are used. With less traffic coming into the city, some road space could be dedicated to bike lanes, wider sidewalks for pedestrians, or additional outdoor dining, as was the case during the pandemic.</p>

<p>â€œThis could be done in a flexible manner, where the space is not permanent or fixed but reallocated depending on the day or time of day,â€� says Lawrence Frank, an affiliate professor at UBC's School of Community and Regional Planning and the School of Population and Public Health, and president of Urban Design 4 Health.</p>

<p>He even imagines a scenario in which municipalities designate specific commuting days â€” say, Tuesday through Thursday â€” and offer tax incentives to employers who demonstrate a reduction in their commuter base to maintain lower traffic levels.</p>

<p>â€œWhen itâ€™s a commute day, certain streets will have to be cleared for traffic and movement of goods. On weekends, high streets could get blocked off from traffic and be set up for pedestrians and urban living. On shoulder days, maybe there would be a kind of hybrid.â€�<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>TRANSIT MOVES LOCAL</strong></h2>

Public transit will be less about moving workers on a nine-to-five schedule from the suburbs to downtown office centres, and more about moving people between different kinds of activities within their neighbourhoods, says Florida.&nbsp; Even so, he expects that fears about the health risks of riding public transit will linger. â€œTransit will be an issue for a long time even post-vaccine,â€� he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Embedded Image" height="349" src="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1536947!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/default/the-future-of-cities-transit-recovery.png" width="640"></p>

<p>Research by the University of Toronto Transportation Research Institute indicates a more optimistic view. In an online survey of 2,753 adults who rode public transit in Toronto at least twice a week pre-COVID, but stopped using the service during the outbreak, 87 per cent said they will come back once theyâ€™ve been vaccinated, and 100 per cent will return once the crisis is declared over. But because ridership has fallen drastically during the pandemic, public transit systems like the TTC that rely on fares for the bulk of revenue may not have the resources to return full force when riders are ready, says Frank.</p>

<p>â€œWill transit be there when the demand returns? And if service is poor â€” if itâ€™s too crowded and people canâ€™t get a seat â€” they might lose ridership permanently,â€� he says.</p>

<p>That, of course, would be disastrous for Zhu and others who rely on regional transit to get downtown â€” even if theyâ€™d only be making that commute two or three …</p></div></div>

Systems are designed by humans, and better designs lead to better performance, stability, and flexibility. <strong>Linux is simply a better designed operating system</strong>. It's super flexible and stable - "blue screens of death" are exceedingly rare in production Linux servers, and their performance is very reliable. <strong>Which is why a vast majority of production systems run on Linux</strong>, and that's also why it's good for anyone working in tech to be Linux literate. That includes you, dear reader.</p><p>Being open source leads to high quality, as bugs have fewer dark places to hide in. Developers can peer under the covers to make sure their Linux applications will work well, rather than guessing and relying on questionable documentation from closed source operating system developers.</p><p>But with great power and flexibility comes a great ability to shoot yourself in the foot. Linux makes that easy as well.</p><h3 id="what-do-the-different-types-of-linux-mean">What do the different types of Linux mean?</h3><p>One of the confusing things when entering the Linux world is the giant jargon which is thrown in your face. It feels like the explanations expect you to already know and understand a bunch of other terms, without building understanding step by step. So, I'd like to give you a very brief summary of terms you might come across and what they mean.</p><h3 id="linux-like-systems">Linux-like systems</h3><p>Mac and Unix are very similar to, but are not Linux technically. You will have a hard time telling the difference, unless you dive deep.</p><p>Unix is older than Linux and extremely similar - In fact, Linux is an open source re-implementation of Unix (which was closed source, but very good). This is pretty much historic trivia, as Unix is rarely seen nowadays, but know that some people use the words Unix and Linux interchangeably.</p><p>In general, there’s a name for operating systems that look and feel like Unix – POSIX compliant, or *nix. When you see these words, translate them as “follows the conventions of Linux, such as basic commands for file manipulation (ls, cd, mkdir) and "/" as the root of the file system etc.”</p><p>GNU is a large set of free software which is the foundation for much of Linux – compilers, C libraries, programs to zip files, and many others. It's also the name of an independent POSIX operating system, with more hardcore ideology around free software than Linux.</p><p>All of the above systems, as well as Linux itself, are examples of POSIX compliant or *nix systems.</p><h3 id="linux-distributions-distros">Linux Distributions / Distros</h3><p>There are (too?) many flavours of “real Linux”, called distros or distributions. It can be a headache to differentiate them.</p><p>A distribution is like a "company", which invents a new operating system. They wrap the Linux Kernel with a new bundle of peripheral programs - i.e. they may use a different mix of GUI programs, support different hardware by default, etc. They release new versions occasionally.</p><p><strong>The bottom line – unless you know what you’re doing, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">just use Ubuntu</a></strong>. It’s the most user friendly, widely supported, and easy to install.</p><p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>, or RHEL, is a different distro which is used sometimes in heavy duty production servers. <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> is the desktop equivalent of RHEL - usually, developers aiming to run their applications on RHEL servers will use Fedora for their development computers, to avoid compatibility issues.</p><p><a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine</a> is a super minimal distro which is used for many Docker images. <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/setting-up-data-science-workspace-with-docker/">Read our blog post about Docker for more information</a>.</p><h2 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h2><p>When people think of Linux, they usually associate it with a scary terminal (plus attached Anonymous hacker with a hoodie 👩‍💻).</p><p>Don't Panic – it’s not so scary! Today, it’s really easy to install Linux on a computer, with a regular GUI wizard, if you pick a distro that cares about that sort of thing (for example, Ubuntu).</p><p>We'll focus on terminals / shells in this lecture, since that is always available, and generally where "real work" is done. Production servers will rarely have GUIs. Don't let that discourage you - after you get used to it, using the shell can become much more convenient than GUIs!</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="The Wizard will now install your software."><figcaption>The Wizard will now install your software.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="basics">Basics</h2><p>The following actions are very basic file manipulation commands - moving, copying, deleting, viewing, etc.<br>I think there are enough sources online to learn these basic commands, and so I won't be re-explaining them here.

It's in charge of things like: </p><ul><li>Taking keystrokes from the user</li><li>Displaying text output to the user.</li><li>Remembering what directory you're in currently (changed using <code>cd</code>, shown using <code>pwd</code>)</li><li>Turning your commands into <strong>new</strong> <strong>running programs &nbsp;- processes,</strong> by sending appropriate messages to the kernel</li></ul><p>For example, what does the shell do when I type <code>python hello_world.py</code> and press enter?</p><ul><li>It's in charge of knowing where the actual program called "python" is located in the file system - probably something like <code>/usr/bin/python</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>You have a business idea but you're not sure if it solves a real pain point and there's a market of potential buyers out there?</p>
<p>You could move forward and build an MVP to validate your idea but should you really invest the time and money to do it?</p>
<p>Validating that there's enough demand for your solution later down the road is one of the most important steps you need to take in order to build a successful business. As it turns out there's a simple, yet elegant way to figure out if you're onto something.</p>
<p>In this blog post we'll walk through this process step-by-step so that you can make an informed decision whether you should double down or go back to the drawing board.</p>
<h2>Ideas and competition</h2>
<p>Most of us see competition as a sign of market saturation. If there are too many competitors it's tough to cut through the noise with our very own solution. Old Competitors have deep pockets and will certainly outspent you in their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Furthermore categories are usually associated with their market leaders. Looking for a solid CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solution? That's what Salesforce is for. Real-time business chat software? Slack is the big player here. E-Mail Marketing? Go with Mailchimp.</p>
<p>While competing with Salesforce might be a bad idea, having competitors shouldn't turn you off as it comes with huge upsides you can exploit.</p>
<p>Having competitors means that the <strong>market is already validated</strong>. Companies are already spending money for a solution. If you try to enter, let alone define a brand new market you're spending most of your time and effort educating your future potential customers about your product and why it's important for their business to succeed.</p>
<p>It's likely that they're not aware of the severity of the problem you're trying to solve for them. Even if you succeed in educating your future users about your product you still have to raise awareness for the necessity to buy your product in higher management since they usually allocate budgets and therefore have to get onboard as well.</p>
<p>Raising such awareness is a grind which will cost you a lot of money spent on marketing and sales. Money you don't really have if you're starting from scratch with no VC funding. It's way easier to enter a well defined and understood category. A category where a lot of people are already spending money on solutions to solve their problems at hand.</p>
<h2>Validating demand</h2>
<p>Now that we know that we should embrace rather than avoid competition we can use this fact to do some market research and estimate if there's enough demand for our product. In addition to that we should also check if entering the market is sustainable long-term.</p>
<p>The following 3-step process is a simple, data-driven framework which helps you in answering those questions.</p>
<p>As an example let's say that we want to build a video conferencing tool specifically designed for job interviews done to hire remote employees. Imagine a tool which has built-in support for whiteboarding, code interviews, video playback for mocked-up "stress test" scenarios, facial emotional recognition, recordings, etc.</p>
<p>Should we move forward with that idea? Is there enough demand? Let's run through the process and figure it out!</p>
<h3>1. Identifying your competitors</h3>
<p>The very first step we need to take is to identify our key competitors. Let's think about how remote job interviews are primarily done these days? What usually happens is that after an initial screening the applicant walks through a series of video calls with various interviewers who vet the candidate based on different criteria.</p>
<p>The core technology used throughout this process is a reliable video conferencing software so let's see who the strongest players are in that market.</p>
<p>To identify the most widely used video conferencing softwares we start our research on a product reviews site called Capterra.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-1.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 1"></p>
<p>Let's enter "Video Conferencing" in the search bar as we're looking for video conferencing software.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-2.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 2"></p>
<p>As we can see there's an even more specific category called "Web Conferencing Software" which, based on its description, looks like exactly what we're after. Clicking on the link directs us to the page where we can explore all the web conferencing solutions in use by businesses these days.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-3.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 3"></p>
<p>The next thing we want to do is to sort the products by "Most Reviews" because the default ranking includes advertisements at the top.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-4.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 4"></p>
<p>Next up we take some time to scroll through the list to figure out who our main competitors would be. Skim through the reviews to see which product is often used in the context of the idea you're pursuing (remote job interviews in our example).</p>
<p>After digging deeper into the specifics we can identify the following tools as our competitors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whereby (a.k.a appear.in)</li>
<li>Wire</li>
<li>Livestorm</li>
</ul>
<p>The more time you spend on this step the more competitors you'll uncover. For the rest of this post we'll move forward with these three tools to keep things simple.</p>
<p><strong>A note on finding the main competitors:</strong></p>
<p>When following the aforementioned steps you'll usually find the big names at the very top of the list. In our case that's Zoom, GoToMeeting or Google Meet. That's totally fine and expected. What you want to do is to look for software which is more specialized and tailored towards the audience and niche you're about to serve.</p>
<p>Based on my own experience I can say that a huge advantage for remote job interviews would be a no-login, no-download and no-installation software package (it should be accessible from within the users browser with 1 click). In addition to that, built-in screen sharing and encryption is a must. Those are some of the problem specific characteristics you should take into account to narrow down your competition.</p>
<h3>2. The VC funding they raised</h3>
<p>Now that we know who our main competitors are it's time to do more research on the companies behind the toolings.</p>
<p>We do this via a website called Crunchbase. Crunchbase is a platform which collects, processes and serves business information about private and public companies with a main focus on venture-backed startups.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-5.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 5"></p>
<p>The next step in our research is pretty simple. We enter our competitors name in the search bar and pull up their organizations profile.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-6.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 6"></p>
<p>What we want to focus on specifically is whether they've raised money in the past and, if so, what amount. In the "Livestorm" example above we can see that they've raised a total of 4.6 Million EUR in 2 rounds (Seed Round and Series A).</p>
<p>We want to do this research for all the competitors we've identified. Simply search for their organizations profile and see if they've raised VC money.</p>
<p>"Wire" for example has raised 14.5 Million EUR and "Whereby" was even acquired by "Videonor".</p>
<p>The main goal with this step is to see if there's money invested in the market. The more money is already invested, the better. Ideally the majority of your competitors should've raised money in the past.</p>
<h3>3. Their website traffic</h3>
<p>The very next thing we should do is to figure out how much web traffic our competitors are getting.</p>
<p>The more visitors they get, the more demand there is for their product. The more demand, the easier it is for us to grab some of that traffic via paid ads or good content marketing and redirect it to our, more specialized solution.</p>
<p>Website traffic numbers are usually considered highly sensitive and kept behind closed doors. Luckily enough Crunchbase has us covered as they're partnering with SEMrush, a tool for professional SEOs and SEMs.</p>
<p>To get a rough estimate as to how much traffic our competitors are getting we can simply click on the "Technology" tab in their Crunchbase profile and look at the "Monthly Visits" number.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-7.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 7"></p>
<p>Doing so reveals that "Livestorm" gets roughly ~305.255 visits per month. "Wire" sits at ~153.904 monthly visits while "Whereby" attracts ~1.365.524 visits every month.</p>
<p>Again, do this for each and every identified competitor. You should be looking at at least ~150.000 visits per month for each of your competitors. The more, the better.</p>
<h3>The results</h3>
<p>That wraps up your main market research process. The main objective in doing this research is to validate that there's enough demand such that your new, specialized solution can find its potential customers more easily.</p>
<p>The two signals you want to look for is invested interest in the market via VC funding and enough organic search traffic you can tap into later down the road.</p>
<p>You want to move forward with your idea if you can validate that at least ~4 of your competitors have received funding and are getting more than ~150.000 visits every month.</p>
<h2>Your challenge</h2>
<p>I'd like to invite you to take some time this week to run through this process with the product you have in mind.</p>
<p>Take the numbers you should be looking for outlined above as ballpark numbers and take other, niche-specific metrics into account (e.g. Facebook followers if you're working on a Social Media related solution).</p>
<p>This process might take quite a while and can feel laborious but trust me that investing this time upfront can save you months, if not years of wasted time and effort.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Starting a new business adventure is a risky endeavor. It takes years and a lot of learnings until success materializes. One of the most common reasons why startups fail is that they solve a problem nobody is willing to pay for.</p>
<p>In this blog post we've discovered a simple 3-step process you can apply to mitigate the risk of building something nobody wants. Via marked research you can validate that there's enough demand to enter the market and carve out your very own niche.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there were many chat services. AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, ICQ and others. These messengers had their own desktop clients, and developers reverse engineered their protocol to build custom applications, both open and closed source. Trillian, Audium and Pidgin were applications that let people communicate across all these messengers with one program. Over time the old protocols died, and newer chat services like Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts started storing your entire history on their servers. People started using the web interfaces and mobile apps, no longer caring about desktop programs.</p>

<p>Matrix is an open source communication protocol. It’s similar to XMPP (formerly Jabber) in the sense that anyone can set up a Matrix server and communicate to people on other Matrix servers. It’s a federated protocol, just like e-mail. Google Hangouts used to support XMPP federation, but silently removed support in 2014. Matrix supports bridging other chat services, so they can appear in a unified view. With my current setup of Matrix and appropriate bridges, I’ve combined my view of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Telegram and native Matrix chats into one convenient user interface. The path to get to that integration was not as simple.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The dedicated server I use for <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/a-history-of-personal-and-professional-websites/">this website</a> and other self-hosted web applications, is located in Germany. Logging in to Facebook or Google’s chat system from a country I’m not currently in, can raise all sorts of security flags and lock me out of my account. For those bridges, I purchased a small virtual machine in a Chicago data center. I installed a proxy on that server, accessible only via VPN, to view both Google and Facebook, so they record the IP address I’m connecting from with my web browser. This helps minimize security lockouts. Telegram isn’t hostile to third party developers, and has an official API. It doesn’t care my bridge is connecting to it from Germany, so I host it on the dedicated server.</p>

<p>The reference Matrix server is called Synapse. It, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridges all have official Docker containers built by their developers. Each bridge must be able to communicate with the Synapse homeserver. Their instructions go through generating configuration and key pairs that are copied over to Synapse in order to form their authentication bridge. The bridges provide chat robots that guide you through getting OAuth tokens or cookies for those respective services.</p>

</figure>

<p>The wiki for each bridge also has instructions for enabling double-puppeting, making each chat look seamless between myself and the accounts on the other side of each respective bridge. Without double-puppeting, each conversation will be in a three person group with the Matrix user, the bridge user (e.g my Google Hangouts user) and the person I’m talking to.</p>

<figure>

      Chat Without Double-Puppeting Enabled

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Enabling double-puppeting via the <code>curl</code> command in the bridge documentation and calling <code>login-matrix</code> on the bot, removes the creation of three person rooms. The bridged accounts will now show up as regular, two-person conversations.</p>

<p>I use the Element desktop app to connect to my matrix server, but I also have a web version of Element running from its own official Docker container in case I need to access chat from another computer. There are other clients, such as <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage">Mirage</a> which is built using Qt and <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">Fluffychat</a> for mobile. Although I use Synapse for my homeserver, there are other servers that support the Matrix protocol that are in use and under active development.</p>

<p>Setting up all the Matrix components wasn’t too difficult, but it does require knowledge or experience with running services. It took a considerable amount of work and debugging to get each bridge operational, compounded slightly by my complex networking setup. Most people would probably just run all of this on a Raspberry Pi at home. I feel that using Matrix with bridges is still somewhat inaccessible to people who aren’t interested in development or server administration. Still, the satisfaction of having unified chat, plus one more layer of abstraction between myself and Google or Facebook, feels like it was wroth the overall effort.</p>

      <h2><strong>Hi there! Who are you and whatâ€™s your background?</strong></h2>

<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Jessica Califano from New York and the newsletter I work on is called <a href="https://temboo.com/the-daily-breather?utm_campaign=the%20daily%20breather&amp;utm_medium=interview&amp;utm_source=rad%20letters">The Daily Breather</a>. I started my career in fashion PR and marketing but eventually moved into the tech industry, where Iâ€™ve been for the past eight years. I am currently Head of Marketing and Communications at <a href="https://temboo.com/">Temboo</a>, a no-code software startup that works with communities to help them improve their environment using sensor technology and environmental data plus grassroots involvement. </p>

<h2><strong>Whatâ€™s your newsletter about?</strong></h2>

<p>The Daily Breather is a free, beautifully designed email report that provides air quality information for whatever locations you want to monitor. Readers get an easy way to understand the effects that air pollution can have on their daily lives, actions they can take to help improve the air around them, and what they should do if the air quality near them is poor. </p>

<p>Our data comes from trusted sources, including the EPA (in the U.S.) and the EEA (in Europe). Having high quality data is vital: it allows for an accurate understanding of air quality, and it lets you compare your own sensor data to data known to be trustworthy. On Fridays we send a special version of the email that includes a graph of the weekâ€™s air quality so you can see how it changed each day. </p>

<p>It also explains what the air quality parameters mean because many people really donâ€™t understand what AQI, PM2.5, Ozone, etc are actually measuring. I find it really helpful to have the concepts explained right inside of the tool.</p>

<p><img src="https://rad-letters.s3.amazonaws.com/custom/daily-breather-tooltip.gif" alt="AQI explanation"></p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to monitor more than one location, weâ€™ll send you updates in the same email so you can check in on as many places as youâ€™d like. Itâ€™s a great way to keep an eye on friends and family who live in other locations.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about The Daily Breather is the design. Our designer, Brett, came up with a great idea of changing the color of the body of the email based on the air quality. We use the same colors that the EPA uses to indicate air quality: green for good, yellow for moderate, orange for unhealthy for sensitive groups, and red for unhealthy. Besides just the colors, the illustrations in the email also change. The flowers wilt when the AQ is poor and you can see more haze in the air.</p>

<p>We also include interesting facts, long reads, videos, social media posts, and more as a fun bonus. They change every day and are curated by me with the help of the team at Temboo.</p>

<h2><strong>When did you get started writing your newsletter? What motivated you to get started?</strong></h2>

<p>The idea for the newsletter was actually from our CEO, Trisala. She thought it would be a good way to try to get people engaged and interested in their local environment. A big part of the work we do with communities is to offer a way for people to get local residents more informed about the environmental issues in their area and this is one way we are working to engage people.</p>

<p>The issue of air quality is important and timely. We wanted to raise awareness about the effects that air pollution can have on health, skin, cognitive function, and overall quality of life. The Daily Breather is designed to make it easy for people to monitor their air quality, because if something is easy, people are more likely to do it. Hopefully, this will encourage people to check their air quality daily, because it will be something that is more and more important as climate change wreaks havoc on the environment.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t Tembooâ€™s first foray into newslettersâ€”we have a weekly newsletter that I write as well that includes our latest blog post each Friday. My team and I publish at least one article a week on the <a href="https://blog.temboo.com/">Temboo blog</a>, mostly about environmental issues, community building, technology, and sustainability. I do all of the editing for the blog and publish my own articles there as well. </p>

<h2><strong>What does the process of writing your newsletter look like for you?</strong></h2>

<p>The newsletter is sent daily through an automated process set up by our engineering team. It sends across time zones, so when you sign up it will send you the emails at 7:30 AM wherever you are located which makes it a great way to start your day. </p>

<p>The content part of the newsletter is set up by me. We have a rotating schedule of the types of content we share: facts, quotes, trivia questions, long reads, podcast recommendations, interactive content, social media posts, newsletters to subscribe to, and what to stream. Weâ€™re planning to add more in the future too like short interviews, events, polls, etc.</p>

<p>Putting together this content is a really fun process. We have a giant spreadsheet with the different categories listed above and so itâ€™s my job to make sure we donâ€™t ever run out of one type. Since the newsletter is sent daily, I usually spend some time each week adding in content to the list. Sometimes Iâ€™ll come across an article or video that I think would be a good fit and add it in then. Other times, I seek out content to include, which is usually the case for the facts.</p>

<h2><strong>What have you learned through writing your newsletter?</strong></h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve learned a lot about air quality in general because of The Daily Breather and the research Iâ€™ve had to do for it. I think about air pollution constantly nowâ€”if I see a truck idling somewhere or smoke from a fire. Even just checking that the air quality is good before exercising outside is a new thing for me. But it also makes me feel a lot more connected to the environment that I live in and more motivated to make sure Iâ€™m not contributing to any pollution in the air around me.</p>

<h2><strong>Whatâ€™s your favorite part about writing your newsletter?</strong></h2>

<p>My favorite part is finding all the content. I am constantly consuming media, so curating the recommendations and other things we include helps me to take a step back and really consider what I am reading, listening to, or watching and ask myself if I think it would be interesting to a lot of other people. And hearing back from people who are enjoying it is always great too.</p>

<h2><strong>What do you wish you had known when you first started writing?</strong></h2>

<p>When I first started working on the newsletter I was really focused on finding content about air quality and the environment in general. Our click through rate was ok but I was surprised that it wasnâ€™t better than where it was. So I thought we should start trying out different types of content, including things like cool artists that I follow on social media or videos about futurism, just stuff that is interesting in any category. And the numbers went way up. So I learned not to box myself in, in terms of the content Iâ€™m sharing. People arenâ€™t only interested in one type of thing, so why limit myself to that? Itâ€™s become a lot more fun to work on now, because I can just find and share cool stuff that I like. I definitely wish Iâ€™d known that from the start.</p>

<h2><strong>What are some of your favorite newsletters, books, and podcasts?</strong></h2>

<p>I probably subscribe to more newsletters than anyone in the world, so Iâ€™ll just share some of my favorites from various categories. </p>

</ul>

<p>As far as books, I mostly read novels. I recently read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leave-World-Behind-Rumaan-Alam-ebook/dp/B083JKGK15">Leave the World Behind</a> by Rumaan Alam and it was excellent. Kind of scary given the times we are in but itâ€™s still a fun and distracting page turner. Ottessa Moshfegh is one of my favorite writers so I recommend any of her novels. Same with Lauren Groff and Rachel Kushner. </p>

<p>For podcasts, I really enjoy <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all">Reply All</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/youre-wrong-about/id1380008439">Youâ€™re Wrong About</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/slow-burn/id1315040130">Slow Burn</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dream/id1435743296">The Dream</a>, <a href="https://features.apmreports.org/in-the-dark/">In The Dark</a>, <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/welcome-to-la">Welcome to LA</a>, and <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet">How to Save a Planet</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>What goals do you have for the future?</strong></h2>

<p>Weâ€™re working on putting together a version of the email that sends information from local air quality sensors that a group we are working with in the Bronx has set up. Weâ€™ll be doing this with more and more groups that we do air quality monitoring projects with too, so the data will be hyperlocal, providing a clearer picture of the air quality in those locations. Weâ€™re also thinking about including other types of environmental data like water quality for example. </p>

<p>The goal is to build out a resource for anyone to find out what the environment they live, work, and play in is like, with the hope of spurring action and engagement to protect and sustain that environment. </p>

<p>I was reading the
<a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_5.10">Linux 5.10 release summary on KernelNewbies</a>, and a
section stood out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.6. Static calls for improved post-Spectre performance</p>

  <p>Static calls are a replacement for global function pointers. They use code patching to allow
direct calls to be used instead of indirect calls. They give the flexibility of function pointers,
but with improved performance. This is especially important for cases where retpolines would
otherwise be used, as retpolines can significantly impact performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time looking at the Linux kernel, but never directly at its indirect call
setup or post-<a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> mitigations. These changes sound very cool,
so I’m going to use this post to try and explain and understand them (both to myself and others).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: One of the original authors of the patchset has emailed me with some corrections
and answers to the questions that I ask below. I’ve marked each with either “Correction” or
“Update.” Thanks, Peter!</p>

<h2 id="background-indirect-calls-spectre-and-retpolines">Background: indirect calls, Spectre, and retpolines</h2>

<h3 id="indirect-calls">Indirect calls</h3>

<p>Indirect calls are one of C’s most powerful language features, and are critical for writing
higher-order code without a supplementary object or function/method dispatch system.</p>

<p>Most C programmers are familiar with the basics of indirect calls, thanks to standard and POSIX
functions like <code>qsort</code> and <code>pthread_create</code>: each takes a <em>function pointer</em>, which it then
calls internally to complete the functionality of the surrounding call:</p>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/P44Ghq">Godbolt</a>).</em></p>

<p>Observe: our <code>call</code> goes through a memory or register operand (<code>[rbp - 8]</code>)<sup id="fnref:opt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:opt">1</a></sup> to get the target,
instead of a direct target specified by the operand value itself (like, say,
<code>call 0xacabacab ; @good_rand</code>). That’s what makes it indirect.</p>

<p>But we can go even further than this! Indeed, a common pattern in C is to declare
entire <em>structures</em> of operations, using each to parametrize a lower level set of behaviors
(for example, the core POSIX I/O APIs) over independent implementations.</p>

<p>This is exactly how <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">FUSE</a> works: every FUSE client
creates its own <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/cd4aae2de6aacad31a15791bbb52adf173561a6d/include/fuse.h#L299-L790"><code>fuse_operations</code></a>:</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this technique isn’t limited to userspace: the Linux kernel itself makes
aggressive use of indirect calls, particularly in architecture-agnostic interfaces
(like the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">VFS</a> and sub-specializations
like <code>procfs</code>) and the architecture-specific internals of subsystems like
<a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><code>perf_events</code></a>.</p>

<p>So that’s neat. It’s so neat that CPU engineers got all
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor#Indirect_branch_predictor">hot in the pants</a> trying
to squeeze extra performance out of them<sup id="fnref:perf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:perf">2</a></sup>, and we ended up with
<a href="https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf">Spectre v2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spectre-v2">Spectre (v2)</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/spectre.png" alt="The Spectre logo"></p>

<p>The exact mechanism that Spectre v2 (also known as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715">CVE-2017-5715</a>) exploits is
<em>slightly</em> out of scope of this post, but at a high level:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Modern (x86) CPUs contain an <em>indirect branch predictor</em>, which attempts to guess the target
of an indirect call or jump.</p>

    <p>To actually speed things up, the CPU <strong>speculatively executes</strong> the
 predicted branch:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A correct prediction means that the indirect call completes significantly faster
 (since it’s already executing or has finished executing speculatively);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A misprediction <strong>should</strong> result in a slower (but still
 successful) indirect call with <strong>no side effects from the incorrect speculation.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words: the CPU is responsible for <strong>rolling back</strong> any side effects associated
 with any misprediction and subsequent speculation. Mis-speculation is a <em>microarchitectural</em>
 detail that should not manifest in <em>architectural</em> changes, like modified registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rolling back</strong> any mis-speculated state is a relatively expensive operation, with a lot of
microarchitectural implications: cache lines and other bits of state need to be fixed up so that
the <em>actual</em> program control flow isn’t tainted by failed speculations.</p>

    <p>In practice, rolling back the entire speculated state would undo most of the advantages
 of speculating in the first place. Instead of doing that, x86 and other ISAs will just mark
 (many) of the bits of speculated state (like cache lines) as stale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fixup behavior (either reverting or marking speculated state) results in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack"><em>side-channel</em></a>: an attacker can
<em>train</em> the branch predictor to speculatively execute a bit of code
(not unlike a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">ROP gadget</a>) that modifies
a piece of microarchitectural state in a data-dependent manner, such as a cache entry
whose address is dependent on a secret value that was speculatively fetched.</p>

    <p>The attacker can then <em>probe</em> that microarchitectural state by <strong>timing</strong> access to it:
 fast accesses indicate a speculatively modified state, disclosing the secret.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The original Spectre v2 attack focused on cache lines since they’re relatively easy to time, even
from high level (and sandboxed!) languages that don’t have access to
<a href="https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_30.html"><code>clflush</code></a> or other cache-line
primitives on x86. But the concept is a general one: it’s difficult to execute speculatively without
leaking <em>some</em> information, and subsequent vulnerabilities (like <a href="https://mdsattacks.com/">MDS</a> and
<a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/">ZombieLoad</a>) have exposed information leaks in other
microarchitectural features.</p>

<p>This is bad news: an attacker running one of the <strong>safest</strong> contexts (JavaScript or other managed
code, in a sandbox, in userspace) can conceivably train the indirect branch predictor to
speculatively execute a gadget in kernelspace, potentially
<a href="https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/">disclosing kernel memory</a>.</p>

<p>So, the kernel needed a new mitigation. That mitigation is <em>retpolines</em>.</p>

<h3 id="retpolines">Retpolines</h3>

<p>To mitigate Spectre v2, the kernel needs to prevent the CPU from speculating on an attacker
controlled indirect branch.</p>

<p>A retpoline (short for <em>ret</em>urn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_(computing)"><em>trampoline</em></a>) does exactly that: indirect
jumps and calls are surrounded by a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunk</a> that
effectively traps the speculated execution in an infinite loop, spinning it until the misprediction
is resolved.</p>

<p>Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/api-app/sites/default/files/Retpoline-A-Branch-Target-Injection-Mitigation.pdf">Retpoline whitepaper</a>
has some helpful illustrations:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/retpoline.png" alt="A visualization of speculative execution with and without a retpoline."></p>

<p>This works by converting the indirect control flow from an <em>indirect branch</em> to an
<em>indirect return</em><sup id="fnref:allreturns" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:allreturns">3</a></sup>, hence the “ret” in retpoline. Returns are <em>also</em> predicted,
but with an additional mechanism given priority: the
<a href="https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2018/04/ras-microbenchmarks/">Return Stack Buffer</a><sup id="fnref:rsb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rsb">4</a></sup>. To ensure that
the RSB can’t be maliciously trained away from the infinite loop, the retpoline begins with a
direct <code>CALL</code> that primes the RSB to always<sup id="fnref:notalways" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notalways">5</a></sup> predict the infinite loop.</p>

<p>Here’s what an indirect call retpoline <em>actually</em> looks like<sup id="fnref:ool" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ool">6</a></sup>, simplified significantly from
the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/lib/retpoline.S">kernel</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/nospec-branch.h">source</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…all of that to replace a simple <code>call [rax]</code>!</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>There are repercussions for this kind of trickery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s slow when correctly predicted: we’ve replaced a single indirect <code>CALL</code> with at least two
direct <code>CALL</code>s, plus a <code>RET</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s <em>really</em> slow when mispredicted: we <em>literally</em> spin in place using <code>PAUSE</code> and <code>LFENCE</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a ROP gadget, so it <em>looks</em> like an exploit primitive. That means it screws with Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">CET</a>
and similar protections on other platforms. Intel claims that newer hardware will support “enhanced

<p>We were recently challenged by&nbsp;Ali El-Sharif from <a href="https://ai.science/">Aggregate Intellect</a> to run some benchmarks on GRANT, and thought that one of the most interesting direct comparisons would be to compare <a href="https://wagtaillabs.com/2020/11/17/introducing-grant-pt-1/">Amalgamate</a> with Cost Complexity Pruning (CCP).</p>



<p>Cost Complexity Pruning applies a similar philosophy to Amalgamate, aiming to remove parts of each decision tree that don’t carry their weight. There are many descriptions of how CCP works on the web, but <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/cost-complexity-pruning-decision-trees/">this is a good, quick introduction</a>.</p>



<p>First up we tried pruning a Random Forest using Amalgamate with increasing&nbsp;<em>threshold</em> values&nbsp;and compared that to pruning with increasing CCP <em>alpha</em> values. Here’s the result plot comparing Validation Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) against the number of rules in the model (as found by <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/cost-complexity-pruning-decision-trees/">Graft</a>):</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="735" height="425" src="https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-1-1.png 735w, https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-1-1-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px"></figure>



<p>What’s interesting here is that Amalgamate has a significant early advantage, up to 20% fewer rules for the same Validation RMSE, but that eventually CCP finds a better, ultra-low complexity model. This suggests that CCP misses some easy simplifications because it only works on each decision tree individually, and that these can be found using Amalgamate.</p>



<p>To test this theory we tried running Amalgamate (with a fixed <em>threshold</em> for simplicity) on each CCP pruned model:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="723" height="428" src="https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-2-1.png 723w, https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-2-1-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px"></figure>



<p>These results show us that Amalgamate always found rules to eliminate, often (but not always) improving Validation RMSE. Overall our experiments showed that Amalgamate can be reduce the number of rules in a model by an average of 5% with no impact on Validation RMSE. This mightn’t sound like a lot, but anything that can be done to reduce the cognitive load required to understand the model without impacting on the results is useful.</p>



<p>By using both CCP and Amalgamate it is possible to find better simple models, and let stakeholders decide where the tradeoff between accuracy and complexity should be.</p>

                    <h2 id="what-could-go-wrong-when-your-employees-commit-internal-information-to-public-github-repos">What could go wrong when your employees commit internal information to public GitHub repos? </h2><p>While <a href="https://savebreach.com/solarwinds-credentials-exposure-led-to-us-government-fireye-breach/">we were the first to report on the SolarWinds security vulnerability that possibly could have exposed their Downloads FTP server</a> credentials letting attackers to push malicious binaries and attack the US government and <a href="https://solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a>' other high profile clients, some more information has surfaced regarding the SolarWinds security vulnerability since then, that gives more insight into what possibly was exposed and whether it could have led to this massive breach of the US government. While majority of security researchers are of the opinion that this wasn't the main reason of the breach, and that there was a complex and sophisticated supply chain attack targeting <a href="https://solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a>, we believe<strong> these small security lapses could have given the attackers a larger attack surface to carry out their attacks</strong> and eventually might have helped strengthen their foothold into the SolarWinds infrastructure, to perform reconnaissance and evade detection.</p><h3 id="plain-old-ftp-to-the-blame">Plain old FTP to the blame?</h3><p>As per the screenshot posted by Vinoth, which we wrote about in our previous <a href="https://savebreach.com/solarwinds-credentials-exposure-led-to-us-government-fireye-breach/">post</a>, SolarWinds were possibly using unencrypted plain FTP server for their Downloads server in the age of global CDN technologies. However, not a direct attack vector its very likely that the FTP server had more vulnerabilities and unencrypted communication can always be intercepted, and modified. But we don't believe this maybe something as concerning as the FTP password leak.</p><h2 id="solarwinds-credentials-were-possibly-leaking-since-2018">SolarWinds Credentials were possibly leaking since 2018</h2><p>Security researcher Vinoth Kumar, told us that "SolarWinds had been possibly exposing the FTP credentials to the Download server since at least 2018". To corroborate his claim, Vinoth shared the the following link to the Configuration file exposed that was exposed in the mib-importer GitHub repo possibly belonging to a <a href="https://github.com/xkozus00">SolarWinds employee</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xkozus00/mib-importer/blob/master/Src/Lib/PurgeApp/PurgeApp.exe.config">https://github.com/xkozus00/mib-importer/blob/master/Src/Lib/PurgeApp/PurgeApp.exe.config</a> and he further added that, upon supplying the <a href="https://github.com/xkozus00/mib-importer">repo base url</a> to the Web Archive, it shows Web Archive had first archived the page back in June 2018, and that was the last time the page was archived. So we concluded that the credentials to the FTP server and other potentially sensitive information in that exposed repository possibly existed for more than 1 year in the public domain until Vinoth reported it to the SolarWinds PSIRT.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1411w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Screenshot of the SolarWinds GitHub repository archived by Web Archive</figcaption></figure><p>This shows that SolarWinds might have been exposing their sensitive internal credentials since a fairly long time before it was brought to their notice, which in turn might have given its attackers an opportunity to steal certificates and other valuable internal information about SolarWinds to carry out the large scale attack against US government and other top organizations using the backdoored SolarWinds Orion software.</p><h2 id="the-mib-importer-github-repository">The mib-importer GitHub repository</h2><p>A "mib-importer" public GitHub repository, possibly belonging to a SolarWinds employee with secrets (like FTP username and password) exposed, was found on GitHub by the security researcher in November 2019, which is said to have existed from around June 2018</p><p>Upon analyzing, the SaveBreach team found out that SolarWinds Orion lets users import MIB files into it. MIB files are used for monitoring network devices. Apparently, the mib-importer tool was developed by SolarWinds to import MIB files into Orion. We found the following data from the <strong><a href="https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Add-MIBs-to-the-SolarWinds-MIB-database">SolarWinds documentation pages</a> </strong>regarding importing &nbsp;MIB files (Reference – <a href="https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Upload-MIB-in-Orion-Universal-Device-Poller">1</a>, <a href="https://thwack.solarwinds.com/t5/NPM-Discussions/Adding-MIBs-to-Orion/m-p/113474">2</a>, <a href="https://thwack.solarwinds.com/t5/NPM-Discussions/Adding-MIBs-to-Orion/m-p/113474">3</a>)</p><p><a href="https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Management-Information-Base--MIB--sw1730.htm">From SolarWinds website</a> – </p><blockquote>Management Information Base (MIB) is a structure that describes all objects a device can report on, such as CPU, fan, or temperature. MIB contains the name, datatype, and the object identifier (OID). MIB is a hierarchical structure, displayed as a navigation tree. Every entry in the MIB tree is a value for a specific component on a specific device.</blockquote><blockquote>SolarWinds maintains a MIB database that serves as a repository for the OIDs used to monitor a wide variety of network devices. The MIB database is updated regularly.</blockquote><h2 id="qa-with-cybersecurity-researcher-vinoth">Q&amp;A with cybersecurity researcher Vinoth</h2><p>From our most recent conversation with Vinoth, it appears that the credentials and possibly more sensitive data about SolarWinds was lying in public domain for a long time before finally being taken down. Vinoth doubts that the data might have also included certificates and not just FTP credentials, which was alone sufficient to sign the malicious binaries and upload them to the FTP server while passing off as legitimate software.</p><p><strong>Q: Since when do you think the GitHub repo might have been exposed? Do you think the attackers could have gained persistence into their infrastructure for almost 3 years to carry out the attack?</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">Vinoth</a></strong>: I’m not sure, even on June 2018, 40 commits were there (in that repo). There was only one page available on archive couldn’t find anything else.</p><p><strong>Q: The Attackers had put signed binaries on the Download server. What was the process the attackers might have followed after getting access to the file upload server to sign the binaries?</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">Vinoth</a></strong>: Not sure, but I could have missed checking the repo which could have had the certificate in it.</p><p><strong>Vinoth had tweeted that the GitHub repo was open to public since 17th June, 2018</strong></p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That Github repo was open to the public since 17 Jun 2018 😱 <a href="https://t.co/SHUWaPXIeK">pic.twitter.com/SHUWaPXIeK</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338956534147993601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>Tweet by Vinod about the web archived GitHub repository page</figcaption></figure><h2 id="certificates-used-to-sign-malicious-binaries-exposed-through-github-repo">Certificates used to sign malicious binaries exposed through GitHub repo?</h2><p>This raises many questions. Were the certificates used to sign the binaries obtained from that public GitHub repository or, from any other information leaked publicly? &nbsp;Exposed certificate could have allowed hackers to sign their malicious SolarWinds Orion binaries and pass them off as legitimate software developed by SolarWinds, subsequently uploading them to the Downloads server with the previously found leaked FTP credentials.</p><h2 id="was-this-how-solarwinds-got-hacked">Was this How SolarWinds got hacked?</h2><p>We can come to a partial conclusion that the internal information exposed on GitHub was there for a sufficiently long time for the attackers to have already exploited them to gain their initial foothold. Although unclear at this point, as there maybe a more sophisticated and complex attack chain with evasion techniques as being claimed by FireEye and security researchers, but we do feel this might have been a precursor to the SolarWinds breach and the widespread cyber attack against the US Government.</p>

<p>Slow websites are frustrating—and Google doesn’t like them either. In May 2021, Google is releasing a set of new ranking metrics known as <a href="https://moz.com/blog/core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The core web vitals are a set of metrics used to determine how fast webpages load. The three metrics are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint:</strong>&nbsp;The time it takes the webpage’s main content to load—should ideally be below 2.5 seconds.</li><li><strong>First Input Delay:</strong>&nbsp;How long it takes before the page is interactive for the user. This should be less than 100 milliseconds.</li><li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift:</strong>&nbsp;The time it takes for unexpected layout shifts in the page’s content; should be less than 0.1 milliseconds.</li></ul>



<p>Throughout this tutorial, you will learn how to optimize your Django templates for faster page load speeds to get your website ready for the new Google updates. Plus, it will make your visitors happy too! Let’s get started!</p>



<h2>Bundling and Minifying CSS with Django Compressor</h2>



<p>CSS is a render-blocking asset, meaning that it blocks the browser from rendering our webpage until the CSS has been completely downloaded and parsed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can optimize this process in our Django templates using <a href="https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Django Compressor</a> to minify and bundle our stylesheets. Thus, reducing the CSS’s file size and the amount of network requests the browser has to make. Awesome, let’s see how we can do this.</p>



<p>First, let’s install and configure Django Compressor.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">pip install django_compressor</code></pre>



<p>After installing, add <code>"compressor"</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> in your project settings.</p>



<pre><code lang="python"># myproject/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # apps
    'compressor',
]</code></pre>



<p>Perfect, since we are using Django’s staticfiles contrib app, we have to add Django Compressor’s file finder to our <code>STATICFILES_FINDERS</code> setting. Inside your <code>settings.py</code> file, add:</p>



<pre><code lang="python"># myproject/settings.py 

STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
    'compressor.finders.CompressorFinder',
)</code></pre>



<p>Now Django Compressor can find our static files. By default, Django Compressor will bundle our CSS files but not minify them. To minify the bundled CSS file, we need to pass the bundled file through a CSS filter. Let’s configure our CSS filters. Inside your <code>settings.py</code> file, add:</p>



<pre><code lang="python"># myproject/settings.py

COMPRESS_ENABLED = True
COMPRESS_FILTERS = {
        "css": [
            'compressor.filters.css_default.CssAbsoluteFilter',  
            'compressor.filters.cssmin.CSSMinFilter',
        ]
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s break down what’s happening here. First, we set <code>COMPRESS_ENABLED</code> to <code>True</code>—this tells Django Compressor to compress our CSS files while in development mode.</p>



<p>Next, we define a list of filters to pass the bundled CSS through. The <code>CssAbsoluteFilter</code> normalizes the URLs in your CSS files to absolute URLs, like the URLs in the CSS <code>url()</code> function, and the <code>CSSMinFilter</code> minifies the bundled CSS.</p>



<p>Perfect, that takes care of the configuration. Let’s set up our templates and start using Django Compressor to minify and bundle our CSS files in the next section.</p>



<h3>Setting Up Templates</h3>



<p>Inside our Django app, let’s create our template folder structure.</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">+-- myapp
    +-- migrations
    +-- templates
        -- base.html
        +-- myapp
            -- mytemplate.html</code></pre>



<p>That takes care of the folder structure. Let’s create our <code>base.html</code> template now. Inside the <code>base.html</code> template, add:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">{% <em>load</em> compress static %}
&lt;!DOCTYPE <em>html</em>&gt;
&lt;html <em>lang</em>="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;!-- Global StyleSheets --&gt;
        {% <em>compress</em> css %}
           &lt;link <em>rel</em>="stylesheet" <em>href</em>="{% static 'css/base.css' %}"&gt;
        {% <em>endcompress</em> %}

        {% <em>compress</em> css %}
        {% <em>block</em> styles %}
            &lt;!-- Child Template StyleSheets Go Here --&gt;
        {% <em>endblock</em> %}
        {% <em>endcompress</em> %}

        &lt;title&gt;Tutorial&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
   ....
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>We load in the compressor template tags and place the files we want to bundle and minify inside the <code>{% compress %}</code> template tag to use Django Compressor. The compress template tag takes one required argument: The filter key from the <code>COMPRESS_FILTERS </code>dictionary that tells Django Compressor which filters to use for these files. </p>



<p>Notice, I placed a style block inside the compressor template tag—this will put the child template stylesheets inside the compressor to be bundled and minified. </p>



<p>Lastly, let’s create a child template and add some stylesheets to it.</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">{% <em>extends</em> 'base.html' %}

{% <em>load</em> static %}

{% <em>block</em> styles %}
&lt;link <em>rel</em>="stylesheet" <em>href</em>="{% static 'css/index.css' %}"&gt;
&lt;link <em>rel</em>="stylesheet" <em>href</em>="{% static 'css/additional.css' %}"&gt;
{% <em>endblock</em> %}

{% <em>block</em> content %}
&lt;h1&gt;Index&lt;/h1&gt;
{% <em>endblock</em> %}</code></pre>



<p>Perfect, now we can test it out in the browser. Save your files and navigate over to <code>localhost:8000</code> in your browser. Inside your developer tools network tab, you should see something similar to this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="201" src="https://engineertodeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-9.07.23-PM-1024x201.png" alt="Compressed CSS file shown in the network tab of the developer tools." srcset="https://engineertodeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-9.07.23-PM-1024x201.png 1024w, https://engineertodeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-9.07.23-PM-980x192.png 980w, https://engineertodeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-9.07.23-PM-480x94.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>The bundled and minified CSS file <code>output.9a3d8d8fb748.css</code> is on line two. Awesome, Django compressor took our two child template CSS files, bundled them, and minified them—this will reduce network requests and speed up browser download and parsing times!</p>



<p>We can use Django Compressor to do the same with our JavaScript files too. In the next section, let’s learn how we can further optimize our template’s CSS files.</p>



<h2>Reducing Render-Blocking CSS with Media Attributes</h2>



<p>CSS files can quickly become bloated with a bunch of rules our page doesn’t need. For example, if someone accesses your site on a mobile device, they don’t need to parse the tablet and desktop styles before using the webpage. They only need the mobile styles.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we have a way around this with the <code>media</code> attribute. We can add a <code>media</code> attribute to the link tag to conditionally parse styles before rendering, depending on screen size. The other CSS files are still downloaded, but they are no longer render-blocking, meaning the browser doesn’t wait for them to load before rendering the webpage.</p>



<p>Let’s look at an example using our child template and base template. Inside the base template, define a new block called <code>mobile_styles</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;head&gt;
    {% <em>compress</em> css %}
    {% <em>block</em> mobile_styles %}

    {% <em>endblock</em> %}
    {% <em>endcompress</em> %}
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Now, let’s add the mobile stylesheet in the child template.</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">{% <em>block</em> mobile_styles %}
&lt;link <em>rel</em>="stylesheet" <em>href</em>="{% static 'css/index-mobile.css' %}" <em>media</em>="(max-width: 520px)"&gt;
{% <em>endblock</em> %}</code></pre>



<p>If we test this out in the browser, we see that both mobile and desktop stylesheet are still downloaded, but only one was render-blocking depending on our screen size. If we resize the browser window, we will see the mobile stylesheet affect screen sizes below 520px.</p>



<p>Perfect, we are now loading less render-blocking CSS—this will improve our largest contentful paint and first input delay metrics.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Congrats on finishing the tutorial! You should now know how to optimize your Django template’s CSS and JavaScript using Django Compressor and reducing render-blocking CSS. </p>



<p>In the <a href="https://engineertodeveloper.com/faster-django-apps-optimizing-templates-part-2/">next tutorial</a>, we will look at optimizing images in our Django templates—images have a massive impact on page load speed performance.</p>

        <p>Published on: 2020-12-16</p>
        
<p>I'm going to consider a fairly unpopular idea: most efforts towards "explainable AI" are essentially pointless. Useful as an academic pursuit and topic for philosophical debate, but not much else.</p>
<p>Consider this article a generator of interesting intuitions and viewpoints, rather than an authoritative take-down of explainability techniques.</p>
<p>That disclaimer aside:</p>
<hr>
<p>What if almost every problem for which it is desirable to use machine learning is unexplainable?</p>
<p>At least unexplainable in an efficient-enough way to be worth explaining. Whether it is an algorithm or a human that is doing the explanation.</p>
<p>Let's define "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">explainable AI</a>" in a semi-narrow sense, inspired by the DARPA definition, as an inference system that can answer the questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why was that prediction made as a function of our inputs and their interactions?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under what conditions would the outcome differ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How confident can we be in this prediction and why is the confidence such?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why might we be unable to answer the above questions in a satisfactory manner for most machine learning algorithms? I think I can name four chief reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some problems are just too complex to explain. Often enough, these are perfect problems for machine learning, it's exactly their intractability to our brains that makes them ideal for equation-generating algorithms to solve.</li>
<li>Some problems, while not that complex, are really boring and no human wants or should be forced to understand them.</li>
<li>Some problems can be understood, but understanding in itself is different for every single one of us, and people's culture and background often influence what "understanding" means. So explainable for one person is not explainable for another.</li>
<li>Even given an explanation that everyone agrees on, this usually puts us no closer to most of what we want to achieve with said explanation, things like gathering better data or removing "biases" from our models.</li>
</ol>
<h2>I - Unexplainable due to complexity</h2>
<p>Let's say, physicists, take in 100 PetaBytes of experimental data, reduce them using equations, and claim with a high probability that there exists this thing called a "Higgs Boson" with implications for how gravity works, among other things.</p>
<p>The resulting Boson can probably be defined within a few pages of text via things such as mass, the things it decays into, its charge, its spin, the various interactions it can have with other particles, and so on.</p>
<p>But if a luddite like myself asks the physicists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did you predict this fundamental particle exists?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will either get a "press conference answer" which carries no meaning other than providing a "satisfying" feeling, but it doesn't answer any of the above questions.</p>
<p>It doesn't tell me why the data shows the existence of the Higgs Boson, it doesn't tell me how the data could have been different in order for this not to be the case, and it doesn't tell me how confident they are in this inference and why.</p>
<p>If I press for an answer that roughly satisfies the explainability criteria I mentioned above, I will at best get them to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, the standard model is a fairly advanced concept in physics, so you first have to understand that and why it came to be. Then you have to understand the experimental statistics needed to interpret the kind of data we work with here. In the process, you'll obviously learn quantum mechanics, but to understands the significance of the Higgs boson specifically it's very important that you have an amazing grasp of general relativity, since part of the reason we defined it as is and why it's so relevant is because it might be a unifying link between the two theories. Depending on how smart you are this might take 6 to 20 years to wrap your head around, really you won't even be the same person by the time you're done with this. And oh, once you get your Ph.D. and work with us for half a decade there's a chance you'll disagree with your statistics and our model and might think that we are wrong, which is fine, but in that case, you will find the explanation unsatisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are fine with this, since physics is bound to be complex, it earns its keep by being useful and making predictions about very specific things with very tight error margins, its fundamental to all other areas of scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>When we say that we "understand" physics what we really mean is that there are a few dozen of thousands of blokes that spent half their lives turning their brains into hyper-optimized physics-thinking machines and they assure us that they "understand" it.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the edges of physics are a black box, I know physics works because Nvidia sells me GPUs with more VRAM each year and I'm able to watch videos of nuclear reactors glowing on youtube while patients in the nearby oncology ward are getting treated with radiation therapy.</p>
<p>This is true for many complex areas, we "understand" them because a few specialists say they do, and the knowledge that trickles down from those specialists has results that are obvious to all. Or, more realistically, because a dozen-domain long chain of specialists combined, each relying on the other, is able to produce results that are obvious to all.</p>
<p>As long as there is a group of specialist that understands the field, as long as those specialists can prove to us that their discoveries can affect the real world (thus excluding groups of well-synchronized insane people) and as long as they can teach other people to understand the field... we claim that it's "understood".</p>
<hr>
<p>But what about a credit risk analysis "AI" making a prediction that we should loan Steve at most 14,200$?</p>
<p>The model making this prediction might be operating with TBs worth of data about Steve, his browsing history, his transaction history, his music preferences, a video of him walking into the bank... each time he walked into the bank for the last 20 years, various things data aggregators tell us about him, from his preference about clothing to the likelihood he wants to buy an SUV, and of course, the actual stated purpose Steve gave us for the credit, both in text and as a video recording.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the "AI" has been trained on previous data from millions of people similar to Steve and the outcomes of the loans handed to then, thus working with petabytes of data in order to draw the 1-line conclusion of "You should loan steve, at most, 14,200$, if you want to probabilistically make a profit".</p>
<p>If we ask the AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is the maximum loan 14,200$? How did the various inputs and their interactions contribute to coming up with this number?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the real answer is probably something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, I can explain this to you, but 314,667,344,401 parameters had a significant role in coming up with this number, and if you want to "truly" understand that then you'd have to understand my other 696,333,744,001 parameters and the ways they related to each other in the equation. In order to do this, you have to gain an understanding of human-gate analysis as well as how its progress over time relates to life-satisfaction, credit history analysis, shopping preference analysis, error theory behind the certainty of said shopping preferences, and about 100 other mini-models that end up coalescing into the broader model that gave this prediction. And the way they "coalesce" is even more complex than any of the individual models. You can probably do this given 10 or 20 years, but basically, you'd have to re-train your brain from scratch to be like an automated risk analyst, you'd only be able to explain this to another automated risk analysts, and the "you" "understanding" my decision will be quite different from the "you" that is currently asking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even the above is an optimist take assuming the "AI" is made of multiple modules that are somewhat explainable.</p>
<p>So, is the "AI" unexplainable here?</p>
<p>Well, not more so than the physicists are. Both of them can, in theory, explain the reasoning behind their choice. But in both cases, the reasoning is not simple, there's no single data point that is crucial, if even a few inputs were to change slightly the outcome might be completely different, but the input space is so fast it's impossible to reason about all significant changes to it.</p>
<p>This is just the way things are in physics and it might be just the way things are in credit risk analysis. After all, there's no fundamental rule of the universe saying it should be easy to comprehend by the human mind. The reason this is more obvious in physics is simply because physicists have been gathering loads of data for a long time. But it might be equally true in all other fields of inquiry, based on current models, it probably is. It's just that those other fields didn't have enough data nor the intelligence required to grok through it until recently.</p>
<h2>II - Some problems are boring</h2>
<p>There is a class of problems that is complex, but not as complex as to be impenetrable to the vast majority of human minds.</p>
<p>To harken back to the physics example, think classical mechanics. Given the observations made by Galileo and some training in analysis, most of us could, in principle, understand classical mechanics.</p>
<p>But this is still difficult, it requires a lot of background knowledge, although fairly common and useful background knowledge and a significant amount of times. Ranging from, say, a day to several months depending on the person.</p>
<p>This is time well spent learning classical mechanics, but what if the problem domain was something else, say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out if a blotch on a dental CT scan is more likely to indicate a streptococcus or a lactobacillus infection.</li>
<li>Understanding what makes an image used to advertise a hiking pole attractive to middle-class Slovenians over the age of 54.</li>
<li>Figuring out, using l2 data, if the spread for the price of soybean oil is too wide, and whether the bias is towards the sell or buy.</li>
<li>Finding the optimal price at which to pre-sell a new brand of luxury sparkling water based on yet uncertain …</li></ul></div></div>

  <p><span>!☕</span> This tutorial will guide you through writing the
“Hello World” program in the C programming language. You’ll use Unix-style terminal
emulators and command-line tools to execute commands, Linux-style package managers to
install programs and libraries, the GNU nano text editor to write C code, the meson build
system to build executable programs and the Gtk+ library to write portable, cross-platform
graphical programs.</p>

<p>Instructions&nbsp;for&nbsp;three operating systems are provided: macOS, Ubuntu Linux and
Windows. The selected tools are personal favorites and were hand picked to allow the
fastest development and to allow identical development flows (and thus seamless
environment switching) on the three operating systems. All tools used in this tutorial are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">free, open source software</a>
and can be downloaded and used without any issues. No programming experience is required,
as this tutorial is for absolute beginners.</p>

<h3 id="before-we-start-terminals">Before we start: terminals</h3>

<p>There are a few notes for absolute beginners that will make our path easier and faster to
understand: to stay short, the tutorial will only guide through the setup process, but
will not teach the C language; references for next steps will be given at the end; some
program downloads may be large and take some time.</p>

<p>Programming languages and textual commands are very different from spoken languages:
programs must be written in a very strict way. Miss a comma and the program will stop
working. The most important rule for a beginner is that the C language, like most other
programming languages, is case sensitive, that is, upper case letters are considered
distinct from lower case letters and one can’t be swapped for the other. Keep this in mind
when typing the code and when in doubt copy and paste it to make sure all symbols are
correctly written.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ll&nbsp;use&nbsp;the terminal emulator application to type textual commands. I’ll
succintly explain what each command does and will show each command written after a dollar
sign. The dollar sign represents the terminal emulator’s prompt symbol, and that’s the
usual symbol that the command line input program, called the shell, displays when waiting
for a command. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, we type after the prompt symbol: <code>ls[space][minus]l</code>, then press
<code>[enter]</code> to execute. In this example, we execute the <code>ls</code> program (list directory) with
the <code>-l</code> parameter (a specific parameter for the program, changes the output mode to long,
or more descriptive). Same example, but also showing the resulting output in my computer:</p>

<pre>$ ls -l
total 7344
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users    9999 set 19 19:12 coffee-34251.svg
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users     347 set 19 19:12 coffee-34251.svg.license
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users   16805 set 19 19:12 favicon.ico
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users    3253 set 19 19:12 favicon.svg
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users   11665 out  2 18:49 index.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users   17833 set 19 19:12 not-coffee.svg
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users 2372085 set 19 19:12 radio.caf
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users 2656465 set 19 19:12 radio.mka
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users 2401864 set 19 19:12 radio.opus
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users    3263 out  2 16:48 site.css
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users    2166 set 19 19:12 square.svg
$ </pre>

<p>So,&nbsp;after&nbsp;running the <code>ls</code> program with the <code>-l</code> parameter, it shows the long
description of current directory and another dollar symbol appears at the end, it’s
waiting for a new command. Don’t worry about understanding this example, I’ll also add
references at the end for learning more about using Unix-style command-line tools.</p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator" target="_blank">terminal emulator</a>.
    Modern terminals are software that emulate physical terminals.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Different&nbsp;procedures&nbsp;are required for each operating system. Pick the best one
for you. After installing, writing and running code will work the same way. We’ll write a
single cross-platform program that works on all three systems and build it using the same
cross-platform build tools.</p>

<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>

<p>For macOS, only the terminal emulator comes installed with the operating system. The Apple
provided C compiler is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang" target="_blank">LLVM clang compiler</a>,
contained in the “Xcode command line tools” package. To install it, open the Terminal
application by opening the Spotlight search input, then typing Terminal (or find it in the
Utilities folder inside Applications). In the terminal emulator, type:</p>

<pre><code>$ xcode-select --install
</code></pre>

<p>The Xcode installation program will start. Follow the instructions that will appear and in
the end, the LLVM clang C compiler will be installed. You can check if it’s working by
executing it with the <code>--version</code> parameter:</p>

<pre><code>$ clang --version
</code></pre>

<p>For installing packages like build tools, text editors and libraries, we’ll install the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_manager)" target="_blank">Homebrew package manager</a>,
which is the main Linux-style package manager for macOS. The package manager allows
single-command installing, configuring, upgrading and removing of packages from the
command line. Go to <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">brew.sh</a> and access the
instructions there, or simply execute this command to download and install it:</p>

<pre><code>$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this command is already more complex than the previous ones, downloading and
executing the install script from the Homebrew source code repository, and gives a hint on
the power and efficiency of the command line. Don’t worry trying to understand it, we’re
installing Homebrew exactly to make it easy to execute complex package installations.
[<strong>edit 20201214</strong>: It might be necessary to restart the Terminal App and configure the
search path after installing <code>brew</code> to be able to use it. When in doubt, check the
<a href="https://docs.brew.sh/">Homebrew documentation</a>.]</p>

<p>Now that Homebrew is installed, you may install packages with <code>brew install</code> and search
packages with <code>brew search</code>. Search and install the GNU nano text editor with:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew search nano
$ brew install nano
</code></pre>

<h4 id="linux">Linux</h4>

<figure>
  <a href="https://not.cafe/assets/2020/gcc-on-ubuntu.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://not.cafe/assets/2020/gcc-on-ubuntu.png" alt="gcc on Ubuntu">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Installing gcc on Ubuntu Linux.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ll&nbsp;use&nbsp;the apt package manager available in
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Linux</a> from the Debian family, but
other Linux distributions using, for example,
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/how-manage-packages" target="_blank">yum</a>,
<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/" target="_blank">dnf</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman" target="_blank">pacman</a>,
etc. will work in pretty much the same way. On Linux the
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU Compiler Collection</a>
usually comes preinstalled, so we’ll use it instead of clang, but they work the same way.
Open a terminal by clicking the activities menu on the top left of the screen and writing
terminal in the search input (or click on the terminal icon in the favorites bar). In the
terminal emulator, write:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install gcc
</code></pre>

<p>Ubuntu Linux and most other distributions require switching to administrator (root) mode
to install programs, so we use the <code>sudo</code> program to execute <code>apt-get</code> in root mode (you
may also use the <code>su</code> program, if <code>sudo</code> is not installed). Type your password and follow
the instructions. In the end, check gcc:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc --version
</code></pre>

<p>You may install packages with <code>sudo apt-get install</code> and search packages with <code>apt-cache
search</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-cache search nano
$ sudo apt-get install nano
</code></pre>

<p>For other Linux distributions, use the appropriate package manager:</p>

<pre><code>$ yum search nano         # for RedHat Linux/CentOS
$ sudo yum install nano   # for RedHat Linux/CentOS
</code></pre>

<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>

<figure>
  <a href="https://www.msys2.org/" target="_blank">

    <a href="https://www.msys2.org/" target="_blank">MSYS2 website</a>. MSYS2 is a
    toolkit for Windows development that contains Unix-style tools.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For Windows we’ll use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingw-w64#MSYS2" target="_blank">MSYS2 toolkit</a>,
which provides a terminal emulator, the pacman package manager and a complete set of
Unix-style command line tools. Download the MSYS2 installer from
<a href="https://www.msys2.org/" target="_blank">www.msys2.org</a> and follow the
instructions to install the package. When installed, MSYS2 will provide three sets of
programs, which are selected whenever opening the terminal emulator. They are called the
MSYS2 shell, the MINGW64 shell (pronounced mingwee 64) and the MINGW32 shell. The MINGW64
shell is the appropriate one to develop Windows programs. The MSYS2 is appropriate for
managing MSYS2 itself and the MINGW32 is the 32-bit version that shouldn’t be used
anymore. After installing MSYS2 it’s necessary to immediatelly upgrade it. Open the MSYS2
shell and type:</p>

<pre><code>$ pacman -Syu
</code></pre>

<p>Follow the instructions and if requested restart the terminal emulator. On Windows we’ll
use the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU Compiler Collection</a> C
compiler (gcc):</p>

<pre><code>$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
</code></pre>

<p>After installing, to test gcc, you must use a MINGW64 shell. If you’re running the MSYS2
shell for executing pacman, open another terminal running the MINGW64 shell and type:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc --version
</code></pre>

<p>From now on, we’ll assume that the MINGW64 shell is being used. Notice that pacman runs
normally both on MSYS2 and MINGW64 shells. You may install packages with <code>pacman -S</code> and
search packages with <code>pacman -Ss</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ pacman -Ss nano
$ pacman -S nano
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>The beauty industry covers a wide range of submarkets – skincare, spas, fragrance, haircare, cosmetics, and makeup. For over two decades, the beauty industry has noted a drastic change in the way things run and how users get the products they want.</p>
<p>As technology evolves, beauty brands carry the burden of developing and fitting in products that are very tangible yet psychological to users. They adjust to users” personal preferences as commodities become more customized, and they move with tech trends to stay relevant.<br>You could wonder, how can the beauty industry use tech to their advantage? Beauty products are physical, sold in retail stores, and people physically apply them to their bodies. As the world leaped into new technological grounds, the beauty industry adapted gracefully. From <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/shopware-ecommerce">eCommerce</a></strong> to AI, outstanding innovations and entrepreneurship have swept across this industry during the last couple of decades. In this article, we would look at what in that period revolutionized the beauty industry.</p>
<div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Social media</h4><p>We can’t talk about the revolution of the beauty industry without talking about social media. The penetration of social media into the daily lives of people is one of the major catalysts to the online boom of beauty products and lifestyle.<br>Social media brought the “influencer” and “following” culture, paving the way for a new form of brand marketing and beauty entrepreneurs. Social media platforms like Instagram helped brands cultivate a strong visual online presence to promote their products. The rise of influencers, who have turned into full-fledged entrepreneurs, has changed the way users engage with brands and discover new products. With YouTube, influencers showed consumers how to apply makeup, use each product, and recommend the best ones.<br>Some brands focus solely on online marketing, brand ambassadorship, and influencer power, shunning traditional marketing to push products that sell in hours. One such <em>internetpreneur</em> is one of the world’s most famous influencers and former youngest billionaire, Kylie Jenner. By focusing on her online power, Kylie Jenner created an extensively successful lipstick brand named after her – Kylie Cosmetics. A brand she built into a billion-dollar business and which earned her “the youngest billionaire” status.<br>Social media platforms like Instagram and Pinterest are tapping into the consumer culture trajectory, making influencers’ provisions to get consumers to their page and sell to them immediately. Instagram came up with the addition of Instagram Shopping, an option that provides a storefront for consumers to explore ‘best’ and ‘featured’ products. The option also allows consumers to make purchases directly from the Instagram platform. This opportunity means that everyone, including visual artists of all kinds, can quickly turn all their photos into product images.<br>Another interesting approach is the Pinterest’s <em>Shoppable Pin</em>, an option that lets consumers find a product pin and then tap it to visit the retailer"s website.<br>Social media platforms allow consumers to do reviews and add comments. Talking about their personal experiences on a particular feature or product provides an easy source of feedback for brands that need to connect to their consumers. Users could also rate a product, which is exceptionally important since most potential buyers actively seek it before making a significant and long-term investment in a purchase.</p>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>E-Commerce</h4><p>COVID pandemic and lockdown issues immensely affected the beauty industry since the world couldn’t focus on beauty while people are more concerned with survival matters. But somehow, the industry pulled through and still clocks good revenue.<br>One of the beauty industry"s biggest strengths is using strong visuals to create digital experiences for users. Leveraging on this and <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/services/ui-ux-design">great UX</a></strong> (user experience), they create smooth digital experiences for users by making products available on online stores.<br>These online stores showcase as many products as possible for consumers to choose from. Customers can compare, analyze, and pay for the product right on the spot. Filters allow users to compare products based on price, ingredients, core technology, delivery time, and brand.<br>Detailed product descriptions allow users to read in-depth about a brand product and transparent customer reviews could be the push a consumer needs to lock on a product. With e-commerce, consumers have all the information they need to buy a product from the comfort of their homes.<br>Ecommerce platforms like Alibaba are tapping into the beauty industry by collaborating with big brands to create digital apps inclined towards beauty and skincare. In 2019, the collaboration between L’Oreal China and Alibaba led to the launch of the first AI mobile-based application for acne diagnosis. They also created Midnight Cream, the first consumer-to-business reverse innovation product.&nbsp; </p>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Augmented Reality (AR)</h4><p>Consumers are usually unsure about which products to try. They might also be worried if a particular product fits their skin tone and how it will look on them. Augmented reality is mostly seen as a technology for gamers, but beauty brands have incorporated this technology into mobile apps and e-commerce.<br>This technology allows users to see how products would look like on them. There is an entire collection of clothes, jewelry, eyewear, and makeup that users can try on without even leaving the screen.<br>Applications like Cosmia Makeup, developed by Skywell Software and Modiface owned by L’Oreal, Sephora Virtual Artists, are popular apps that use AR. They are a perfect blend of AI, and virtual assistance, tailored to meet users’ preferred tastes. They work in real-time, taking accurate face measurements so cosmetics can fit in the right spots.<br>AR isn’t just a cool technology. Driven by current digital styles, it works well with e-commerce and online engagement. It is an excellent way for brands to engage their users, letting them try out products before purchase. It boosts the buyers’ confidence to make purchases and reduces the possibility they experience remorse.</p>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h4><p>One of the issues consumers of beauty products have is finding <strong>the right fit</strong>. Skin tone, color, texture, age, and type are crucial factors when selecting the perfect match. Some brands like Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty have capitalized on the lack of skin color diversity inclusion to create and sell products with shades for all skin colors.<br>AI technology in the beauty industry has opened doors to more consumer personalization. This technology promises to find the ‘exact match’ to users. AI-powered beauty apps scan the skin and recommend the perfect beauty formula using powerful algorithms. Skincare routine, makeup combination, and other beauty routines can be set for particular consumers, using information from the person’s image.<br>Modiface Skin AI, an app owned by Modiface, detects skin changes such as dryness, dark spots, and discoloration.<br>L’Oreal and Alibaba’s Effaclar Spotscan is an AI-powered app that scans the face for acne. The application uses thousands of images of people with different skin types and acne issues. Thanks to the extensive database, the AI can effectively narrow down to the exact problem a person is experiencing. They also provide professional advice from an expert dermatologist on how best to treat that type of acne.<br>AI personalization isn’t just limited to skincare. There are smart mirrors like HiMirror, a skin detector, and a skin tracking mirror. A perfect blend of AR and AI stimulates up to five different lighting scenarios for various settings – office, mall, party, etc. These settings allow you to apply the right makeup for each occasion. You could also use AR to stimulate what your makeup would look like before you apply it.<br>Tmall Genie Queen is also an AI-powered mirror from Alibaba that auto-adjusts it’s lighting, recreating different makeup application modes. These smart mirrors also have a 3D effect, allowing you to see your makeup from different angles or a 360 rotation.<br>Haircare is not falling behind when it comes to <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/tech-expertise/machine-learning-ai">AI tech</a></strong>. Choicify is an app from Henkel Beauty Care in Germany that allows users to choose the right hair color. The app is personalized to each consumer and provides the right solutions for hair affairs, recommending suitable products and customizations.</p>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Virtual Assistants</h4><p>Virtual assistants for beauty brands can come in different forms, but notable are voice assistants who help users find the perfect product. They could also work through an entire makeup or skin routine with consumers, acting as guides.<br>Virtual assistants are AI-powered, allowing them to store personalized information about a user and using that information when needed. Because of their wide range of expert knowledge, they are quick resources for users who have challenges or need some questions answered immediately. They are a perfect way for brands to provide instant, around-the-clock customer solutions for their users.<br>Coty, a global beauty brand, worked with Google Assistant to launch a Clairol Color Expert. Clairol Color Expert is a hands-free, voice-activated guide at home for the hair color process. It helps users find the right hair shade product and care. Like all voice assistants, it activates when just saying ‘Hey Google, talk to Clairol.’<br>By creating this technology, Coty has provided a resource for consumers on all google enabled devices, speakers, and smartphones, thereby widening the reach of technology and innovation in the beauty industry.</p>
</div></div>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The beauty industry has catered to the needs of women for a very long time. They will also be catering to the needs of people for a long time to come. We must note that big beauty brands are not interested in diving into tech; neither do they see themselves as tech companies. But an industry or brand that is to stay relevant must work with current trends and technology, and the beauty industry is no different.<br>By incorporating …</p></div></div>

<p>Bad air is bad for you. The air purifier market, though, is a mess. Every purifier uses incompatible proprietary filters, presumably to lock you into buying replacements. How do we know these actually work? Few seem to publish lab tests. And why does it cost $100-$300 for a big plastic box with a fan and a filter inside?</p>

<p>It’s common to build DIY air purifiers by basically strapping a filter to a fan. I like the idea of these, but again, it’s hard to be confident they really work. There’s a few experiments out there, but not enough to make me comfortable. So I decided to do some experimenting of my own. I made a purifier, generated smoke, and measured how well it removes tiny particles.</p>



<p>If you’re in a hurry, this post says that if you strap two HEPA filters to a box fan, it will clear the air of basically all the particles we can measure, and it will do it faster than a commercial filter that costs twice as much.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="in a large room the DIY filter does slightly better than the commercial filter"></p>



<h3 id="diy-purifier">DIY purifier</h3>

<p>My DIY purifier was <em>very</em> simple. (I don’t want to promote any particular brands here. Contact me if you want the exact products.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>A standard box fan. (Cost: $19)</li>
  <li>Two HEPA air filters, each approximately 32 cm x 22 cm and 5cm thick. (Cost: $35 for both)</li>
  <li>A bungie cord. (Cost: Free)</li>
</ul>

<p>Assembly takes about 30s. You put the filters on the intake side of the fan and strap them on with the bungie cord. Here’s a picture:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_notape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>Timeless elegance and grace, it is not. I get the shakes just looking at that bit of crinkled filter.</p>

<h3 id="commercial-purifier">Commercial purifier</h3>

<p>As a comparison, I got a $100 air purifier from a well-known brand that’s intended for small rooms. It uses uses a single HEPA filter that’s about 25cm x 12cm and 4cm thick. Replacement filters currently cost around $25.</p>

<h3 id="smoke">Smoke</h3>

<p>It’s surprisingly hard to repeatedly generate a consistent amount of smoke. I tried burning various things (paper, cardboard) and found that the number of particles generated can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on the burn pattern. This is difficult to control and effectively random.</p>

<p>Ideally, I’d have liked to burn some food product like oil, since the kitchen is usually the biggest source of indoor air pollution. I couldn’t figure out a good way of doing this, either: You’d need to have the same amount of oil distributed in the same way and heated to the same temperature.</p>

<p>I finally settled on using incense. I cut sticks to the length of a standard credit card and then attached the ends horizontal to the ground. This seemed to be pretty consistent. In retrospect, I bet that burning toast in a toaster would work well. (I didn’t have one on hand.)</p>

<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>

<p>I borrowed a cheap-ish ($100) air quality monitor from a friend. I think it’s made by some company in China and then re-sold by various white-label brands. I can’t figure out who the original manufacturer is. Based on data I’ve seen for the reliability of other air quality monitors, I wouldn’t trust the absolute numbers, but the I think the <em>relative</em> measurements should still be OK.</p>

<p>The typical measurement for particulate pollution is “PM 2.5” which is in units of μg/m³. This is intended to measure what you’d get if you did the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a cubic meter of air.</li>
  <li>Filter all the solid particles out of the air.</li>
  <li>Keep only the solid particles that are are 2.5 micrometers (μm) or smaller.</li>
  <li>Weigh all the particles you kept in micrograms (μg).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some ways to interpret these numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The EPA says yearly averages should be below 12 and daily averages below 35.</li>
  <li>The average outdoor level ranges from 6 in Finland to almost 100 in Nepal. Rich countries are typically under 15. The highest levels are typically found in Asia and Africa.</li>
  <li>Cooking can easily cause PM 2.5 measurements to spike into the hundreds. I’ve observed myself that this can happen with only a small amount of visible smoke.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Since the air quality monitor doesn’t log data, I used an ultra-hacky alternative: I set the monitor next to a laptop running a stopwatch. I then aimed a tabet at both of those screens and took a timelapse video. Finally, I manually transcribed the data by going to each minute marker in the data. (This was even more tedious than it sounds.)</p>



<p>I ran a first experiment in a tiny room of around 8 ㎥. Due to worries that wind from the purifiers might change the speed the incense burned, I placed it on the opposite side of a wall, with a gap of around 20 cm near the ceiling.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_tinyroom.jpg" alt="tiny room setup"></p>

<p>I repeated the experiment once with no filter, once with a commercial filter, and once with the DIY filter. Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_linear.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>Things are a bit random around the beginning, probably due to the drifting of the smoke before it’s equalized in the room. With no filter at all, this spikes all the way to 1000 μg/m³, the maximum the instrument can show.</p>

<p>If we make the y-axis logarithmic, it becomes quite clear that the DIY filter is cleaning the air at a better rate. (This is the picture from the top of this page.)</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in log space"></p>

<p>If we take the EPA’s threshold of 12 μg/m³, the DIY filter gets there in around 15 minutes, while the commercial filter take around 25 minutes.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I don’t spend most of my time in an 8 ㎥ room. Thus, I repeated the experiment in a large room of around 100 ㎥. Here there was no wall between incense and purifier. Instead I left around a meter of distance between the incense and purifier and the purifier and the monitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_largeroom.jpg" alt="large room setup"></p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_linear.jpg" alt="large room measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>There’s even more randomness around the beginning, probably just due to how the smoke drifts around. Based on the room volume we’d expect a peak concentration with no filter of around 80 μg/m³ = 1000 μg/m³ * (8/100). Reassuringly, this is pretty close to what we see.</p>

<p>The DIY purifier looks a bit better. If we plot in log space, it’s more clear that it is indeed filtering at a better rate:</p>

<p>It’s common advice for DIY purifiers like this to seal around the edges of the filter so that all air must pass through it.  I share the intuition that this would help, but it’s hard to be sure: If you block airflow, you slow down the fan. This could be counterproductive.</p>

<p>In this case at least, experiment is easier than theory. I took packing tape and carefully sealed around the intake side.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_tape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier with tape" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>And the results are…</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/taping.jpg" alt="taping around the filter has no effect"></p>

<p>…nothing!?</p>

<p>This was unexpected. I thought the tape would help, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if it hurt instead. Instead, there’s basically no difference at all. I don’t know enough about fluid dynamics to even speculate about what’s happening here, so I won’t try.</p>

<p>There could be some weird quirk in how I ran this experiment. This doesn’t necessarily mean that all the advice to tape around the filter is <em>wrong</em>. However, I’ve never seen any experriments that show taping helps either.</p>



<p><strong>Cost.</strong> The DIY purifier isn’t dramatically cheaper than the commercial one, but I expect the filters would need to be replaced much less often. The commercial purifier uses a single filter with an area of 300 cm², whereas the DIY purifier uses two filters with a total area of around 1400 cm², and also slightly thicker. It’s reasonable to assume the DIY filters could remove ~4 times as many particles before replacement.</p>

<p><strong>Durability.</strong> One concern is that box fans aren’t meant to be used with filters attached and could wear out. This is reasonable. However, box fans are much cheaper than commercial purifiers, and I’ve been using this particular fan with various filters attached for several years now without issue.</p>

<p><strong>Electricity.</strong> The cost of electricity is another factor. Typical box fans seem to use around 55W, whereas commercial purifiers typically use 30-45W. If electricity costs $0.13 / kWh, the box fan would cost around $62 to operate 24 hours a day for a year, while a 30-watt purifier would cost around $34. Obviously, these numbers decrease if you run the purifier less. Some (more expensive) commercial purifiers have air quality sensors built in and automatically turn on only when needed.</p>

<p><strong>MERV or HEPA?</strong> Most people who build box-fan purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_efficiency_reporting_value">MERV</a>-rated filters intended for furnaces. Commercial air purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA">HEPA</a>-rated filters. Roughly speaking, HEPA filters are “better” in that they are rated to remove a higher percentage of particles in one pass. It’s not clear that HEPA filter will actual perform better when attached to a fan, though: A filter that catches fewer particles in one pass might still be better if it allows for faster airflow.</p>

<p><strong>That one video.</strong> If you’re reading this article after it was linked from some forum, I’d bet you that someone in the comments links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5APw_SLUU">this video</a> from the Michigan Sinus Center. I found this inspirational, but note a couple of things: First, while the description says they use HEPA filter, the video clearly indicates a MERV filter. Again, that’s not necessarily bad! They claim that around 90% of particles sized 0.3 microns are larger are eliminated in a single pass. That’s good, but not totally reassuring. The question is, does it remove 99% in two passes? If 90% of the particles in the ambient air were large and the filter only catches large particles, then additional passes would never get rid of the most dangerous small particles. This is why I trust HEPA filters a bit more: since they remove almost all particles in one pass, I’m confident they should remove almost all particles eventually. This is also why I strongly prefer experiments that actually measure particles removed from the air in a room, rather than just the air coming out of the purifier.</p>

<p><strong>Further questions.</strong> There’s a lot of things that further experiments could look at:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the fan speed make a huge difference?</li>
  <li>How does the purifier compare to larger commercial purifiers?</li>
  <li>How do MERV-rated furnace-type filters compare under the same conditions?</li>
  <li>How can it not matter if there’s tape around the filters!?</li>
  <li>Does fan speed matter? (I always ran the box fan at maximum speed.)</li>
  <li>Is it better to put the filters on the intake or outtake side of the …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

                    Service</h2>

                <h3 id="emergence-of-emobility">Emergence of mobility concepts</h3>

                <p>
                    Before the digital revolution and user-centric approach, the concept of accessible, new forms of
                    transportation was the future vision of what life could be like. With the rapid growth of
                    technology, mobile devices, enhanced battery capacities, wide Internet connection, investments in
                    new unexplored forms of service delivery, and quick social adaptation in the last ten years we have
                    witnessed a great transformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Raising enthusiasm boosted consumption and proved that rapid adaptation is possible and widely
                    accepted. New economic models have begun to take into account sharing concepts and value the
                    tangible benefits of such solutions. In a sharing economy, not used assets such as parked cars and
                    extra bedrooms can be rented out. We transferred from owning to renting. And this concept widely
                    approved first by Uber users moved to other transport areas offering new possibilities. In the
                    Alternative Journal article,
                    <a href="https://www.alternativesjournal.ca/science-and-solutions/ours-better-yours" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
                        ‘Ours is Better than Yours’
                    </a>
                    , Ray Tumulty (2014) the sharing economy is
                    described as a clearly urban phenomenon. To achieve economies of scale for shared economy services
                    satisfactory population density is required. Moreover, these services are seen as an extra option,
                    not a replacement for traditional sectors. Ridesharing is used along with public transportation in
                    cities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the growing success of rented items and services, new forms of transportation options come to
                    the market. The mobility concept grew to form a comprehensive ecosystem offering numerous moving
                    variants, such as city bikes, electric scooters, car rides, ticket purchasing options, city traffic
                    monitoring, planning the most convenient route, parking options, integrated payments, and available
                    charging options for ‘e’ users. All available in real-time from the mobile app on one’s phone. This
                    progress developed the term
                    <a href="https://solidstudio.io/blog/from-maas-to-emaas-how-e-is-taking-a-charge-over-the-markets.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">

                    , which covers a wide range of mobility services
                    available on the market, and its integral part becomes a shared economy providing extra value for
                    participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a high-level, the MaaS ecosystem includes transport infrastructure, transportation services,
                    transport information, and payment services. Within the ecosystem, the common objective is the
                    delivery of a seamless mobility experience and transportation network improvement by utilizing the
                    benefits of each service - public and private. Besides, other participants such as local authorities
                    or data administration companies can collaborate to smooth the operation of the services and improve
                    their profitability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MaaS as a definition is described as
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://solidstudio.io/img/blog/emobility-ebook/6.jpg" alt="MaaS definition" width="100%" height="auto">
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the MaaS ecosystem examples was presented by the Siemens Mobility Division in 2016 for
                    Tampere City, Finland. The ecosystem is build of 4 main elements: service providers; a
                    business-to-business (B2B) platform; mobility retailers; and the users. The intention of the project
                    was to unite the existing and upcoming transport services with the operations of the local
                    paratransit services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A similar approach on a high level was presented by König project ‘Mobility As A Service for Linking
                    Europe’. Four different levels define the public and regulatory level, the transport and logistics
                    service providers level, the mobility service level, and the end-user level. On the basis of similar
                    concepts and definitions, a framework for Mobility as a service was developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a business perspective, MaaS is described by Kamargianni and Matyas in the paper ‘The Business
                    Ecosystem of Mobility-as-a-Service’[1](2017) as ‘the wider network of enterprises that influences how a

                <p>
                    To support theoretical premises on shared mobility, a survey conducted by McKinsey&amp;Company (2017)
                    provides some insight into the consumer’s opinion on ride-hailing and car-sharing. Respondents were
                    asked how their usage of ride-hailing and car-sharing services will change within the next two
                    years. In both cases, over 60% responded that it will increase or increase significantly. Shared
                    mobility is mostly favored in urban areas, but seems to be less attractive for running errands or
                    multi-stop shopping trips.

                <h3 id="what-is-e">What is ‘e’ all about?</h3>

                <p>
                    We are an integral part of the next global transformation, where alternative fuels and green energy
                    takes charge. The concept explained above has been extended with ‘e’ - a possibility to travel in an
                    eco-friendly way, where ‘e’ stands for electric solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Electric Mobility as a service combines Mobility as a Service (MaaS), Electric Mobility Systems
                    (EMS), and Shared Electric Mobility Services (SEMS) [2]. As a concept eMaaS operates upon MaaS,
                    where the last one became one of the complementary components. With that defined, all MaaS
                    participants become, as a consequence, eMaaS attendees. Providing they offer electric mobility
                    solutions.

                <p><img src="https://solidstudio.io/img/blog/emobility-ebook/8.jpg" alt="MaaS definition" width="100%" height="auto">
                </p>

                <p>
                    Electric Mobility System (EMS) covers technologies (batteries, charging technologies, drivetrains,
                    and EVs), infrastructure (physical and organizational of charging stations, electricity grid,
                    information and communication technology), and users (manufacturers, suppliers, end-users, service
                    providers, governments, and agents).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shared Electric Mobility Services’ (SEMS) applies to a new economy implementation, where instead of
                    ownership there is an on-a-need basis share connected by the technology with users and providers.
                    SEMS replies to the environmental, social, financial, and transportation-related benefits that had
                    already been correlated to emobility and shared mobility practice connecting both. Five business
                    approaches are proposed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Membership-based (e.g. e-bike sharing, e-car sharing, e-ridesharing, e-ride hailing, e-scooter
                        sharing, e-bus sharing),
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Peer-to-Peer(e.g. e-car sharing, e-bike sharing, e-scooter sharing),
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Non-membership-based (e.g. e-car rental, elimousine rental),
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For-hire (e.g. e-car/bike/scooter sharing, e-ridesharing e-carpooling),
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mass transit systems (e.g. e-Public Transport, airport autonomous shuttles).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As a part of a wider concept, combined with two other components MaaS &amp; EMS, together provides
                    multiple eco-friendly transportation possibilities. Successful implementation of such a concept
                    requires multi-level support, well-designed system architecture, and an extensive network in public
                    structures.
                </p>

                <h3 id="user-centric">User-centric approach</h3>

                <p>
                    The user-centric approach will always be foreground. It applies to the development of the widely
                    recognized concept of e-mobility as a service. From accessible payment methods for single ticket
                    purchasing, subscriptions, to well-developed charging networks and various means of transport
                    access. At each stage of the proposition should be declared value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are still in the early stages of what could be called e-Mobility as a service. Most customer
                    journeys are under development, and achieving overall flow is still in its infancy. There is a lot
                    of research to be done, but there is room for the general necessary approaches. Each of the
                    participants, in order to achieve success and remain successful in this growing market, …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I’ve been considering these concepts for a few years, and after spending a few years living in a small, economically-challenged community - I started to develop some ideas on how to power food sovereignty alongside traditional food sources like foraging, hunting, and fishing.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-small-scale-food-production-a-potential-solution">Distributed small-scale food production: A potential solution</h2>

<p>I realize this may be an idealistic approach, assuming people will be willing to take on the burden of learning new skills like animal husbandry, the many aspects of gardening, and the inevitable food preparation skills that are required to manage the outputs of such a system.</p>

<p>This being said, I think this could work for a minority of interested folks, and allow a more refined approach to a more accessible, possibly larger and possibly communal systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://permapeople.org/blog/assets/veg-garden-stella-de-smit.jpg" alt="Vegetable garden by Stella de Smit"></p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>This list will need to be specific to each region such a system would be rolled out in. For this system to work, we should define each required <em>_niche_</em> or <em>_zone_</em> (medicine, staple, protein, etc) as well as the <em>_method_</em> (intensive row-based or food-forest style) based on an amount of land/space available.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The system should</strong> <strong><em>not</em>:</strong></li>
  <li>Be a replacement for the grocery store</li>
  <li>
    <p>Be expected to feed a whole family exclusively</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The system should:</strong></li>
  <li>Follow the principles of permaculture</li>
  <li>Be supplementary to regular food purchasing/foraging/consumption</li>
  <li>Be easy to set up and get rolling (beginner crops for beginners)</li>
  <li>Maintenance should decrease year-over-year</li>
  <li>Material inputs should be free and should utilize waste products (compost, greywater) whenever possible</li>
  <li>Output should increase year-over-year</li>
  <li>Be scalable and easy to replicate</li>
  <li>Be easy to substitute items based on personal preference/needs</li>
  <li>Should support a range of diets</li>
  <li>Each element should serve two or more functions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="elements">Elements</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Staples - Something that is substantial, and worthy of being a main course. At least 2 crops in case of failure, most often annuals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medicine - Teas, herbs, healthful foods. Can easily grow 3+, often perennials</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fertilizer/Mulching - Beneficial to growth or maintenance of the entire system (preferably edible)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greens - Important for health, and fulfilling an important niche in western diets</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supplementary - Snacking foods, processable foods for jams or sauces</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protein - Most likely and accessible item is egg production, but not legal everywhere</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surplus - For use in feeding animals, wildlife, crafting, or trading with neighbours</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="example-system">Example system</h3>

<p>Based on my experiences living and growing in the temperate coastal rainforests (zone 7b), I’ve developed this example/conceptual list to complement the locally available forage:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Staples (2+)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti squash / Acorn / butternut - for its many benefits (groundcover, mulch, seed production, hardiness)</li>
      <li>Potatoes - would require creative integration if using <em>_food forest_</em> method</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Medicine (2+)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Mint / lemonbalm / lavender / rosemary</li>
      <li>Currants / Seabuckthorn</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Fertilizer/Mulching (1 per season)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Comfrey</li>
      <li>Clover / alfalfa</li>
      <li>Pigeon peas / siberian peas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Greens (2+)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Arugula</li>
      <li>Kale</li>
      <li>Giant red mustard</li>
      <li>Bok choi</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Supplementary (2)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Cucumber</li>
      <li>Apple tree (on Pacific crab-apple stock) / currant / blueberries / strawberry / raspberry</li>
      <li>Tomatoes</li>
      <li>Chives</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Protein (either/or)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>3x hens / ducks</li>
      <li>Chickpeas / beans</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Surplus</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Double-up on at least 2 choices from above</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-considerations-to-be-developed-further">Other considerations (to be developed further)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How can we empower economically-challenged communities through the use of food sovereignty?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would it take to convert the average non-gardener to start growing a sufficient amount of food?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would it take for the average non-gardener to benefit (enough to support) from an intensive, cooperative, multi-cultured field-cropping or food forest system?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How far can we scale such a system if it does exist?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the required inputs —  like space, water, and fertilizer?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the minimal outputs to make this a worthwhile endeavor?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>Get creating! As they say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The best time to plant a tree, is 10 years ago. The second best time is now.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unknown</li>
  </ul>

<p>Your beautiful app deserves more subscribers, do you agree? If so, there's good news. Offer Codes can help you convert more of your free users into paying. If you're interested in streamlining the money-making part of your engineering marvel, I invite you to dive into a few ways how to achieve it with me below.</p><p><strong>In the next 15 minutes, you’ll find out how to maximize visibility of your app by…</strong></p><p>1. Making students your best ambassadors<br>2. Leveling up your PR<br>3. Getting more attention with Giveaways<br>4. Rewarding loyal customers<br>5. Cross-promoting your apps</p><p>But first, let's quickly clarify the code diversity:</p><p>It's alright to be confused. I was too. There are 4 different App Store code types as of now, and they serve different purposes. I studied Apple's maze of docs, so you don't have to, and explained it in simple words.</p><h3 id="what-are-offer-codes-first-of-all">What are Offer Codes, First of All?</h3><p>They look like this: FMWPN78P7TTHLW3MKE (quite long, yep). You can share them with a prospective subscriber, so they redeem the code, and get your subscription with a time-limited discount.</p><p>What's particularly great about offer codes is that you can adjust literally everything: how much $$$ off your regular subscription price you want to offer, for how long they'll be paying the discounted price, and finally, for how long your offer will be redeemable.</p><p>It’s safe to call Offer Codes the most versatile marketing tool offered by the App Store since its release in November 2020. You can use them to attract new subscribers, win back the churned, or retain the existing. Limited at 150K codes per quarter per subscription, you'll barely feel a shortage. I doubt those who will are reading this 😁 And, Tokens will help you carefully dispense those codes—one per user—so you squeeze the most revenue out of that quarterly limit.</p><h3 id="but-we-ve-already-had-promo-codes-">But we've already had promo codes...</h3><p>Not quite the same thing. The difference is as vast as that between Apple Calendar and <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>. Both offer and promo codes can be distributed outside the app via QR codes, on blogs, in ads, on social media, etc. Users can redeem them via App Store or convenient <a href="https://tokn.co/_0zRVOgLO">tokn.co</a> links. Promo codes always give a 100% discount, i.e. if you give away a promo code, a person will get your subscription for free for its entire duration. Say, you have a $9.99/year sub. Give a promo code to this sub, and they will get 1 year for free. That's it—no other options. </p><p>With offer codes, you set your own rules. 30% off your $3.99/month subscription for 2 months? You got it. Free access to an annual subscription for 1 month? Not a problem. </p><p>You can generate just up to 100 promo codes per subscription per 6 months, whereas <strong>offer codes are limited to 150,000 per quarter per subscription</strong>! </p><p>Such a steep difference is easily justifiable by what you want to use these two for. Promo codes are good for driving extra sales indirectly. Send out free copies of your app to influencers and journalists. If they like and mention it, you'll get extra downloads that are yet to be converted into subscriptions. Offer codes are more about helping you to convert potential subscribers directly, without the influencer middleman. You wouldn't reach out to 150K journalists, would you? However, you may have that many potential customers.</p><p>Last but not least: promo codes expire in 28 days after generation, and offer codes—when you decide (max. 180 days).</p><h3 id="i-ve-also-heard-something-about-introductory-and-promotional-codes-">"I've also heard something about Introductory and Promotional Codes..."</h3><p>Yes, that's a thing, too. However, their marketing potential is rather limited as they can only be distributed within your app, so forget about running a 50% off giveaway or sending a free copy to that Italian Apple journalist using these two.</p><p><strong>If you're more into comparison tables, here's one from Apple itself:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/0-5RklpeUMNfQ-gqaa.png" alt="iOS App Store's Offer vs Introductory vs Promotional Codes comparison table"></figure><h2 id="let-s-translate-those-codes-into-revenue">Let's Translate Those Codes into Revenue</h2><p>Although I'm not a business mastermind who created apps that would be making billions of dollars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21123057/tinder-1-billion-dollars-match-group-revenue-earnings">Tinder</a>, I hope that a few strategies from my arsenal may be handy for fellow developers. They helped us at Gikken grow our best-in-class Mac and iOS translator app—<a href="https://gikken.co/mate-translate/mac/?ref=blog-oc">Mate</a>—4x in the last 2 years. We're a bootstrapped <a href="https://gikken.co/about?ref=blog-oc">three-person company</a> and we're careful about every dollar we make and spend. I'll be very happy if any of my takeaways will help you make more off of your awesome app!</p><p><em><strong>Note: I'll be using <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/?ref=blog-oc">Tokens</a> in my examples—the app that we made to help you generate offer and promo codes faster, and your users redeem them with ease—by just clicking on a link.</strong></em></p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/oc-article-3-1.png"><figcaption><strong>Left: promo code. Right: offer code. </strong>Don't make your users google how to redeem a code—Tokens wraps codes in tokn.co links that are easy to redeem.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="1-making-students-your-best-ambassadors">1. Making students your best ambassadors</h3><p>Many of us know firsthand that students are on a tight budget. However, it doesn't mean they don't deserve good software. For years, companies have been adjusting their regional prices according to purchasing power. You can think of student discounts as an even more caring income-based price adjustment.</p><p>On the upside for your app business, students are some of the most socially active folks out there. They meet a lot of people in classes, their dorm, at parties, etc. Make them your loyal users and you may get your best ambassadors. That surrendered 30% of your sub price will pay off over and above in new users they'll bring in. People love bragging with things they love. If your app is good (and I'm sure it is!), take down the price hurdle for students, so they can start loving it, and spreading the word.</p><p>When we launched a 50% discount for students and teachers on <a href="https://gikken.co/mate-translate/mac/?ref=blog-oc">Mate</a>, it took off instantly. Many students were discovering Mate but couldn't afford it. An easy-to-get discount took out this barrier. Now, edu sales account for around 15% of our revenue.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that in order to make it work like a charm, you need to automate it. It makes sense to test whether there's interest for your app among students by just directing them to your support email first, but it won't scale. It will hold back too many from claiming it (too much effort: come up with a message, write it, attach a student ID, wait for a reply, redeem a code). On the opposite, typing in a student discount and instantly getting a discount is totally frictionless and as fast as it just could be. No emailing or waiting involved. You sell it to them the moment they want it. Also, you certainly don't want even more emails in your support inbox.</p><p>Here's how we made it with Mate: user enters their student email, we validate it using <a href="https://github.com/leereilly/swot">this</a> fabulous library from GitHub, and if it's actually .edu, send a discount code to that address.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-17.06.06.png.pagespeed.ic.N8tvf_WQxR.png"><figcaption>Claim your 50% in 5 seconds by just using your student email.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether you go the easy way, and offer discounts via email support, or the harder but more efficient way—automate it. You may find Tokens helpful in dispensing those discounts. </p><p>Apple made creating offer codes a two-step story: they are stored in campaigns, or just offers. You set up an offer once and then you generate codes for it. You can top it up with more codes at any time. </p><p>First, I want to include one static link into my student emails, so it dispenses codes automatically—one per student. On the screenshot below, I create an offer that gives 50% off my subscription for 1 year:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-09-at-14.19.20.png"><figcaption>Select a subscription you want to offer a discount on in the sidebar → and select Create an Offer from the pull-down next to the + button.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Then, I want to add 1,500 codes using that + button:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-22.03.10.png.pagespeed.ic.mXwOSbmOAK.jpg"></figure><p>Now, I can copy the offer link and include it in my student emails:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-14-at-17.36.41.png"></figure><p>I don't have to mingle with managing a database of codes, picking unused ones for each email, generating and re-uploading new codes every now and then. It all runs smoothly without my attention now. Using Tokens's redemption status, I will know when I need to top up my student campaign. Then, I'll just hit that + button and add a few more thousands of codes. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-22.06.03.png.pagespeed.ic.Ralj58wSp7.png"><figcaption>Thanks, Gikken.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-level-up-your-pr">2. Level up your PR</h3><p>It's old news that a few powerful folks can multiply your reach by thousands. In other words, get an influencer to like your app, and they might share it with hundreds of thousands of their readers. How do you get them to like it? You show it to them. If you can run into them at WWDC, perfect—do it in person. If you can't (and in 2020, you can't), send them a friendly email (aka pitch) explaining why their readers must love your app.</p><p>The key to any good pitch is playing up how easy it is to test the product. Influencers and journalists get dozens of requests like yours. Even if the pitch is half-baked but it's super easy to play around with the actual product and the product is super good, you up your chances by a lot. Since subscription-based apps are technically free, they can test drive it for free, true. If they seriously want to write about you, they'll need access to all features, though. Including a promo code when sending out a pitch has always been a good tone. And offer codes aren't changing anything fundamentally here. The good part is that you have 15,000 times more offer codes than promo codes, so you'll barely feel short of them. Also, giving a promo code meant that the journalist would get your premium version for the entire duration of the subscription. With offer codes, you can easily adjust it.</p><p>My jaw dropped after we made <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/talking-tokens/ryan-jones-from-flighty-and-weather-line/?ref=blog-oc">our interview</a> with Ryan Jones who 50x'ed traffic for Weather Line with Tokens. The power of doing good PR is often undervalued.</p><p>To start blasting out my pitches, I want to create an offer—free 1 month trial:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-18.22.37.png.pagespeed.ic.iTgwAMT01R.jpg"></figure><p>Add a bunch of codes by clicking that +, and then I can copy a code, and even name it not to forget who it went out to:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-21.51.50.png.pagespeed.ic.P87CPgfQcm.jpg"></figure><p>Let's keep the fingers crossed:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-14-at-22.21.01.png"><figcaption>Disclaimer: I discourage you from using this pitch template if you actually want to get reviewed.</figcaption></figure><p>OK, actually, I'll know for sure whether my titanic pitching efforts have paid off:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-21.53.52.png.pagespeed.ic.rEqXU3GyQ2.jpg"></figure><h3 id="3-get-more-attention-with-giveaways">3.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div target="_blank"><p>A couple of words about Blender. Simply put, Blender is a 3D creation suite. However, it’s also free and open-source, which provides more transparency and reliability to its professional users.</p><p>Today, many UX/UI designers require animation and 3D creation tools to deliver stunning designs for various software. Just like for any other software development agency, web design and visual content are what can be easily demonstrated and makes us stand out on the market. So we’re constantly working to keep it that way.&nbsp; That’s why our designers also study 3D animation and video editing.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of years ago, I made research and found out Blender is mature enough for professional use. Since then I've been studying and using it in my work and now pass my knowledge to the colleagues in the design department.</p><p>The tutorial below is the first in the series, and below I present a short crib to keep at hand after watching.</p><figure id="w-node-bfe8ff51f8a7-7a0a8b78"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tcU_iZT-hbQ"></iframe></p></figure><p>With this video and blog post you’ll be able to create the next image:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd3487994dd492353e2a0aa_4Ne1fdFQqqlsnFhKBt0AaFOF6awoxIa6P5i5yVstKtRWffCyrCdJrLSf07nwgaQIh1HFr-sZk6GycDTfT5sVqtorVtv7OVf13wPB6QW8ilNvIUEYSoli8MlhXhLbCgSQjrFKHQNB.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Working With Views in Blender</h2><p>Press and hold the&nbsp; Tilde (~) symbol on your keyboard and a menu will pop up, where you can choose a view: just point at it and release the button. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34878d85fdc54a45caeda_GVbVGpaBsoe4f10p-xCjlAj23VPt3f3KJYPMtYICwSTCdScKdgPYt5xSmX_7i0myUH9ajdDJS5kycxXeHgAnlAKtwy93zDzNPFP9MhGd2aTV5kaAXVdshMgJW8OPGBI45nnVnPg7.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>You can also quickly switch the views by switching numbers 1, 2, 3 on the nav pad. They are already programmed for changing the view, but usually, it’s more convenient to use the mouse to change views.</p><p>By the way, there is also a 5th button on the navpad. It is a switch button to perspective or orthography. You can also switch to an orthographic view. That is, it has no perspective deformations. You might need it to fully understand the shape of an object without distortion.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon clicking it again, it returns to the previous view.&nbsp;</p><p>Orthography lets you work in the isometric view, but don’t forget that the camera is at the top left, and you’ll be rendering what the camera is showing.&nbsp;</p><h2>Camera view control</h2><p>To control the camera, you use the middle mouse button (the wheel). Press it and move the mouse to rotate the camera. If you’re going to hold the SHIFT button in addition, the camera will be moved around instead of rotating. If you’re going to hold the Ctrl button instead, the scene will be zoomed in or out on mouse movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, you can press SHIFT + ~. Then, configure the camera view as you wish by rotating the mouse and using keys W, A, S, D, Q, E:</p><ul role="list"><li>W – forward</li><li>A - backward</li><li>S - left</li><li>D - right</li><li>Q - up</li><li>E - down</li></ul><p>As for our practice, we usually set the camera location and angle to zero, then we move it along the Y-axis – that’s the most convenient way of working with simple scenes. If you’re doing, say, animation, details for the depth of field might force you to use the camera in other ways.</p><h2>Working with objects</h2><p>Adding objects can be done through Shift+A or through the Add button at the top.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34878081db5b6853166a7_TbhfjutbIieqsQE4EENTyesttgBkPDrlDGNIl5CBSTBLMZB0TjF4Ngv6d6D9p2sJh2sudM6U-Ad3LGnE0bJbUEZw2N9uZ_1Feccg5OfcKgVQLYF88jSLHwErILyqmIkkU6m82fhj.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Use “G” to move objects, “R” to rotate them, and “S” to scale them. If you press “G” or “R” or “S” + the axis button (X, Y, Z), the movement, rotation or scaling will be linked to the selected axis. Linking to an axis is useful when you need to move or rotate objects with precision.&nbsp;</p><h3>Modeling 101</h3><p>Blender has a few modes. For the basic modeling purposes, let’s review two of them.&nbsp;</p><p>In the object mode, you can select an object or a few, and in edit mode you, well, you edit it.&nbsp;</p><p>Use the “TAB” key to switch to the editing mode.</p><p>Vertices and edges together make a surface. In the editing mode, you can press “1”, “2”, or “3” to switch to vertices, edges, and surfaces correspondingly.</p><p>Sometimes it is easier to edit an object when it’s transparent – for that, press Shift+Z.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34878d85fdc79385caedb_mp92e1FMHuvpgtDGTSUA279cCw0ZeyRlcS1CwX10PdvzGsJzZdsYrhIlyz75xIFnjj4QeNXFeun3lVl-eE99yxVaXRLW9YumuRHOaQ0mPsPAiqtej-zrA7vfFTo62QyJOHRAEZDt.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Here you can also move, rotate and scale any vertex, edge, or surface using the “G”, “R”, and “S” buttons and the axis button. Or use the corresponding buttons on the panel on the left.</p><p>Note: check out extrusion: press “3” to switch to the surface mode and press “E” to squeeze the object out.</p><p>If you need more geometry, select the object and press Ctrl+R in the edit mode. This command will make a cut and add geometry.&nbsp;</p><p>To delete the object, press Tab, exit the edit mode and move to the object mode. Then, simply press Delete. If you’re in the edit mode, you can also press A to select everything and then press Delete.</p><p>The combination of Ctrl+R and scrolling allows adding more segments to the object.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34878988e80bcac873b83_Ge8YwQHclsLGD3_cIjSP8Up298Wzvty3q2zeLAlAlN1HOhjtalKWzj5wnQ46o5RO45-GAOfRAoaPPd68T5hd0bRrVCkCiqkBsXTevGZfD4mNxFP1_DtrLb_59-ynG4DTEPL6Ztjv.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>When you’re adding an object – say, a torus, – an object setup panel will appear. It is important to set parameters in it right away. Otherwise, if you do some other modifications, the panel will disappear and any changes won’t be saved.</p><h3>Example: how to make a donut-shaped object</h3><p>Place a torus. Switch to the top view. Select half of all the vertices as shown in the picture below. For that, make the object transparent with Shift+Z, otherwise, only the top vertices will be selected. Delete them. Use Shift+Z to cancel the transparent mode and you’ll see that you have a half-torus now. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd3487827b70d6b8e7d60e4_TC4Rjxm0Ld1766CnxTFRd6CacKHtL6IUvXMlKu5qW0IIYB1IeL4EMRFxe1Q3mbXOIfiiwSJZhETcvoVNjIvjTVhw140q4CEo0Lr6X6j5gQ6nH0mHVn7EUs7xwg5IveYXk72HJJgf.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you find it too low-poly, you can go into the editing mode, select everything (A), and then enable subdivision with the right mouse button.&nbsp;</p><p>However, simply doing it won’t be enough to make an object smooth. When you have your object selected, find and press the wrench icon on the menubar. You’ll see object modifiers, among which you’ll want to select the subdivision surface to edit its parameters.&nbsp;</p><p>The Render parameter is visible only during rendering.</p><p>The Levels Viewport parameter is responsible for what is seen now.&nbsp;</p><p>When you adjust smoothing, don’t go too far with your experiments. In our case, initially, we had only 420 rectangles. However, with smoothing equal to 3 there were already 26,000 rectangles. Increasing smoothing even more will probably make your computer lag or even unresponsive at all.&nbsp;</p><p>So when you do smoothing, complicating the mesh, or changing geometry, don’t overdo it.&nbsp;</p><p>Notice: when you’re working with modifiers, you can adjust them as long as you don’t have the Apply button pressed. After that, you can only undo your action and change the necessary modifiers again.&nbsp;</p><p>When you click on a wrench and add a modifier, you can also find the Solidify modifier as well. It works properly only in the object mode. With Solidify, the main parameter is thickness. You can add random thickness. For instance, applying to a cylinder will turn it into a pipe.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd3487918d56c00f3046deb_uAxv4TtLIR1-csxJqTF99f0PHXDFJVhlfnwu8QyO9r09r2Ozslk6Y_MbwzP3XjguVzQs2W5QXNcb4CqDjN-7a_7BlNHu3eywTY_mM5EVUealeWc6JM_S0kkCD7uhXKgfB6kt1wl9.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>These are the basics of making really simple objects.</p><h2>Introduction to materials</h2><p>Let’s first create a sphere via Shift+A &gt; Mesh.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, enable shade smooth via using the right mouse button click to display it normally.</p><p>When you’re in the viewport, you can hold the Z button to see the solid display, or press Shift+Z to switch to the wireframe.</p><p>Press Shift+A and add light. You can select from multiple types of light sources, and then manipulate them just like ordinary objects to put them wherever you need.&nbsp;</p><p>When you render them, your computer may slow down.&nbsp;</p><p>Notice: if you notice squares around your object when you rotate it, that’s fine. To hide them, select the Solid mode.&nbsp;</p><p>Click World, a red button with a red planet on it on the right of the interface. The Color option defines the color of your world, which will also affect your objects. Note that the color will be seen only in the Rendered mode, so you might want to split the screen in order to see the Render and a perspective of the object simultaneously.</p><p>Click the sphere, and in the bottom right corner, you’ll find a menu with a ball icon. It refers to material properties. Click New. Then in the parameters list, choose a contrasting color so that the object could be visible. There are many other parameters that you can learn on your own; we won’t pay our attention to it now.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34879d15acb30e049def9_PLZ3_Fndy2UA-3mwwLOWFeZGsOS3_KsPF1U0EJ5GtJLRov_H6XHkXP-x2eCfY-b4nCk0qDYQtJVCzT2dm2GytqrkFdA4Uq04XSdHFD4cUAAtFMOBsUWDI4GRIwG6DPn23IFjwosS.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now you can use the Shader editor to add anything you want, from generated textures to gradients. We’ll talk more about it in our next posts.</p><p>A material can consist of several files, for instance, wood and marble, and every layer can be edited alone.&nbsp;</p><h2>What’s next</h2><p>In this post, I showed how objects are created and managed, how to work with the mesh and modifiers, and how materials are applied.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, this is not enough to make the best web design company – there is so much more to tell about scene design, light setup, textures, materials, renders, composition, and animation. But for learning that, one should master object creation first, which is best done through video tutorials like the one above, and this text is more of a crib to keep at hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay tuned for more tutorials and cribs like this while we’re learning and sharing new insights on design, animation, and videography.<br></p></div></article></div>]]>

               <!--https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17365838/remove-leading-whitespace-from-whitespace-pre-element-->
               <div id="richtextcss"><p>While Iâ€™m no expert in the matter at all (I took art classes in Grades 7-9 if that counts for anything), I have, on more than one occasion, engaged in friendly debate over what constitutes art. Mona Lisa? art. <a href="https://i.redd.it/5ugttvttk3a31.jpg">SrGrafoâ€™s</a><span> comic strips? art. This stupid red square?Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xoLRCSD.png"></p><p>Okay, now youâ€™re really pushing it. I wouldnâ€™t call this art per seâ€¦ maybe more like a colored shape. Of course, you might disagree. But hear me out! For I think Iâ€™ve reached a pretty foolproof classification system. You see, there are primarily two things to consider in distinguishing whether something is art:Â&nbsp;</p><ol>
<li>The intention</li>
<li>The affirmation</li>
</ol><h3>The Intention</h3><p>In other words, was it the intention of the artist to create a work of art in the first place? If not, then it shouldnâ€™t be considered art. I find it hard to believe that a passerby could possess such authority as to claim the contrary. What a load of hubris to believe that they know better than the person who made it as to what that thing is in the first place. For instance, an artistâ€™s rough sketch, uneaten banana, or slab of marble, donâ€™t qualify as art. They are but a roadmap, a light snack, and a slab of marble in that order. It may be called art only <em>after</em><span> the artist chooses to declare it so. Not</span><em><span> before. </span></em><span>Of course, itâ€™s all in the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/3YFeE1eDlD0?t=5"><span>branding</span></a><span>. Until something is branded as art, weâ€™d likely not even know it exists. The art that we see and hear about, are precisely those things that the artist has chosen to brand as such.</span></p><p>Ok, so we have just established that for an artist, art is something to be declared, just like <a href="https://youtu.be/C-m3RtoguAQ?t=67">bankruptcy</a><span>. But what happens after they claim something to be art? Well, we can agree, but we donâ€™t have to.</span></p><h3>The Affirmation</h3><p>Art is transactional in nature. Someone creates what they claim as art, and someone affirms that fact. Since the one claiming and affirming are one and the same in the special case of the artist, they are indeed correct when they label it art. It is art <em>to them, </em><span>but this might not be the case for me, for you, or Winnie the Pooh. Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YgQ4LwX.png"></p><p>Just as the artist reserves the right to declare it, we (individually) reserve the right to reject it. We donâ€™t have to take their word for it, they could be crazy for all we know! They could call their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/arts/design/banana-art-basel-miami.html">banana taped to a wall</a><span> art. But, no. Theyâ€™re wrong. Itâ€™s just a banana - thatâ€™s a light snack remember? Regardless of what modern/contemporary art museums may wish to suggest, we alone decide whatâ€™s art, and whatâ€™s not (woohoo title drop). It is not up to them to tell us what to think. The people in this video for instance seem to suggest those white paintings to be art.Â&nbsp;</span></p><div><p><iframe frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aGRHOpMRUg?showinfo=0"></iframe></p></div><p>But they are not the definitive authority. They are merely an intermediary facilitating this discourse on behalf of the artist. This is often the source of disagreement when it comes to recognizing art: when someone presumes their beliefs regarding art more valid. Those people are what I like to call <a href="https://youtu.be/S_k2BXefHNc?t=4">wrong</a>.</p><p>No one elseâ€™s opinion matters. Not the art dealersâ€™, the museum curatorsâ€™ or the money launderersâ€™. Just your opinion, and the artistâ€™s. When there is an apparent consensus between you and the artist, then it <em>is art</em>. On the contrary, although we may respect the artist, if what was displayed merely an abundant lack of skill, then we may concede it to be in fact really, <strong>really</strong> bad art. So bad in fact that it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote">asymptotically</a> reaches a threshold known as <em><u>an eyesore</u></em> in the limiting case as x approaches infinity, where x is my apathy for figuring out how to continue this math metaphor.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/33HEwLL.png"></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>For something to be considered art, the artist has to intend it, and we have to accept it (until then, it exists in an indeterminate state of limbo). This generally means that we need to recognize some level of skill, however minimal, by judging the effort required to create it. People may suggest otherwise, but you have the final say when it comes to art: it is your right. So stop worrying about what others think. Donâ€™t let someone else tell you what is and what isnâ€™t art.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Â&nbsp;</p><h3>Appendix: examples of what is and what isnâ€™t art</h3><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KmeDZqO.png"></p><p>P.S. As general rule of thumb, if you canâ€™t find it in an art class, itâ€™s not art!</p></div>

			<p>I’ll never forget my first Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. &nbsp;It was an event I’d wanted to go to since I first heard about it as the nerve center of the sports analytics world. &nbsp;I walked the halls with people whose articles and algorithms I read&nbsp;religiously. &nbsp;But that is not what made it memorable. &nbsp;No, what made it memorable was the horde of undergrads following Jeff Luhnow around like he was the Pied Piper.</p><p>I don’t get paid by anyone to do sports analytics, so I suppose it’s a bit presumptuous for me to write a post about getting a job in sports analytics. &nbsp;But I have worked for many years in the analytics space more broadly, and I know a thing or two about labor markets.</p><p>So if you are an aspiring GM, I hope these tips can help you to pursue your dreams in the most efficient way possible. &nbsp;And if you are Jeff Luhnow, I hope this will help you avoid&nbsp;paper cuts from resumes whipped at you&nbsp;by the horde.</p>
<h3>Do some analytics using publicly available data</h3><p>Go&nbsp;analyze it. &nbsp;Like right now. &nbsp;Finish reading this post, subscribe to our newsletter, follow Lacrosse Reference on Twitter, and then go do it.</p><p>The most disappointing thing about Sloan for me was the lack of novel analytics. &nbsp;The student presentations were great because they demonstrated new ways of looking at old things. &nbsp;But the teams, the ones who actually pay people to do this stuff, were conspicuously quiet. &nbsp;Which makes sense; why tell the whole world, and all your competitors, what you are doing to gain an advantage?</p><p>And it was even more disappointing because the people that those teams employ are, in many cases, the ones that advanced the field in the first place. &nbsp;John Hollinger is a great example, but I can point to a dozen people in front offices who were hired because they did great work in their spare time. &nbsp;Such is the draw of doing analytics within the front office that most teams simply hired the best amateur analytics minds because they were the ones doing the best work. &nbsp;For their part, I suspect they wanted to work for the teams because they could be involved in decision-making and have access to internal-only data sets. &nbsp;Certainly nothing wrong with that.</p><p>So to sum up the history of sports analytics: 1) nobodies made a name for themselves using public data and publishing online and 2) teams hired said nobodies. &nbsp;If you aren’t on GoDaddy right now registering a domain name, I have no more advice for you. &nbsp;Do some analytics, write about what you did, post it on the internet. &nbsp;If you create interesting stuff, people will see it, and if you are dogged/clever, the right people will see it. &nbsp;And if it’s going to help them gain an edge against their competitors, they will hire you. &nbsp;(How’s that for grossest oversimplification ever?)</p><p>When I’ve hired people into analytics roles (albeit not in sports), I didn’t want to hear about degrees, GPAs, or other resume elements. &nbsp;I wanted to hear about side projects that demonstrate passion and capability. &nbsp;Publishing your own work hits both of these boxes.</p><p>(And be thankful that you are dealing with such clean data <strong><em>(1)</em></strong>)</p>
<h3>Focus on storytelling and writing skills, not machine learning</h3><p>Don’t get me wrong, machine learning is great. &nbsp;And deep learning is even greater. Powered by a huge explosion of annotated data, these techniques enable truly awesome new capabilities. &nbsp;But you have to be smart about when to apply advanced statistical techniques and when to use…algebra. &nbsp;I’d bet that 99% of the sports analytics that will confer any sort of competitive advantage are basic averages and regressions. &nbsp;We are simply not trying to solve the sort of classification problems that the more sophisticated techniques excel at <em><strong>(2)</strong></em>.</p><p>So if not advanced statistical modeling, what is the skill set should you hone? &nbsp;The simple answer is storytelling.</p><p>Throughout my consulting career,&nbsp;the most important lesson I’ve learned is that the success of an analytic is wholly dependent on the story that it is packaged in. Put another way, I’d rather have a simple, less insightful, model that is packaged in an effective story than a model that nails some sort of prediction but can’t be communicated easily. &nbsp;Unless you are already the GM, you are going to have to convince someone to act based on the insight that your models have generated. &nbsp;You cannot do this unless you are an effective storyteller.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not something that you can take a Coursera course to learn. &nbsp;Storytelling is the poster-child for soft skills. &nbsp;Fortunately, it’s something where practice makes perfect. &nbsp;Explain to your grandparents what PER or WAR means. &nbsp;Think about how you would translate analytical content to&nbsp;someone who didn’t know what numbers are. &nbsp;Draw a sketch representing an analytical concept. &nbsp;Incorporate analytical insights into James Harden fan-fiction.</p><p>Just don’t assume that the people you need to convince will inherently understand what you’ve done, even if it seems obvious to you.</p>
<h3>Make sure you are solid with SQL, Python, R, and some sort of data viz</h3><p>Statistical modeling is the sexy skill (how crazy is that?) within the analytics space. &nbsp;That’s how people build self driving cars and beat world champions in Go. &nbsp;But successful analytics have to stand on three legs: data, algorithms, and storytelling/visualization. &nbsp;In truth, you can get away without having sophisticated algorithms, but you can’t get away with a poor data foundation or a poorly packaged insight. &nbsp;Don’t skimp on the plumbing of your analysis!</p><p>And unless you are joining a massive data organization, you’ll probably be responsible for all three things. &nbsp;They want you to be Ben Zobrist, not Mark Trumbo. &nbsp;That could mean using SQL to store&nbsp;and clean data on Monday. &nbsp;Then writing an R model on Tuesday. &nbsp;Then taking the results of that and using&nbsp;Python&nbsp;to format&nbsp;the results into a Tableau-ready input file so that you can build a visualization dashboard on Thursday. &nbsp;And you’d better be able to 1) do all those things or 2) be familiar enough that you can figure them out via StackOverflow.</p><p>I’m not suggesting that you must be an expert in all of these areas, but you have to be competent enough to know how to tackle a given problem or requirement. &nbsp;If you are someone who has a strong background in modeling, you should focus your learning cycles on the data engineering piece or the storytelling piece on the backend. &nbsp;If you are a data engineer, make sure you are considering whether there is a better algorithm out there relative to you hacking something together. &nbsp;And as we discussed above, don’t sleep on the importance of packaging your insights into a story that makes them easy to digest and act on.</p><p>In other words, to get a job in sports analytics, you’ve got to be a jack-of-all-trades.&nbsp; I realize that is still somewhat vague. And that is why I have started the Sports Analytics Academy. If you think you would benefit from some help in getting started, <a href="https://lacrossereference.com/sports-analytics-academy/">check it out</a>.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>The biggest challenge in consulting projects that include modeling is data availability/quality, by far. &nbsp;Even when the data is system generated, it’s often unclear what each field means. &nbsp;Sometimes they give you a data set that is only a subset of the population. &nbsp;Or the company changed how they collected the data half way through. &nbsp;Awareness of these pitfalls is crucial to being an effective advisor because if you ignore them, it’s easy to create an analysis that is misleading. &nbsp;But you, aspiring data-GM, are lucky because sports data doesn’t typically suffer from these same issues. &nbsp;For one, almost every relevant piece of game information is posted on the internet, where millions of people can alert providers to data quality issues. &nbsp;The simple fact that the data is public is a huge advantage because you don’t need to ask permission to analyze it. &nbsp;(You’d be surprised how unhelpful data people are&nbsp;when they think you are upstaging them.)</li>
<li>&nbsp;One of the most frustrating things about deep learning, and machine learning more broadly, is the requirement that you have a lot of annotated training data to teach the models with. &nbsp;To be fair, I’m not frustrated with the techniques, but with the fact that people consistently gloss over this requirement when they talk about using deep learning in models. &nbsp;Facebook can develop these great models because they have a decade and a half worth of data from billions of users uploading photos and tagging them. &nbsp;Google was able to make advances with their speech recognition because their models are amazing, but also because every time they got a dictation wrong, users would correct it before hitting send. &nbsp;You shouldn’t say yes when someone asks you whether machine learning could help predict something unless they are also committing to providing the money or people/time to annotate a sufficiently large data set.</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><section><div><article><div><p>When I created this blog back in September my goal was to post at least once
a month. It's December now and you're reading my second post, so I'm not exactly
off to a great start. 🤔</p><p>Things have been busy on the Rust BPF front though! At the end of October I
began working on a blog about the current state of things, exactly one year
after I started getting involved. While doing that I finally started feeling
inspired enough to try and add a BPF target to rustc, something that had been
on my todo list for a very long time but never managed to find the time to work
on.  (<em>Aah... if only someone wanted to sponsor all this work... wink wink!</em>)</p><p>A couple of weeks ago I finally sent a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79608">pull request</a>
to get the new target(s) merged. The changes were pretty straightforward, with the
only unexpected thing being that I ended up having to write
<a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker">https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker</a> - a partial linker needed to enable
rustc to output BPF bytecode.</p><p>I'm going to tell you why I had to write the linker in a moment, but first,
let's start with looking at how clang - the de facto standard BPF compiler -
compiles C code to BPF.</p><h2>How BPF projects are compiled with clang</h2><p>BPF doesn't have things like shared libraries and executables. Programs are
compiled as object files, then at run-time they're relocated and loaded in the
kernel where they get JIT-ted and executed.</p><p>Because of that, and because for a long time function calls were not allowed so
everything had to be inlined, BPF programs written in C are typically compiled
as a <strong>single compilation unit</strong>, with library code written in <a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/tree/master/bpf/lib">header
files</a> and included with
<code>#include</code> directives.</p><p><img alt="clang BPF compilation model" src="https://confused.ai/static/bpf-linker-clang.svg"></p><p>This compilation model is simple and effective: <strong>one compilation unit</strong> goes
in, <strong>one object file</strong> comes out. Because BPF programs tend to be small,
recompiling the whole source code on every change is generally not an issue.
Since everything gets compiled together, there's <strong>no need for linking</strong>
separate compilation artifacts. <em>(You see where this is going?)</em></p><h2>How Rust projects are compiled</h2><p>Rust uses a different compilation model. Code is split into crates. Crates
can't be lumped together with <code>#include</code> directives, they are always compiled
independently as <strong>one or more compilation units</strong>.</p><p>Consider the following example:</p><pre><code><span>alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo tree
</span>app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->└── dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->
<!-- -->alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo build
<!-- -->   Compiling dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->   Compiling app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.19s
</code></pre><p><code>app</code> is an application crate that depends on a library <code>dep</code>. When building,
the following happens:</p><p><img alt="Rust compilation model" src="https://confused.ai/static/bpf-linker-rustc.svg"></p><p>The rust compiler is invoked twice: first to compile the <code>dep</code> crate as a rust
library, then to compile the <code>app</code> crate as an executable. When the <code>app</code> crate
is compiled, the <strong>pre-compiled</strong> <code>dep</code> crate is provided as input to the
compiler via the <code>--extern</code> option.</p><p>This compilation model always produces <strong>multiple object files</strong>, which then
must be <strong>linked</strong> together to produce the final output. The rust compiler uses an
internal linker abstraction, whose implementations spawn to external linkers
like <code>ld</code>, <code>lld</code>, <code>link.exe</code> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker-flavor">others</a>.</p><p>Therefore, to add a new target with this model we need a linker for the target.
Since clang never links anything when targeting BPF though, it turns out that <code>lld</code> -
the LLVM linker - can't link BPF at all. So I wrote a new linker.</p><h2>A new (partial) BPF linker</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker">bpf-linker</a> takes LLVM bitcode as
input, optionally applies target-specific optimizations, and outputs a single
BPF object file. The inputs can be bitcode files (<code>.bc</code>), object files
with embedded bitcode (eg <code>.o</code> files produced compiling with
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#embed-bitcode">-C embed-bitcode=yes</a>),
or archive files (<code>.a</code> or <code>.rlib</code>).</p><p>The linker works with anything that can output LLVM bitcode, including clang.
There are a couple of reasons for taking bitcode as input instead of object
files.</p><p>Only a subset of Rust (just like only a subset of C) can be compiled to BPF
bytecode. Therefore bpf-linker tries to push code generation as late as
possible in the compilation process, after link-time optimizations have been
applied and dead code has been eliminated. This avoids hitting potential
failures generating bytecode for unsupported Rust code that is actually
unused (eg, parts of the <code>core</code> crate that are never used in a BPF context).</p><p>Another reason is that the linker might need to apply extra optimizations like
<a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker/blob/d890b113ffe612dcba51cc7d23a14fabd8198318/src/bin/bpf-linker.rs#L104">--unroll-loops</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker/blob/d890b113ffe612dcba51cc7d23a14fabd8198318/src/bin/bpf-linker.rs#L108">--ignore-inline-never</a>
when targeting older kernel versions that don't support loops and calls.</p><h2>Not one but two BPF targets!</h2><p>The rustc fork at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/rust/tree/bpf">https://github.com/alessandrod/rust/tree/bpf</a> includes two new
targets, <code>bpfel-unknown-none</code> and <code>bpfeb-unknown-none</code> which generate little
endian and big endian BPF respectively. The targets automatically invoke
bpf-linker so with that fork, compiling a BPF project with Rust is finally as
easy as:</p><pre><code><span>alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo build --target=bpfel-unknown-none
</span>   Compiling dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->   Compiling app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.98s
<!-- -->alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ file target/bpfel-unknown-none/debug/app
<!-- -->target/bpfel-unknown-none/debug/app: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, eBPF, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
</code></pre><p>Getting the targets merged will probably take a while, but worry not! With a
little trick, you can use the linker to <em>compile BPF code with stable Rust
already today!</em></p><p>I made bpf-linker implement a <code>wasm-ld</code> compatible command line. Since rustc
already knows how to invoke <code>wasm-ld</code> when targeting webassembly, it can be
made to use <code>bpf-linker</code> with the following options:</p><pre><code><span>alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo rustc -- \
</span>        -C linker-flavor=wasm-ld \
<!-- -->        -C linker=bpf-linker \
<!-- -->        -C linker-plugin-lto 
<!-- -->   Compiling dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->   Compiling app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.68s
<!-- -->alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ file target/debug/app
<!-- -->target/debug/app: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, eBPF, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
</code></pre><p>Let's see what those options do:</p><ul><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker-flavor">-C linker-flavor=wasm-ld</a>
tells the compiler that the linker supports the same command line options as <code>wasm-ld</code></li><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker">-C linker=bpf-linker</a>
configures bpf-linker as the linker to spawn</li><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/linker-plugin-lto.html#linker-plugin-lto">-C linker-plugin-lto</a>
tells rustc to pass LLVM bitcode to the linker</li></ul><p>And voilà! Go compile some BPF with stable rust now 🎉</p><h2>What's next</h2><p>bpf-linker is obviously new and needs more testing. Over the next few weeks I'm
going to add more unit tests and try it on more Rust code. I'm also thinking of
trying to link the whole Cilium BPF code with it just to test with a large,
complex code base.</p><p>While working on the rustc target, at some point I went off on a bit of a
tangent and ended up making some changes to LLVM and the kernel so I'm going to
try and finish those off. They are needed to implement the
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-trap-intrinsic">llvm.trap</a> intrinsic
so <code>panic!()</code> can be implemented in a generic way, instead of having to resort
to program-specific hacks like jumping to an empty program with
<code>bpf_tail_call()</code>. I'll probably do a whole separate post about that.</p><p>Finally, after my <a href="https://confused.ai/posts/intercepting-zoom-tls-encryption-bpf-uprobes">last post</a> I
received some truly great feedback! I was especially pleased to hear from a
couple of companies that are using BPF and that are considering using it with
Rust.</p><p>I was equally pleased to see that there's a group of people developing BPF in C
that feel strongly that I'm wasting my time and that Rust brings nothing over
C, being BPF statically verified, not needing the borrow checker etc.  They gave
me inspiration for a post I'm hoping to publish soon, which will cover why I
think that Rust has the potential to become as central to the BPF ecosystem as it
is central to WebAssembly development today. Until next time!</p></div></article></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>Web and browsers are evolving fast!</p>



<p>Many optimizations we did few years are ago now outdated or not recommended.</p>



<p>Delivering Google Fonts to get maximum performance has also changed recently as browsers implemented new features. </p>



<p>I’ve already written a blog post on optimizing Google Fonts. This post is specifically on why you should self-host Google Fonts.</p>

<h2 id="outdated-performance-arguments">Outdated Performance Arguments</h2>



<h3 id="argument-browsers-will-already-have-google-fonts-cached">Argument: Browsers will already have Google Fonts cached</h3>



<p>When you embed a Google Font, it first downloads a CSS file from “fonts.googleapis.com” and then downloads font files mentioned in that CSS file from “fonts.gstatic.com”.</p>



<p>Only font files downloaded from “fonts.gstatic.com” has a cache period of 1 year. The main CSS file only has 24 hours of cache lifespan.</p>



<p>“Browsers will already have Google Fonts cached”, yes, but<strong> to serve that cached font, the browser needs to download a CSS file every 24 hours</strong>, that too is render-blocking in most websites!</p>



<p>If that didn’t convince you enough, here is one more 😉.</p>



<h4 id="new-cache-partitioning-in-browsers-for-privacy">New “Cache Partitioning” in browsers for privacy</h4>



<p>Chrome and Safari have implemented something called “Cache Partitioning” or “double key caching”.</p>



<p><strong>In simple words, files cached by website A will not be available for website B</strong>. When a <strong>website A </strong>downloads a resource from “example.com/script.js”, cache it, and another <strong>website B</strong> tries to download the same file, it will have to download it again.</p>



<p>So a Google Font downloaded by a website will not be available for another website in the browser cache.</p>



<p>Under the hood, the browser uses a key to cache files. Usually, the cache key is the URL of the file. But with cache partitioning, the URL of the website which requested the file is also included in the cache key.</p>

<p><strong>With Cache Partitioning</strong></p>

<p>You can read more about cache partitioning in Chrome here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaining security and privacy by partitioning the cache.</a></p>



<h5 id="browser-implementation-of-cache-partitioning">Browser implementation of Cache Partitioning</h5>



<p>✅ Chrome: since v86 (October 2020)<br>✅ Safari: since 2013<br>🚫 Firefox: from v85 (January 2021)</p>



<p>Browsers like Edge, Opera, Brave uses Chromium engine, so expect this feature in other browsers soon.</p>



<p>Also, note that <strong>Chrome and Safari alone has a market share of ~80% in browsers.</strong></p>



<h3 id="argument-google-fonts-delivers-optimized-fonts-based-on-device-browser">Argument: Google Fonts delivers optimized fonts based on device/browser</h3>



<p>Yes, Google delivers different fonts based on the user-agent.</p>



<p>But as long as you deliver self-hosted Google Font in<strong> “woff2” format, you’re targeting ~96% of the browsers.</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="321" src="https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x321.png" alt="image 2" srcset="https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x321.png 1024w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-300x94.png 300w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x241.png 768w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1536x482.png 1536w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-380x119.png 380w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-800x251.png 800w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1160x364.png 1160w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 2029w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><strong>Only Internet Explorer and Opera Mini don’t support “woff2”</strong>. In that case, you can add <strong>“eot” as a fallback</strong> and still get all advantages of self-hosting.</p>



<p>Here is the sample code:</p>



<pre><code>@font-face {
  font-family: 'Poppins';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url('../fonts/poppins-v15-latin-regular.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6-IE8 */
       url('../fonts/poppins-v15-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Super Modern Browsers */
}</code></pre>



<h3 id="argument-google-cdn-is-faster">Argument: Google CDN is faster</h3>



<p>If your website on good hosting or has CDN and has enabled HTTP/2, self-hosting will outperform Google CDN. Because the browser doesn’t have to make extra DNS lookups, SSL handshakes etc and reuse existing HTTP/2 connection.</p>



<p>When you self-host and inline Google Fonts, the browser can immediately start to download the font after receiving the first HTML. You can also leverage preload functionality.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/@thegreengreek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sia Karamalegos</a> has written a great post on comparing the difference: <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Making Google Fonts Faster⚡</a>.</p>

<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2802/1*JPlj6igUcBeqfGUul4hIUA.png" alt="Image for post" loading="lazy"><figcaption>With Self-Hosting</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="is-it-legal-to-self-host-google-fonts">Is it Legal to Self-Host Google Fonts?</h2>



<blockquote><p>“Yes. The open-source fonts in the Google Fonts catalogue are published under licenses that allow you to use them on any website, whether it’s commercial or personal.”</p><cite>Google Fonts – <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In fact, Google itself recommends to self-host Google Fonts for complete control like preloading. It’s mentioned in one of their YouTube videos:</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe title="Web performance made easy (Google I/O '18)" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mv-l3-tJgGk?start=1490&amp;feature=oembed" data-lazy-method="viewport" data-lazy-attributes="src"></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="how-to-self-host-google-fonts-in-wordpress">How to Self-Host Google Fonts in WordPress</h2>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-webfonts-local/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OMGF</a> plugin can self-host Google Fonts. But I found it hard to use. We’ve to search the fonts or auto-detect by opening pages manually.</p>



<p>If you’re using <a href="https://flying-press.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlyingPress</a>, turn on “Optimize Google Fonts”. It will take care of self-hosting, combining and everything for you!</p>

<p>The sound emitted by keystrokes can potentially be used to perform a side channel attack for guessing the text being
typed. This page runs a program that demonstrates such type of an attack.</p>

<p>First, type some text in the canvas below to train the prediction model. Don’t type super fast - it’s recommended to try
a <em>Hunt and Peck</em> style of typing first to at least get some positive results. The program will try to predict keys
which have been pressed at least 3 times.</p>

<p>When ready with typing the training data, click the <em>Pedict</em> button, wait for the model to train and continue typing
outside the browser window. The program will continuously try to guess what is being typed by only analyzing the audio
capture from the page.</p>

<p>Currently, the code is not very portable, so please read the requirements below and make sure you meet them.  Also, this
is a proof-of-concept and probably won’t work effectively in all environments.  It does work pretty good on my setup
though - iMac, Filco mechanical keyboard, built-in mic.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I’m waiting on trains, I imagine myself jumping onto the tracks, hitting the third rail, and frying to a crisp, just before the train arrives to crush my smoldering corpse.</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>When my car passes over a bridge and I feel the urge to jump in the river or even throw my phone over the bridge.</p>
<p>But that’s just me…</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Or do you have those thoughts, too?</p>
<p>There have been many names for it throughout time.</p>
<p>Edgar Allen Poe called it, “The imp of the perverse.”</p>
<p>Freud called it, “The Death Drive.”</p>
<p>Others have referred to it as the “High Place Phenomenon.”</p>
<p>But it’s more commonly referred to as the “Call of the Void” – or “L’appel du vide,” if you want to sound awesome when you say it:</p>
<p>It’s possible that this is actually a miscommunication of our survival instinct – i.e., instead of taking these thoughts as a warning that we wish to harm ourselves, the “Call of the Void” may actually be affirming your own will to live.</p>
<p>I mean, I’ve thought through the train scenario I described above more than a thousand times (give or take). And I can’t tell you how many times that feeling has manifested when I’ve been near a cliff or on top of a skyscraper.</p>
<p>And I am definitely not alone.</p>
<p>And yet, if you’re reading this right now, it’s highly unlikely that you’ve ever followed through on any of those “calls.”</p>
<p>Neither have I.</p>
<p>Though sometimes I do get this rush of adrenaline right after.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s the reaffirmation of the will to live they speak of – or at least a manifestation of it…</p>
<p>There is a poem about it [L’Appel Du Vide (The Call of the Void) by
Celia Donovan] (<a href="https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/lappel-du-vide-the-call-of-the-void/" target="_blank">scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/lappel-du..</a>)</p>

This was 23% higher than the 5.6% rate for the “other day” group.</p><p>The study, which appears today in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BMJ</a>),&nbsp;looked at 980,876 procedures performed in US hospitals by 47,489 surgeons.&nbsp;Of those procedures, 2,064 (0.2%) took place on a surgeon’s birthday.&nbsp;The patients were all Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 99. They had all undergone one of 17 common emergency surgical procedures between 2011 and 2014.</p><h2>Distractions during the most common emergency surgery types</h2><p>Examples of those 17 procedures included cardiovascular surgeries, hip and femur fracture, appendectomy, and small bowel resection. The study focused on&nbsp;emergency surgery, so as to&nbsp;minimize the potential selection bias. For example, surgeons might otherwise choose patients based on their illness severity, or patients might choose their surgeon.</p><p>As the authors write, “The effect size of surgeons’ birthday observed in our analysis (1.3 percentage point increase or a 23% increase in mortality), though substantial, is comparable to the impact of other events, including holidays (e.g., Christmas and New Year) and weekends.” <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>In fact, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3m5rimG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history of surgery</a> has often demonstrated that external factors can influence surgical outcomes. The authors refer to a 2014 study showing that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23345314/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patients admitted to Scottish emergency rooms on&nbsp;public holidays had a 27% increase</a> in 30-day mortality.&nbsp;Other research has found, for example,&nbsp;that doctors are more likely to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1910546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prescribe antibiotics</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2749268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opioids</a> — and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2733171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less likely to order&nbsp;cancer screening tests</a> — as the workday progresses. This is most likely because the “cumulative cognitive demand” of such decisions gradually takes its toll.&nbsp;</p><p>Research on judges has yielded similar results. It has found, for example, that external factors as diverse as outdoor temperatures and sports results can influence judges’ decisions.&nbsp;</p><h2>A natural experiment: ER surgery on the doctor’s birthday</h2><p>But the authors say the “natural experiment” in the present study is more revealing than, for example, holiday-related mortality rates. That is because “those events not only affect physicians’ performance but also influence patients’ decision to seek care (i.e., patients seeking care on these special days might be sicker than those seeking care on other days), as well as hospital staffing.” Unless, of course, the patients know their surgeon’s birthday, which is unlikely (though that may change if this study becomes widely known).&nbsp;</p><p>The 1.3% effect size was the result after a very through series of controls. These included, for example, excluding those surgeons with the highest patient mortality rates. Other controls included assigning a random “pseudo-birthday” to surgeons to see whether the results still held up, or checking whether the surgeon did an above-average number of procedures on their birthday. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>Likewise, the researchers controlled for “milestone” birthdays (such as 40 or 50). They also controlled for whether a birthday fell on a Friday, which might make after-work birthday festivities more likely.&nbsp;Their findings also held up when the analysis was restricted to procedures with the highest average mortality, or to only the most ill patients.&nbsp;In fact, without these adjustments, the 30-day mortality rate difference between the birthday and non-birthday groups (the unadjusted rate) was even higher (7.0% vs. 5.6%, or a 1.4% difference).</p><h2><strong>Why</strong> does emergency surgery suffer on surgeon’s birthday?</h2><p>The authors propose a few potential explanations for this “birthday effect.”&nbsp;</p><p>These include hurrying through an emergency surgery to be on time for after-work birthday events; <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/study-finds-users-not-notifications-initiate-89-of-smartphone-interactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">distracting</a> birthday-related phone calls or text messages; more conversations with well-wishing staff members; and a decreased likelihood to go back to the hospital that evening if a patient’s condition deteriorates.</p><p>They also found that some surgeons did not work on their birthdays. While 2,144 surgeons in this study performed procedures one day before their birthday, and 2,027 did so one day after their birthday, only 1,805 surgeons carried out procedures on their actual birthday. This does not affect the results of the study’s analyses. But it does suggest “that birthdays are an important enough factor for some surgeons to choose not to operate on that day, which supports the credibility of our assumption that a birthday could be a distracting factor for those surgeons who choose to operate on that day,” the authors write.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Limitations</strong> <strong>and future directions</strong></h2><p>The researchers emphasized that this study focused on common procedures, and on older Medicare patients. This means that the findings may not apply to other types of patients, or to other surgical procedures.</p><p>Still, the authors write, these results may lead to “additional support for surgeons who have potentially distracting events,” such as birthdays, “to make sure that patients receive high quality surgical care regardless of when undergo surgery.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patient mortality after surgery on the surgeon’s birthday: observational study</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirotaka Kato, Anupam B.

<article>
  
  <div><p>It has been quite a year, I hope everyone is well and staying safe. This is my first and probably only post for the year, and covers a fun privilege escalation vulnerability I found in Postgresql. This affects all supported versions of Postgresql going back to 9.5, it is likely it affects most earlier versions as well.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is similar to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) issue, however in this case it relates to state not being fully cleared/reset before exiting a security restricted operation.</p>
<p>Tested versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>13.0 – PostgreSQL 13.0 (Debian 13.0-1.pgdg100+1)</li>
<li>12.4 – PostgreSQL 12.4 (Debian 12.4-1.pgdg100+1)</li>
<li>12.3 – PostgreSQL 12.3 (Debian 12.3-1.pgdg100+1)</li>
<li>11.9 – PostgreSQL 11.9 (Debian 11.9-1.pgdg90+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Release notes and updates: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-131-125-1110-1015-9620-and-9524-released-2111/">https://www.postgresql.org/</a></p>

<p>I set out with the goal of finding a vulnerability which would allow an unprivileged user to elevate their privileges to that of <code>superuser</code>.</p>
<p>There are some legitimate ways to provide users with elevated persmissions in Postgresql, without giving those users full <code>superuser</code> rights. This is typically done using <code>SECURITY DEFINER</code> functions.</p>
<p>When misconfigured, a badly written <code>SECURITY DEFINER</code> function and controllable <code>search_path</code> can be used to elevate privileges (<a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/abusing-security-definer-functions/">Cybertec Blog</a>).</p>
<p>This functionality is explicitely called out in the Postgresql documentation in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html#SQL-CREATEFUNCTION-SECURITY">how to safely write security definer functions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because a SECURITY DEFINER function is executed with the privileges of the user that owns it, care is needed to ensure that the function cannot be misused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though this is legitimate functionality, it still provided a good starting point, as it gave me an idea of where I should looking in the source code. Maybe there would be a way to use <code>SECURITY DEFINER</code> in another context.</p>

<p>I started off by looking into security definer functions and other locations where Postgresql switches user permissions, I noticed mention of <code>security-restricted operations</code>. This immediately triggered that spidey sense that there might be something to find in these. Out came grep and a search for locations where <code>security-restricted operations</code> are mentioned.</p>
<p>Two places where this term occurs are <code>src/backend/commands/analyze.c</code> (<code>ANALYZE</code> directive) and <code>src/backend/commands/vacuum.c</code> (<code>VACUUM</code> directive), with the same code comment in both:</p>
<pre><code>/*
* Switch to the table owner's userid, so that any index functions are run
* as that user.  Also lock down security-restricted operations and
* arrange to make GUC variable changes local to this command.
*/
</code></pre><p>This leads into the next section;</p>
<h2 id="indexes-and-functions">Indexes and Functions</h2>
<p>This seemed interesting, I didn’t know that an index could run functions. Now it was time to first figure out how to make indexes run user functions.</p>
<p>Turns out this is pretty easy to do, the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html">documentation</a> has a bunch of examples of indexes calling functions (even if these aren’t user defined, it shows the syntax on how to structure the sql query.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>ON</span> films ((<span>lower</span>(title)));
</code></pre></div><p>In this, an index is created on the <code>films</code> table, using the <code>title</code> column, cast to lowercase using the <code>lower</code> function. It should be pretty straight forward to simply supply a user created function instead of <code>lower</code>.</p>
<p>I’m skipping a few debugging steps I had to go through, but it boiled down to reading the error messages thrown when trying to use the function. The main thing to note at this point is that an <code>INDEX</code> requires an <code>IMMUTABLE</code> function, meaning the function will always return the same result for a given input. This makes sense, an <code>INDEX</code> is trying to optimise on uniqueness.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> sfunc(integer) 
  <span>RETURNS</span> integer
  <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> <span>IMMUTABLE</span> <span>AS</span>
  <span>'SELECT $1'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>And now create a table, and an index on that table:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> blah (a int, b int);
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> blah <span>VALUES</span> (<span>1</span>,<span>1</span>);

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> indy <span>ON</span> blah (sfunc(a));
</code></pre></div><p>This isn’t really helpful, I wanted a function that does something more useful, like inserting values into another table. The reason being that I wanted to retrieve the user which was executing to index function. The train of thought I had at this point was:</p>
<pre><code>create index as unpriv --&gt; privileged user executes ANALYZE/VACUUM --&gt; index function executes as privileged user 
</code></pre><p>In this scenario I was planning on using <code>SECURITY INVOKER</code> to trick Postgres into executing the function as the privileged user.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- create the table to insert the user into
</span><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> t0 (s varchar);

<span>-- create the security invoker function
</span><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> sfunc(integer) <span>RETURNS</span> integer
   <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> 
   <span>SECURITY</span> <span>INVOKER</span> <span>AS</span>
   <span>'INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (current_user); SELECT $1'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>As mentioned earlier, the index requires an <code>IMMUTABLE</code> function. So trying to use the function in an index, would throw an error:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql">tmp<span>=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> indy <span>ON</span> blah (sfunc(a));
ERROR:  functions <span>in</span> <span>index</span> expression must be marked <span>IMMUTABLE</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This seemed like a dead-end. Then it occurred to me that functions can be recreated/redefined. As long as you use <code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION</code>, any existing function will be overridden. Maybe the <code>INDEX</code> doesn’t check if an assigned function has become mutable since it was initially defined (spoiler, it doesn’t!).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> sfunc(integer) 
  <span>RETURNS</span> integer
  <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> <span>IMMUTABLE</span> <span>AS</span>
  <span>'SELECT $1'</span>;

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> indy <span>ON</span> blah (sfunc(a));

<span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> sfunc(integer) <span>RETURNS</span> integer
   <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> 
   <span>SECURITY</span> <span>INVOKER</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>'INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (current_user); SELECT $1'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Now when the index is run the <code>current_user</code> will be inserted into table <code>t0</code>. To check this, I switched to a privileged user (postgres) and executed the <code>ANALYZE</code> function.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql">tmp<span>=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> t0;
 s
<span>---
</span><span></span>(<span>0</span> <span>rows</span>)

tmp<span>=#</span> <span>ANALYZE</span>;
<span>ANALYZE</span>
tmp<span>=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> t0;
  s
<span>-----
</span><span></span> foo
(<span>1</span> <span>row</span>)

tmp<span>=#</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The triggering of the function worked, but we inserted the user <code>foo</code> instead of <code>postgres</code>. This means the <code>SECURITY INVOKER</code> didn’t have an effect. Looking back at the source-code comment from earlier, we can recall that a switch is done to the owner’s uid in security-restricted functions. Yay, we proven that this functionality works, sure we found a nice bypass for the <code>IMMUTABLE</code> check, but this isn’t really a security or world ender.</p>
<h2 id="ill-get-to-it-later---deferred">I’ll get to it later - deferred</h2>
<p>Diving back into the source-code, I had a look at how the security-restricted operation was entered, and subsequently exited.</p>
<p>In the <code>vacuum.c</code> file, there were some interesting comments. Maybe you can spot the bit that caught my eye immediately.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>/*
</span><span>  * Switch to the table owner's userid, so that any index functions are run
</span><span>  * as that user.  Also lock down security-restricted operations and
</span><span>  * arrange to make GUC variable changes local to this command. (This is
</span><span>  * unnecessary, but harmless, for lazy VACUUM.)
</span><span>  */</span>
GetUserIdAndSecContext(<span>&amp;</span>save_userid, <span>&amp;</span>save_sec_context);
SetUserIdAndSecContext(onerel<span>-&gt;</span>rd_rel<span>-&gt;</span>relowner,
                                            save_sec_context <span>|</span> SECURITY_RESTRICTED_OPERATION);
save_nestlevel <span>=</span> NewGUCNestLevel();

<span>// DO LOTS OF WORK
</span><span>// &lt;--- SNIP ---&gt;
</span><span></span>
<span>/* Restore userid and security context */</span>
SetUserIdAndSecContext(save_userid, save_sec_context);

<span>/* all done with this class, but hold lock until commit */</span>
<span>if</span> (onerel)
        relation_close(onerel, NoLock);

<span>/*
</span><span>  * Complete the transaction and free all temporary memory used.
</span><span>  */</span>
PopActiveSnapshot();
CommitTransactionCommand();
</code></pre></div><p>See that last comment and function calls? The <code>CommitTransactionCommand()</code> is executed after the <code>SetUserAndSecContext</code>, which resets the context userid to that of the executing user. In SQL you have transactions and a transaction isn’t final until the commit happens. This gives you room to execute some SQL, have part of it fail and then seamlessly rollback any changes to the state before the transaction was entered. The fact that in this code the user is restored before the transaction is committed made me wonder if it would be possible to sneak in some additional commands to execute before the commit is done.</p>
<p>Next ensued a long time of reading documentation and looking for ways to delay execution of SQL commands. I finally happened on <code>INITIALLY DEFERRED</code>, which held the key to unlocking this puzzle. This was part of the documentation for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html">TRIGGERS</a> which further set the spidey senses tingling.</p>
<p>What is <code>INITIALLY DEFERRED</code>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>INITIALLY DEFERRED
The default timing of the trigger. See the CREATE TABLE documentation for details of these constraint options. This can only be specified for constraint triggers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going into the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> reference you find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a constraint is deferrable, this clause specifies the default time to check the constraint. If the constraint is INITIALLY IMMEDIATE, it is checked after each statement. This is the default. If the constraint is INITIALLY DEFERRED, it is checked only at the end of the transaction. The constraint check time can be altered with the SET CONSTRAINTS command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds exactly like what we want! An initially deferred constraint is only checked at the “<em>end of the transaction</em>”. This indicated that it would happen just before the <code>commit</code> but after the security context switch.</p>
<h2 id="gymnastics">Gymnastics</h2>
<p>The next trick was to figure out how to use the constraint trigger and where this should be placed so that it triggers at the right moment.</p>
<p>Firstly, a <code>CONSTRAINT TRIGGER</code> needs a function to execute. This will be our “final” step, and should thus be executing in the privileged user context. Therefore we should insert our privileged actions into this function. The other trick is that the <code>CONSTRAINT TRIGGER</code> needs to be triggered somehow. Fortunately we’ve already got the initial bits ready. Since the index calls our custom function, which inserts into table <code>t0</code>, we have an action which will cause a constraint trigger to execute.</p>
<pre><code>Index runs --&gt; sfunc inserts into t0 --&gt; constraint trigger fires --&gt; strig function is executed
</code></pre><p>This leaves us with the following SQL:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql">
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> t1 (s varchar);

<span>-- create a function for inserting current user into another table
</span><span></span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> snfunc(integer) <span>RETURNS</span> integer
   <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> 
   <span>SECU…</span></code></pre></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use AWS Lambda." Now they have thousands of concurrent problems.</p>

<p>If you want to know how to build a sanely-architected url-shortener using AWS Lambda on top of a datastore like Postgres, this is not the post for you.  We're going to build a Rube-Goldberg url-shortener using <em>just</em> Lambda.</p>

<!--break-->


<p>And since it may not be clear to everyone, this post contains Bad Ideas™ and Extremely Inappropriate Uses of Tools®.  Don't try this in production.</p>

<p>As a brief background, AWS Lambda is a "Function as a Service" service.  You give amazon some code (a function) and they'll run it for you — once, 1000 times, 1000 times <em>at</em> once, whatever you need.  It's a way of running certain kinds of code in the cloud without needing to manage your own server, not even a virtual one.</p>

<p>Lambda is a very specific kind of hammer that's extremely good at hammering a very specific kind of nail.  This blog post will not be discussing that nail.  This blog post will not discuss anything close.  Because it turns out you can use a hammer to drive a wing-nut into silly putty if you swing hard enough and are willing to get messy.</p>



<p>Ok, so the first thing any url-shortener needs is link mapping.  Somewhere you need to store that <code>/123</code> maps to <code>html5zombo.com</code>.  Well, you've got an input and an output - that sounds like a Lambda function!  What if we just create a new Lambda function for every link mapping!  Millions of separate Lambda functions.  After a quick check to make sure there's no limit on the number of Lambda functions you can have (besides an upper limit of 75GB of storage space), we're off to the races.</p>

<p>As an example, the function <code>read_123</code> will just be hardcoded to return <code>html5zombo.com</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
    return { 'url': 'html5zombo.com' }
</code></pre>

<p>However, a url-shortener needs to produce links, not Lambda functions.  We want the url <code>/123</code> to trigger this function and return the url as a 301 redirect.  For that we turn to API Gateway.  It's a poweful, flexible tool with a million options, but we're just going to use it to hot-glue urls to lambda functions.  For our read function, we can configure a resource (<code>123</code>) and a method on that resource (<code>GET</code>) to trigger our Lambda function.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Api Gateway wasn't built to support thousands and thousands of separate endpoints like <code>/123</code>, <code>/124</code>, <code>/125</code>, etc.  There's a limit of 300 resources per api.  You can request an increase on that limit, but I suspect "because I thought it would be funny" won't be a compelling justification.</p>

<p>We're not stuck, though—we can fix this problem the way we fix all problems: more Lambda functions!  We'll just define one new endpoint that takes a url parameter: <code>/{id}</code> in api gateway.  That'll execute a single Lambda function (call it <code>read(id)</code>) that will, in turn, execute the specific read function (eg <code>read_123</code>) we want.</p>

<p>In pseudocode, <code>read(123)</code> would look like:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
    read_result = AWS.lambda.invoke('read_' + event.id)
    return {
        'statusCode': 301,
        'headers': { 'Location': read_result['url'] }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Alright, so using two different types of read functions, <code>read(id)</code> and <code>read_123</code> (and <code>_124</code>, etc), we've got shortened links working.  Loading up <code>/123</code> in your browser tells ApiGateway to run <code>read(123)</code>, which runs <code>read_123</code>, which returns <code>html5zombo.com</code>.</p>



<p>Soon we'll want to put together a function to generate these short links.  There's another hurdle first, though.  We need a global counter!  When a user goes to shorten a new link, we need to know what the next id (eg <code>124</code>) is.  We need to store a global counter somewhere.</p>

<p>Now, saner developers might tell you that Lambda is stateless and you can't use it to store data.  You and I know those people just lack strength of character.  Remember: if Lambda functions don't solve your problem, you're not using enough of them.</p>

<p>As it turns out, all you need to do to store a global counter is write a self-updating Lambda function!  Let's call this function <code>iterator</code>, and in pseudocode it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
  i = 0
  myCode = load the code for this function from the filesystem
  myCode = myCode.replace('i = ' + i, 'i = ' + (i+1))
  AWS.lambda.updateCode('iterator', myCode)
  return i
</code></pre>

<p>Self-updating code: what could go wrong?</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fmarkhughes%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F01%2FTerminator-2-1200x873.jpg" width="600" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, the observant among you might be noticing a problem (besides the obvious one that this is all horrifying):  concurrent requests to this function might overwrite each other.  A good fix for this would be to use literally anything else in technology as a datastore.  But since obviously that's not the fix we're going to use, we'll just tell Lambda to limit the maximum concurrency on this function to 1 so it can never run twice in a row!</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinkuchta.com/files/lambda_concurrency.png" width="600" alt=""></p>

<p>And now we've got our massively overcomplicated way of storing one number in the cloud!  Here I am using <code>apex</code>, a handy Lambda cli tool, to run the <code>iterator</code> function repeatedly.</p>

<pre><code>$ apex invoke iterator -a '$LATEST'
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "74"}
$ apex invoke iterator -a '$LATEST'
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "75"}
$ apex invoke iterator -a '$LATEST'
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "76"}
</code></pre>



<p>Alright, we now have everything we need to create a write function - the one that actually shortens links for us.  We want to be able to send an HTTP POST request with a body like <code>{ url: 'hamsterdance.com' }</code> and receive a shortened url like <code>kmk.party/123</code> in return.  In yet more pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
  # Grab the url we're given
  url = json.parse(event.body).url
  nextI = AWS.lambda.invoke('iterator')

  newFunctionBody = """
    def handle(event, context):
      return { url: ${url} }
  """
  newFunctionName = 'read_' + nextI
  AWS.lambda.createFunction(newFunctionName, newFunctionBody)
  return 'kmk.party/' + nextI
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, every time you use this <code>write</code> function to create a new shortened link, we make an api call to generate an entirely new Lambda function with unique code.  This is totally reasonable and not at all a ridiculous misuse of an amazing tool.</p>

<p>As a brief aside, I should mention that this is a horrible security hole.  <code>url</code> is untrusted user input, but we're just interpolating it into code and <em>running</em> that code.  We can work around that, though, by <a href="https://github.com/kkuchta/url_shortener/blob/master/functions/write/main.py#L21">base-64 encoding and decoding the url</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://kevinkuchta.com/files/lambda_diagram.png" width="600" alt=""></p>

<p>All the pieces of this abomination are in place.</p>

<p>Now the only thing left for a proper url-shortener is a frontend!  There are plenty of simple and nearly free places to host a flat file with a bit of JS to act as that frontend so obviously we're not going to use any of those.  Hosting a flat file is, though pointless and bizarre, quite easy on Lambda (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': file.read('./index.html'),
        'headers': { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Index.html just contains some JS to make an HTTP POST to our write function and display the resulting short link.</p>

<p>And there it is: a url-shortener using only Lambda.  We've abused AWS's api to make self-updating functions.  We've flooded our AWS account with single-purpose functions whose output is hardcoded.  We've used the wrongest possible tool to serve flat files, slowly.  We stopped <em>just</em> short of a publicly-available arbitrary code execution bug on my personal AWS account.  Let's call it a day!  Here it is live at <a href="https://kmk.party/">kmk.party</a> and here's the <a href="https://github.com/kkuchta/url_shortener">full, non-pseudocode</a>.</p>

<p>FAQ:</p>

<p>This is really neat <strong>Yes it is thank you</strong></p>

<p>This is absolutely horrifying <strong>See previous answer</strong></p>

<p>Should I use this in production? <strong>Only if you video tape it for posterity</strong></p>

<p>WHY? <strong>Because someone said I couldn't do it</strong></p>

<p>How would you actually go about building a url-shortener? <strong>The inspiration for this post was one called <a href="https://outcrawl.com/go-url-shortener-lambda/">Building a URL Shortener with Go and AWS Lambda</a>.  I got really excited in the moments between reading that title and realizing it was really building a shortener using Go and Lambda <em>and</em> DynamoDB.  When I get overexcited, things like this happen.</strong></p>

<p>Why python? <strong>I wrote half of this in node, but creating/updating Lambda functions requires creating a zip file which node doesn't do natively.  Using a node library requires a huge node_modules folder that must itself get zipped up when you're making a self-updating function like some kind of crazy person.  Switching to python, with its built-in Zipfile module, saved a lot of time and made the iterator run in under a second instead of around 5.</strong></p>

<p>I very much enjoy Code That Should Not Be <strong>Then you might like <a href="https://kevinkuchta.com/2017/07/disguising-ruby-as-javascript/">Disguising Ruby as Javascript</a> where I wield ruby metaprogramming like a hacksaw in a horror film.</strong></p>

<p>I know a way to make this whole thing even more ridiculous <strong>Tweet at me (<a href="https://twitter.com/kkuchta">@kkuchta</a>)! The world-fire can always use more fuel.</strong></p>

						<p><strong>Is there still research to be done in Programming Languages?</strong> This essay touches both on the topic of programming languages and on the nature of research work. I am mostly concerned in analyzing this question in the context of Academia, i.e. within the expectations of academic programs and research funding agencies that support research work in the STEM disciplines (<span>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics</span>). This is not the only possible perspective, but it is the one I am taking here.</p>
<p><span id="more-416"></span>PLs are dear to my heart, and a considerable chunk of my career was made in that area. As a designer, there is something fundamentally interesting in designing a language of any kind. It’s even more interesting and gratifying when people actually start exercising those languages to create non-trivial software systems. As a user, I love to use programming languages that I haven’t used before, even when the languages in question make me curse every other line.</p>
<p>But the truth of the matter is that ever since I finished <a href="ftp://ftp.ccs.neu.edu/pub/people/crista/publications/thesis/index.html">my Ph.D.</a> in the late 90s, and especially since I joined the ranks of Academia, I have been having a hard time convincing myself that research in PLs is a worthy endeavor. I feel really bad about my rational arguments against it, though. Hence this essay. Perhaps by the time I am done with it I will have come to terms with this dilemma.</p>
<p>Back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, programming languages were a BigDeal, with large investments, upfront planning, and big drama on standardization committees (Ada was the epitome of that model). Things have changed dramatically during the 80s. Since the 90s, a considerable percentage of new languages that ended up being very popular were designed by lone programmers, some of them kids with no research inclination, some as a side hobby, and without any grand goal other than either making some routine activities easier or for plain hacking fun. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP, by Rasmus Lerdorf circa 1994, “originally used for tracking visits to his online resume, he named the suite of scripts ‘Personal Home Page Tools,’ more frequently referenced as ‘PHP Tools.’ ” [<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/history.php.php">1</a>] PHP is a marvel of how a horrible language can become the foundation of large numbers of applications… for a second time! <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html">Worse is Better</a> redux. According one <a href="http://langpop.com/">informal but interesting survey</a>, PHP is now the 4th most popular programming language out there, losing only to C, Java and C++.</li>
<li>JavaScript, by Brendan Eich circa 1995, “Plus, I had to be done in ten days or something worse than JS would have happened.” [<a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2010/10/every-day-i-learn-something-new-and-stupid/#comment-1021">2</a>] According to that same survey, JavaScript is the 5th most popular language, and I suspect it is climbing up that rank really fast. It may be #1 by now.</li>
<li>Python, by Guido van Rossum circa 1990, “I was looking for a ‘hobby’ programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas.” [<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/">3</a>] Python comes at #6, and its strong adoption by scientific computing communities is well know.</li>
<li>Ruby, by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto circa 1994, “I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That’s why I decided to design my own language.” [<a href="http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html">4</a>] At #10 in that survey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare this mindset with the context in which the the older well-known programming languages emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortran, 50s, originally developed by IBM as part of their core business in computing machines.</li>
<li>Cobol, late 50s, designed by a large committee from the onset, sponsored by the DoD.</li>
<li>Lisp, late 50s, main project occupying 2 professors at MIT and their students, with the grand goal of producing an algebraic list processing language for artificial intelligence work, also funded by the DoD.</li>
<li>C, early 70s, part of the large investment that Bell Labs was doing in the development of Unix.</li>
<li>Smalltalk, early 70s, part of a large investment that Xerox did in “inventing the future” of computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back then, developing a language processor was, indeed, a very big deal. Computers were slow, didn’t have a lot of memory, the language processors had to be written in low-level assembly languages… it wasn’t something someone would do in their rooms as a hobby, to put it mildly. Since the 90s, however, with the emergence of PCs and of decent low-level languages like C, developing a language processor is no longer a BigDeal. Hence, languages like PHP and JavaScript.</p>
<p>There is a lot of fun in designing new languages, but this fun is not an exclusive right of researchers with, or working towards, Ph.Ds. Given all the knowledge about programming languages these days, anyone can do it. And many do. And here’s the first itchy point: <em>there appears to be no correlation between the success of a programming language and its emergence in the form of someone’s doctoral or post-doctoral work. </em>This bothers me a lot, as an academic. It appears that deep thoughts, consistency, rigor and all other things we value as scientists aren’t that important for mass adoption of programming languages. But then again, <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html">I’m not the first to say it</a>. It’s just that this phenomenon is hard to digest, and if you really grasp it, it has tremendous consequences. If people (the potential users) don’t care about conceptual consistency, why do we keep on trying to achieve that?</p>
<p>To be fair, some of those languages designed in the 90s as side projects, as they became important, eventually became more rigorous and consistent, and attracted a fair amount of academic attention and industry investment. For example, the Netscape JavaScript hacks quickly fell on Guy Steele’s lap resulting in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">ECMAScript specification</a>. Python was never a hack even if it started as a Christmas hobby. Ruby is a fun language and quite elegant from the beginning. PHP… well… it’s fun for possibly the wrong reasons. But the core of the matter is that “the right thing” was not the goal. It seems that <span><em>a reliable implementation of a language that addresses an important practical need</em></span> is the key for the popularity of a programming language. But being opportunistic isn’t what research is supposed to be about… (or is it?)</p>
<p>Also to be fair, not all languages designed in the 90s and later started as side projects. For example, Java was a relatively large investment by Sun Microsystems. So was .NET later by Microsoft.</p>
<p>And, finally, all of these new languages, even when created over a week as someone’s pet project, sit on the shoulders of all things that existed before. This leads me to the second itch: <em>one striking commonality in all modern programming languages, especially the popular ones, is how little innovation there is in them</em>! Without exception, including the languages developed in research groups, they all feel like mashups of concepts that already existed in programming languages in 1979, wrapped up in their own idiosyncratic syntax. (I lied: exceptions go to aspects and monads both of which came in the 90s)</p>
<p><a href="http://tagide.com/blog/?attachment_id=544" rel="attachment wp-att-544"><img title="PLs" src="http://tagide.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/PLs-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>So one pertinent question is: given that not much seems to have emerged since 1979 (that’s 30+ years!), is there still anything to <em>innovate</em> in programming languages? Or have we reached the asymptotic plateau of innovation in this area?</p>
<p>I need to make an important detour here on the nature of research.</p>
<h3>&lt;Begin Detour&gt;</h3>
<p>Perhaps I’m completely off; perhaps <em>producing innovative new software</em> <em>is not a goal of [STEM] research</em>. Under this approach, any software work is dismissed from STEM pursuits, unless it is necessary for some specific goal — like if you want to study some far-off galaxy and you need an IT infrastructure to collect the data and make simulations (S for Science); or if you need some glue code for piecing existing systems together (T for Technology); or if you need to improve the performance of something that already exists (E for Engineering); or if you are a working on some Mathematical model of computation and want to make your ideas come to life in the form of a language (M for Mathematics). This is an extreme submissive view of software systems, one that places software in the back sit of STEM and that denies the existence of value in research in/by software itself. If we want to lead something on our own, let’s just… do empirical studies of technology or become biologists/physicists/chemists/mathematicians or make existing things perform better or do theoretical/statistical models of universes that already exist or that are created by others. Right?</p>
<p>I confess I have a dysfunctional relationship with this idea. Personally, I can’t be happy without creating software things, but I have been able to make my scientist-self function both as a cold-minded analyst and, at times, as an expert passenger in someone else’s research project. The design work, for me, has moved to sabbatical time, evenings and weekends; I don’t publish it [much] other than the code itself and some informal descriptions. And yet, I loathe this situation.</p>
<p>I loathe it because it’s is clear to me that software systems are something very, <em>very</em> special. Software revolutionized everything in unexpected ways, including the methods and practices that our esteemed colleagues in the “hard” sciences hold near and dear for a very long time. The evolution of information technology in the past 60 years has been _way_ off from what our colleagues thought they needed. Over and over again, software systems have been created that weren’t part of any scientific project, as such, and that ended up playing a central role in Science. Instead of trying to mimic our colleagues’ traditional practices, “computer scientists” ought to be showing the way to a new kind of science — maybe <em>that </em><a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1?firstview=1">new kind of science</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sciences-Artificial-Herbert-Simon/dp/0262691914">that one</a> or maybe something else. I dare to suggest that the something else is related to the design of things that have software in them. It should not be called Science. It is a bit like Engineering, but it’s not it either because we’re not dealing [just] with physical things. Technology doesn’t cut it either. It needs a new name, something that denotes “the design of things with software in them.” I will call it Design for short, …</p></div></div>

    <p>Throughout my career, I’ve crossed paths with quite a few developers whose
chief expertise has run the gamut of programming languages: C, Python,
Java, Ruby, JavaScript, and so on. The programming language(s) in which you
build expertise undoubtedly influence the way you think about problems and
what solutions you’re likely to reach for, and they do so in a big way.
The common thread I’ve noticed, though, is that developers on average lack
competency in their operating system shell. That lack of competency often
manifests as an <em>aversion</em> to the shell.</p>
<p>You may see that a developer prefers to use point-and-click interfaces
when a shell can get the job done more quickly and with exponentially
more flexibility. You might find that they write scripts in their native
language rather than struggle with the intricacies of <code>bash</code>. At one of
my previous workplaces, I uncovered a 30 line Ruby script that could
have been replaced by one pipeline in <code>bash</code>. Yes, a single pipeline.</p>
<p>This shell aversion is a real shame, because the shell can be a very powerful
tool in one’s technical arsenal. The shell is <em>the</em> textual interface to your
computer.  Regardless of familiarity, every developer will be forced to use a
shell in some ongoing capacity. That use may be to invoke <code>git</code>, grab a quick
snapshot of what is happening in the cloud with <code>aws</code>, or start a container
with <code>docker</code> or <code>docker-compose</code>. The uses are there, and they are many.</p>
<p>Because my experience has largely been infrastructure focused, the shell is more
often a sensible tool for me to reach for than it is for other developers.
Consequently, I learned many hard lessons about shell, best practices,
patterns, and anti-patterns.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the topic at hand today. A friend sent me a blog post
claiming to implement a “safe” template for bash. Just insert your shell
into the provided blank. It’s a fairly hefty template too, weighing in at
just under 100 lines.</p>

<p>I won’t sugar coat it. There’s a <em>lot</em> wrong with this. Let’s start
from the top.</p>
<h2 id="the-airing-of-grievances">The Airing of Grievances</h2>
<h3 id="the-shebang">The Shebang</h3>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</code></pre><p>In case you don’t know what a shebang is for, here’s the quick
rundown: generally, when you execute a file on your computer, it’s a raw
binary that your operating system understands and can execute natively.
Being that scripts aren’t binaries, a file starting with <code>#!</code> signals
that instead, the command that follows should be executed and the the
file path passed to the interpreter.</p>
<p>In this case, we’ve got <code>env</code> searching a user’s <code>PATH</code> and executing
<code>bash</code>. Proponents of this method would tell you that it smooths over
file system hierarchy differences between machines. That’s technically
true.</p>
<p>But there’s a big problem here: if you’re at the level of experience
where you’re copy/pasting a template, your <code>bash</code> script isn’t
going to run on any machine other than the one you wrote it on (or
other very similar systems where <code>bash</code> can be found at the same
place). Using <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code> as the shebang gives the
<em>misleading</em> impression that you can just take the script and
run it somewhere else. And that’s just not true unless your script does
almost nothing of interest, or you actually understand the differences
between various platforms and can account for them when writing
your script. Furthermore, as the author, you probably originally
wrote the script with the system-wide <code>bash</code> in mind - so why
shouldn’t you just use that one?</p>
<p>“But John,” you say. “When I use <code>python</code> and <code>ruby</code> and other scripting
languages, I always use <code>#!/usr/bin/env</code>.” You sure do. The difference
between <code>bash</code> and those other languages is that those other ones
have tooling built around them, like <code>pyenv</code>, <code>poetry</code>, <code>rbenv</code> and <code>bundler</code>,
to facilitate running at a non-standard location with a particular
interpreter version and collection of libraries.</p>
<p>Don’t misrepresent your script from the outset. Just use <code>#!/bin/bash</code>
unless you can actually handle running in another environment.</p>
<h3 id="the-set-smorgasbord">The <code>set</code> Smorgasbord</h3>
<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail
</code></pre><p>Here we’ve got a smattering of shell options that are commonly used, but
are not universal. Here’s what <code>bash</code> has to say about those options,
with irrelevant options removed for brevity:</p>
<pre><code>$ help set
      -e  Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
      -u  Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
      -o option-name
          Set the variable corresponding to option-name:
              pipefail     the return value of a pipeline is the status of
                           the last command to exit with a non-zero status,
                           or zero if no command exited with a non-zero status
      -E  If set, the ERR trap is inherited by shell functions.
</code></pre><p>Right off the bat, <code>set -e</code> is a giant landmine. What happens when you pipe
some text to <code>grep</code> and nothing matches? Well, <code>grep</code> exits with a non-zero
status. Oops!</p>
<p>You can work around this with an <code>if</code> statement, or slapping an <code>|| true</code>
on the end, but it creates an entirely new problem. It’s still something you
have to remember to do everywhere, but only for very few binaries.</p>
<p><code>grep</code> is not the only binary that uses its exit code informatively.
<code>terraform plan -detailed-exitcode</code>, for example, will let you know whether
the plan showed a diff or not, or if there was an error during the plan
process. In this sort of case, you’d probably want to capture the exit code
with something like <code>rc="$?"</code> immediately after so that you can deal with it
as appropriate.</p>
<p><code>set -u</code> is fine, and I would recommend it generally. That said, you’ve got to
be responsible and initialize anything you’re going expecting to get via the
environment. If you don’t, your program will bomb with a canned error message
and exit code. Your users (or future you) will appreciate a reminder regarding
expected environment variables and what their values ought to be. For example,
you might write something like:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5
</span><span> 6
</span><span> 7
</span><span> 8
</span><span> 9
</span><span>10
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>
<span>set</span> -uo pipefail

<span>MY_SECRET_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>MY_SECRET_PASSWORD</span><span>:-</span><span>}</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> -z <span>"</span><span>$MY_SECRET_PASSWORD</span><span>"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>'you forgot to provide your secret password'</span> &gt;<span>&amp;</span><span>2</span>
    <span>exit</span> <span>1</span>
<span>fi</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>I don’t take any exceptions with <code>set -o pipefail</code>.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with <code>set -E</code> is that its only usefulness comes
from catching unhandled errors in your script. Unhandled errors are
a deficiency with the script as written, and should be corrected. And, like
<code>set -e</code>, you run into the same sort of problem where executables
might use the exit code to communicate some information that is not
necessarily a fatal error.</p>
<h3 id="an-immediate-directory-change">An Immediate Directory Change</h3>
<p>On line 5, before any script logic has been executed, this template will
change the current directory:</p>
<pre><code>cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre><p>Want to pass the script a relative file path? Not on my watch.</p>
<p>Don’t change directories in your script unless you are ready to deal with
the consequences of that.</p>
<p>Additionally, this displays another anti-pattern: the use of <code>$BASH_SOURCE</code>.
It only works in <code>bash</code>, not in any other shell. The manual says that:</p>
<pre><code>BASH_SOURCE
    An array variable whose members are the source filenames where the
    corresponding shell function names in the FUNCNAME array variable are
    defined.  The shell function ${FUNCNAME[$i]} is defined in the file
    ${BASH_SOURCE[$i]} and called from ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}.
</code></pre><p>Proponents of the use of <code>$BASH_SOURCE</code> would argue that <code>$BASH_SOURCE</code> works
both when a script is sourced and when it is executed. That is true,
but also only useful in the rarest of circumstances.</p>
<p>Sourcing functions like an include or import in other programming languages.
The sourced script is effectively inlined. Unless both the sourcing script
and sourced script are built with that in mind, you’re signing up for chaos.</p>
<p>I have been writing bash …</p></div></section></div>

</p><p><strong>EDIT: The update has been available since last Friday. You can check it out by downloading the latest update from FreeSO servers, then following the instructions later in this post!</strong></p>
<p>Three years ago, any chance of anyone reviving The Sims Online looked very slim. Any existing project seemed to either fall off in activity, be a hoax in the first place, or burn hopeful fans with controversial donations for a server that was never meant to be. Despite all the ruckus, three years ago is when we got the first glimmer of hope that TSO would be back again – a convincing UI recreation of the initial few screens of the game including Create A Sim, with a lot of backend work to load important game content. Developed by Afr0 and ddfczm, this recreation was called Project Dollhouse, and it’s what inspired me to work towards this same goal. Despite exciting developments in SimAntics emulation by me and ddfczm, with ingame footage of TSO objects somewhat working, this community stayed at only a few members – nobody believed anymore in TSO ever returning. Our community slowly grew as I implemented the online sandbox mode and split into FreeSO, and people finally started believing that it was possible. The launch into beta was a spectacular surprise.</p>
<p>Today, we’ve almost done it. It has been a heck of a long journey, and finally people don’t have to <em>believe</em> in something anymore – it’s right here. A fully re-implemented TSO client and server is available for all to use, with source available so it can be developed further by anyone in the future, maybe tens of years from now. The ability to play TSO will never truly disappear, thanks to the efforts of its community.</p>
<p>Recently, I attempted to port The Sims 1 to mobile by myself, something many users never would have believed would work until recently. Unfortunately this was not meant to be, but I demonstrated that it was never impossible, and that it can even be done well by an independent developer.</p>
<p>To keep up with my trend of doing stupid things nobody believes in, I decided to make good on a crazy idea I shared three years ago, and have even mocked on one april fools since it felt so unfeasible at the time. I had an idea that The Sims and The Sims Online could potentially be rendered and playable in 3D, in real time, using mesh reconstruction techniques. Our next update will have an experimental mode showing that this is indeed possible!</p>
<p>I’m guessing your immediate thoughts from seeing our header image is, “how is this even remotely possible? the objects in this game are 2D sprites”. This article will also explain how it wasn’t as impossible as it seemed, and explain how it was achieved.</p>


<p>The update will release within the week. It will include the 3D mode shown in the video (see later in this post for more info), but also several critical bug fixes including fixes for interactions, disappearing purchased objects, lot save mishaps and many common SimAntics exceptions.</p>
<p>Note that in 3D mode, the first time you see each drawgroup the game will freeze or stutter heavily. This is because it is generating the 3D meshes the game uses from the sprites – these are not included with the FreeSO client!</p>
<p>The update also includes two enhancements for 2D mode. You can now use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and our new 3D wall component can be used in 2D mode to generate 3D wall shadows. You’ll find a toggle for this in the options menu.</p>

<p>Though Simitone can no longer be developed for mobile devices, the source is still available and buildable on windows desktop. Since Simitone runs on the FreeSO engine, these changes work in it as well. Gameplay is still in the same state as seen in the last video, so it’s not entirely playable.</p>

<p>The idea of converting TS1/TSO objects to 3D was actually something I was interested in even before I started working on Project Dollhouse or FreeSO. While Niotso and PD were still active, I frequented the Niotso IRC on hackint, where we discussed the various formats in the game.</p>
<p>Most other isometric games simply draw sprites from back to front, which works well for most games, assuming that the sprites are never meant to intersect each other. The Sims is a rather special case, since object sprites intersecting with avatars is a key requirement for most of the objects – specific parts of a shower, for example, must appear over the sim while they are in it. For this purpose, all object sprites in The Sims have a little extra depth… in that they literally store a depth value for each pixel in the sprite, as it was when it was originally rendered from a 3D model. This is called its z-buffer, and allows per pixel depth comparison between objects and avatars.</p>
<p>I created a javascript tool for experimenting with TS1 sprite rendering, which mostly served as a way to tweak and examine how the z-buffers stored in object sprites should be used to perform depth ordering between objects and avatars that might intersect.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.niotso.org/zbuffer/">http://www.niotso.org/zbuffer/</a></p>
<p>This was not the only function of this renderer, though. A custom version I made was actually able to render objects from non-standard angles, using the z buffers and some vector math to offset their pixels to a new position in 3D space. (press 1, 2 to rotate)</p>
<p><a href="http://freeso.org/zbuffer/index.html">http://freeso.org/zbuffer/index.html</a></p>
<p>This was a good proof of concept, but obviously this kind of 2D per-pixel transformation is too slow to run in real-time on a lot. It was clear a true solution would need to generate a 3D model which could be transformed and rendered on the GPU.</p>
<p>You could say that this has always been the secondary goal of this project, though obviously I never like to get people’s expectations up if they might be disappointed. It’s always been on my mind, either way.</p>

<p>Developing the whole thing into a playable state took about a week. Not kidding – since the entire game was already there, and terrain was already in 3D, it didn’t take long to get a prototype working. The first steps were simply generating meshes for existing objects in the game and displaying them by themselves in volcanic. This was done to test how viable applying such a technique to the whole game might be, on a per object basis.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/5c9cf87d8aa7c062064c705da94f853e.gif" width="187" height="225"></p>
<p>These triangle meshes were literally generated as heightmaps of the z-buffers, without any tricks. It became clear that these meshes would have too many triangles to render 1000-fold on a typical TSO lot, so the next step was to obtain and adapt a mesh simplification algorithm to create meshes with managable triangle counts. This worked incredibly well – typical reductions were usually 50-fold. Additional techniques were applied after this to remove duplicate triangles, but that will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>Two days after starting, I’d written an alternate implementation of the world that attempted to render with a 3D camera. This was weird enough in itself – seeing TS1 graphics from another angle, even without objects, was really surreal. This mode immediately used a modified shader for drawing grass and build mode gridlines, but was completely unplayable. Ground and object clicking completely relied on the isometric perspective – and had to be re-implemented later in a more universal fashion.</p>
<p>Later that night, I got the game rendering objects too, and off the bat it ran surprisingly well. Some of the objects had clear z issues, and there was no way to render walls in 3d, but the game looked like it could potentially function at some point.<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/268515111520567296/346818287176515594/unknown.png"></p>
<p>Objects quickly gained their own shader to function with our custom lighting, and using a simple bounding box + raycast I was able to make objects clickable as well.</p>

<p>Walls were quite tricky, since the original wall component generated a 2D sprite list, I had to re-implement wall rendering from scratch to generate 3D wall geometry with cuts and thick walls. This only took a day, but the recompile time for that single class is a testament to its complexity (though it is surprisingly simpler than the original 2D wall component).</p>
<p>One notable thing is that walls in The Sims 1 make no physical sense – no matter what direction you look at them from, the “front” of it appears to be dead on the edge of the tile, while the thickness of the wall extends back away from the camera. To represent this in 3D and avoid clipping issues with doors, walls and paintings, the wall actually has to shift away from the camera depending on the view direction. Thankfully this effect is subtle.</p>

<p>From this point, I added experimented with rendering the city view as part of the sandbox, and the result quickly became very cool. Around this point I also replaced our old mouse -&gt; terrain position estimation with a more robust raycasting solution too, which allows objects to be placed in 3d, go here to work correctly and a few more core game features to work correctly. This change will actually also benefit the 2D engine – complex terrain will no longer be impossible to click on.</p>

<p>(these are development screenshots, the meshes for the objects, wall shad0ws and the skybox will look slightly different now)</p>
<p>This past week has been writing tweaks for the mesh reconstruction, playtesting, visual improvements, robust camera controls and 3D wall shadows.</p>

<p>Any single graphical state for an object in The Sims is called a Drawgroup (DGRP). These contain information for positioning sprites in 3D space, for multiple zooms and rotations. We wish to create 3D meshes for each of these graphical states, which we can then render in place of the 2D sprites.</p>
<ul>
<li>A heightmap-like mesh is generated directly from each sprite in the DGRP, and appropriately transformed from the isometric sprite (x, y, z) into object space. Meshes for “dynamic sprites” – toggleable sprites for each DGRP are kept as separate meshes to make them easier to toggle.
<ul>
<li>This can possibly be improved by omitting triangles that …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

<p>For much of 2020, Vicente Zavarce has been running Yummy, the delivery app he founded last year in Venezuela, from San Francisco. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Venezuela shut its borders, leaving him stranded thousands of miles away from his Caracas-based team. Zavarce, who previously worked at Postmates, started Yummy in the hopes of bringing a similar delivery app model to his home country — a market most investors and tech companies have been unwilling to touch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to vast oil reserves, Venezuela was among the richest countries in Latin America. But in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/12/01/falling-crude-oil-prices-crush-venezuelas-ailing-economy.html">2014</a>, as oil prices fell, the country’s economy began collapsing. President Nicolás Maduro cracked down on the civil unrest that followed, leading the United States and other countries to impose sanctions on Venezuela. In September, the Trump administration levied a <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-responds-to-the-maduro-regimes-attempts-to-corrupt-democratic-elections-in-venezuela/">new round</a> of penalties on the country, accusing the government of depriving citizens of “free and fair elections.” The International Monetary Fund estimates that the country’s GDP will <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/VEN">drop by 25%</a> this year and that inflation will remain at its breathtaking high of 6,500%. Since 2015, around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-security-un/venezuela-exodus-set-to-top-5-million-as-long-term-needs-grow-officials-say-idUSKBN1X21MM">5 million</a> Venezuelans have fled the country, and of those who remain, nearly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-poverty/venezuela-poverty-rate-surges-amid-economic-collapse-inflation-study-idUSL1N2EE1MG">65% live in poverty</a>.</p>



<p>Zavarce says those circumstances didn’t deter him from starting a company in the country where he grew up. His gamble on Venezuela, one of the last untouched markets for delivery and e-commerce in the region, paid off. Yummy raised $450,000 from investors and now employs 50 people. The platform has more than 250 delivery drivers, and more than 200 merchants have signed up. In October, just six months after it formally launched, Yummy was acquired by the Central American super-app Hugo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, <em>Rest of World</em> spoke with Zavarce about how he built Yummy. The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>



<h3><strong>Venezuela is a market other tech companies have avoided. Can you talk about why you started Yummy in what you knew would be a really difficult environment?</strong></h3>



<p>Everyone — my friends from [delivery app] Rappi, my friends from Uber Eats, my friends from Postmates — told me I was insane, but they supported me.</p>



<p>I am from Venezuela. I grew up in the streets of Caracas until I was 18 and then went to college in the U.S. Regardless of being abroad, my heart is still Venezuelan. At Postmates, I was in charge of user acquisitions, and I helped lead our expansion into Mexico City, where we were not the biggest player. I faced challenges that I overcame, and it gave me great experience. At a certain point, it felt almost irresponsible not to use my experience to start something in my home country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started working on Yummy in October 2019. We thought it was ridiculous that this kind of thing didn’t exist in Venezuela. I knew there was a market because there was already a lot of restaurant e-commerce happening on WhatsApp and Instagram. People would message a restaurant on Instagram to get its WhatsApp number, and then they would call them and have a ten-minute conversation just to place a delivery order. It was happening in this very hacky way because there wasn’t a platform to aggregate the restaurants and provide a fleet of drivers.</p>



<h3><strong>Knowing that Yummy was really the first service of its kind in Venezuela, what things did you have to think about that you wouldn’t have to at a company like Uber Eats or Postmates?</strong></h3>



<p>We really had to teach drivers about the service. In the U.S., people know what Uber Eats is, and if you want to work for them, you can just download the app. Because we were starting from scratch, we created a three-day training course for applicants to get certified as Yummy drivers. We cover things like how to interact with restaurants and customers and how to properly store food. A lot of our customers pay in cash, and we don’t want our drivers becoming targets for robbery. Once a driver collects a certain amount of cash, they’re instructed to go to one of Yummy’s offices to drop it off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Connectivity is also a huge issue. To ensure some of the restaurants we worked with had consistent Wi-Fi, we actually had to buy them hotspots, which they paid us back for in installments. When we were designing the app, we were very conscious about its size, to be sure that images and menus could load without eating up too much data. Because cell signals can be unreliable in urban areas, we also acquired a company called Dingo. It built a way for people to place and receive orders over WhatsApp using a chatbot; you don’t need the fanciest phone to order from Yummy. So you can order in the app itself or over WhatsApp.</p>



<h3><strong>Were investors worried about supporting a company working in Venezuela?</strong></h3>



<p>If I were to start a business in the U.S., as someone with experience, a strong team, and a good idea, I probably would have raised money before launching. That wasn’t the case for us because no one really believed that we would succeed, at least not enough to dip into their own pockets to support us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever we would talk to investors, the conversation would go something like: There’s no competition there. You have the advantage of being first. Your team is fantastic. You have experience with a larger food-delivery company — but Venezuela is very risky.</p>



<p>We launched with our own money and by raising capital from family and friends. Once we had three months of results that showed hypergrowth, then I could approach investors with a different story. We grew at a rate that made us one of the fastest-growing food-delivery apps in history. That was attractive to investors, despite the risks of the Venezuelan market.</p>

<h3><strong>How did you take into consideration wealth inequality in Venezuela when you thought about who your ideal customers would be?</strong></h3>



<p>At the beginning, we were more of a luxury service. We had to think strategically because we wanted to capture wealthy individuals first. When we started, we didn’t have any funding, so the service wasn’t cheap. In cities, the wealth divide is really geographical, and the wealthier neighborhoods were also safer for our drivers.</p>



<p>But our goal was always to make Yummy cheaper once we had funding, and that’s essentially what we did. Now, we’re focused on having options for everyone. For instance, you can order from McDonald’s now. There’s much more diversity in the neighborhoods where we’re receiving orders from — it’s definitely no longer relegated to only the wealthy communities.</p>



<h3>The pandemic has been a boon to a lot of delivery apps globally. Did that hold true for Yummy?</h3>



<p>I’d say that, overall, we netted zero, between the positives and negatives. All the high schools and universities are closed in Venezuela, which are historically hot zip codes for food delivery no matter where you are in the world. Offices are also closed, which is another big user base. Venezuela has a huge party scene — clubs stay open until 6 in the morning. Late-night food and drinks were a big portion of our business model, and then suddenly all of that was gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started focusing more on breakfast orders and also delivering from supermarkets. We also tweaked the app so that you can get food from multiple restaurants in the same order. Parents can order sushi, and kids can get pizza.</p>



<p>On the positive side, it really drove merchant adoption. When the pandemic started, the government mandated that restaurants operate with only pickup or delivery. So that gave us the opportunity to introduce this business model right on time. We approached restaurants and convinced them to open “dark” kitchens [restaurants optimized for delivery with no front-of-house service] and sell through us. Some restaurants ended up making essentially what they were making before the pandemic.</p>



<h3><strong>Are you worried about competition?</strong></h3>



<p>We knew that if we proved this could be done, a big company might move into the country within 10 months. We have continued trying to quickly expand. One way we’ve guarded against competition is by having about 50% of the restaurants we work with sign exclusivity agreements. That’s also part of why we began expanding to grocery-store delivery and delivery from other kinds of shops, and it’s why we want to go beyond food. We want to be the app where people go for everything.</p>



<h3><strong>You’ve just been acquired by the El Salvadoran app Hugo, only six months into Yummy’s operation. How is that changing the company’s future?</strong></h3>



<p>We really felt that the team at Hugo, which is a super-app expanding throughout the Caribbean, really understood our vision. They started out in their home country, El Salvador, which is also a risky market. They had some of the same challenges we did. They really understood underserved economies, connectivity issues, the culture; what they built is oriented around what we were trying to build. We can use their technology and really focus on growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Caracas, there are maybe 500 restaurants you would want to order from, whereas, in New York City, there are thousands. If you focus on only one vertical — like food delivery — there’s a limit there that might not exist in the U.S. Once we raised a seed round from AngelList, we decided we were going to expand and become a super-app. In a smaller economy where there is no e-commerce, we have the opportunity to become a one-stop shop for our customers.</p>



<p>As part of the deal, we will be staying on for at least the next four years and continuing to build the company. That was really important for Hugo and us.</p>

				<p>Remember when we used to joke around, debate about politics, have a drink afterwards and hug your  friend with a  different political view. Remember when we would switch on the news and just casually criticize whatever dumb shit both the  political parties were doing. Ahh those were the days.</p>
<p>Remember when we used to hug our friends with a slightly different political view than us. Remember when we switch on the news and make fun of whatever dumb shit those politicians were pulling of. Remember when opinions were objective and not personal.</p>
<p>Now everyone and their grandmother has a political opinion that is so well formed, so true,  that neither of them is going to entertain any counter argument. I have seen decade old friendships end, careers destroyed, families torn apart because of differing political opinions.</p>
<p>We do have faint memories  of  a time before this, where everyone didn’t make everything a part of their identity. Where you could have a reasonable discussion with someone without it ending in a fist fight. Those times are long gone, but how the hell did we arrive here.</p>

<p>There is point on the slope where shit goes downhill, and for us it was that point when Social Media appeared. Social Media in all it’s glorious forms aren’t  inherently bad, it’s when you add big data magic and billions of dollars of advertisement budget to the mix that messes everything up. Suddenly  the thing  that you use to keep tabs of your friends and family, start to keep tabs on you.</p>
<p>Advertisement has always been about attention, that’s why big billboards are lit up in the middle of the  night showing scantily clad women with legs pointing to some shit your won’t need. The sole purpose is to turn your head and to make you take notice. They don’t care who sees it, they just care a lot of us do.</p>
<p>A lot of advertisement on the early days of the internet were similar, they would put banner ads on the  most busiest sites hoping to gather the most eyeballs. It worked  like that for some time  until they  realized rather than billboards  on the side of the  road,  you could target your users. Rather than  advertising on a generic forum about the world, you could advertise on a blog about cars for your new useless engine oil. The people who would be visiting the car blog would probably be the ones who would be most interested in buying your shitty snake oil. Hence targeting was born. The ROI of Internet advertisement skyrocketed, and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Then Social Media came along with a totally different game. They started  to  track your each and every move  building up intricate profiles of you neatly kept on an offshore data-center, opening up an even better gold mine for those sleazy salesmen. Rather than waiting for someone to show up for that stupid  blog post  about that broken down car, they could put the ad for the snake oil right in the feed of a person who loves clicking on car pictures. It was all christmas  in ad town from  then on, and the companies  who had the best  tracking profiles  started swimming in money, and the ones who didn’t started dying out. (Too far ? yeah too far)</p>
<p>After spending a couple of billions and tracking every sneeze and every turn of everyone  who ever set foot in their world,  they started to  realize some thing else. The people who bought the snake oil on the first impression was not the normal person who kind  of loved cars, but the obsessed ones who believed that snake oil was the best oil in the  world and that the best way to save the world was to buy more snake oil. Those were the people that had the most ROI ever, and  the people who wore nice suits in big office buildings decided they wanted more of these obsessed fanatics, and Big Social gladly served them up on a plate.</p>
<p>But even in a large  enough population pool  the people who are obsessed about a lot of shit is really hard to find, and to keep the money flowing they needed more of them. So they did what anyone with a degree in Operations would do, they started manufacturing them.</p>
<p>Big Social realized that the people who  engage  most, who  drive the most revenue are the ones obsessed with the content. They are the most  revenue generating cattle of the ranch, and since everything is a numbers game they started to maximize obsessiveness. Well how do you manufacture people who would die for their views ? How do you manufacture obsessiveness ? Bubbles.</p>
<h2 id="enter-bubbles">Enter Bubbles</h2>
<p>The more the number of positive reinforcement that a person receives about their already existing viewpoints and the more number  of negative reinforcements they see around the opposing ones, the more likely they are to believe their beliefs are true. The more they are engrossed in their bubbles the more they are susceptible to being obsessed.</p>
<p>The  first  time we sign-up for it, they don’t know anything about us. So they ask us for our interests and to add our closest friends. Based on that they show us some generic content  based on our and  our friends interests. Then we start interacting with them, each and every interaction, each and  every pause is recorded and measured and converted  to a  data point. Initially the content is neutral, leaning just to the side  of our interests and our beliefs. The more we interact with it, the more the virtual  profile of ourselves get optimized. With our likes and shares and comments  we build an echo chamber around ourselves, with help from a  black box algorithm designed to optimize  for obsessiveness.</p>
<p>But an echo chamber doesn’t make you and obsessed radical, what makes you one is shock.</p>
<h2 id="enter-shock">Enter Shock</h2>
<p>Shock is what pushes your towards the edge of obsessiveness. Content that has high shock value are borderline impossible to believe. They rock your belief system and lingers on the edge of possibility. It’s purpose is not to make you believe the content right away, but to expand and reinforce your viewpoint so much so that you believe a little more polarized content than what you are used to. That is how you manufacture obsessiveness, that’s how your manufacture  polarization. The cycle is repeated indefinitely nudging you little by little to the edge, until you fall  o ver. Is  it  intentional or  a  byproduct  of an algorithm optimized for profit and engagement maximization is up for debate.</p>
<p>Consider me and Youtube. Like every teenager I had trouble with the ladies and like any other teenager I turned  to the internet for help. I started with dating videos, content which I  was looking for. Then slowly my recommended feed stared to show just one or two videos on how women were the problem of modern society, not enough to turn me to a believer but just enough to shock me. Having been exposed to that I started to normalize videos that bash feminism, SJW’s being owned and rants about how women are the problem. Then my feed started to get populated with  even more  anti-women and videos around red-pill and the manosphere. I am not saying these viewpoints are right or  wrong, but they were shocking  and normalized  a lot  of stuff that I would never have accepted if I was shown then from the start. After a while I started believing a lot of the what was being said, I was starting to suffocate in my own bubble. Luckily I used to read a lot outside the internet and hence had access to contrasting view points. That’s when I realized how deep in the rabbit hole I was. This prompted me to seek out alternate viewpoints and form my own opinions.  If I had kept going I would most probably have turned  into an angry fanatic thirsty for blood on the internet, shouting on some obscure forum on the edge of the internet.</p>
<p>That’s what  the algorithms are designed to do. They have the maximum engagement and attention from how obsessed their users  are. For being obsessed it’s not only vital that you  push the view point forward but also to demean and dehumanize the opposing one, so much so to the point that you believe the views that they hold are clearly wrong.  It pushes us into an us vs them mentality, where we are on right ones  and they are the wrong ones.</p>
<p>After a while we start to internalize what we interact with, it becomes a part of your identity.You start to believe the extreme content that you are exposed to as your own, you start to defend it with all your might.  You can’t entertain an  argument  because it is no  longer an argument  against your opinion,but one against  your identity. To entertain any argument is to acknowledge you are wrong and to prove everything you have interacted with for a long time to be wrong. This is  what  polarizes  us, this is what makes having a friendly conversation about opposing  views impossible in this  day and age. This is what is being done to us. We are divided  by opinions cocooned in our own bubbles, our own  echo chambers which enforce our beliefs and makes us immune to any counter  argument no matter how right or wrong.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-out">Breaking Out</h2>
<p>It’s not easy and fun getting out once you are inside. It’s like the matrix you see and hear and interact with an artificial world designed to hook you in, and like Neo it’s one hell of a ride to unplug. It’s hard but it’s possible, this is how I  did it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the data that they have on you, take away the data and take away the power.</li>
<li>Humanize the opposing view points and the people who make  them. Realize they too have a valid point and that they believe it enough to defend it with all their heart.</li>
<li>Seek out alternate view points, it’s kind of a fun exercise. When you start everything looks stupid and dumb, persist and after a while you will feel a switch inside your brain, when you realize they also have a valid point.</li>
<li>Take some time off and  think deeply about everything and put together a version of the reality and form your own opinions based on them.</li>
<li>Refine those opinions  as you learn more about reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li>Logout of all your Social Media, it’s not that useful anyway</li>
<li>Get a Flip Phone,  looks cooler than  a dumb phone</li>
<li>Life life  as  nature …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You might recall that my Twitter account was <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked</a> and then <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/03/twitter-lockout-again/" data-type="post" data-id="15287">again</a> just two weeks later.</p>



<h2>The first: brute-force</h2>



<p>The  first take-over was most likely a case of brute-forcing my weak password while not having 2FA enabled. I have no excuse for either of those lapses. I had convinced myself I had 2fa enabled which made me take a (too) lax attitude to my short 8-character password that was possible to remember. Clearly, 2fa was not enabled and then the only remaining wall against the evil world was that weak password.</p>



<h2>The second time</h2>



<p>After that first hijack, I immediately changed password to a strong many-character one and I made really sure I enabled 2fa with an authenticator app and I felt safe again. Yet it would only take seventeen days until I <em><strong>again</strong></em> was locked out from my account. This second time, I could see how <em>someone had managed to change the email address</em> associated with my account (displayed when I wanted to reset my password). With the password not working and the account not having the correct email address anymore, I could not reset the password, and my 2fa status had no effect. I was locked out. Again.</p>



<p>It felt related to the first case because I’ve had my Twitter account since May 2008. I had never lost it before and then suddenly after 12+ years, within a period of three weeks, it happens twice?</p>



<h2>Why and how</h2>



<p>How this happened was a complete mystery to me. The account was restored fairly swiftly but I learned nothing from that.</p>



<p>Then someone at Twitter contacted me. After they investigated what had happened and how, I had a chat with a responsible person there and he explained for me exactly how this went down.</p>



<p>Had Twitter been hacked? Is there a way to circumvent 2FA? Were my local computer or phone compromised? No, no and no.</p>



<p>Apparently, an agent at Twitter who were going through the backlog of issues, where my previous hijack issue was still present, accidentally changed the email on my account by mistake, probably confusing it with another account in another browser tab.</p>



<p><strong>There was no outside intruder, it was just a user error.</strong></p>



<p>Okay, the cynics will say, this is what he <em>told</em> me and there is no evidence to back it up. That’s right, I’m taking his words as truth here but I also think the description matches my observations. There’s just no way for me or any outsider to verify or fact-check this.</p>



<h2>A brighter future</h2>



<p>They seem to already have identified things to improve to reduce the risk of this happening again and Michael also mentioned a few other items on their agenda that should make hijacks harder to do and help them detect suspicious behavior earlier and faster going forward. I was also happy to provide my feedback on how I think they could’ve made my lost-account experience a little better.</p>



<p>I’m relieved that the second time at least wasn’t my fault and neither of my systems are breached  or hacked (as far as I know).</p>



<p>I’ve also now properly and thoroughly gone over all my accounts on practically all online services I use and made really sure that I have 2fa enabled on them. On some of them I’ve also changed my registered email address to one with 30 random letters to make it truly impossible for any outsider to guess what I use.</p>



<p>(I’m also positively surprised by this extra level of customer care Twitter showed for me and my case.)</p>



<h2>Am I a target?</h2>



<p>I don’t think I am. I think maybe my Twitter account could be interesting to scammers since I have almost 25K followers and I have a verified account. Me personally, I work primarily with open source and most of my works is already made public. I don’t deal in business secrets. I don’t think my personal stuff attracts attackers more than anyone else does.</p>

<p>What about the risk or the temptation for bad guys in trying to backdoor curl? It is after all installed in some 10 <em>billion</em> systems world-wide. I’ve <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/09/12/the-backdoor-threat/">elaborated on that before</a>. Summary: I think it is terribly hard for someone to actually manage to do it. Not because of the security of my personal systems perhaps, but because of the entire setup and all processes, signings, reviews, testing and scanning that are involved.</p>



<p>So no. I don’t think my personal systems are a valued singled out target to attackers.</p>



<p>Now, back to work!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>The ACCC has instituted proceedings in the Federal Court against Facebook, Inc. and two of its subsidiaries for false, misleading or deceptive conduct when promoting Facebook’s Onavo Protect mobile app to Australian consumers.</p>

<p>Onavo Protect was a free downloadable software application providing a virtual private network (VPN) service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that, between 1 February 2016 to October 2017, Facebook and its subsidiaries Facebook Israel Ltd and Onavo, Inc. misled Australian consumers by representing that the Onavo Protect app would keep users’ personal activity data private, protected and secret, and that the data would not be used for any purpose other than providing Onavo Protect’s products.</p>

<p>In fact, the ACCC alleges, Onavo Protect collected, aggregated and used significant amounts of users’ personal activity data for Facebook’s commercial benefit. This included details about Onavo Protect users’ internet and app activity, such as records of every app they accessed and the number of seconds each day they spent using those apps.</p>

<p>This data was used to support Facebook’s market research activities, including identifying potential future acquisition targets.</p>

<p>“Through Onavo Protect, Facebook was collecting and using the very detailed and valuable personal activity data of thousands of Australian consumers for its own commercial purposes, which we believe is completely contrary to the promise of protection, secrecy and privacy that was central to Facebook’s promotion of this app,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“Consumers often use VPN services because they care about their online privacy, and that is what this Facebook product claimed to offer. In fact, Onavo Protect channelled significant volumes of their personal activity data straight back to Facebook.”</p>

<p>“We believe that the conduct deprived Australian consumers of the opportunity to make an informed choice about the collection and use of their personal activity data by Facebook and Onavo,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>The Onavo Protect website stated that the app would “save, measure and protect” users’ mobile data, while advertisements on Facebook’s website and app included statements such as “Keep it secret. Keep it safe… Onavo Protect, from Facebook”.</p>

<p>The ACCC is seeking declarations and pecuniary penalties.</p>





<p><em>The attached document below contains the ACCC’s initiating court document in relation to this matter. We will not be uploading further documents in the event this initial document is subsequently amended.</em></p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>US-based Facebook, Inc. owns global social media and private messaging platforms including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>

<p>US-based Onavo, Inc. and Onavo Mobile Ltd, based in Israel, were mobile analytics companies that were acquired by Facebook in October 2013. After the acquisition Onavo Mobile became Facebook Israel Ltd.</p>

<p>Apple removed Onavo Protect from its App store in 2018 for non-compliance with its developer terms such as, among other things, collecting information about other apps installed on a user’s device for the purposes of analytics. It was later also removed from the Google Play store and was discontinued in 2019.</p>

<p>The ACCC’s <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/digital-platforms-inquiry-final-report">Digital platforms inquiry final report</a> examined a range of issues involving digital platforms and consumers, including concerns about Onavo Protect and how its users’ data was being collected and used.</p>

<p>In December 2020, in an unrelated action, the US Federal Trade Commission (US FTC) brought proceedings against Facebook, alleging that the company is illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct. The US FTC alleges that Facebook engaged in a systematic strategy including its 2012 acquisition of Instagram and 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp, and the imposition of anticompetitive conditions on software developers to eliminate threats to its monopoly. The court documents filed by the US FTC refer to Facebook’s use of Onavo Protect data to identify future acquisitions as part of the allegation that Facebook is illegally maintaining a monopoly.</p>

<![CDATA[Empirical Estimates of Golden Handcuffs]]>

December 15, 2020 | https://applieddivinitystudies.com/handcuffs-empirical/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://applieddivinitystudies.com/handcuffs-empirical/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p><a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/handcuffs/">Last post</a>, I argued against common explanations for Golden Handcuffs.</p>
<p>Before we dive deeper, it’s worth asking, are they even real? Are employees of elite companies actually pathologically unable to leave? Is it just a stereotype with no grounding in reality?</p>
<p>Here are a variety of attempts to estimate the Golden Handcuffs effect empirically.</p>
<h3 id="YC-Founders-Join-Elite-Universities-but-Not-Elite-Companies"><a href="#YC-Founders-Join-Elite-Universities-but-Not-Elite-Companies" title="YC Founders Join Elite Universities, but Not Elite Companies"></a>YC Founders Join Elite Universities, but Not Elite Companies</h3><p>Rather than examining the psychology of employees, let’s just work backwards and count how many founders have big company experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/wilbin-rationalists/">A while back</a>, I published a dataset of the top Y Combinator founders and noticed something odd.</p>
<p>Of the 26 founders, only 1 had held a full-time role at a FAANG company. [2] Two others had worked at Facebook, but only as interns. Outside of FAANG, only 3 founders had worked at companies I recognized at all. [3]</p>
<p>One explanation is the founder-as-monomaniacal-hero. Founders are totally single minded in their devotion, and would never do something as stupid as get sidetracked by prestige or status.</p>
<p>Except that they absolutely do. Of the 26 founders, 21 attended elite universities, mostly MIT and Stanford [1]. So maybe those universities are just incredibly good at fostering entrepreneurs, but more likely, they’re just good at attracting and selecting them. I take this as evidence that founders are not allergic to jumping through conventional hoops, pursuing instrumental goods, sitting down to take the SAT and so on.</p>
<p>It gets weirder when you consider population sizes. Google has around 100,000 employees, whereas MIT and Stanford undergrad programs are just 11,500 combined! And since average tenure at Google is under 4 years, each unit of headcount produces more alumni than a full degree program. [4]</p>
<p>All else equal, we should expect to sample many more founders from Google than from elite universities, but this doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>What’s going on?</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Selection-Effects"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Selection-Effects" title="Golden Handcuffs as Selection Effects"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Selection Effects</h3><p>One explanation is that there are no golden handcuffs and it’s all selection effects. The kinds of people who work for Google are the ones who never intended to leave in the first place. The kinds of people who want to start great companies don’t have any interest in working for somebody else.</p>
<p>This is a reasonable explanation, but applies to less than half of the founders I looked at.</p>
<p>Only 11 of the 26 founders started a company right out of school. 14 have confirmed work experience, and another 2 have scrubbed the employment history, but have long gaps between graduating from school and founding their company.</p>
<p>Maybe working for a small startup shows that you’re less risk averse than a Google employee, but I don’t totally buy this. Brandon Leonardo (Instacart) worked at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/webs/">Webs</a>, a company I’ve never heard of that claims to make “small business marketing simple”. Dan Kan (Cruise) worked at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/uservoice/">UserVoice</a>, “the leading product feedback management software”. What exactly do these experiences select for?</p>
<p>In contrast, if you do want to start a company, working at Google seems like a great first step! You can meet co-founders and potential early employees, save money to fund yourself, gain legitimacy for investors and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible the kinds of people who think about “gaining legitimacy for investors” are not going to start great companies. Maybe “real founders” don’t pursue instrumental goods.</p>
<h3 id="A-Third-Perspective-Ex-Google-Founded-Companies"><a href="#A-Third-Perspective-Ex-Google-Founded-Companies" title="A Third Perspective: Ex-Google Founded Companies"></a>A Third Perspective: Ex-Google Founded Companies</h3><p>We’ve been dancing around the issue, but why not just go straight to the source and look at outcomes for the population we care about?</p>
<p>Are Google employees actually bad at starting companies?</p>
<p>Looking directly at startups founded by ex-Google employees valued over a billion dollars, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutanix $5.8B</li>
<li>Cohesity $2.5B</li>
<li>Asana $4.3B</li>
<li>Lucidchart $1B+</li>
<li>Rubrik $3.3B</li>
<li>Instagram (sold for $1B, valued at $100B in 2018)</li>
<li>Pinterest $43B</li>
<li>Flatiron Health $1.9B</li>
<li>Xiaomi $46B</li>
<li>Affirm $2.9B</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a super impressive list! It doesn’t seem like ex-Google employees are bad at starting companies and pathologically incapable of quitting their jobs. Instead, the oddity is merely that they don’t attend Y Combinator.</p>
<p>That’s a different skew, and much easier to explain. Unlike regular YC founders, ex-Google employees may just be:</p>
<ul>
<li>So wealthy that they self-fund until they can raise a Series A and aren’t willing to sell 7% of their company for $125k.</li>
<li>So tired of bureaucracy that they refuse to join an accelerator.</li>
<li>So credentialed that they don’t feel a need to go through Y Combinator to gain further credibility.</li>
<li>So well connected that they raise a Series A without going through Y Combinator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the explanation, the fact remains that ex-Google employees do in fact leave to start companies.</p>
<h3 id="Adjustments-and-Proportionality"><a href="#Adjustments-and-Proportionality" title="Adjustments and Proportionality"></a>Adjustments and Proportionality</h3><p>Of course, we now have to ask if they do so proportionally. Even if Google has produced the founders of nearly a dozen billion dollar companies, we shouldn’t be impressed until we’re confident that they’re actually hitting above their weight.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorn_startup_companies">Wikipedia lists</a> 495 startups worth over a billion dollars, putting Google at 2%. But if you only include US based startups, Google is at 9 out of 122, or 7%.</p>
<p>To figure out the appropriate reference class, we’ll start with the number of software engineers in the US (4 million), then identify how many ex-Google employees there were 10 years ago when most of these founders started their companies.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/gabor/timeline-employee-count-growth-for-microsoft-yahoo-google-and-facebook-9ede22a37824">A partner at google</a> has compiled and released <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0M0u0-C_LoFrGLw0H-9nkgN9wqUhl4bUTcVI0fDZuU/edit#gid=793191479">historical headcount data</a>. This is a good starting point, but remember that we’re actually interested in the total alumni population rathern than point-in-time headcount.</p>
<p>To make this estimate, I assume 3 year average tenure and run a simplified simulation where 33% of the workforce quits at the end of each year, then Google rehires up to next year’s headcount. </p>
<p>Running this simulation from 2000 to 2010, we get that there were 50,000 ex-Google employees in 2010. They’ve <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-software-engineers-does-Google-have">previously said the workforce is 40% technical</a>, so that’s equivalent to 20,000 engineers. [5]</p>
<p>Pitting that against the 4 million software engineers in the US [6], we get that ex-Google engineers were around 0.5% of the relevant population, but started 7% of the US based billion dollar startups. That’s a mulitple of 14x, and fairly good evidence that Google employees are not particularly bad at starting companies. [7]</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Taking a step back, recall that what we’re actually curious about is not whether Google engineers are disproportionately successful at starting companies, but whether they even try in the first place. In other words, do they appear irrationally bound by Golden Handcuffs?</p>
<p>Compared to a randomly selected US based engineer, Google engineers have all sorts of benefits. They’re well credentialed, well connected, largely based in Silicon Valley, and supposedly smarter than average.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible that their success rate is 140x that of a typical engineer, but they only try one tenth as often. The fact that Google engineers start successful companies doesn’t preclude the possibility that Golden Handcuffs are holding them back.</p>
<p>Further, consider that “rationality” in this case is really a function of both odds of success and opportunity cost. Even if Google engineers are less likely to start companies, it could be a perfectly reasonable choice given their relatively high opportunity cost.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, the empirical data tells us a few interesting things, but can’t present a decisive conclusion.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] The other universities I count as “elite” are:</p>
<ul>
<li>RISD</li>
<li>Joint RISD/MIT</li>
<li>2 x Harvard</li>
<li>University of Waterloo</li>
<li>Berkeley, Columbia MBA</li>
</ul>
<p>The ones I don’t include are:</p>
<ul>
<li>USD</li>
<li>San Jose State University</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Duke</li>
<li>Claremont McKenna College</li>
</ul>
<p>I do include 4 founders who attended Stanford for grad school, but did not attend an elite undergraduate institution.</p>
<p>[2] Apoorva Mehta of Instacart spent 2 years at Amazon.</p>
<p>[3] Tony Xu of DoorDash was an intern at Square, and worked full time at McKinsey for 2 years, and eBay for another 2. Fred Ehrsam of Coinbase had spent 2 years at Goldman Sachs. Brian Armstrong of same had interned at IBM and Deloitte, then spent a year at Airbnb. Though notably, this was in May 2011, back when Airbnb was a small Series A startup with under $10 million in total funding.</p>
<p>[4] This ends up being a bit complicated. Reportedly, Google has an average tenure of 3.2 years with a median of 1.1. This is possible, but odd, and I’m not sure how they got these numbers. It’s tricky because at any given time, some population of employees has not left and you don’t know how long they’ll stay. If you count their tenure as their tenure-to-date, you’re undercounting how long they’ll actually end up staying. If you only count employees who have left, you’re skewed toward employees with short tenure. Also, Google has grown over the years, and we’re looking at founders who are successful now but started out 10 years ago when Google was around 25,000 employees.</p>
<p>[5] Data <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FeDDGo_SWeDMMZlTrJ_P2TifyJoOqAuOD8klBKQpUdA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. And yes, it’s possible the proportion of engineers has changed over time and this analysis is off.</p>
<p>This also helps explain why there are relatively so many founders from top universities. In the same 10 year time span, Stanford and MIT undergrad graduated around 115,000 alumni.</p>
<p>[6] Maybe we should be looking at the number of people who have been software engineers from 2000 to 2010 including retirements, and this number is actually higher. Assuming 40 year careers, and a constantly total number of engineers, it should be something like 25% higher, and Google is proportionately 25% better than it appears in the main text.</p>
<p>[7] There are lots of over corrections you could apply here, so don’t take this too literally. Maybe the relevant population is all people, not just engineers. In that case, Google ends up looking way better since the general population is much less than 40% engineers. </p>

<p>Alchemy gets a bad press. It has done for centuries. Changing base metal into gold is, at best, a delusional dream and at worst a con-trick, a shyster’s brag. In Ben Jonson’s play&nbsp;<em>The Alchemist,&nbsp;</em>Subtle is an unashamed charlatan who promises his clients limitless wealth through access to the Philosopher’s Stone. One of&nbsp;<em>The Canterbury Tales – The Canon’s Yeoman’s Tale</em>&nbsp;– revolves around the story of a canon selling a pot capable of producing silver at will. Recent scholarship has suggested that Chaucer was familiar with a real case where a chaplain claimed, through alchemical practice, to be able to conjure coins of silver and gold which he then sold to the Mint for a tidy profit.</p>



<p>Isaac Newton’s interest in alchemy is well-known. His work on physics was dwarfed by the vast corpus of unpublishable material on alchemy and the occult. In 1936, John Maynard Keynes bought a sheaf of his manuscripts and spent years trying to unravel their arcane weavings. His conclusion challenged Newton’s pre-eminent position in the scientific pantheon: ‘Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago.’&nbsp;Newton’s early biographers suppressed this less empirical side of his work, lest it undermine his authority. Newton himself kept it quiet – as well he might. Many alchemical practices were banned at the time and punishment for conviction reputedly included hanging from a gallows wrapped with silvery tinsel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Russia, Peter the Great’s favourite scientist was Count Iakov Brius – son of a Scottish immigrant. They travelled together to London on Peter’s notorious Grand Embassy, and Brius stayed on for six months to study science and collect scientific instruments. Back in Moscow, he set up an observatory in the Sukharev Tower, ran a School of Navigation, built Russia’s first Newtonian telescope, promoted Copernican astronomy, and commissioned and wrote a good deal of science and mathematics. Yet he is remembered in Russia as&nbsp;<em>Koldun na Sukharevoi bashne&nbsp;</em>‘the wizard in the Sukharev Tower’ (the title of a nineteenth-century novel about him by Ivan Lazhechnikov) – the man who turned silver into gold and owned a book written by the devil himself. In 1934, Stalin demanded the tower be destroyed, and everything in it brought to him. As the demolition took place, so the story goes, a tall man in a powdered wig was spotted in the crowd, jabbing an accusing finger at the work.</p>



<p>The popular image of alchemy, of the transmutation of metals, is a misunderstanding, a corrupt simplification. Alchemy embraces a hugely sophisticated set of beliefs and practices, and a high-minded cosmology. The universe is not static but a dynamic system on a very slow trajectory towards ultimate perfection. At the heart of all matter lies the&nbsp;<em>prima materia.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;The natural world is struggling to restore it, to shake off all the impurities and return Creation to its harmonious state. What alchemy offers is a participation in this process, an acceleration of it, requiring only the discovery of&nbsp;<em>lapis philosophorum</em>&nbsp;as agent to convert substances into the&nbsp;<em>prima materia.</em>&nbsp;The quest for the Philosopher’s Stone was not so different from the cathartic promises of most religions<em>&nbsp;–</em>&nbsp;but rather than temple and priest, it involved furnaces and alembics and distillation vessels, all the paraphernalia of a laboratory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, the study of alchemy has enjoyed something of a revival. Its importance in the history of science is becoming much more widely understood. Serious scholarship and international symposia are conducted in its name. Newton’s esoterica are now on-line, through the Cambridge Digital Library. Yet overturning centuries of prejudice does not come easily. One of the principal revisionists, Lawrence Principe of John Hopkins University, was recently ‘yelled at’ in a conference for discussing alchemy and accused of taking ‘hallucinatory drugs’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alchemy has its origins in the great ferment of Alexandria in the early Christian centuries. The ideas of Gnostics and Neoplatonists were combined with those of Babylon and ancient Egypt. One of the earliest texts, written by a pupil of Democritus, is the&nbsp;<em>Physika kai Mystika – ‘Of Natural and Hidden Questions’.&nbsp;</em>It is the adventure of hidden questions that really drove the alchemists, the Platonic idea that we live in a world that is only partially visible. To try and glean the veiled elements of our world was the&nbsp;<em>Opus Magnum&nbsp;</em>of alchemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The great fifteenth-century alchemist, Sir George Ripley, was not alone in recognizing the mysterious nature of his enthusiasm. The Philosopher’s Stone would enable the ultimate reduction of matter. It was substance, but spirit too. It was elusive, but ubiquitous: ‘The philosophers say that the birds and fishes bring the Stone to us, each man possesses it, it is everywhere, in you, in me, in all things’. Reach the heart of things and you find enigma, paradox, ambiguity. That is the legacy of the alchemists. It is also what Einstein discovered, and what the pioneers of particle physics and mathematics are discovering too. The zealots of the Enlightenment did their best to purge it from the new scientific tradition; now that tradition has matured, the role of alchemy can be properly examined.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>This article is the result of my latest obsession with software virtualization. After years of just skipping virtualized routines, I was finally inspired by <a href="https://blog.can.ac/" target="_blank">Can</a> and started work on this complex topic. What ensued was months of reverse engineering, functional programming, and a LOT of learning. Now that I finally feel comfortable publishing some information on the things I learned in the process, I present unto you the first installment in my devirtualization series, focusing on how virtualization works and the methodology of how we can lift a VM. The aim of this series is to tear down the curtains behind virtualization and hopefully inspire more reverse engineers to research this interesting topic!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Over the last 10 years or so, virtualization based obfuscation has become the de-facto standard in defensive and offensive software alike. As the complexity and power of disassembling tools has improved, software security solutions have kept up rather well. Packers and code mutation tools, being easily defeated by even newbie attackers, have been replaced by these virtual machine based protectors. Today, the two main ‘pioneers’ in this field, controlling the vast majority of the market are <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/" target="_blank">VMProtect</a> and <a href="https://www.oreans.com/" target="_blank">Themida</a>. While we will be looking into analyzing (and breaking) them specifically in some future articles, today we’ll just be looking into how we can lift <em>any</em> VM into <a href="https://blog.can.ac/" target="_blank">Can</a>’s promising <a href="https://vtil.io/" target="_blank">VTIL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-what-actually-is-virtualization">But first, what actually is virtualization?</h2>
<p>Virtualization is the <strong>recompilation</strong> of instructions to a <strong>custom proprietary architecture</strong>, and the generation of <strong>handler routines</strong> to emulate said architecture. Let’s look at an example of the life of just one simple instruction, <code>push rcx</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://0xnobody.github.io/assets/virtualization-1/vm-flowchart.png" alt="alt text" title="Life of a push rcx instruction"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>The mystical adventure <code>push rcx</code> undertakes when you press ‘Protect’</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code>push rcx</code> instruction is decoded, and interpreted by the virtualizer. A handler is generated (or fetched, if it has already been generated and is being reused), which is responsible for executing this instruction in a way that the CPU understands. In our example, I called this handler <code>VPUSH</code> just for explanation’s sake, but obviously they don’t come with names attached to them.</p>

<p>Following this, a ‘virtual instruction’ is then assembled, which contains bytes to identify its handler (in this case, just a table offset) and any operands that are needed for execution. You can see in the diagram above, that the bytes corresponding to the instruction’s <strong>handler offset</strong> are in <strong>green</strong>, whereas the ones corresponding to the <strong>operand</strong> (ie. the <strong>target register</strong>) are in <strong>blue</strong>. This is also reflected in the handler with the corresponding colours.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting, that on handler execution, the virtual instruction pointer (VIP) actually points to the beginning of the <strong>blue</strong> operand bytes. This is because the previous handler has to read (and consume) the next handler’s offset in order to pass control over to it.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s take a closer look at this <code>VPUSH</code> handler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>movzx</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[rbp]</span> 
<span>; - rbp is the virtual instruction pointer (VIP) in this case, which contains the pushed register (blue)</span>
<span>; - the pushed register is fetched and stored in ax. In our case this is 0x30</span>

<span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rsi</span> <span>+</span> <span>rax</span><span>]</span> 
<span>; - rsi is the virtual context; it holds each of the virtual registers. Think of a CONTEXT structure on </span>
<span>; windows.</span>
<span>; - the lower word in rax holds the register offset in the context. The register is fetched from the</span>
<span>; context and stored in rax.</span>

<span>push</span> <span>rax</span>
<span>; - the stored register is pushed to the stack.</span>

<span>movzx</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>+</span><span>0x2</span><span>]</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>+</span><span>rdx</span><span>]</span>
<span>; - VIP + 0x2 contains the next handler's offset (green). It is fetched and stored in rdx</span>
<span>; - rdi is the handler table base. The next handler is fetched by offseting it by rdx and storing the</span>
<span>; handler address</span>

<span>add</span> <span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>0x4</span>
<span>; - the instruction pointer is incremented by the size of bytes consumed</span>

<span>jmp</span> <span>rdx</span>
<span>; - jump to the next handler, held by rdx, to execute the next instruction's handler</span>
<span>; - the execution loop continues...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Virtual machines are basically just very <strong>very</strong> long chains of these handlers, each doing quite rudimentary operations.
It must be said, however, that the example I gave above is an extremely simple one. Modern virtualizers have integrated encryption and obfuscation techniques, and some feature quite advanced custom architectures. Many stray far away from the x86 instruction set to make the analyst’s life harder.</p>

<p>Well, how does this impact analysis, you ask? Well, since you’re reading this article, you must already know ;)
But to name a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The original instructions are lost, forever. Only the behaviour is retained, in a proprietary, usually randomized architecture. For example, even after full devirtualization, we can’t for 100% say that the original register used for the push is <code>rcx</code>.</li>
  <li>The VM’s architecture can differ significantly from the original. For example, a single VM instruction could push 3 registers, exchange 2 registers, and write to one register. All in a <em>single</em> virtual instruction!</li>
  <li>Other obfuscation techniques (such as mutation) can now be applied on both the host level (real x86 instructions executing on the PC) and on the guest level (the virtual instructions represented by the handlers).</li>
  <li>Control flow is in most cases highly obscured. Often conditional jumps are manually emulated. This makes tracking basic blocks difficult.</li>
  <li>The VM cannot be statically analyzed in tools like IDA, as it does not function like a conventional program.</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, virtualization is an extremely powerful and effective software protection method.</p>

<h2 id="lets-break-it">Let’s break it!</h2>
<p>In order to break and reverse this protection, we really just need to do three things: gather information in order to determine exactly what each handler does in which order, somehow convert this information into a language that the CPU and disassemblers understand (in our case, x86), and then finally repackage the binary.
This is called <em>lifting</em>, <em>translation</em>, and <em>repackaging</em> respectively, and it is what needs to be done to devirtualize any VM.
Today, we’re just gonna be looking at <em>lifting</em> in particular.</p>

<h2 id="lifting">Lifting</h2>
<p>The dictionary definition for lifting is “raise to a higher position or level”. This is entirely true. We are performing analyis on the virtual routines, in order to determine what each handler does on the instruction level, and then converting this information into a higher level, easy-to-understand representation. This is done in a few steps.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://0xnobody.github.io/assets/virtualization-1/virt-starter-pack.png" alt="alt text" title="Ha ha xd"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>After analyzing VMs for a few hours (or days), you do begin to notice certain things.</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Before we can perform any handler analysis, we must first be able to navigate our way around the VM. Although this step varies greatly for each VM, certain parts always remain the same.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every VM routine must begin by saving the value of each register, usually by pushing them to the stack. This is done because the VM needs to use the registers to run its handlers, and it must restore the registers after exiting the VM.</li>
  <li>Each VM must also have some sort of context structure. This is where current executing information about the VM is held, such as register values. It can easily be identified as it is accessed very often in every handler.</li>
  <li>Each VM must have an instruction pointer (VIP) used to determine which handler to execute next and to provide that handler with operands. It is also easy to identify, as it much be adjusted after each handler.</li>
  <li>Many VMs have some sort of stack representation. For example, VMProtect uses a nominated register to access the stack, whereas Themida just uses RSP.</li>
  <li>Code flow must somehow be passed from one handler to the next. This can just be an index in a handler table, an offset to some point in the code, or something entirely different. It is worth noting that the next handler <em>must</em> be computed from the VIP.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to properly analyze and decode each handler, we must be able to follow the VM’s execution. We must follow the VM’s <em>fetch-&gt;decode-&gt;execute</em> loop, so we are able to determine which handler will be executed next. Once the basics of the VM are reversed and we can step through the handler instructions, the next step is to identify these handlers.</p>

<h3 id="identification">Identification</h3>
<p>Now we need to determine what each handler does. We can achieve this via <em>pattern matching</em> the instructions. Of course, we must remember to keep these patterns balanced, ensuring we match all the relevant instructions but make them generic enough so that we can match with all instances of the handler.</p>

<p><em>Pattern matching</em> is quite a generic method, and can be used in various different flavours alongside many other algorithms depending on the complexity of the VM. But in this example we’re gonna take it easy, and just look at a simple forward matching algorithm. This allows us to specify the patterns we want to match, and the order we want to match them in.</p>

<p>Let’s use the above <code>push</code> handler as an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// this class contains templates to pattern match against</span>
<span>//</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>matcher</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>pattern_matcher</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span><span>);</span>

<span>// these are the constant registers</span>
<span>// they are hardcoded here for simplicity's sake</span>
<span>//</span>
<span>x86_reg</span> <span>vip_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>X86_REG_RBP</span><span>;</span>
<span>x86_reg</span> <span>vcontext_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>X86_REG_RSI</span><span>;</span>

<span>// these values will be set as the patterns are found</span>
<span>// they allow us to ensure that the same register is used for more than one pattern</span>
<span>// they also allow us to retrieve specific information about the handler eg. operand sizes</span>
<span>//</span>
<span>x86_reg</span> <span>pushed_reg_idx_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>X86_REG_INVALID</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>pushed_reg_idx_offs</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span>x86_reg</span> <span>pushed_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>X86_REG_INVALID</span><span>;</span>
 
<span>auto</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>matcher</span>
    <span>// match for `mov %0, [%vip + %1]`</span>
    <span>// %0 is written to pushed_reg_idx_reg, %1 is written to pushed_reg_idx_offs</span>
    <span>//</span>
    <span>-&gt;</span><span>mov_reg_mem</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>pushed_reg_idx_reg</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>vip_reg</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>pushed_reg_idx_offs</span><span>)</span>

    <span>// match for `mov %2, [%ctx + %0]`</span>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Static quantization allows the user to generate quantized integer model that is highly efficient during inference. However, sometimes, even with careful post-training calibration, the model accuracies might be sacrificed to some extent that is not acceptable. If this is the case, post-training calibration is not sufficient to generate a quantized integer model. We would have train the model in a way so that the quantization effect has been taken into account. Quantization aware training is capable of modeling the quantization effect during training.</p>



<p>The mechanism of quantization aware training is simple, it places fake quantization modules, i.e., quantization and dequantization modules, at the places where quantization happens during floating-point model to quantized integer model conversion, to simulate the effects of clamping and rounding brought by integer quantization. The fake quantization modules will also monitor scales and zero points of the weights and activations. Once the quantization aware training is finished, the floating point model could be converted to quantized integer model immediately using the information stored in the fake quantization modules.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do quantization aware training. More details about the mathematical foundations of quantization for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/">â€œQuantization for Neural Networksâ€�</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-quantization-aware-training">PyTorch Quantization Aware Training</h3>

<p>Unlike TensorFlow 2.3.0 which supports integer quantization using arbitrary bitwidth from 2 to 16, PyTorch 1.7.0 only supports 8-bit integer quantization. The workflow could be as easy as loading a pre-trained floating point model and apply a quantization aware training wrapper. However, without doing layer fusion, sometimes such kind of easy manipulation would not result in good model performances.</p>



<p>In this case, I will also use the ResNet18 from <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html">TorchVision models</a> as an example. All the steps prior, to the quantization aware training steps, including layer fusion and skip connections replacement, are exactly the same as to the ones used in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Static-Quantization/">â€œPyTorch Static Quantizationâ€�</a>. The source code could also be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/leimao/PyTorch-Quantization-Aware-Training">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The quantization aware training steps are also very similar to post-training calibration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Train a floating point model or load a pre-trained floating point model.</li>
  <li>Move the model to CPU and switch model to training mode.</li>
  <li>Apply layer fusion.</li>
  <li>Switch model to evaluation mode, check if the layer fusion results in correct model, and switch back to training mode.</li>
  <li>Apply <code>torch.quantization.QuantStub()</code> and <code>torch.quantization.QuantStub()</code> to the inputs and outputs, respectively.</li>
  <li>Specify quantization configurations, such as symmetric quantization or asymmetric quantization, etc.</li>
  <li>Prepare quantization model for quantization aware training.</li>
  <li>Move the model to CUDA and run quantization aware training using CUDA.</li>
  <li>Move the model to CPU and convert the quantization aware trained floating point model to quantized integer model.</li>
  <li>[Optional] Verify accuracies and inference performance gain.</li>
  <li>Save the quantized integer model.</li>
</ol>

<p>The quantization aware training script is very similar to the one used in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Static-Quantization/">â€œPyTorch Static Quantizationâ€�</a>:</p>

<h2>INTRO</h2>



<p>A few years ago, I got the opportunity to architect and code the fire propagation system in Far Cry 2. &nbsp;At that time, &nbsp;it was a gigantic task and it scared the hell out of me. Luckily, it turned out well enough.</p>



<p>With the upcoming Far Cry 3, several people recently asked me how the system worked. I realized that I never took the time to write it down. So, before I forget and also because it might be useful to somebody out there, here’s a high level overview of its inner workings. &nbsp;Pretty programmer art included as a bonus.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: Although Far Cry 3 uses the same system I wrote, I was not involved in the project. They may or may not have changed / adapted or modified the algorithms. What I describe below is accurate for Far Cry 2.</em></p>

<h2>BASE STRUCTURE</h2>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>A 2D Grid good for grass fire. &nbsp;Here, a fire cell has 50 hitpoints</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the core, the fire propagation system is quite simple. Since gameplay is what’s important, we&nbsp;sacrifice some of the realism for fun. The fire propagation in&nbsp;Far Cry 2 &nbsp;(and Far Cry 3) has just enough realism to maintain the player’s&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a>,&nbsp;but certainly not enough to get published anytime soon. Because I like to&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep things simple</a>, it doesn’t involve any complicated mathematics, physics or fluid dynamics. That has the additional advantage to be fast to simulate and easy to understand.</p>



<p>The secret sauce is an&nbsp;equally spaced grid. It is true for grass, for objects as well as for trees. The only difference is that we use a 2D grid for grass and a 3D grid for objects and trees.</p>



<p>Each cell of the grid has a position in the world, a radius and&nbsp;<strong>hitpoints</strong>. The cells have a plethora of&nbsp;properties, but these three are the bare minimum to propagate fire.</p>



<h2>LIGHT MY FIRE! HOW TO START ONE?</h2>



<p>The game engine tracks all damage done in the game, might it be bullet shots, impacts or fire damage. When a game entity is damaged, it is notified by an event. The damage event includes how much damage was done, what kind it was and what caused it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the kind of damage was fire based and the entity is flammable, then at least two things happen:</p>



<ul><li>Firstly, the fire grid is dynamically created for the damaged entity. We create them dynamically because we don’t want those grids&nbsp;to exist in the wild for no reasons. That would take memory, disk space, etc, so we create them as we go. But, once created, it remains as long as the game entity exists.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Secondly, we figure out which cell in the grid is closest to the damage source. That cell then takes the damage and its hitpoints are reduced accordingly.</li></ul>



<p>That’s where things get interesting – When a cell has been damaged by fire and has lost all its hitpoints;&nbsp;<strong>it catches fire</strong>.</p>



<p>While burning, the cell becomes a damager itself. It deals damage to its neighbour cells on the grid; cells that share an edge with it. By doing so, it reduces their hitpoints and when in turns these cells have lost all their hitpoints, they catch fire. That’s how the propagation is created.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridBiggerFire1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridBiggerFire1.jpg 700w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridBiggerFire1-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><figcaption>Fire propagating from left to right. The cells on the fire front are being damaged.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Lastly, a cell from the grid as a finite lifetime. Otherwise, it would burn forever. It can be seen as the amount of energy given by the material that is burning. &nbsp;For instance,&nbsp;a piece of paper would most likely burn faster than a wood log, so it would be given a shorter lifetime value.</p>



<p>That’s it. A fully functional fire propagation system good enough for a AAA game!</p>



<h2>TECHNICALITIES</h2>



<p><strong>Simulate wet jungle VS dry patch of grass</strong><br>How to simulate a wet jungle versus a dry patch of grass? They behave differently. Quite easily!<br>Increase the fire cell’s hitpoints and it’s difficult to set it on fire and it’s slow to propagate.&nbsp;Decrease its burning lifetime and the fire dies out quickly. There, you just simulated a wet jungle environment.</p>



<p><strong>How to create the propagation grids</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Grass / Land</em></strong><br>For grass wildfire, &nbsp;an axis-aligned 2D grid is built in realtime and projected on a 3D terrain. For each of the cell, we take care to determine if the cell position is underwater, or under an object such as a rock or a building. In which case, we disable that cell and it can no longer catch fire. We wouldn’t want to have fire propagating under rock, would we?<br></p>

The cells under the rock are disabled.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Objects</em></strong><br>For objects, it’s a little bit more complicated. First, we create an&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume">AABB</a>&nbsp;that entirely surrounds the object. &nbsp;Second, we somehow&nbsp;need to detect the shape of that object. After all, it could be a chair, an oil barrel or a whole house for all we know. To accomplish that, the &nbsp;bounding box is divided in equally spaced cubes.&nbsp;The size of each cube depends of the object size, the number of fire emitter we want to have, performance, memory, etc.</p>



<p>An iterative algorithm then go through all those cubes and test their location against the collision shape of the object.&nbsp;If the test return a positive result, this cube is kept, otherwise it is discarded. At the end, we have a collection of cubes that approximately&nbsp;represent the shape of the object to be burned. That’s our propagation grid.<br></p>

<h2><strong>WIND EFFECT</strong></h2>



<p>The wind is an important disruptive factor for a wildfire and it adds a great layer of realism for the player. &nbsp;Here it could be tempting to&nbsp;over-think&nbsp;the design and go with a very complicated system. After all, it’s an active area of research and&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748912001988">several</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475407002030">papers</a>&nbsp;on the subject are available online.</p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-s2.0-S0378475407002030-gr3-300x235-1.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-s2.0-S1540748912001988-gr3.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Luckily, with what have been explained thus far, it’s quite easy to simulate if we accept to cut corners a bit.</p>



<p>In our system, the fire propagates by damaging the&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cells on a grid. And it is generally accepted that a fire should spread faster in the direction of the wind than against&nbsp;the wind? Then, with that in mind, we can create a rule where a burning cell deals more damage to its&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cells if that neighbor is in the direction of the wind.</p>



<p>We do that by getting the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot product</a>&nbsp;between the wind direction&nbsp;vector and the direction of the&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cell to damage.&nbsp;If the result is greater than zero, then that node is dealt greater damage. &nbsp;Likewise, if the result is negative, &nbsp;the node is against the wind and should be dealt less damage. To be fancy, the amount of damage is interpolated with the dot product result as shown in the picture below.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>The cell on fire causes more damage to its neighbor cells if they are in the direction of the wind.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With that rule alone, you will get a nice bell shaped fire front that propagates in the direction of the wind. Simple, yet believable&nbsp;enough to get the player’s stamp of approval.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that we simulate gravity the exact same way.</p>



<h2>PROPAGATING TO THINGS AROUND AND CHAIN REACTIONS</h2>



<p>When a cell burns, it sends a “I’m on fire and I burn this much in this radius” message down&nbsp;the game event pipeline. This event is caught by objects, AI and other game systems that are in that area. They react&nbsp;to this message their own specific ways. The AI freaks out, the flammable objects get damaged and eventually catch fire. And, &nbsp;it is also true for dynamic objects. &nbsp;For example, if a burning oil barrel goes flying through the map, every step of the way, &nbsp;it will send that “i’m burning” message and a lot of things around might hear it.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone.jpg 719w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone-300x284.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px"><figcaption>In the absence of wind, a cell on fire damages equally all its neighbors.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>This causes a chain reaction effect where trees, explosive items, &nbsp;objects and patches of grass set each others on fire. &nbsp;It’s completely&nbsp;systemic and it makes it much more believable. It &nbsp;also scores pretty high on the&nbsp;player’s&nbsp;fun meter because it behaves as one would expect, yet as real fire, it sometimes gets totally out of control.</p>



<h2>OPTIMISATION</h2>



<p><strong>The Hair Transplant Strategy</strong></p>



<p>In an ideal world, we would have access to enough memory to hold&nbsp;an infinite number of particle emitters and we could display an infinite number of particles on screen.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the reality is that those numbers are actually pretty low.</p>



<p>To do more with less, we have to put our emitters where it really counts. Enters the hair transplant strategy! &nbsp;In Far Cry 2, the fire emitters are constantly being teleported around, most importantly, from the back of the camera to the front. The player’s point of view is monitored at all time and emitters that are burning out of sight are moved to a better location where they are also needed.</p>



<p>In addition, the emitters’s density is higher in close proximity of the player and lower as the distance increases. A kind of fire&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail">LOD&nbsp;</a>if you will.&nbsp;If things are getting bad and we still need more emitters but none are available, we increase the particle sizes to give them more volume and fill more space on screen.</p>



<p>With this strategy, and some others, we can simulate a wildfire that is several meters wide with a relatively low number of particle emitters.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>Credits: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Event Pipeline</strong><br>Since the described system tried to avoid all complicated maths, generally speaking we will be GPU bound before being&nbsp;CPU bound.</p>



<p>That being said, the event pipeline could be a bottleneck. It works well when you have just a few cells on fire. But, it’s another story when you have thousands of them burning and&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;their state to the world. That will likely clog your CPU’s arteries.</p>



<p>The trick for me was to regroup the cells that were burning into&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis-aligned_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AABB</a>&nbsp;groups. These groups would constantly merge, split and&nbsp;change shape to follow the evolution of the fire. The events would then be sent per AABB instead of per cell, which saves&nbsp;a significant amount of processing power. Additionally, the events would be spread out across several frames in order to distribute the load and avoid framerate spikes.</p>



<p><strong>Keeping things under control.</strong><br>In your game, if you don’t constrain the propagation somehow, it will either</p>

      <p>There's a well-known quote by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>:
        "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I like it because it doesn't
        attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get
        you 90% of the way there 90% of the time. Wikipedia describes the book the quote
        is from (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He explains...the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western
          framework through which we intellectualize the value of food <strong>is more a religious
and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and
reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That...sounds familiar.</p>
      <h2 id="write-code">Write code </h2>
      <p>Code, like food, has value. I think those of us who write it can (hopefully)
        agree on that. Some, though, are so afraid of writing/eating
        <em>too much</em> that they avoid writing/eating what they should.</p>
      <p>In the context of programming, I think this translates to an unhealthy fear
        (again, for some) of duplication. A little bit of duplication - writing
        something in a way that doesn't completely maximize conciseness - isn't the end
        of the world. Sometimes it's the best path forward. Sometimes it's okay to
        copy-and-modify here and there, especially when you're still figuring out what
        your application will end up being.</p>
      <h2 id="not-too-much">Not too much </h2>
      <p>Of course too much code, like too much food, can also be a bad thing. This is
        a well-trodden topic so I don't feel the need to go too far into it here.</p>
      <p>Just be aware of your project's "appetite": write what needs to be written,
        and then try not to over-indulge.</p>
      <h2 id="mostly-functions">Mostly functions </h2>
      <p>By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure
        functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel
        that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional
        subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly
        always a win for the long-term health of the project.</p>
      <p>Of course the qualifier is "mostly": this isn't a dogma. Writing a 100%
        functional system ("going vegan", if you will) often requires you to jump
        through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking
        at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not
        be worth it.</p>
      <p>And then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need
        a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient
        deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not
        be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or
        performance-sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
      <h2 id="%22real-code%22">"Real code" </h2>
      <p>Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food
          stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat
          only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have
          recognized as food.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is
        "code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what
        they do". Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don't get too clever,
        "manufacturing artificial ingredients". Use the primitives that are there, when
        possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.</p>
