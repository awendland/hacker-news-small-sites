      <h2 id="pre-introduction">Pre-introduction</h2>
<p>Recently I stumbled upon and then stumbled upon again on <a href="https://blog.dave.tf/post/new-kubernetes/">David Anderson</a>’s interesting post about “new Kubernetes”, based on a discussion he had with <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery Lancey</a> about what they would do differently if they were rewriting Kubernetes from scratch. Interestingly, a decent part of the proposals for a “new Kubernetes” are design choices made by Hashicorp for <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a>, which is a pretty underrated orchestrator, and drastically simpler ( one of the main goals of said “new Kubernetes”).</p>
<p>Some people are aware that Docker Swarm kinda exists but is abandonware/on life support, and isn’t really recommended anymore, but it still comes up in discussions due to how easy it is to use. For most, that leaves Kubernetes as the only “serious” option, but it is a <em>very</em> complex piece of software, with a lot of moving parts, which isn’t actually required or need in most cases.</p>

<p>This inspired me to write a series on Nomad, what it is, why it’s great, where it’s lacking and how to use it.</p>
<h2 id="introduction---what-is-nomad-and-why-its-great">Introduction - what is Nomad and why it’s great</h2>
<p>Hashicorp’s Nomad is a simple to run and maintain, yet very flexible task scheduler/orchestrator. It relies on plugins for execution, autoscaling and other features, and can run pretty much anything via its <code>task drivers</code> - Docker, contairnerd, LXC, rkt, podman, Java, fork/exec, QEMU, firecracker, FreeBSD jails.</p>
<p>It comes in the form of a single binary, run in two modes (<code>server</code>, in groups of 3 or 5, which make scheduling decisions and host the APIs and configuration, and an unlimited number of <code>worker</code>s which actually run whatever it is you want to run), and can be automatically clustered via <a href="https://consul.io/">Consul</a>. The configuration ( both for jobs and of Nomad itself) is in <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl">HCL</a> (I’ll get into more detail about how great that is a bit later) or JSON (mainly for when the jobs are submitted by machines/scripts/tooling and not humans). Multiple clusters can be connected via <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/federation?in=nomad/manage-clusters">multi-region federation</a> for sharing ACLs and for API forwarding ( you can submit a job or request logs to any server for any region and it will be forwarded to the appropriate server). Deployments can be complex out of the box ( rolling, canary, blue/green), and everything is version controlled and rollbackable.</p>
<p>Like most HashiCorp tools, it’s “open core”, meaning that the majority of features are available in an <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad">open source</a> version, and some more advanced/enterprise-y ones ( in Nomad’s case, <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-nomad-multi-cluster-deployment">multi-region/cluster deployments</a> - deploying something simultaneously to multiple separate clusters, policy as code with <a href="https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/nomad">Sentinel</a> and similar ) require upgrading to Nomad Enterprise.</p>
<h2 id="primitives">Primitives</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>job</code> is a declarative file which contains groups of tasks, each task being a container/binary/anything run by an exec driver</li>
<li><code>system</code> jobs (run on all client nodes, equivalent to Kubernetes DaemonSets, for monitoring/logging agents/load balancers)</li>
<li><code>periodic</code> jobs (equivalent to cronjobs)</li>
<li><code>service</code>, which registers as a Consul service and is thus discoverable ( via API or DNS)</li>
<li><code>deployment</code>, each version of a job, they’re tracked and can be rollbacked to</li>
<li><code>allocation</code>, each instance of a task ( group ) on a node</li>
<li><code>namespace</code>, a logical unit to organise jobs in and ACLs around</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jobs">Jobs</h3>
<p>Example of a very basic job that runs a Docker container (<code>jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.21</code>), with limits of 1000Mhz of CPU and 1024MB of RAM, and registers the service with Consul:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>job</span> <span>"jaeger"</span> {
        type <span>=</span> <span>"service"</span>
        <span>group</span> <span>"api"</span> {
            <span>task</span> <span>"jaeger"</span> {
                driver <span>=</span> <span>"docker"</span>
                <span>config</span> { 
                  image <span>=</span> <span>"jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.21"</span>
                }
                <span>resources</span> {
                  cpu <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>
                  memory <span>=</span> <span>1024</span>
                }
                <span>service</span> {
                  name <span>=</span> <span>"jaeger-query"</span>
                }
            }
        }            
}
</code></pre></div><p>Note that this is a <em>very</em> basic job, there are no healthchecks, no persistent storage, no extra configuration, no update strategy, no autoscaling, no exposed ports.</p>
<h4 id="deployment-history-and-rollback">Deployment history and rollback</h4>
<p>Nomad tracks each job’s full definitions and deployment history, and allows you to easily rollback and compare them, via the UI, CLI or API, e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># List the versions of the job named "opentelemetry-collector"</span>
$ nomad job history opentelemetry-collector
Version     <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
Stable      <span>=</span> false
Submit Date <span>=</span> 2021-01-08T21:30:30+01:00

Submit Date <span>=</span> 2021-01-08T21:29:48+01:00

<span># Check the difference between versions</span>
$ nomad job history -p opentelemetry-collector
Version     <span>=</span> <span>1</span>

Stable      <span>=</span> true
Submit Date <span>=</span> 2021-01-08T21:29:48+01:00

<span># Revert job "opentelemetry-collector" to version 0</span>
$ nomad job revert opentelemetry-collector <span>0</span>

</code></pre></div><h4 id="state-tracking-and-job-planning">State tracking and job planning</h4>
<p>Nomad keeps the desired state and its history, and with <code>nomad job plan</code>, similar to <code>terraform plan</code>, allows us to preview what will change upon applying a new job file. There’s also a feature to verify nothing has changed between the <code>plan</code> and <code>run</code> (equivalent to <code>terraform apply</code> with a plan file) with the <code>-check-index</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ nomad job plan otel.nomad
+/- Job: <span>"otel"</span>
+/- Task Group: <span>"opentelemetry"</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> create/destroy update<span>)</span>
  +/- Task: <span>"opentelemetry-collector"</span> <span>(</span>forces create/destroy update<span>)</span>
    +/- Config <span>{</span>
          args<span>[</span>0<span>]</span>:  <span>"--config=local/otel/config.yaml"</span>
      +/- image:    <span>"otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.15.0"</span> <span>=</span>&gt; <span>"otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.20.0"</span>
          ports<span>[</span>0<span>]</span>: <span>"health"</span>
          ports<span>[</span>1<span>]</span>: <span>"jaeger_thrift_compact"</span>
        <span>}</span>
Scheduler dry-run:
- All tasks successfully allocated.

Job Modify Index: <span>413</span>
To submit the job with version verification run:

nomad job run -check-index <span>413</span> otel.nomad

When running the job with the check-index flag, the job will only be run <span>if</span> the
job modify index given matches the server-side version. If the index has
changed, another user has modified the job and the plan<span>'</span>s results are
potentially invalid.
</code></pre></div><p>Overall, it’s a very useful feature, especially when collaborating, locally or via CI/CD.</p>
<h4 id="checking-the-status-and-logs">Checking the status and logs</h4>
<p>To check the status of a job, there are a few commands under <code>nomad job</code> and <code>nomad alloc</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ nomad job status otel
ID            <span>=</span> otel

<span># logs are at the allocation level ( similar to Kubernetes, where they're at the container level), so we get them with the alloc id</span>
$ nomad alloc logs 89031cfd
<span>[</span>...<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><h4 id="lifecycle-and-sidecars">lifecycle and sidecars</h4>
<p>Nomad allows defining the lifecycle of tasks in task groups, and their status, with the <code>lifecycle</code> stanza. We can have <code>prestart</code> ( for initialisation ), <code>poststart</code> ( companion, for proxying (aka ambassador and adapter pattern in Kubernetes )) or <code>poststop</code> for clean up, and via the <code>sidecar</code> bool we define whether or not it should run as long as the main task(s), e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">  <span>task</span> <span>"init"</span> {
    <span>lifecycle</span> {
      hook <span>=</span> <span>"prestart"</span>
      sidecar <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
    }
    driver <span>=</span> <span>"docker"</span>
    <span>config</span> {

        "job_id<span>=</span><span>'</span><span>${</span><span>NOMAD_JOB_ID</span><span>}</span><span>!'"</span>
      ]
    }
  }

  <span>task</span> <span>"fluentd"</span> {
    <span>lifecycle</span> {
      hook <span>=</span> <span>"poststart"</span><span> # should start after the main task
</span><span></span>      sidecar <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span> # should run as long as the main task does, and be restarted if it fails
</span><span></span>    }
    driver <span>=</span> <span>"docker"</span>
    <span>config</span> {
      image <span>=</span> <span>"fluentd/fluentd"</span>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="aclrbac">ACL/RBAC</h3>
<p>ACL ( access-control list ), or RBAC ( role-based access control ) as it’s known in Kubernetes, allow defining who can do what, so that not everyone with network access can have full administrator privileges and run/stop whatever. Nomad’s ACL system is pretty similar to Consul and Vault’s, and uses JSON ( mostly for non-humans ) or HCL to define <code>policies</code> with <code>rules</code>, which describe what action is allowed on what object.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span># a basic policy which allows the predefined read policy with read-only access to list and read:
</span><span># job, volume and scaling details, and extra capabilities for job creation and log access within the default namespace

  capabilities <span>=</span> [<span>"submit-job","dispatch-job","read-logs"</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>Assignment of policies is done only via the CLI, unlike Kubernetes where that happens in YAML, as does policy management:</p>

<![CDATA[How to offer better downloads: 4 sets of HTTP headers]]>

February 28, 2021 | https://charemza.name/blog/posts/http/downloads/how-to-offer-better-downloads/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://charemza.name/blog/posts/http/downloads/how-to-offer-better-downloads/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>To offer HTTP file downloads via your own code [rather than redirecting elsewhere], it's often easy to rustle something up. However, the default behaviour in a lot of cases may not give users as good an experience as possible. With a bit of effort, you can polish that right up, and here are 4 sets of HTTP headers that help you do just that.</p>

<h3>content-length</h3>

<p>If you are able to, set the <code>content-length</code> header with the total size of the file.</p>

<p>This simple header will cause browsers to tell users [estimates for] the time-to-completion of downloads. [It's also required for browsers to attempt to do range requests, as in the following section.]</p>

<p>Note that if streaming a file to the client, e.g. using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/request-response/#streaminghttpresponse-object">Django's StreamingHttpResponse</a>, then at the point the HTTP headers are generated, the full bytes of the file are not available, so this can't happen automatically. You have to explicitly determine the length of the file and set the header. For example, if the file is stored in S3, S3 returns a <code>content-length</code> header with all responses, and you can take the value of this header and return it to the client.</p>

<h3>accept-ranges / range / content-range [/ content-length]</h3>

<p>By default, if the connection is interrupted, browsers will have to restart the download from the beginning. If you support HTTP range requests, which use the <code>accept-ranges</code>, <code>range</code>, <code>content-range</code> headers, [and <code>content-length</code> header] then browsers can resume downloads from where they left off.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests">MDN docs on HTTP range requests</a> for more information. Note that <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/s3-optimizing-performance-best-practices/use-byte-range-fetches.html">S3 supports range requests</a>, so if your code is essentially a proxy to S3, you can proxy the headers to and from S3 to support this fairly easily.</p>

<h3>content-disposition</h3>

<p>By default, browsers will guess at a suitable filename for the downloaded file, typically using the last path-component from the URL. Instead, consider what would be a more helpful filename, and set something like <code>content-disposition: attachment; filename="very-helpful-filename.csv"</code>.</p>

<h3>accept-encoding / content-encoding</h3>

<p>Some files compress well, for example typical CSV files. Serving compressed versions of these would often make downloads much faster. However, if the most likely thing users will do will do is immediately and manually uncompress the file, you've just made their life a tiny bit harder.</p>

<p>However, the browser can do this so the user will never even notice. For example, if the browser sends an <code>accept-encoding</code> header specifying it accepts gzip [which most modern browsers do], and if the server returns a header of <code>content-encoding: gzip</code> with gzipped data, the browser will automatically decompress this data on download. The user will notice nothing other than faster downloads.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, S3 doesn't support this sort of content negotiation. If you're storing your data on S3, and want to support both gzipped and non-gzipped versions of an object, you'll have to store them under separate keys. To avoid this, you might be tempted to compress on-the-fly. However, you then won't be able to send a <code>content-length</code>, or handle range requests.</p>

<hr>

<p>That's it!</p>

<p>If you don’t know  <a target="_blank" href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> , it is a javascript runtime like Nodejs but with some changes.</p>
<p>We are not going to talk about the technical aspect here but only the advantages and disadvantages that I have in working with Deno.</p>

<h2 id="write-and-play">Write and play</h2>
<p>With Deno, you no longer need to install packages with package managers like NPM, so no more heavyweight node_modules folder on your computer (and also on your conscience).</p>
<p>Imports are done with Urls which can be either in deno's package manager with versioning, or directly on the git directory of your favorite library.</p>
<p>To illustrate that, here a sample code to start a web server with Deno and  <a target="_blank" href="https://oakserver.github.io/oak/">Oak Server</a> :</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { Application } <span>from</span> <span>"https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts"</span>;

<span>const</span> app = <span>new</span> Application();

app.use(<span>(<span>ctx</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  ctx.response.body = <span>"Hello world!"</span>;
});

<span>await</span> app.listen(<span>"127.0.0.1:8000"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>You can also run codes that are not on your computer like <a target="_blank" href="https://deno.land/x/nessie@1.1.3">Nessie</a> which lets you perform database migrations directly from the command line with Deno.</p>
<pre><code>deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write https://deno.land/x/nessie/cli.ts init
</code></pre>
<h2 id="typescript">Typescript</h2>
<p>Yes, Deno uses typecript by default for your code writing to avoid many errors, and since typescript is the norm in this perfect world, all libraries written in Deno uses typescript are typed.</p>
<p>And typescript is fully integrated into our IDEs, the code is easier to debug! 😁</p>
<h2 id="webassembly">WebAssembly 👀</h2>
<p>Deno integrates browser APIs and therefore has the WASM API allowing you to use functions written in other languages directly in your code.</p>
<p>I was personally tired of seeing Python run after installing each dependency in my NodeJs projects, it gave an impression of instability and that’s verified by running a code on different OS ...</p>
<p>But it's resolved as WASM is universal and standardized!</p>
<h2 id="browser-apis">Browser APIs</h2>
<p>Deno has (again) a big advantage, that offering browser APIs to make the javascript development environment more homogeneous with front-end javascript development.</p>
<p>For example : the standardized function " <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">fetch</a> " is available with Deno.</p>
<h2 id="custom-formatter">Custom Formatter</h2>
<p>Deno integrates a custom formatter to make the code in your project between each developer more homogeneous with the <code>deno fmt</code> command</p>

<p>I only see 2 problems using Deno :</p>
<h2 id="instability">Instability</h2>
<p>Since Deno is still young, the libraries and the runtime may have bugs.</p>
<p>I have often had to spend long hours debugging my code to fix crashes.</p>
<p>Often due to a bad cache or a version change in a dependency or runtime.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the more we advance in time, the more stable Deno is and the libraries also with a strong open source community.</p>
<p>For example, I have more easily participated in open source projects using the deno runtime to improve them than NodeJs.</p>
<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
<p>The number of available libs is still quite low, again due to Deno's age, but this number is increasing day by day (javascript ecosystem, lol)!</p>

<p>In the end, I use Deno whenever I have to do something other than frontend, instead of using NodeJs, if the library I want to use doesn't exist, then I create it and make it public to help other people.</p>
<p>And I learned a lot from the open-source community by operating like this!</p>

<p>It’s interesting to see how the amount of ennui in our society increases simultaneously as technology advances. We are doing something wrong. Technology and its rapid advancement can be not only distracting but dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is this contributing to the declinism of our society? I think it is, and my only advice is to be more empathetic and caring of others around you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The abundance of digital content, the accessibility of technology, the algorithms strictly designed to keep you connected and in rage, and the facility to consume more goods from our homes, digital and non-digital, it’s all part of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are becoming isolated creatures who are often policing others to see how they are behaving and ready to complain publicly if other people disagree with us.</p>



<p>Attacking and criticizing others is easier than ever; digital anonymity is at the root cause of this. Interestingly, those who identify themselves and dare to share their opinions publicly suffer from attacks of people who dislike what they say, destroying any opportunity of dialog and intelligent conversation.</p>



<p>It is boredom, online anonymity, misinformation, and many other things contributing to a civic and ethical decline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve found myself lured into digital anger holes just by doom-scrolling on Twitter and other platforms. Even when I think I’m self-aware, it’s hard to push back and ignore the ignorant and the misinformation of pointless negativity, some of which comes from people who are just virtue signaling.</p>



<p>Slowing down is the best thing we can do, in my opinion. Before you reply to a critic, before responding to someone’s comment, take a minute and figure out if responding or commenting to something undeniably negative or ignorant is necessary. I think it is not.</p>



<p>Fighting misinformation, cynicism, and hate speech are necessary, but we can’t do it with more misinformation and cynicism of our own. We often fall under tribalism behavior, and it requires a large amount of patience and self-awareness to combat that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don’t need to stop innovating to advance our technologies. However, we need to be wise and empathetic to those who are negatively affected by it. Hence, we should be aware of what’s happening and be willing to make changes, even when not in our favor, to ensure the technology and progress that comes with it benefit everyone equally.</p>



<p>At a personal level, I find it beneficial to be more present and empathetic to those around us, our family, our friends, the cashier at the store, the homeless around the corner, the people with who we disagree, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just follow the Golden Rule:</p>



<blockquote><p>One should never do something to others that one would regard as an injury to one’s own self</p><cite><em>Mahābhārata</em>&nbsp;13.114.8</cite></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>This post has been discussed on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26291054#26294846">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/luawx6/rust_zig_and_the_futility_of_replacing_c/"><code>/r/rust</code></a>, and
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/1iiifg"><code>lobste.rs</code></a>.</p><p>I should not have posted this to Hacker News on a Saturday night right before
going to bed, but in my defense, this post blew up in a way I didn’t expect.</p></div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>There was a recent <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771">dust-up on GitHub</a> surrounding the decision by the
<a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography">Cryptography library</a> (which I will call <code>cryptography</code> for convenience) to
switch to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>One of the distro maintainers of my distro of choice, <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>, filed a bug
report with the <code>crytography</code> saying that the switch broke builds on several
platforms that Gentoo still supports. The <code>cryptography</code> authors replied that
those platforms are not really used anymore, and that they were going to stick
with Rust because it has better memory safety than C. They also argued that it
is better to force better programming languages on people because of better
security.</p><p>At first glance, it appears that the better argument is on the side of the
<code>cryptography</code> maintainers, but after thinking about it carefully, I think they
are wrong.</p><h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2><p>There are a few reasons why I believe the <code>cryptography</code> maintainers are at
fault.</p><h3 id="due-diligence">Due Diligence</h3><p>First, their argument for Rust (and against C) because of memory safety implies
that they have not done due diligence in finding and fixing such bugs.</p><p>I can almost hear the rage of my readers against that paragraph above and
against the fact that I don’t have a commenting system on my blog. So let me
answer the comments preemptively.</p><p>“They are volunteers, giving their time away for free!”</p><p>Yes, but they also <em>intend</em> for their code to be used widely. They managed to
succeed in that, so they now have some obligation to their users.</p><p>“They don’t have any obligation!”</p><p>If a software project actively goes out and gets users, which just about any
project with a serious number of users has done, then yes, they have an
obligation to those users. The reason is that they sold users on the idea of
using their software. In other words, they were marketing their software, which
means making promises.</p><p>In fact, when people release <em>libraries</em> and try to get users for them, it’s
<em>because</em> they want them to be used by downstream programmers. A programmer
might write a program to scratch an itch and release it, but that reasoning
applies much less to libraries, in my opinion.</p><p>“Okay, but they didn’t get anything in return, so there’s still no obligation.”</p><p>In return, the users gave them <strong>relevance</strong>.</p><p>One of the most vocal (in favor of Rust) developers of <code>cryptography</code> works for
Red Hat Security Engineering (if I read his GitHub profile right). I don’t know
if his work on <code>cryptography</code> helped him get that job, but it might have.</p><p>Another of the most vocal developers has a computer security company. I would
bet money that his work on <code>cryptography</code> gives his company relevance.</p><p>So they did <em>not</em> get “nothing” from users. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>By the way, this position comes from my own experience pushing my <a href="https://git.yzena.com/gavin/bc"><code>bc</code></a>. I
managed to convince the FreeBSD project to <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/tree/main/contrib/bc">make it the default</a> in FreeBSD
13.</p><p>Once I did that, I shouldered, willingly, the need to keep FreeBSD happy. And
while I have made mistakes, I have done well so far.</p><p>And with my <code>bc</code>, <strong>I did my due diligence with memory safety</strong>. I fuzzed my
<code>bc</code> and eliminated all of the bugs. I even run the generated fuzzer test cases
through AddressSanitizer, and my entire test suite is run through Valgrind
<em>and</em> AddressSanitizer. I also add failing fuzzer cases to my test suite, which
means I run more and more test cases through both of those frightfully
effective tools.</p><p>For the record, those tools are only effective with effective test suites, which
I spent a lot of time building. But <em>building</em> such a test suite is part of due
diligence itself.</p><p>So it follows that if the developers have <em>not</em> done their due diligence, their
users should <strong>leave</strong>, either by forking the project or creating a new one.
The relevance they gave to the <code>cryptography</code> authors should disappear.</p><h3 id="battle-tested-c-code">Battle-Tested C Code</h3><p>In fact, I have done enough due diligence with my <code>bc</code> that I would consider it
a dereliction of duty to Rewrite It in Rust (RIIR).</p><p>Why would it be a dereliction of duty? Because rewriting it in Rust would cause
<em>more</em> bugs, not less. This is because of several reasons:</p><ol><li>I would need to <em>redesign</em> it to fit the language.</li><li>I would need to <em>reimplement</em> it, and new implementations always have bugs.</li><li>The C code is battle-tested, both by me (using fuzzing and other techniques)
and by users.</li></ol><p>That last point is the most crucial, especially in the case of <code>cryptography</code>.</p><p>If the developers of <code>cryptography</code> claim that they have, in fact, done their
due diligence with regards to memory safety in their C code, then they are
claiming that it’s battle-tested.</p><p>The saying that “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,” and in this case,
<em><strong>if</strong></em> the <code>cryptography</code> developers are claiming that they have done their
due diligence, they are throwing away a bird in the hand for a single one in the
bush.</p><div><p><strong>Edit (28 Feb 2021)</strong>: This part of the post seems to be misunderstood widely,
so I am going to attempt to clarify.</p><p>People are arguing that having safe C code requires a frozen, small codebase
with a thorough test suite. And then they debate my position based on the belief
that the codebase needs to evolve.</p><p>For the record, I agree with them that in order to have safe C code, the
codebase must be small and frozen.</p><p>What I am arguing is that <strong>crypto</strong> code <em>should</em> be small and frozen, with a
thorough test suite. I wrote about that <a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2019/11/finishing-software/">here</a>.</p></div><p>And if that’s the case, their users should <strong>leave</strong> and take <code>cryptography</code>'s
relevance with them.</p><h3 id="desktops-and-smartphones-are-not-the-only-computers">Desktops and Smartphones Are Not the Only Computers</h3><p>The users of <code>cryptography</code> were claiming in the bug report discussion that Rust
is not portable to many platforms, and the authors said that they don’t have the
time or resources to target those platforms. Fair enough.</p><p>But then they claim that the <em>users</em> should put in the effort to port Rust to
their platforms. This is wrong.</p><p>The <code>cryptography</code> authors also claim that the platforms that Rust doesn’t
support do not matter. As we will see below, this is false.</p><p>While I agree that the <code>cryptography</code> authors are not responsible for porting
Rust to other platforms, the users of those platforms are not either.</p><p>That responsibility falls on the Rust developers.</p><p><em>They</em> were the ones who sold Rust to those who have used it, so as above,
<em>they</em> have the responsibility for supporting their users.</p><p>Granted, the Rust developers have made no claim about being portable to every
platform. But they <em>have</em> claimed that it is <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded">appropriate for embedded
software</a>.</p><p>If it were true, this would be great. After all, <a href="https://youtu.be/3HxPzutkNYw?t=257">IoT devices outnumber
desktops and smartphones by at least one order of magnitude</a>.</p><p>But there are a lot of them that LLVM, Rust’s backend, cannot generate code
for. In fact, there are a lot of them that <em>C++</em> cannot run on.</p><div><p><strong>Edit (28 Feb 2021)</strong>: Also, the Rust developers are the developers with the
most experience reading ISA manuals knowing how to make a compiler generate
code. So they are still the best placed to support those “esoteric”
architectures.</p><p>And if they do not know how to read ISA manuals and generate code, it’s because
they lean too heavily on LLVM.</p></div><p>Make no mistake; embedded software is still running the majority of devices in
the world. And C is the king of embedded software.</p><p>I don’t know exact numbers, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the majority of
programmable devices in the world cannot run Rust.</p><p>Thus, because Rust uses LLVM, it is not portable.</p><p>And in my opinion, Rust is not appropriate for the embedded space.</p><p>So in this case, I would consider that the <code>cryptography</code> developers were
victims of the Rust developers.</p><h3 id="gcc-is-not-the-only-compiler"><code>gcc</code> Is Not the Only Compiler</h3><p>That isn’t the only problem.</p><p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">project to make <code>gcc</code> able to compile Rust</a>. That’s commendable.</p><p>However, many people seem to believe that once it’s done, Rust will be portable.
That is not the case.</p><p>Why? Simple: <strong><code>gcc</code> is not the only compiler</strong>.</p><p>There is plenty of code out there that uses dead simple C compilers, like
<a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">tcc</a>, <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">sdcc</a>, and others. And often, they have <a href="https://embeddedgurus.com/stack-overflow/2012/06/optimizing-for-the-cpu-compiler/">good reason to do
so</a>.</p><p>Adding a <code>gcc</code> frontend, while it will improve the situation, will not make Rust
as portable as C. Period.</p><h3 id="pushing-for-progress-hinders-it">Pushing for Progress Hinders It</h3><p>The other thing that the <code>cryptography</code> authors claim is that their users who
refuse to adopt Rust are hindering progress.</p><p>That may be true, but it is also true that forcing “progress” on others hinders
<em>true</em> progress.</p><p>By forcing users to either adopt Rust or pin their dependency on <code>cryptography</code>
to the most recent version without it, they are forcing those users to use
stagnant code.</p><p>Isn’t that the very opposite of progress?</p><h2 id="cryptography-at-fault"><code>cryptography</code> at Fault</h2><p>Those reasons lay out why I think the <code>cryptography</code> authors should shoulder the
blame for this situation, and I think I can explain where they went wrong.</p><ol><li>They let ideology come before pragmatic engineering.</li><li>They sold <code>cryptography</code> to users.</li><li>They knew that switching to Rust would break existing users and did it
anyway.</li><li>They either did not do their due diligence for memory safety, or they did
and threw that battle-tested code out.</li></ol><h2 id="portability">Portability</h2><p>To be honest, I used to think that it was better to switch to a better language
than C.</p><p>I had several talks with Linux distro maintainers, as well as a talk with my
father-in-law, that convinced me that C’s portability is still important enough
that it should be used.</p><p>Unless, of course, you <em>explicitly</em> target only certain platforms. But you had
better be prepared to never target others.</p><p>In fact, after talking with the distro maintainers, who have had to build Rust,
I am also convinced that it’s not just about being portable, it’s also about how
<em>easy</em> it is to <em>build</em> software.</p><p>Rust’s bootstrap is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">complicated</a>, and it is one of the worst things about
it.</p><p>If building software in Rust means building Rust for a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">Tier 3</a> platform,
you can bet that <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/02/09/Rust-move-fast-and-break-things.html">people will stick with C</a>.</p><h3 id="zig">Zig</h3><p>I want to take a moment to talk about Zig.</p><p>Zig might be one of the most promising up-and-coming languages of recent memory.</p><p>But it will ultimately fail to reach its goal.</p><p>You see, Zig is meant to replace C.

I just resurrected and cleaned up an old tool I had lying around. It's now nice
and usable by others. This tool loads terrain data, and renders it from the
ground, simulating what a human or a camera would see. This is useful for
armchair exploring or for identifying peaks. This was relatively novel when I
wrote it &gt;10 years ago, but there are a number of similar tools in existence
now. <i>This</i> implementation is still useful in that it's freely licensed and
contains APIs, so fancier processing can be performed on its output.

I've thought about them a lot, and wrote this to compile some of those thoughts in a single document.</p><p>What is a community? For my purposes, I’ve found a useful definition.</p><blockquote><p>A group of people, united by a shared passion or purpose, who interact with each other.</p></blockquote><p>Looking at the definition, there are only two things a community needs.</p><ul><li>A shared passion or purpose</li><li>People interacting with each other</li></ul><p>Here’s some examples of communities:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Community</th><th>Shared passion/purpose</th><th>People interacting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Your high school</td><td>Learn (apparently)</td><td>Talking in classrooms, lunches, groupchats</td></tr><tr><td>React developers</td><td>Using the same language, interested in the development of the language</td><td>Tweeting at each other, reddit, forums</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The strength of a community, then, comes from the strength of this shared passion/purpose and the depth and frequency of interactions. And so, a useful formula for measuring the strength of a community could be:</p><p><span></span> = strength of the passion/ideal</p><p><span></span> = the ith connection</p><p><span></span> = the depth of the ith connection</p><p>We can come up with a few interesting observations through this formula.</p><ul><li><p>Notice that this definition doesn’t talk about technology or the platform used to bring these people together. <strong>Putting people into a group chat doesn’t make it a community.</strong> In fact, a group chat isn’t even necessary to build a community. There’s clearly a React developer community on the internet, but there isn’t any specific platform or group chat they congregate at. In that sense, communities can be thought of as the superset of the platform they exist on. A single community can use many platforms to interact with each other, but the discord server or slack channel they use isn’t the community itself.</p></li><li><p><strong>The strength of the shared passion/purpose acts as a force multiplier on the connections in a community.</strong> If there is no shared P, the community has no strength. Getting people together who don’t have a shared passion is the same thing as putting a bunch of random people in a group chat and calling it a community.</p></li><li><p><strong>It’s much easier to connect with people who have the same values and passions as you do, so the stronger P is, the stronger every single connection is right at the outset.</strong> So (somewhat obviously), the more passionate people are, the easier is it so make a community with them. Conversely, without a strong shared ideal, it’ll be very difficult to get people to interact and form deep connections.</p></li><li><p>The shared purpose can even be something as trivial as having to be in the same place at the same time. But if you’ve left high school, you’ll notice how you probably haven’t kept in touch with 90% of the people you knew, even if it felt like you knew them really well during your time there. That leads us to another important point- <strong>there is a hierarchy of shared experiences that bring people together.</strong> You didn’t keep in touch simply because the strength of your connection was based on location, which is very weak compared to shared passions or experiences.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/hierarchy.jpeg" alt="shared purpose hierarchy"></p><p>A community with a few deeply passionate people is much stronger than one with many shallow ones. You’d think that it’s merely the area under the curve (connections x depth of connections), but there’s a third dimension here-  P would likely be much higher in communities with deeper connections, making those communities stronger.</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/3d.jpeg" alt="3d graph of P, depth and connections"></p><p>Notice that frequency of interaction is not a factor at all. It’s only useful to the extent that it increases the depth of relationships in a community- beyond that, it doesn’t make a difference.</p><p>Think of your closest group of friends. You could meet them all after months and you’d still feel the same sense of community you did before. The strength of your connection superseded the need to constantly interact. And so, the DAUs of a community is a terrible way to measure its strength. This is not to say it doesn’t matter, just that while frequent interactions may lead to deep connections, deep connections don’t necessarily mean frequent interactions.</p><h2>Who’s a community for?</h2><p>The need for deep connections means that communities specifically built for the internet can only fulfill a certain set of users.</p><p>The issue is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a>. Humans can only maintain ~150 deep connections, and the vast majority of these are taken up by in person relationships. But to make online communities, you need people to make strong relationships. So, in a sense, you need people with enough ‘mental social capacity’ to form those deep relationships with people online.</p><p>This required ‘mental social space’ means that online communities need to cater to people who are missing some sort of social interaction offline. And so, they need to find a way to offer connections that people cannot find in person.</p><p>From a social lens, the internet is an aggregation of extremes. It allows everyone in the long tail to suddenly have an abundance of people like them. This means that people with unconvential interests who couldn't find their people in person, can do so online. So the the gamer, the programmer, the digital artist in school- they don’t need to feel so different anymore.</p><p>For example, I’ve been interested in startups for years now, and after bingeing <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/podcast/">YC’s podcasts</a>, I realised that I needed a way to find people with the SV mindset. Twitter allowed me to find many people my age with similar interests, <a href="https://twitter.com/sarvasvkulpati/status/1247181074611851267?lang=en">Enlite</a> allowed me to meet a bunch of really interesting people, and interning at <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> gave me a glimpse of what it’s like to work at startups. All of these happened without meeting a single one of of these people in person.</p><p><a href="https://hackclub.com/">HackClub</a> is a perfect example of a community that’s built to cater to a group of people who miss some sort of social interaction offline. It’s still strangely difficult to find kids who are interested in coding and building things, and Hack Club fills that gap by giving young hackers an online community of people just like them. It works so well because it manages to both</p><ul><li>Cater to highly passionate people</li><li>Cater to people who don’t usually find their communities in person</li></ul><h2>Building strong community</h2><p>While finding many people with a high P is a prerequisite, you need to then get them to interact with each other, to weave the web of connections that form the thing you’ll call your community. When you first bring people together, each individuals connections will look like this:</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/connections.jpeg" alt="a graph of connections against depth"></p><p>Each member will have fairly weak connections with all the other members.The mistake I made when I first started Enlite was thinking that putting a bunch of people in a slack channel would mean that all of them interact with every other member all the time. That wasn’t the case. Instead, a small, core group of people emerged.</p><p>When you’re in school, you’ll notice that cliques naturally form. No amount of social engineering would get the jocks to suddenly integrate with the nerds. Similarly, the formation of cliques in a community is pretty normal, and in fact, is a great thing. It means people are falling into subsets of others they are comfortable with.</p><p>However, you don’t want insulated cliques. While there should be strong connections within them, they should also be connected to each other. Should this succeed, your community will look like this:</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/graph.jpeg" alt="network of members in a community"></p><p>Any individual in your community will end up with a T shaped profile- many fairly shallow connections, a few very deep ones. The width of the stem would depend on the number of online friends they mentally have space to make as well as their success with connecting to people within the community.</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/depth.jpeg" alt="depth"></p><p>Much like any social product, Enlite has a retention curve, and about a third are still active. An interesting observation is that the members who initially attended the most video calls are the ones who are now the most active in chat. My theory is that they acquired the best relationships and so, felt incentivised to talk and share opinions and progress on projects.</p><h2>Creating strong connections</h2><p>But how do you facilitate creating these strong connections? Something I’ve noticed is that every relationship: teacher-student, parent-child, friend-friend, follows a timeline</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/friendGraph.jpeg" alt="friendship timeline"></p><p>In a sense, the depth of a relationship could be measured by how much a pair knows and understands about what makes the other tick. You could have a wild drinking buddy and always have fun but unless you have some deep conversations, you don’t have a deep relationship. To increase the depth of the relationship quickly, you need to increase the bandwidth of communication- doing so allows both people to understand each other faster, and so, speeds up the timeline of the relationship.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/aadillpickle">Aadil</a> and I followed each other on twitter for a while. I saw his tweets, he saw mine, sometimes we interacted with each other. But then, when making Enlite, I got on a zoom call with him. Within 30 minutes, we were much, much better friends. It felt like the amount our friendship progressed in a few months of interacting with each other on Twitter was repeated several times over in 1 zoom call.</p><p>Of course, different mediums have different bandwidth, but there’s a tradeoff- the higher the bandwidth, the higher the barrier of entry. Scheduling a zoom call, for example, is much harder than sending a Twitter DM.</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/bars.jpeg" alt="bar charts of communication mediums compared"></p><p>In this sense, audio is probably best placed at the intersection of bandwidth and friction. On audio calls, you don’t need to care about how you look, you don’t need to constantly stay in a ‘switched on’ state and stare at the camera throughout, and it’s much easier to hop on and off. This is probably why platforms like Discord and Clubhouse are growing so fast as a tool to grow communities.</p><h2>A summary</h2><p>In conclusion:</p><ul><li>Communities = passion x interaction x strength of interactions</li><li>You don't need a group chat for a community, and putting people into a group chat doesn't make it one</li><li>Communities need to cater for connections people don't find in person</li><li>Creating connections requires a high bandwidth of communication. When in doubt, choose video</li><li>Frequent activity doesn't necessarily mean a strong community</li></ul></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

<p>Here is a number to remember:&nbsp; .994 (and not because 994 is the country
telephone code for Azerbaijan).</p>



<p>The measure of poverty most commonly used by the World Bank is the “headcount”: the proportion of people below a poverty line,  a fixed level of income or consumption expenditures (CEX) per capita. &nbsp;The Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (1986) measures of poverty are weighted sums of people from a given distribution of consumption expenditures (or income), and the headcount is the simple case where the weights are equal for each person, irrespective of how far from the poverty line their CEX is. </p>



<p>This leads to a simple question:&nbsp; “How much of the  observed variation in headcount poverty rates across countries is due to variation in the median of the distribution of consumption expenditures?”&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>The answer, shown in Figure 1, is (roughly) “All of
it.”&nbsp; The R-Squared of the median (with
various powers to account for non-linearity) for explaining headcount poverty
for the three poverty lines is: </p>



<ul><li>$5.50 per day, R-Squared=.988,
correlation(poverty, predicted)=.994</li><li>$3.20 per day, R-Squared=.988, correlation(poverty,
predicted)=.994</li><li>$1.90 per day, R-Squared=.983,
correlation(poverty, predicted)=.991 </li></ul>



<p>The simple correlation between the actual $3.20/day or $5.50/day headcount poverty rate and headcount poverty as predicted using only the median of the country distribution is .994 and for $1.90 it is .991.&nbsp; These are about as high a correlation as real world data can produce.&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong>Figure 1:&nbsp; Headcount poverty rates are extremely highly associated with median consumption expenditures </strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="749" height="353" src="https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image.png 749w, https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-300x141.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"></figure>



<p><em>Source:&nbsp;
Author’s calculations based on data from:&nbsp; “</em><a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povDuplicateWB.aspx">PovcalNet:
the on-line tool for poverty measurement developed by the Development Research
Group of the World Bank</a>”</p>



<p>The regression uses the 389 country/time observations from
the World Bank data that are based on consumption expenditures (not income) and
recent data (not distant extrapolations). Since headcount poverty is a partial
integral of a distribution of consumption expenditures the relationship between
the median and headcount has to be non-linear.&nbsp;
I use powers of the median from -2 to 5 to allow for flexible
non-linearity. </p>



<p>Nancy Birdsall and Christian Meyer have argued that for
development issues “<a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/median-message-good-enough-measure-material-well-being-and-shared-development-progress">The
Median is the Message</a>.” &nbsp;For headcount
poverty they are <em>completely</em> right. &nbsp;The answer to the question:&nbsp; “Why does a country at a given time have
headcount poverty rate it does?” is “Because of its median of consumption
expenditure.” Pretty much full stop.&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditional on the median, any and all other factors
or variables can explain <em>at most</em> 1.2
percent of the variation in country headcount poverty rates (maybe 0, but <em>at most </em>1.2). &nbsp;</p>



<p>You might be saying, “Lant, why are you making such a big
deal of this correlation?”&nbsp; Well, thanks
for asking.&nbsp; </p>



<p>This very tight correlation is not built in.&nbsp; One can usefully decompose (as many have done)
the difference in poverty rates comparing two distributions (between countries
or over time) into three elements on the (mostly accurate) assumption the
distribution is log-normal (that is, the natural log of consumption
expenditures is distributed as a Gaussian normal distribution):</p>



<ol><li>Differences in the central tendency of the log-normal distribution,</li><li>Differences in the variance of the log-normal distribution and</li><li>Differences in the distribution below the poverty line being more or less favorable to poverty than would be expected of a log-normal of a given central tendency and variance (as the log-normal is a two-parameter distribution this forces an exact shape).</li></ol>



<p>How much of the variance in headcount poverty is an
empirical fact that depends on the actual distributions of consumption
expenditures across countries and the fact that (2) and (3) account for 1.2
percent of the variance could have been otherwise, it is not cooked into
definitions.&nbsp; In fact, one can easily
imagine policies or programs that would bring up the lower tail, and hence
reduce poverty, much more than the log-normal would predict.&nbsp; So it is a striking finding that <em>both </em>differences in variance
(inequality) with the assumption of log-normality and deviations from
log-normality below the poverty line <em>together
</em>account for at most 1.2 percent of observed variation in poverty.</p>



<p>Included in the country/time varying factors whose variation
in the observed data <em>cannot</em> explain
more than 1.2 percent of the observed variation in headcount poverty rates are
things like: “budget (government or other) devoted to anti-poverty programs”
and “efficacy of the design of anti-poverty programs” or “whether the country’s
anti-poverty programs are ‘evidence based’” or, for that matter, any
interaction of those factors, like:&nbsp;
“whether a country devoted budget to well-designed anti-poverty programs
based on evidence.”&nbsp; The median explains
nearly all variation in poverty across countries with no reference to targeted
programs of any kind: not micro-credit, not conditional cash transfers, not
chickens, not livelihood programs, nothing that claims to impact poverty
without changing the median. </p>



<p>Given the amount of time, energy, intellectual firepower, academic
publication, and advocacy that go into discussions of anti-poverty <em>programs</em> one might think they are a
large part of the “solution” to global poverty.&nbsp;
But they just have not been.&nbsp; If
your median consumption expenditure went up then your headcount poverty went
down and <em>nothing</em> else that any
country has done besides that seems to be very important in explaining poverty
reduction.</p>



<p>The relative importance of growth of median consumption expenditures versus “all else” can be illustrated with two different poverty lines at two different levels of income, the “extreme poverty” penurious poverty line that the World Bank often uses (but which I think is fundamentally <a href="http://www.effective-states.org/the-mdgs-were-a-disaster-meet-lant-pritchett/">illegitimate</a> as it is too low) and the “$5.50/day” line (which I think is still too low).</p>



<p>The predicted level of $1.90/day “extreme poverty” for a
country at the average income of the lowest quartile of countries is 72.2%.&nbsp; If its poverty rate were better by one
standard deviation of the residual conditional on the median it would fall to
only 68.6 percent.&nbsp; Even if it had the
best poverty conditional on its median for any country in the bottom quartile
it would fall by about 10 percentage points to 62.7 percent.&nbsp; In contrast, if that country grew by two
percent a year for 20 years (which is roughly the average growth in the post
WWII era) poverty would fall to 35.9 percent—about in half.&nbsp; If it grew at 4 percent per capita for 20
years (this is about one standard deviation above the average growth of 2
percent) predicted headcount poverty would fall to 12.1%.&nbsp; Sustaining rapid growth starting from a low
median consumption expenditures reduces poverty <em>50 percentage points</em> more than having the <em>best</em> observed poverty conditional on the low median.&nbsp; With sustained growth <em>half the population </em>moves out of extreme poverty compared to 10
percent even the <em>best</em> observed
poverty with stagnant income (and just to be clear, the data here don’t tell
what accounts for these observed low poverty rates conditional on the median). </p>



<p><strong>Figure 2:&nbsp; Even getting to the best headcount poverty for a given median expenditures versus the average produces a small gain relative to the poverty reduction from sustained growth of the median</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="481" height="289" src="https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-1.png 481w, https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-1-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px"></figure>



<p>I do the same exercise with the second quartile of income
and the $5.50/day poverty line, with roughly the same results.&nbsp; Even the best performance for poverty
conditional on median produces gains much, much, smaller than the gains in
poverty reduction from sustained rapid growth.</p>



<p>The results of these regressions are just facts about the
world and do not directly reveal causal structures.&nbsp; In particular, there may well be cost
effective poverty reducing programs that merit support by governments and/or
philanthropists.&nbsp; The cross-national
correlations can only speak to what <em>have been</em>
the correlates of poverty, not <em>what could
be.&nbsp; </em>But, while one doesn’t want to
over-interpret facts, neither does one want to under-fact interpretations of
very specific and particular empirical findings about specific programs
either.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The next time you hear the phrase “solve global poverty” remember the number: .994.&nbsp; If what follows “solve global poverty” isn’t about raising median consumption expenditures a very good question is: “why not?”</p>



<p>(This blog is titled “Part I” because I plan a Part II that
does a bit more on the technical issues of these types of decompositions and a
Part III that discusses a bit the broader implications.&nbsp; But, unlike the Lord of the Rings (in which
all three were filmed at the same time) these are not yet written and the
future is unpredictable).</p>

<p>It begins in October 1927, with a single camera exhibited in Moscow at an Exposition of Photographic Technique in the new Soviet capital, Moscow. Bostelman’s camera is a small 35mm camera with a simple, single-speed shutter and a winding key to advance the film. The camera’s back is removable, and removing it turns the rest of the camera into an enlarger which can be used to make prints.</p>
<p>It never makes it into production, but Bostelman’s simple snap-shooter is the first Soviet camera. What comes after this is first a trickle, and then a flood.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, and the Soviet camera industry is the second-largest in the world – second only to Japan, whose bands such as Nikon, Canon, Minolta Olympus and Pentax have become household names. The Soviet Union has its own heavyweights, and between them they have churned out dozens and then hundreds of different camera designs as the decades tick by.</p>
<p>Thanks to a mix of espionage, war reparations, ingenious design and a desire to show the West a thing or two, the USSR’s camera makers come up with a Soviet answer to almost every camera type made in the West, though not necessarily at the same time. Soviet designers devised a myriad of different models, some of the brutishly simple, others showing real flair and ingenuity.</p>
<p>Odd, then, that the entirety of a photographic industry spread across the largest country ever formed and spanning more than 60 years can get judged off first impressions. In the last 20 years, I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve seen people declaim the quality of all Soviet cameras based off a single flea-market <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2018/12/zenit-e-russian-camera-review/">Zenit-E</a> which might have mouldering in someone’s basement for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>This is something I’ve learned having spent the last 20 years collecting and using Soviet cameras. The first one I came across was a Soviet-era <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2017/06/lomo-lc-a-cameras-lc-wide-lca-120/">Lomo LC-A</a> compact in a camera shop in London’s West End; a solid black rectangle with surprising heft and exotic Cyrillic lettering. That Lomo sparked an enduring love for film cameras of all shapes and sizes, and a particular interest in those made behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, where I grew up, Soviet cameras were almost unknown. But that wasn’t the case in Western Europe. The boom years of the Soviet photographic industry during the Cold War coincided with a new age of prosperity and consumerism west of Berlin. More people had the money and time to travel, and they wanted cameras with which to document it. The Soviet Union wanted hard currency and had a smorgasbord of cameras that could be sold at subsidised prices. Along with the Praktica cameras of East Germany’s vast Pentacon, Soviet cameras appealed to a huge swathe of photographers with a limited budget.</p>

<p>This article – and it’s a big one, so get a drink handy – is an attempt to dispel some of the myths that have developed around Soviet cameras, especially since the 1990s. It’s not trying to pretend that it’s only politics got in the way of the USSR’s cameras, and that every Zenit and Zorki is a match for a Nikon or a Leica. Some of the horror stories you might have heard about Soviet camera quality are 100% true. But not every Soviet camera is a lemon, and some are capable of taking fantastic images if you take the trouble to learn their strengths and, yes, their weaknesses.</p>

<h4><span id="The_big_five"></span><strong>The big five</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>But first, a little history.</p>
<p>The Soviet camera industry was dominated by five big names: <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/KMZ"><strong>KMZ</strong></a> (<em>Krasnogorskiy Mechanicheskiy Zavod</em>) in Moscow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOMO"><strong>Lomo</strong></a> in St Petersburg, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_(brand)"><strong>Kiev-Arsenal</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FED_(camera)"><strong>FED</strong></a> in Ukraine and <a href="https://vintagecameralab.com/brand/mmz/"><strong>MMZ</strong></a> (the home of BelOMO) in what is now Belarus. Some of these bureaus concentrated on one particular style of camera – FED, for instance, became known for Leica-copy rangefinders they started making in the 1930s and they were kept in production until almost the end of the Soviet Union itself.</p>

<p>The cameras created ranged from rudimentary compacts simple enough for children to ambitious designs intended to compete with the very best the West had to offer. The latter were a kind of photographic soft power – with no internal market to pay top dollar for them, the higher-spec cameras were touted as evidence of Soviet ingenuity and engineering prowess</p>
<figure id="attachment_22492" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22492"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kosmofoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/zenite4-e1590396414210.jpg" alt="Zenit-e (Pic: Stephen Dowling)" width="2000" height="1500"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22492">The Zenit-E is the most-produced 35mm SLR in history (Pic: Stephen Dowling)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much simpler cameras were made in Soviet industrial quantities: million after million. This model became the dominant one from the mid 1970s. Camera designers were no longer urged to make cameras to compete with the best of the West, but to tweak tried-and-trusted designs a little each time. You can see this in the successive designs that came after the ubiquitous Zenit-E SLR and Lomo’s simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smena_(camera)">Smena viewfinder camera</a>. Despite cosmetic changes on the outside, underneath little changed from camera to camera.</p>
<p>A leading Soviet camera collector named Viktor Suglob recently produced a Russian-language book called ‘<a href="http://ussrphoto.com/Wiki/default.asp?WikiCatID=39&amp;ParentID=4&amp;ContentID=311&amp;Item=1200+Cameras+from+USSR+by+Suglob%2C+Shaternik%2C+Kochergin">1200 Soviet Cameras</a>’, an encyclopaedia of almost every prototype and production camera devised over nearly 75 years of the USSR. Many of these, of course, were never produced beyond a few samples or pre-production models. But hundreds of designs did make it into production. Today, millions of these cameras – from KMZ and Lomo, MMZ and FED – still survive in working condition.</p>
<h4><span id="The_major_models"></span><strong>The major models</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>If you’re curious about Soviet cameras, you’ll find the easily available cameras falling into seven main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leica copy rangefinders:</strong> Mostly made by FED in Kharkiv in the Ukraine and under the “Zorki” name from KMZ in Moscow. These cameras use the same <a href="https://camerapedia.fandom.com/wiki/39mm_screw_lenses">L39 screw mount</a> that Leica rangefinders did up until the mid-1950s. These cameras were produced, in various forms, until the early 1990s.</li>
<li><strong>Contax-style rangefinders:</strong> The Kiev brand started out copying the Contax II rangefinder produced in Germany before the war, initially with Contax parts taken as war reparations. The “<a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Kiev_rangefinder">Kiev Contax</a>” line of cameras was made until the late 1980s</li>
<li><strong>Zenit SLRs:</strong> KMZ produced the Soviet Union’s widest array of SLR cameras under the Zenit name. The earliest versions were little more than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorki_1">Zorki rangefinder</a> with a reflex prism attached, but the line grew more popular in the late 1960s with the Zenit-E, the first Soviet SLR to use the M42-screw mount. M42 Zenits were made until the early 2000s, and a narrower range of cameras from the mid-1980s until the mid-2000s used the Pentax K mount. Lomo, and Kiev also produced SLRs, but these are far less common.</li>
<li><strong>Simple viewfinder cameras:</strong> Both Lomo in St Petersburg and MMZ in Minsk produced very similar families of snapshooters, rectangular viewfinder cameras with a simple shutter and a three-element glass lens. MMZ’s were called <a href="https://camerapedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vilia">Vilia</a> and Lomo’s were known as Smenas. Just two Smenas – the <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2020/03/these-are-the-most-produced-35mm-cameras-of-all-time/">Smena-8 and the 8M</a> – were built to the tune of around 21 million, making them the most-produced 35mm cameras of all time. These cameras are cheap and rudimentary, but their glass lens definitely elevate them out of toy camera territory.</li>
<li><strong>Simple TLRs:</strong> Medium format cameras were not produced in the same breadth and scale as 35mm cameras, but there were still some successful models. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubitel">Lubitel family</a> of cheap 120-format TLRs are the easiest to find. Built out of plastic but with glass Triplet-style lenses, these Lomo-made cameras were produced from the 1940s until after the fall of the Soviet Union.</li>
<li><strong>Medium format SLRs:</strong> The Soviet Union’s equivalent to the <a href="https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2019/04/camera-geekery-pentax-67/">Pentax 67</a> was the <a href="https://vintagecameradigest.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/the-kiev-6c-a-photographic-artifact-of-the-cold-war/">Kiev-6C</a>, which eventually evolved into the <a href="http://mattsclassiccameras.com/slr/kiev-60/">Kiev-60</a>. These are big, heavy SLR cameras with a rougher finish than their Western counterparts but with a range of very well-regarded lenses.</li>
<li><strong>Hasselblad-style medium-format cameras: </strong>The Kiev factory also produced a series of Hasselblad-style focal plane cameras, the Kiev-80 and <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Kiev_88">88</a> being the best-known of them. The lenses made for the Kiev-6/60 were also produced for some versions of this camera range. They are cheap – especially compared to Hasselblads – but they don’t come with a great reputation for reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were many other brands and minor camera ranges made in the USSR (the plucky Lomo LC-A compact spawned a movement in photography all on its own), but these are the main ones. They are all reasonably easy to find – very easy in the case of Zenit SLRS and FED rangefinders – and there’s no shortage of spare parts or repairers that can coax them back to life should anything be wrong.</p>
<p>Kosmo Foto released the video below last year as a guide for common models to investigate:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGlfbl5Oa_k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4><span id="Better_dead_than_Red"></span><strong>Better dead than Red?</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>Make no mistake – many film camera shooters regard Soviet cameras as uniformally awful, junk that should live in a landfill rather than a camera cabinet. Most of these photographers would sooner cut off a limb than handle a clunky Zenit or Zorki.</p>
<p>But the Soviet camera industry had peaks and troughs – periods when construction and quality control were high and times when standards were lax and reliability low. A Soviet rangefinder from the mid-1950s is from a very different system to one produced in the “Year of Stagnation” of the late 1970s.</p>

<p>The bad reputation which Soviet cameras isn’t undeserved,” says Jay Javier, the Filipino photographer and camera collector behind the <a href="https://www.fedka.com/jay/">Fed Zorki Survival Site</a>. “Many were really badly designed or made. As these creatures become more known, thanks to the internet, the bad ones get to be publicly shamed and justly avoided. Many of the generalisations in this respect turn out to be valid.”</p>
<p>Soviet quality control, especially in later years, sometimes left a lot to be desired. Cameras leaving the factory were supposed to be inspected and given a passport signed by a factory foreman ensuring they were working correctly. This The older …</p></div></div>

								<p>
								Welcome back to Fightin’ Words! It’s been a while since we last discussed how the <a href="https://ki.infil.net/w01-bugs.html">most famous fighting game bugs</a> have impacted the community’s favorite games. Today’s topic is a bit more technical, but it’s an equally important factor in how our favorite modern games are played -- we’re going to be doing a <strong>deep dive into netcode</strong>.								
								</p>
								</div>

								<hr><!-- Infil -->
								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_lecture.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
								At its core, netcode is simply a method for two or more computers, each trying to play the same game, to talk to each other over the internet. While local play always ensures that all player inputs arrive and are processed at the same time, <strong>networks are constantly unstable</strong> in ways the game cannot control or predict. Information sent to your opponent may be delayed, arrive out of order, or become lost entirely depending on dozens of factors, including the physical distance to your opponent, if you’re on a WiFi connection, and whether your roommate is watching Netflix.
								</p><p>
								Online play in games is nothing new, but fighting games have their own set of unique challenges. They tend to involve direct connections to other players, unlike many other popular game genres, and <strong>low, consistent latency</strong> is extremely important because muscle memory and reactions are at the core of virtually every fighting game. As a result, two prominent strategies have emerged for playing fighting games online: <strong>delay-based netcode</strong> and <strong>rollback netcode</strong>. 
								</p></div>
								</div>

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_thoughtful.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
								There’s been a renewed passion in the fighting game community that <strong>rollback is the best choice</strong>, and fighting game developers who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW61xJNJ9m8">choose to use delay-based netcode</a> are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTUtnclr2hs">preventing the growth of the genre</a>. While people have been passionate about this topic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2kAdmUCaI&amp;t=42m34s">for many years</a>, frustrations continue to rise as new, otherwise excellent games repeatedly have bad online experiences.
								</p><p>

								There are relatively few easy-to-follow explanations for what exactly rollback netcode is, how it works, and why it is so good at hiding the effects of bad connections (though <a href="http://mauve.mizuumi.net/2012/07/05/understanding-fighting-game-networking.html">there are some</a>). Because I feel this topic is extremely important for the future health of the fighting game community, I want to help squash some misconceptions about netcode and explain both netcode strategies thoroughly so everyone can be informed as they discuss. If you stick around to the end, I’ll even <strong>interview some industry experts and community leaders</strong> on the topic!
								</p><p>
								Before we dig into the details, though, let’s get one thing straight.
										
								</p></div>
								</div>

								<hr><!-- Infil -->
								<!-- header -->
								

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_smiling_3.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
										Both companies and players should care about good netcode because <strong>playing online is no longer the future -- it's the present</strong>. 
								</p><p>
										While most other video game genres have been this way for a decade or longer, fighting game developers seem to be resistant to embracing online play, perhaps because of the genre’s roots in offline settings such as arcades and tournaments. Playing offline is great, and it will always have considerable value in fighting games, but it’s simply a reality that <strong>a large percentage of the player base will never play offline</strong>. For many fighting game fans, playing online <em>is</em> the game, and a bad online experience prevents them from getting better, playing or recommending the game to their friends, and ultimately causes them to <a href="https://youtu.be/iTUtnclr2hs?t=758">simply go do something else</a>.
								</p><p>
										Even if you think you have a good connection, or live in an area of the world with robust internet infrastructure, good netcode is still mandatory. Plus, lost or delayed information happens regularly even on the best networks, and poor netcode can <a href="https://twitter.com/john_takeuchi/status/1162562266027327488">actively hamper matches</a> no matter how smooth the conditions may be. Good netcode also has the benefit of connecting regions across greater distances, effectively uniting the global player base as much as possible.

										<!-- gif 1A -->

											<figcaption>Bad netcode can ruin matches. This match, played online between two Japanese players, impacted who gets to attend the Capcom Pro Tour finals. <a href="https://twitter.com/john_takeuchi/status/1162562266027327488">(source)</a>
											</figcaption></figure></div>
										
								</div>
								</div>

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_content.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
										What about those who never play online because they much prefer playing offline with their friends? The <strong>healthy ecosystem</strong> that good netcode creates around a game benefits everyone. There will be more active players, more chances to consume content for your favorite game -- from tech videos to spectating online tournaments to expanding the strategy of lesser-used characters -- and more excitement surrounding your game in the FGC. Despite <a href="http://ki.infil.net/">Killer Instinct</a>’s pedigree as an excellent game, there’s no doubt that its superb rollback netcode has played a huge part in the sustained growth of its community.
								</p><p>

										Good netcode matters, period. So let’s talk about it.

The quality and completeness of data has greatly improved at TMDB over the years and we think with some re-alignment of community resources, it can work really well as Trakt’s primary TV data source.</p><p id="4e87">What it really boils down to is a moral opposition to taking in data from a community and then trying to sell it back to them. We believe when a user contributes to an online data source, they mean for that work to be shared with everyone around them. Both TMDB and Trakt have open and free APIs for developers to build upon that hard work.</p><p id="fded">TVDB is enforcing a commercial paid model to get access to their community moderated data. The first option is a commercial agreement with an app directly, but we’ve heard TVDB is asking for unrealistic licensing fees compared to an app’s revenue. The second option is charging users directly to access TVDB data. That doesn’t really work either, since that means an app is dependent on users paying a 3rd party service to work.</p><ol><li id="938a">New TV shows are imported using TMDB as their data source <em>(all new shows since November 2020 already use TMDB)</em></li><li id="5713">When we do nightly data refreshes, we compare TMDB with TVDB to determine if the seasons and episodes match up. <em>(we’ve gathered data on over 20,000 shows since November 2020)</em></li><li id="9fe3">We created a <a href="https://trakt.tv/transition/tmdb/updates" rel="noopener"><strong>comparison page</strong></a> for TMDB and TVDB data. This helps determine what data is missing or needs to be updated at TMDB.</li><li id="70cd">If shows 100% match up, we will automatically change to TMDB as the data source. We’re also working on tools to help Trakt users verify and indicate a show can be switched to TMDB. <em>(this will happen soon)</em></li></ol><p id="ac2a">Many of you help moderate TVDB and TMDB, and we can’t thank you enough for doing that! It helps Trakt and the thousands of other apps that use metadata from both sources.</p><p id="e53b">We need your help to ensure TMDB data is complete and ready for the transition. This means keeping TV shows updated with new episodes as they air and backfilling old shows with incomplete seasons and episodes.</p><blockquote><p id="474d">Please read the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/bible" rel="noopener"><strong>TMDB Contribution Bible</strong></a> and follow all the rules for contributing data. Our goal isn’t to simply replicate TVDB data over, but rather update TMDB using their rules and standards. Some Trakt TV shows will need to be manually adjusted to match TMDB, we can handle that in <a href="https://support.trakt.tv/" rel="noopener"><strong>Trakt support</strong></a>.</p></blockquote><p id="06e6">The <a href="https://trakt.tv/transition/tmdb/updates" rel="noopener"><strong>comparison page</strong></a><strong> </strong>helps visualize TMDB and TVDB data to determine what is missing or different. Green rows indicate a 100% match of the episode count, air dates, and titles. Blue rows indicate the episode count matches, but there might be differences in air date or title. Red rows indicate the episode count doesn't match. Click the + to expand a season to see individual episode info. All of these are linked to TMDB and TVDB as well, so you can quickly jump to those databases.</p></div></div><div><div><p id="4dc0">Thanks again for all your help with the TMDB transition and moderating data over there. We really appreciate it!</p><p id="86ec">— Trakt</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this session, we’ll take a look at some of the ways we can determine whether the development efforts we’re undertaking suffer from too much or too little focus on architecture. We’ll examine a number of real-world examples that are intended to inspire either admiration or terror, and try to find some recipes of how we can get more of the former and less of the latter in our own projects.</p>

<h2>Definitions of Architecture</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/cm/">ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://handbookofsoftwarearchitecture.com/">Grady Booch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by <em>cost of change</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stefan Tilkov:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the architect considers important enough to merit their attention</p>

<p><em>Different organizations and applications will require different architectures, and those architectures will change over time</em></p>
<h2>Cases:</h2>
<h3>#1 Non-Extensible Extensibility</h3>
<p>Highly customizable multi-tenant e-commerce solution with lots of features, which has to balance between large customers with specific needs and small customers with generic needs</p>
<ul>
<li>If you attempt to design something that satisfies everybody, you will satisfy nobody.</li>
<li>Highly specific is often preferable to generic</li>
</ul>
<h3>#2 Perilously fine-grained</h3>
<p>Large-scale B2B food retailer building a new logistics system, hired &gt;200 developers to build a microservice-based system. Each developer “owned”
a microservice, which was hell to scale. Eventually moved away from ‘EntityService’ pattern</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody wants to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ3wIuvmHeM">Netflix</a> but nobody is</li>
<li>Small is not always beautiful</li>
<li>Refactoring within team boundaries much easier than globally</li>
<li>Ignore organizational parameters at your own risk</li>
</ul>
<h3>#3 Your system WILL be dynamic</h3>
<p>Large-scale insurance system with &gt;100 developers. 2 releases / year with 2-week modeling period  What if you miss this slot?</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized responsibility hurts</li>
<li>Faces with too much rigidity, a way around the rules will be found</li>
<li>Just because you’re used to it doesn’t make it acceptable</li>
</ul>
<h3>#4 Free-style Architecture</h3>
<p>A small E-Commerce / Online shop which grew fast to 100-120 developers over ~10 self-contained teams</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid increasing the numbers of developers if you can</li>
<li>Move to system of systems</li>
<li>If you don’t actively create an architecture, be prepared to deal with the one that emerges.</li>
<li>Loose coupling requires very few rules, but they need to be enforced strictly</li>
</ul>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<h3>#5 Cancerous Growth</h3>
<p>Financial services provider with independent brokers as clients, 20 years of company history. Spun off new company and just copied system and then <em>shared the database</em>. Also implemented own encryption in Borland C++ and noticed bug after encryption own database</p>
<ul>
<li>Successful systems often end up with the worst architecture</li>
<li>Unmanaged evolution will lead to complete chaos</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid of some light architectural governance</li>
</ul>
<h3>#6 Improve with less intelligence</h3>
<p>Bank with multiple CotS systems, phased out proprietary solution to replace with OSS. Replaced “Magical Integration Broker” with much more simple dockerized pubsub solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Smart endpoints, dumb pipes</a> AKA never put too much logic or intelligence into infrastructure</li>
<li>Valuespecific over generic solutions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li>Don’t be afraid of architecture</li>
<li>Choose the simplest thing that will work</li>
<li>Create evolvable structures</li>
<li>Manage your system’s architectural evolution</li>
<li>Don’t create road blocks - create value and get out of the way</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p>Consistently ranked as one of the leading causes of death around the world, malaria doesnâ€™t have an effective vaccine yet. But researchers have invented a promising new blueprint for one â€” with properties akin to the novel RNA-based vaccine for COVID-19.</p><p>Making a vaccine for malaria is challenging because its associated parasite, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Plasmodium-protozoan-genus"><em>Plasmodium</em></a><em>,</em> contains a protein that inhibits production of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/memory-t-cell">memory T-cells</a>, which protect against previously encountered pathogens. If the body canâ€™t generate these cells, a vaccine is ineffective. But scientists recently tried a new approach using an RNA-based platform.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Their design circumvented the sneaky protein, allowed the body to produce the needed T-cells and completely immunized against malaria. The patent application for their novel vaccine, which hasn't yet been tested on humans, was <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20210030859.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20210030859&amp;RS=DN/20210030859">published</a> by the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office on Feb. 4.</p><p>â€œIt's probably the highest level of protection that has been seen in a mouse model,â€� said Richard Bucala, co-inventor of the new vaccine and a physician and professor at Yale School of Medicine.</p><p>The teamâ€™s breakthrough could save hundreds of thousands of lives, particularly in developing nations. <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria">In 2019 alone</a>, there were an estimated 229 million cases of malaria and 409,000 deaths worldwide. Of those deaths, 94% were in Africa, with children being the most vulnerable.</p><p>â€œIt affects societies and populations that have the least amount of resources and expertise to manage these infections well," Bucala told <em>The Academic Times</em>. "We need new vaccines, and we need more tools."</p><p>Novartis Pharmaceuticals and the National Institutes of Health funded the work. GlaxoSmithKline is an assignee on the patent, which if approved, will allow the company to produce the vaccine and make it available to the public.</p><p>At present, the only vaccine to prevent malaria is called <a href="https://www.malariavaccine.org/sites/www.malariavaccine.org/files/content/page/files/PATH_MVI_RTSS_Fact%20sheet_042019.pdf">RTS,S</a>. Approved two years ago, this vaccine is the result of nearly two decades of research, but is only about 30% effective. And after four years, that figure drops to 15%.</p><p>â€œIt doesn't work very well,â€� Bucala said. â€œAnd the research studies all have the conclusion that the people who fail to mount a vaccine response, or who get reinfected, have poor memory T-cell responses.â€�</p><p>Along with Andrew Geall, a pharmaceutical researcher who developed the RNA platform that the duo used, Bucala found a way to prevent the unwanted protein in <em>Plasmodium</em>, called <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17158894/">PMIF</a>, from inhibiting T-cell generation.Â&nbsp;</p><p>â€œOur research studies indicate that it was this particular gene product, PMIF, that was responsible for this,â€� Bucala said. â€œIt prevented memory T-cells from forming, and that's why one could not generate a memory response to <em>Plasmodium</em>.â€�</p><p>In a conventional vaccine, for instance the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm">standard flu vaccine</a>, an inactivated version of the virus is injected into a host. The body recognizes an intruder, fights against it, generates antibodies against the harmless virus, then returns back to normal.Â&nbsp;</p><p>However, once the virus has left the host, the body needs a way to remember how it fought back. Otherwise it will have to relearn the antibody generation â€” but perhaps next time with the actual, harmful virus infecting the host all the while. This is where memory T-cells come in: They remember how to generate the immune response and remind the body when the time comes. <em>PlasmodiumÂ&nbsp;</em>prevents the immune memory system from occurring by producing PMIF.</p><p>â€œSuppressing the T-cell response and immune memory is so important to the parasite that the parasite brings its own gene, PMIF, to do that,â€� Bucala said. â€œIf you eliminate that factor, the body naturally develops memory immunity.â€�</p><p>The concept of the novel malaria vaccine accounts for the PMIF problem. Instead of injecting the actual pathogen, the vaccine presents the body with instructions, via RNA, on how to create the protein unique to the pathogen by itself in order to fight it â€” which is precisely how Pfizerâ€™s COVID-19 vaccine works.</p><p>However, rather than an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html">mRNA platform</a>, Bucala and Geall use a self-amplifying <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7474593/">saRNA</a> platform. The key benefit of the latter is that it is effective at much lower doses because it can rapidly produce copies of itself inside the cell.Â&nbsp;</p><p>â€œFor saRNA, one can potentially make a million doses of vaccine with a couple liters of synthetic production,â€� Bucala said. â€œIt's much more efficient than the base-protected mRNA vaccines.â€�</p><p>The proposed saRNA vaccine tells the body to create the troublesome PMIF protein, generates antibodies against it and naturally produces the necessary memory T-cells, as Bucala had hoped.</p><p>â€œWe thought we could combine RTS,S with a PMIF vaccine, but the mouse studies seem to suggest that just immunizing with PMIF is sufficient,â€� Bucala highlighted.Â&nbsp;â€œThat's how striking the results were.â€�</p><p>Bucala and Geall have placed their vaccine in the hands of the Oxford University institution that facilitated the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55302595">AstraZeneca</a> COVID-19 vaccine. It is one of the only places in the world that is doing phase 1 studies in malaria, meaning researchers infect human volunteers with the disease after immunizing them.</p><p>â€œThis is not in humans yet," Bucala noted, â€œbut they are the group that can put it into humans, I think, best. We are doing those studies this year."</p><p>Beyond the saRNA technology's use for the malaria vaccine, Bucala believes it is an ideal method for immunization design in the future, including for COVID-19 prevention, because of its dual low cost and high yield. He says it could reach far and wide.Â&nbsp;</p><p>â€œThe current mRNA approach is an important step in that direction,â€� he said. â€œBut we are going to, I believe, need to do better. I hope that the saRNA opens that platform.â€�</p><p><em>The application for the patent, Uses Of Parasite Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factors, was filed on Oct. 16, 2020 to the U.S. Patent Trademark Office with the application number 17/073006. The inventors of the pending patent are Richard Bucala, Yale School of Medicine and Andrew Geall, Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

<p>I had a fun time giving a Z3 tutorial at Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer (FMIE) <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/">https://fmie2021.github.io/</a> (videos coming soon hopefully!). I got to be kind of the "fun dad" with the Z3 tutorial <a href="https://github.com/philzook58/z3_tutorial">https://github.com/philzook58/z3_tutorial</a> , while at times it felt a bit like Cody's Coq tutorial <a href="https://github.com/codyroux/broad-coq-tutorial">https://github.com/codyroux/broad-coq-tutorial</a> was trying to feed the kids their vegetables. It was a fantastic tutorial (maybe the best I've seen?), but it was tough love. He knew it was going to be like this from the outset and had a fun little analogy of me downhill skiing while he was about to go on an uphill mountaineering slog.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors to lead to this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I could use Z3’s python bindings giving an air of familiarity, whereas everything was incredibly foreign in Coq.</li>
  <li>Z3 can actually be used to declaratively state problems and pushbutton calculate solutions to them with very little user help, which gives it a lot more "Wow" factor.</li>
  <li>Coq is a tool that requires significantly more background to even comprehend what the hell it is. I still think many aspects of it are totally bizarre. But Coq users, this is just the water they swim in. For example, defining an inductive predicate as a datatype is still a bizarre notion to me, but it is Coq 101. I say this to Coq users and they look at me like I’m nuts. “What could even be the problem?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, a fun exercise for me was to take the examples from my tutorial and try to translate them into Coq. For the most part I think it isn't that hard and rather educational.</p>
<p>It's interesting the things that show up. Because the Z3 tutorial was designed for automation, the more automated tactics in MicroOmega and Ring are super useful. </p>
<p><a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/micromega.html">https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/micromega.html</a></p>
<p>
The thing is that the sort of proofs that show up here are fine and all, but they aren't going to teach you to fish for yourself. When you step out of this super automatable fragment you're sunk if you don't know other techniques, like the ones Cody was teaching. There may be a better balance of fun and education to be found.</p>
<p>I think there is a hole in the educational content out there on Coq. Software Foundations focuses on the rudiments, CPDT and FRAP kind of takes it a little hardcore, and the Mathematical Components stuff makes you buy in on ssreflect style and some hardcore math topics, both of which are nuts I have not cracked. Also, all of them are really long and initimidating. Seems like there should be something a little more breezy, a little more automatic. It is demoralizing as a beginner to either not know how to prove obvious trivial facts, or even to struggle to do so at great length.</p>
<p>This was also a nice opportunity to take Alectryon by Clément Pit-Claudel out for a spin <a href="https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon">https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon</a> Alectryon allows you to see the proof state on hover over in your browser. It's a super important part of the Coq. It was pretty easy to put in my blog. Just copy and paste the gnarly html output into a Jekyll post and make sure to link in the CSS files in an assets folder, because they are where the magic happens.</p>
<p>The gist for this post is here <a href="https://gist.github.com/philzook58/acd204b4895c41f9e85618f0f6b30a58">https://gist.github.com/philzook58/acd204b4895c41f9e85618f0f6b30a58</a></p>

<p>The very first problem in the tutorial was</p>
<pre><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span><span><span>(** python</span>
<span>x = Int('x')</span>
<span>y = Int('y')</span>
<span>solve(x &gt; 2, y &lt; 10, x + 2*y == 7)</span>
<span>*)</span></span></span></pre><p>which Z3 returns the solution [y = 0, x = 7].</p>
<p>It isn't so obvious how to get coq to find this solution in a low effort way. However, it is easy to get Coq to confirm the validity of this solution given that you know about the [lia] tactic. Otherwise it may be kind of annoying. In general, it may be a good approach to use external tools to produce solutions and just manually place the solutions into Coq. Validating a solution is often easier than producing it.</p>

                    <p>Something interesting is underway. </p><p>Over the past month, <a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/">NBA Top Shot</a>, a digital collectable similar to a basketball card has exploded in interest and in price. My friend Michael Batnick just wrote a great post about d<a href="https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/02/23/im-in-the-mania/">iving into the mania head first</a>. With Top Shot, instead of a physical card you get a digital one, or a moment - a video clip that is unique. In turn it has ushered in excited about the cryptoasset powering Top Shot, &nbsp;Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT's).</p><p>NFT's are are unique items that live on the blockchain. They can be intangible or tangible. They can embed smart contracts and different other forms of licensing and business logic as well. I call it the "internet of cool shit", but others have called it the "internet of value", "internet of art", or the "internet of collectibles". I personally think this is the killer app for crypto. This post is not a tutorial in NFT's however, but you can find a great one <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="the-format-is-shifting">The Format is Shifting</h2><p>Instead, this post is about NBA Top Shot. Its success is what has turned on the lightbulbs in people's heads. &nbsp;It's the first true mainstream validated application. I know some will yell at me about a Bitcoin ATM, the Venezuelan economy, Coinbase, Cryptokitties, or the slew of other applications that feel mainstream. NBA Top Shot is different. It's the first time I've seen a true format replacement underway. </p><figure><img src="https://www.justinpaterno.com/content/images/2021/02/shb1cutr.png" alt=""><figcaption>NBA Top Shot since October</figcaption></figure><p>Top Shot has been so successful that it is starting to affect the price of cardboard.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>All things are connected.</p><p>I believe Top Shot's surge in Late January contributed to dip in NBA average player card market &amp; Baseball cards' explosion slowing down.</p><p>Now imagine what happens in the hobby when Top Shot withdrawals are opened up and ppl w 12x returns can spend it??</p></div>— The Breaks (@WatchTheBreaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/WatchTheBreaks/status/1363034024818536448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This person (and others) think it will reverse, and at some point it will reach an equilibrium, and they're right. But it's not just a simple bubble, it's something else. In fact, if you know anything about the card market, you know people are sitting on tons of unopened "wax" which is the equivalent of an oil well or a gold mine. They sit on the wax for years, mine out the top players and rare inserts over time and then sell them to high end collectors. This might imply that we may be seeing something of a short squeeze happening - where those in the business of collecting are short a new format and will have to sell the old format and buy the new one, which then feeds on itself.</p><h2 id="formats-are-fungible">Formats are Fungible</h2><p>This format trade is what is interesting about Collectibles are all about scarcity and what everyone else as sees as valuable. The biggest maker of basketball cards, Panini, has implicitly released sets of cards under different sub-sets tied to price and scarcity - Obsidian, Immaculate, Prizm, Hoops. If given two 1/1 cards of the same player on both subsets, the more "premium" subset card is will certainly be worth more than the more "retail" one. Both are just a single, scarce, 1/1 card for one player and both are just cardboard. The difference in price is that people believe that they are more than just cardboard, a player, and the only card in existence. If they didn't then they would be fungible in the first place. What is fungible is the paper they are printed on. Formats are fungible. Unprinted cardboard can be replaced by unprinted cardboard. Ethereum can be replaced by Ethereum. Someone could come out with the hottest and better newer Top Shot tomorrow and steal some of the thunder, or completely take it away. </p><h2 id="format-replacement-cycles-are-reflexive-feedback-loops">Format Replacement Cycles are Reflexive Feedback Loops</h2><p>Unlike arguments whether a player is good or a card is truly scarce, formats replacement cycles are technology installation cycles and are feedback loops. </p><p>Anyone who's collected music over the years understands this phenomenon when a new format would come out. You have a bunch of cassette tapes and the CD player comes out. A few people buy them at high prices, and start buying CD's. The price of the player comes down and people buy more players and more CD's. They start coming standard in cars, &nbsp;your record shop stops carrying as much selection, so people buy more CD's, and the player cost comes down further. Then they replace the Walkman with the Discman, and bands stop releasing on cassette and you eventually people have replaced their tape collection entirely with CD's, and then some. &nbsp;In this case every technological advancement installs a player, which then moves the CD market forward, which then installs more players in more places, and so forth.</p><p>If a new format starts to become the preferred way to collect something that is scarce, a special self-referential feedback loop emerges called reflexivity. Reflexivity is the process by which price begins to change fundamentals. The higher the price, the more the fundamentals become appealing, which increases the price and so on and vice versa. With cards - the more the digital format becomes preferred to the cardboard format, the the price of digital cards goes up and the price of cardboard goes down. The rising and falling prices make each one more and less desirable, affecting the price and demand further.</p><p>Right now the industry is starting to wake up to the fact that they need to start replacing their collection. It doesn't mean cardboard is going to be worthless, and Top Shot is going to the moon. Collectors will collect, both will have value, but Top Shots gains will come partly from Cardboards fall. This may be even exaggerated by the fact that people in the cardboard business may now need to get into the digital cardboard business and have to sell cardboard to buy digital. We're witnessing a new format for a relatively mainstream application begin to get installed and it's fascinating to watch. </p>

<p>The goal of this article is to explore the topic of the camera response function experimentally. We’ll build
up from first principles and the main focus will be on building intuition with code examples. The only pre-requisite is base
familiarity with Python + NumPy and, of course, curiosity about the topic. 🧑‍🚀</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a quick way to find out the response function of your camera, you can check out the
implementation of <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d27/classcv_1_1CalibrateDebevec.html">CalibrateDebevec</a> in OpenCV, or stick around to get a deeper intuition.</p>
<p>I’ve made an effort to link to interesting resources that provide a good starting point to dig deeper into specific directions
that could not be covered in this article. You’re encouraged to follow them and come back to this at your own pace.</p>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>You can follow along and play with the code examples. The Jupyter notebook is <a href="https://github.com/martomi/roboalgorithms-code/blob/main/notebooks/camera-response-function.ipynb">available on
Github</a>. 📔</p>

</div>

<h2 id="what-the-crf-">What the CRF? 🤔</h2>
<p>A camera measures the light intensity hitting the imaging sensor and outputs an image with pixel values that in some way
correspond to that light intensity. This correspondence is modeled by the camera response function (CRF).</p>
<p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/crf-animation.gif#center" alt="Camera Response Function Animation"></p>
<p>For a computer vision engineer, the pixel values are the only observation of the real-world. Thus, it is helpful to understand
how they relate to actual light intensities to correctly model that world.</p>
<p>Most cameras have some non-linearity in their response to light intensities. Images taken by consumer-grade cameras are particularly
affected by this because they are optimized for viewing experience and not for measurement accuracy.</p>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>If we know the response function, we can resolve that ambiguity and turn any camera
into a scientific measurement device! 🔬</p>
</div>

<h2 id="applications-of-the-crf-">Applications of the CRF 🔨</h2>
<p>Many computer vision algorithms that rely on the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~16385/s17/Slides/14.1_Brightness_Constancy.pdf">brightness constancy
assumption</a> require accurate estimation of the
CRF. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow">optical flow</a> or any direct method for visual SLAM that
works with pixel intensities such as <a href="https://vision.in.tum.de/research/vslam/dso">DSO</a>.</p>
<p>Direct methods for visual SLAM are currently one of the most robust approaches for accurate robot localization in
challenging environments where GNSS coverage is unreliable. An autonomous last-mile robot delivery service is an example that’s
increasingly gaining <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-fedex-delivery-robots-your-sidewalk/">commercial traction</a> in recent years
and may use such technology.</p>
<p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/delivery-robot.png#center" alt="Delivery Robot"></p>
<div>
  <p>💡</p>
  <p>One could argue that due to the shift towards deep learning approaches and more readily available cameras that are optimized
for machine vision, it will be unnecessary to manually calibrate for the camera response function in the future. Nevertheless, I still
see value in exploring the fundamentals for learning purposes.</p>
</div>

<p>In this article, we’ll look at the application of generating <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/papers/debevec-malik97.pdf">HDR images</a> which
also relies on knowledge about the camera response function because we need to “fuse” multiple images taken at different exposure times.</p>

<p>A camera is an array of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode">photodiodes</a> that converts incoming
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">photons</a> into electrical current or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage">voltage</a>. This phenomenon is known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">photoelectric effect</a> and is the
same phenomenon utilized in solar panels.</p>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>We measure the voltage to determine the amount of incident light.</p>
</div>

<p>For each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active-pixel_sensor#Pixel">pixel</a>, there’s a corresponding photodiode in the
camera sensor. We take an image by exposing the sensor to light for a given period (exposure time). Since the
photodiodes produce an electrical current proportional to the amount of light they receive, we can use that measurement to
reconstruct the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/photodiode-to-image.png#center" alt="Photodiode to Image"></p>
<h2 id="converting-voltages-to-pixel-values--">Converting voltages to pixel values  📺</h2>
<p>When we measure the voltage generated by the photodiode we get an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal">analog</a>
quantity. But we need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal">digital</a> value that fits into our pixel
representation of 8 bits. A device that can perform this conversion is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">Analog-Digital (A/D)
converter</a>. Most A/D converters used in cameras today will output
an 8, 12, or 16-bit digital value.</p>
<h3 id="analog-to-digital-converter-">Analog-to-Digital Converter 📈</h3>
<p>We will start with an 8-bit A/D converter. Note that regardless of the bit depth, the range of possible values will be limited in
the digital domain. Meaning that with 8-bit we only have <span>
  \(2^{8} = 256\)
</span>
, unique values to assign to all possible voltage
measurements.</p>
<p>Let’s simulate a naive A/D converter:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>max_value</span>(bit_depth: int) <span>-&gt;</span> int:
    <span>"""Return max integer value for the specified bit depth"""</span>

</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/adc-example.png" alt="A/D Converter Output"></p>
<h4 id="quantization-noise">Quantization noise</h4>
<p>From the staircase-like plot above we can see the discrete jumps caused by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)">quantization</a> effects. Because we’re losing some precision at this step, this effect also becomes a component of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise">total image noise</a> known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise#Quantization_noise_(uniform_noise)">quantization noise</a>.</p>
<h4 id="under--and-overexposure">Under- and overexposure</h4>
<p>The plot also demonstrates that any values below or above the supported range are irreversibly lost. This phenomenon is known as under- or overexposure.
Our goal will always be to choose the exposure time such that this effect is minimized.</p>
<h4 id="dynamic-range">Dynamic Range</h4>
<p>The range of light intensities that the camera can capture without under- or overexposure is called the camera dynamic range. It is a very important
metric for outdoor robot operation due to the large variations in light intensities.</p>
<div>
  <p>💡</p>
  <p>Curiously, extending the dynamic range of the camera isn’t as simple as increasing the bit-depth of the A/D converter. The primary limiting factor is usually linked to the physical <a href="https://hamamatsu.magnet.fsu.edu/articles/dynamicrange.html">full-well capacity and noise level</a> of the photodiodes. The bit-depth of the A/D converter is then selected to maximize that.</p>
</div>

<p>So our goal is to maximize the information we can get from every image. We have two ways to optimize for that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a camera with a higher dynamic range</li>
<li>Adjust the exposure time to minimize over- and underexposure</li>
</ol>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>For very dimly lit scenarios, it is not always an option to adjust the exposure time because a very long exposure time can cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur">motion blur</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="programmable-gain-amplifier-">Programmable Gain Amplifier ⬛</h3>
<p>Underexposure happens for dimly lit scenes or shorter exposure times when the photodiodes don’t have a chance to convert a sufficient amount of photons into electrical current. This is how a fully underexposed image looks:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="py">photodiode_array_milivolts <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array([<span>0.028</span>, <span>0.213</span>, <span>0.234</span>, <span>0.459</span>])

util<span>.</span>display_images([pixel_values], titles<span>=</span>[<span>"Underexposed image"</span>])
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/underexposed-image.png#center" alt="Underexposed Image"></p>
<p>Cameras have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable-gain_amplifier">programmable-gain amplifier</a> (PGA) that can amplify the voltages from the photodiodes and bring them in the range supported by the A/D converter. The level of amplification can be configured on most cameras through the ISO setting.</p>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>We can capture images in the dark without increasing the exposure time as much.</p>
</div>

<div><pre><code data-lang="py"><span>def</span> <span>pga</span>(milivolts: np<span>.</span>ndarray, gain: float <span>=</span> <span>1.0</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> float:
    <span>"""Naive programmable-gain amplifier
</span><span>    
</span><span>    milivolts  -- input voltage from photodiode
</span><span>    gain       -- ratio output / input
</span><span>    """</span>
    <span>return</span> gain <span>*</span> milivolts

<span># Add an amplifier to the same example values from above</span>
pixel_values <span>=</span> adc(pga(photodiode_array_milivolts, gain<span>=</span><span>300.0</span>))
util<span>.</span>display_images([pixel_values], titles<span>=</span>[<span>"Amplified image"</span>])
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/amplified-image.png#center" alt="Amplified Image"></p>
<p>There’s a caveat: we did not model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise">image noise</a>. The weaker signal in dimply lit scenes results in a lower <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio">signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)</a>. In other words, amplifying the signal will also amplify the noise and that’s why using a higher gain usually results in grainier and lower quality images. In extreme cases when the strength of the signal is below the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_floor">noise floor</a> it can be difficult to extract <em>any</em> useful information.</p>
<p>Reducing the image noise can be performed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing">digital image processing</a> pipeline which is the final step before saving the image. This part significantly differs between camera models and may include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_balance">white balance</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping">tone mapping</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction">gamma encoding</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_compression">image compression</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_image_pipeline">more</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <article>
      
<p>You encounter a crusty old-timer who tells you how great programming
used to be: the computer just did what you told it.  Languages were
simple and easy to understand. In awe, you ask: “Did you write FORTRAN?
or assembly?” The old-timer laughs: he’s not <em>that</em> old. He started with
C!</p>
<p>It’s common to think of C and other “old” languages as being “close to
the machine,” but that’s because the Unix abstractions have become so
ubiquitous that we no longer think of them as abstractions.  They feel
natural, and they don’t leak until you need to do a lot of math or
figure out why your program is so slow.</p>
<p>Magic is different. It <em>feels</em> different. When you encounter something
magical, it may work, but you aren’t sure why. Worse, you can’t trust
it. A hallmark of magical frameworks is being slightly “wrong:” you need
to specify that you are expecting a <code>Token</code> prefix in the
<code>Authorization</code> header, but the <code>@Authorized</code> annotation only lets you
check for a <code>Bearer</code> token and where <em>are</em> those classes, anyway?</p>
<p>A successful abstraction is presented as a set of tools. There may need
to be escape hatches, and a good abstraction includes semantics around
them that, if not elegant, are at least usable. The places where “leaks”
occur are signposted.</p>
<p>Magic, on the other hand, is presented as certainty. It isn’t a set of
tools, but a holistic solution. Any escape is going to involve dark
arts.</p>
<p>Abstractions don’t spring from nothing. They require a well-understood
domain, and successful ones are often narrow because of that. The more
detail and edge cases that must be dealt with, the more complicated an
abstraction must be to deal with them.</p>
<p>When I’m writing code, I try to consider whether I’m solving the problem
at hand or trying to solve <em>the problem of solving the problem.</em> I think
the latter is a hallmark of magical approaches: “I have a perfect
understanding of what’s necessary to solve this class of problem. I’ll
make it Really Easy and nobody will have to think about it again.”</p>
<p>That’s not what happens, though, is it? If you give in to the
temptation, you’ll write something that obscures rather than revealing
intent. Your successors (including your future self) will curse you. If
I find myself slipping into that mentality, I back up and think:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the “nouns” of this problem?</li>
<li>What are the “verbs?”</li>
<li>How can I present a “sentence” that makes my intent clear?</li>
</ol>
<p>Next month, there may be a noun I overlooked that needs to be handled.
There may be a new operation that needs to be implemented. It’s very
unlikely that the thousand lines I wrote to “solve the problem in five
lines of code” will bend to fit as easily as a module, a couple of
types, and a half-dozen functions will.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Furries are notorious. Among purveyors of cringe, saying, "Furries, amirite?" is like Jerry Seinfeld mentioning air travel. Furries aren't the punchline, they're a whole category of joke! Nature is red in tooth and claw, never more so than when jaded internet denizens recollect that Tony the Tiger is, to some, a hottie.</p><p>(No, seriously. Legend has it that the official Tony the Twitter account had to be shut down because furries kept offering, uh, uncomfortably positive brand feedback. Apparently the NPS boost wasn't worth it.)</p><p>Okay but like, what <em>are</em> furries, who counts? Fear not —&nbsp;in these modern times, a venerable brand such as Merriam-Webster considers itself savvy enough to compete with the likes of Urban Dictionary and Know Your Meme. And, tbh, did a decent job <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/history-of-furry-and-fursona">covering the basics</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A rising usage of <em>furry</em> refers to people who have a keen interest in, or even dress up as, anthropomorphic animal characters, like those often seen in comics, games, and cartoons. The personalized animal identity of a furry is known as their <em>fursona</em>, the portmanteau of <em>furry</em> and <em>persona</em>. <em>Fursonas</em> can exist as costumes, online avatars, or even full lifestyles.</p></blockquote><p>Essentially, furry is all about playing pretend. Newsflash, it's fun to be silly and make up stories! A wolf with amethyst eyes <em>would</em> be awesome, that's why they keep putting them on those sick shirts.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with furries, you might think the hobby sounds harmless, if perhaps a bit childish, and you'd be right. But you'd also be underestimating how ridiculously — how <em>effervescently</em>, and sometimes tumescently — over-the-top furries can be. Furries go hard for what we enjoy. By my way of thinking, the unabashed passion in face of constant ridicule is exemplary.</p><p>Because yeah, if you're not a kid and you roleplay as a fantasy animal version of yourself, people will make fun of you. FYI.</p><p>My headline asks, are furries freaks? Contra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines">Betteridge</a>, the answer is yes (and I'll get into why, don't you worry). Oddballs have a way of rolling into corners together. When it comes to furries, our insistence on aberrance has made us infamous, at least if you're sufficiently immersed in certain ecosystems of digital degeneracy.</p><p>Let's back up for a second. Allow me to introduce myself — nice to meet you, I'm a cartoon rabbit. Bunsonya looks like this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c478d9-8466-4dc8-8868-eb8d8bb0bd1f_800x1173.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c478d9-8466-4dc8-8868-eb8d8bb0bd1f_800x1173.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56c478d9-8466-4dc8-8868-eb8d8bb0bd1f_800x1173.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1173,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:107061,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>(Portrait by <a href="https://twitter.com/PastellBits">@PastellBits</a>.)</p><p>Mike asked me to explain what the heck is going on with furries after he was swarmed by communists with critter avatars. I've forgotten how he evoked such revilement, but presumably it comes with the territory when you're a Very Online™ billionaire. Surely Elon Musk has attracted his share of furry ire! Among other quirks, furries lean <em>heavily </em>left politically.</p><p>Before we get into that, I know what you're wondering: Is it a sex thing? That's always the first question. Furry <em>can</em> be a sex thing —&nbsp;is often a sex thing, I admit —&nbsp;but it doesn't strictly have to be. One's fursona can be a more involved version of one's <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Patronus_Charm">Patronus</a>, or what people indifferent to ~le cultural appropriation~ <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1314752483722313728">might call a spirit animal</a>.</p><p>Most fursonas are toonishly anthropomorphic, as demonstrated by Bunsonya above, but again that's not essential. The basic idea is that you have an animal alter-ego and socially abnormal enthusiasm for it.</p><p>As my Twitter mutual @Jebriel <a href="https://twitter.com/Jebriel/status/1360343188385501187">put it</a>, "I think this is just a lowkey form of dysphoria with extra steps." Not coincidentally, the furry community is chock-full of transgender and autistic people — two demographics that already form a Venn diagram. Homo- and bisexuality are also notably prevalent.</p><p>No one will judge you for keeping horny off main, especially given that furries want to welcome under-18 anthro enthusiasts as well as the adults. Neither are adherents required to wear a fursuit, which is what those team-mascot-looking costumes are called.</p><p>In fact, fursuits are expensive, routinely running thousands of dollars, and either out of reach or undesirable to many in the fandom. Those outfits are just as sweaty and itchy as you'd guess from looking at them, and fursuiters tend to wear a layer of Under Armour HeatGear (or similar) to protect both suit and skin.</p><p>The appeal is an altered mode of self-expression, both aesthetic and interpersonal. @Aryeh___ <a href="https://twitter.com/Aryeh___/status/1360699795266961410">pointed out</a> that fursuiting is "a helpful way for people who struggle in social situations (ASD spectrum, etc) to be boisterous, cuddly, and animalistic in the safety of a covering/mask."</p><p>Regarding "the fandom" — this is what the furry community tends to call itself, despite not being devoted to a specific media property. As you might guess, any halfway decent depiction of anthropomorphized critters is likely to be a hit with furries (the anime <em>Beastars</em> is a recent fave). And the community is teeming with original artists devoted to this subject. Yes, a great deal of it is porn.</p><p>To be abundantly clear, no one can deny that furries writ large are a lascivious bunch prone to unusual fetishes (though, as I mentioned above, valiant if ultimately quixotic attempts are made to shield the minority of kids and teenagers). Why is there a notable crossover between furry and inflation, or furry and oviposition? Because furries are perverts, duh. Our reputation nearly always precedes us.</p><p>However, furries are not <em>morally</em> depraved except by puritan busybody standards. Having sex while pretending that you are an animal is a different ball of wax from sexually assaulting an actual animal. One is fantasy play; one is a repugnant crime.</p><p>Zoosadists (people who aspire toward the latter) infiltrate the community for obvious reasons —&nbsp;furry porn can be a tittilating "second best" for those into irl bestiality. But whenever a zoosadist's proclivities are discovered, they are promptly called out, shunned, and reported to the relevant authorities to whatever extent possible.</p><p>So, anyway, about the communism. There's no slam-dunk, smoking-gun reason why furries are rabidly leftist, though demographics are a likely cause. An <a href="https://dogpatch.press/2018/07/17/furry-socialism/">article</a> on prominent furry news site Dogpatch Press chalks it up to the fandom's communitarian and DIY ethos, making sure to note: "If you're conservative, libertarian, or other, contributing good content outlasts natural disagreement among sub-fandom groups. It takes special effort to earn unwelcome."</p><p>To translate, if you're the kind of conservative or libertarian who doesn't push progressives' buttons and is generally on the quiet side about politics, you'll be fine. That said, not everyone gives a fuck about this; some furries are of the old-school hacker ethos in which your terrible ideology, whatever it may be, is irrelevant.</p><p>The article chastises alt-right furries — which, yes, are a thing — that George Orwell, indubitably, would say "Nazi Furs Fuck Off." Contemporary over-application of the term "Nazi" plays into this to some degree, but incredibly there are indeed Neo-Nazi furries, or at least people who lean into that LARP. However, at a furry con you are far more likely to encounter hammer-and-sickle insignias, to the extent that you could put it on a bingo card.</p><p>A key thing to understand is that furries constitute a fringe outcast community, mocked and ostracized by default. All groups of this sort are characterized by what I call "outlierness," a polite euphemism for being seriously strange. And traits cluster —&nbsp;for example, the gayness, transness, and autisticness of furries make it no surprise that many furries work in the tech industry. Those clustered traits become self-reinforcing stereotypes, forming cultural positive feedback loops.</p><p>If furries are startlingly often on the commie spectrum or somewhere near it, where does all the money for fursuits and porn come from? Dude, jobs. Again a comparison to the tech industry is apt —&nbsp;I'm sure you can think of a programmer pulling several $100k in salary alone who nonetheless cheers on the DSA, and I bet that a few have alts stanning for Mao on the low.</p><p>Not that most furries are rich; the wealthy among us happen to "take one for the team" in terms of funding the community's creative endeavors, and thus are more visible. They're also the people who can afford fursuits, assumed by uninformed normies to represent the entire fandom.</p><p>Hopefully you now have a passable understanding of What the Deal Is with Furries. Perhaps you're intrigued —&nbsp;if you'd like a fursona of your own, check out <a href="https://thisfursonadoesnotexist.com/">This Fursona Does Not Exist</a> and see what catches your fancy!</p><p>-Sonya Mann </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0066d83-7bdd-4746-ab56-7f0fcfcffef2_2746x1156.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0066d83-7bdd-4746-ab56-7f0fcfcffef2_2746x1156.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e0066d83-7bdd-4746-ab56-7f0fcfcffef2_2746x1156.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:613,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3960700,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This post was originally drafted in August 2018, but I never got around to finishing it. As such, parts of its framing (e.g. the focus on bindgen) are outdated, given the relative infancy of the interop space at the time. I was recently told that the post is still useful in this form so I decided to finish and publish it anyway, while attempting to mark outdated things as such when I notice them. Everything after the allocators section was written near the time of publication.</em></p>

<p>In 2017 I worked on the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/">Stylo</a> project, uplifting Servo’s CSS engine (“style system”) into Firefox’s browser engine
(“Gecko”). This involved a <em>lot</em> of gnarly FFI between Servo’s Rust codebase and Firefox’s C++ codebase. There were a
lot of challenges in doing this, and I feel like it’s worth sharing things from our experiences.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in Rust integrations, you may find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9acx2zgx4Q">this talk by Katharina on Rust - C++ FFI</a>, and <a href="https://hsivonen.fi/modern-cpp-in-rust/">this blog post by Henri on integrating encoding-rs into Firefox</a> useful as well.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-this-post-for">Who is this post for?</h2>

<p>So, first off the bat, I’ll mention that when integrating Rust into a C++ codebase, you
want to <em>avoid</em> having integrations as tight as Stylo. Don’t do what we did; make your Rust
component mostly self-contained so that you just have to maintain something like ten FFI functions
for interacting with it. If this is possible to do, you should do it and your life will be <em>much</em> easier. Pick a clean API boundary, define a straightforward API, use cbindgen or bindgen if necessary without any tricks, and you should be good to go.</p>

<p>That said, sometimes you <em>have</em> to have gnarly integrations, and this blog post is for those use cases.
These techniques mostly use bindgen in their examples, however you can potentially use them with hand-rolled bindings or another tool as well. If you’re at this level of complexity, however, the potential for mistakes in the hand-rolled bindings is probably not worth it.</p>

<p><em>Note from 2021: <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> is probably a better tool for many of the use cases here, though many of the techniques still transfer.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-was-involved-in-stylos-ffi">What was involved in Stylo’s FFI?</h2>

<p>So, what made Stylo’s FFI so complicated?</p>

<p>It turns out that browsers are quite monolithic. You can split them into vaguely-defined components, but
these components are still tightly integrated. If you intend to replace a component, you may need to
make a jagged edge of an integration surface.</p>

<p>The style system is more self-contained than other parts, but it’s still quite tightly integrated.</p>

<p>The main job of a “style system” is to take the CSS rules and DOM tree, and run them through “the cascade”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
with an output of “computed styles” tagged on each node in the tree. So, for example, it will take a document like
the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;style </span><span>type=</span><span>"text/css"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>body</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>12px</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>div</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>2em</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>&lt;/style&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"foo"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and turn it into something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> has a <code>font-size</code> of <code>12px</code>, everything else is the default</li>
  <li>the <code>div</code> <code>#foo</code> has a computed <code>height</code> of <code>24px</code> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>, everything else is the default. It “inherits” the <code>font-size</code> from <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> as <code>12px</code></li>
</ul>

<p>From a code point of view, this means that Stylo takes in Gecko’s C++ DOM tree. It parses all the CSS,
and then runs the cascade on the tree. It stores computed styles on each element in a way that Gecko can read
very cheaply.</p>

<p>Style computation can involve some complex steps that require calling back into C++ code. Servo’s style system
is multithreaded, but Gecko is mostly designed to work off of a single main thread per process, so we need to
deal with this impedence mismatch.</p>

<p>Since the output of Stylo is C++-readable structs, Stylo needs to be able to read and write nontrivial C++
abstractions. Typical FFI involves passing values over a boundary, never to be seen again, however here we’re
dealing with persistent state that is accessed by both sides.</p>

<p>To sum up, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lots and lots of back-and-forth FFI</li>
  <li>Thread safety concerns</li>
  <li>Rust code regularly dealing with nontrivial C++ abstractions</li>
  <li>A need for nontrivial abstractions to be passed over FFI</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this conspires to make for some really complicated FFI code.</p>



<p>I’ll try to structure this so that the more broadly useful (and/or less gnarly) techniques come earlier in the post.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics-of-bindgen">The basics of bindgen</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/">Bindgen</a> is a tool that generates Rust bindings for structs and functions from the provided C or C++ header files. It’s often used for writing Rust bindings to existing C/C++ libraries, however it’s useful for integrations as well.</p>

<p>To use it for an integration, write a header file containing the functions your Rust code needs (referencing structs from other header files if necessary), and <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/command-line-usage.html">run bindgen on it</a>. For some codebases, doing this once and
checking in the generate file suffices, but if your C++ code is going to change a lot, <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/tutorial-1.html">run it as a build dependency instead</a>. Beware that this can adversely impact build times, since your Rust build now has a partial
C++ compilation step.</p>

<p>For large C++ codebases, pulling in a single header will likely pull in a <em>lot</em> of stuff. You should <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/allowlisting.html">allowlist</a>, <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/blocklisting.html">blocklist</a>, and/or mark things as <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/opaque.html">opaque</a> to reduce the amount of bindings generated. It’s best to go the allowlisting route — give bindgen an allowlisted list of functions / structs to generate bindings for, and it will transitively generate bindings for any dependencies they may have. Sometimes even this will end up generating a lot, it’s sometimes worth finding structs you’re not using and marking them as opaque so that their bindings aren’t necessary. Marking something as opaque replaces it with an array of the appropriate size and alignment, so from the Rust side it’s just some bits you don’t care about and can’t introspect further.</p>

<p>Bindgen <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/cpp.html"><em>does</em> support some C++ features</a> (you may need to pass <code>-x c++</code>). This is pretty good for generating bindings to e.g. templated structs. However, it’s not possible to support <em>all</em> C++ features here, so you may need to blocklist, opaqueify, or use intermediate types if you have some complicated C++ abstractions in the deps. You’ll typically get an error when generating bindings or when compiling the generated bindings, so don’t worry about this unless that happens.</p>

<p>Bindgen is <em>quite</em> configurable. Stylo has a <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/components/style/build_gecko.rs">script</a> that consumes a <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/ServoBindings.toml">large toml file</a> containing all of the configuration.</p>

<h2 id="cbindgen">cbindgen</h2>

<p>We don’t use <a href="https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen">cbindgen</a> in Stylo, but it’s used for Webrender. It does the inverse of what bindgen does: given a Rust crate, it generates C headers for its public <code>extern "C"</code> API. It’s also quite configurable.</p>

<h2 id="cxx">cxx</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> is the cool new hotness in 2021, which kind of approaches the problem from both sides, enabling you to write Rust bindings for C++ and C++ bindings for Rust. It’s definitely worth checking out, a lot of the things that are hard to make work with bindgen are trivial in cxx. For example, it automatically figures out what types need to be opaque, it automatically converts between <code>&amp;T</code> and <code>T*</code> across FFI, and it is overall more targeted for the use case of an FFI layer where Rust and C++ both call each other.</p>

<h2 id="bindgen-aided-c-calling-rust">Bindgen-aided C++ calling Rust</h2>

<p>So bindgen helps with creating things for Rust to call and manipulate, but not in the opposite direction. cbindgen can help here, but I’m not sure if it’s advisable to have <em>both</em> bindgen and cbindgen operating near each other on the same codebase.</p>

<p>In Stylo we use a bit of a hack for this. Firstly, all FFI functions defined in C++ that Rust calls are declared in <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/layout/style/ServoBindingList.h">one file</a>, and are all named <code>Gecko_*</code>. Bindgen supports regexes for things like allowlisting, so this naming scheme makes it easy to deal with.</p>

<p>We also declare the FFI functions defined in Rust that C++ calls in <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/layout/style/ServoBindingList.h">another file</a>, named <code>Servo_*</code>. They’re also all <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/ports/geckolib/glue.rs">defined in one place</a>.</p>

<p>However, there’s nothing ensuring that the signatures match! If we’re not careful, there may be mismatches, causing bad things to happen at link time or runtime. We use a small <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/ports/geckolib/tests/build.rs">autogenerated</a> <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/ports/geckolib/tests/servo_function_signatures.rs">unit test</a> to ensure the validity of the signatures.</p>

<p>This is especially important as we do things like type replacement, and we need tests to ensure that the rug isn’t pulled out from underneath us.</p>

<h2 id="type-replacing-for-fun-and-profit">Type replacing for fun and profit</h2>

<p>Using <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/blocklisting.html">blocklisting</a> in conjunction with the <code>--raw-line</code>/<code>raw_line()</code> flag, one can effectively ask bindgen to “replace” types. Blocklisting asks bindgen not to generate bindings for a type, however bindgen will continue to generate bindings <em>referring</em> to that type if necessary. (Unlike opaque types where bindgen generates an opaque binding for the type and uses it everywhere). <code>--raw-line</code> lets you request bindgen to add a line of raw rust code to the file, and such a line can potentially define or import a new version of the type you blocklisted. Effectively, this lets you replace types.</p>

<p>Bindgen generates unit tests ensuring that the layout of your structs is correct (run them!), so if you accidentally replace a type with something incompatible, you will get warnings at the struct level (functions may not warn).</p>

<p>There are various ways this can be used:</p>

<h3 id="safe-references-across-ffi">Safe references across FFI</h3>

<p><em>Note from 2021: <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">cxx</a> does this automatically</em></p>

<p>Calling into C++ (and accepting data from C++) is unsafe. However, there’s no reason we should have to worry about this more than we have to. For example, it would be nice if accessor FFI functions – functions which take a foreign object and return something from inside it –  could use lifetimes. It would be even nicer if nullability were represented on the FFI boundary so that you don’t miss null checks, and can assume non-nullness when the C++ API is okay with it.</p>

<p>In Stylo, we have lots of functions like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>RawGeckoNodeBorrowedOrNull</span> <span>Gecko_GetLastChild</span><span>(</span><span>RawGeckoNodeBorrowed</span> <span>node</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which bindgen translates to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>Gecko_GetLastChild</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>RawGeckoNode</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>RawGeckoNode</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>   
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using the <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/servo/components/style/build_gecko.rs">bindgen build script</a> on a provided <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819cd31a93fd50b7167979607371878c4d6f18e8/layout/style/ServoBindings.toml#648-671">list of borrow-able types</a>, we’ve told bindgen that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>FooBorrowedOrNull</code> is actually <code>Option&lt;&amp;Foo&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>FooBorrowed</code> is actually <code>&amp;Foo</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I watched <a href="http://old.law.columbia.edu/isoc/eben_moglen_freedom_in_the_cloud.ogv">the famous speech ‘Freedom in the Cloud’</a> of Eben Moglen in 2010 at the ISOC-NY. Again if I might add. That speech had a great influence on me. It was the first time that I realised that client-server infrastructure of the internet is a huge problem. This very infrastructure ensured that all the data were aggregated and used (or abused) by the ones that owned the servers. At the same time the clients were being deprived of power. And that with the accumulation of servers in a data centre and he virtualisation of the servers (cloud) these owners were getting even more powerful.</p>



<p>I wasn’t the only one that was influenced by this speech of Eben. It also marked the beginning of the development of <a href="https://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora social network</a>. As it happens some of the initial developers of Diaspora were present at that Friday night at ISOC-NY and it inspired them to build the Diaspora software.</p>



<p>A lot has changed the last eleven years, and I will get to that, but what hasn’t changed is the client-server infrastructure, the source of evil. If anything the power of ones that own the servers like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple and even Twitter has increased greatly in the last 10 years. And as a consequence the ones working on the client side have become even more powerless. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/edward-snowden">Snowden</a> (2013) and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cambridge-analytica-factbox/factbox-who-is-cambridge-analytica-and-what-did-it-do-idUSKBN1GW07F">Cambridge Analytica </a>(2016) are just a few examples that demonstrate that this abuse of the ‘architecture of the catastrophe’ took directions that we couldn’t have envisioned.</p>



<p>On the plus side since 2010 a lot of developments have started to halt this catastrophe. Some were more successful than other but it’s undeniable that if someone is looking for a free (as in freedom) alternative right now a lot more options are available than 10 years ago. Also these options seem to be sustainable and rather successful. The <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse">Fediverse</a> with Mastodon, Pleroma, PeerTube, Funkwhale, Pixelfed, Lemmy and others have made great progress since the introduction of the <a href="http://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a> protocol. <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> has made great progress with the introduction of advanced clients like Conversations, Movim and Gajim.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.freedombox.org/">Freedombox</a> hasn’t lived up to it’s expectations though. The development of Freedombox was initiated by Eben and allows to set up a simple private server in your home. The last time I checked even Diaspora was not supported by Freedombox making social networking with it impossible. Luckily other initiatives have taken flight such as <a href="https://yunohost.org/#/whatsyunohost">Yunohost</a>. They make it easy to self-host a server and install software for blog, chat, social networking, online storage and file sharing. Yunohost and others bring the dream of Eben closer of a peer-to-peer network instead of a client-server network.</p>



<p>Another noteworthy development is <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Scuttlebutt</a>, a client-based peer-to-peer application for encrypted social network. Just install the app on your PC or phone (<a href="https://www.manyver.se/">Manyverse</a>) and communicate directly with others that installed the app.</p>



<p>Or <a href="https://briarproject.org/">Briar</a>, a client for messaging that uses Bluetooth, WiFi and the Tor network to communicate. The need to host your own server has been replaced by simply installing an app that doesn’t rely on a central server. Even if the internet is down the information keeps flowing over WiFi and Bluetooth.</p>



<p>Although we still live in the catastrophe that Eben spoke about eleven years ago there are more possibilities to escape and it appears that more and more people are discovering this. With every scandal, every update of the term of service a wave of new users appears on the networks that I mentioned above and that’s something to be grateful about but it should also motivate us to keep fighting for a free (as in freedom) internet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><a href="https://writer.math.dev/">https://writer.math.dev</a></p>
<p>Welcome to Math Writer and thank you for visiting this page. Math Writer is a rich text web editor for math, utilising the power of MathJax and the featureful TinyMCE text editor. It allows you to enter markdown and math together and aims to be a convenient way to write digital math, particularly for your own websites, with pdf and html export options. It will always be free to use and I welcome suggestions, pull requests and bug reports.</p>
<h2>The Power of MathJax</h2>
<p>All math is entered and rendered in accordance with <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, the popular math rendering engine for the web. This means you can enter math either as AsciiMath or LaTex, however I prefer the former for most cases as it reads better in raw form (ultimately it is a personal preference). In addition, a set of handy keyboard shortcuts are included in this editor to aide with commonly used mathematical symbols.</p>
<h2>The Power of TinyMCE</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/">TinyMCE</a> is, by their own admission, the world's most customizable and flexible rich text editor. It provides powerful WYSIWYG functionality and ease of use. By combining TinyMCE with the power of MathJax, I was able to build (what I hope is) a high quality math editor.</p>
<h2>Markdown Works!</h2>
<p>Basic markdown commands like headers (#, ##, ...), italics (*), bold (**) and lists (*, -, 1., a., etc.) work in this editor. So you can think of it as a Markdown Editor with mathematical input.</p>
<h2>Who is the Audience?</h2>
<p>I built this editor for myself, but decided it might be worthwhile for others, hence hosting it online. It is most valuable to those who enter a lot of mathematical content for websites (using MathJax), as it exports nicely to HTML and provides a convenient workflow. It is also useful for those looking for a reasonable quality math editor, who are not yet tied in to LaTeX, MS Word or another option. I believe the editor hits the sweetpot of being able to write WYSIWYG formatted rich text, with the power of mathematical input from AsciiMath &amp; LaTeX, with one-click previews of rendered maths.</p>
<h2>Suggestions &amp; Pull Requests Welcome!</h2>
<p>I would be very happy for others to take this editor and customise it for themselves or morph it into something more. I would love to see AsciiMath become a standard for mathematical input (LaTeX is good too, but I am a big fan of AsciiMath being more readable in raw form), and perhaps this project will help push in that direction.</p>
<h2>Get started!</h2>
<p>To get started, simply navigate to <a href="https://writer.math.dev/">https://writer.math.dev</a>. There is a basic tutorial under the "Read Me" tab. If you like this editor, please do star it on <a href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna/math-writer">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>You can e-mail me at <a href="https://writer.math.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="1f7e6c7770743174777e71717e5f77706b727e7673317c7072">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> for any queries, suggestions or just a general chat. Thank you again for your time and I hope you enjoy this editor.</p>

February 27, 2021 | https://stu2b50.dev/posts/current-state-of1da9 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://stu2b50.dev/posts/current-state-of1da9">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout">
      <div id="main">
        

    

    <div>
        <p>I'm sure everyone has heard plenty about the excellence of the M1 Macbooks (I have an Air, by the way; a fanless ultraportable with that kind of performance really attracted me), so in the beginning of this post I will stick to pain points and quirks I experienced with the Macbooks and how I solved them (if I could) to serve as a reference for others, leaving the fairly generic "wow m1 good" at the end. </p>
<p>the tl;dr judgement is: for most developers, it's going to be 95% of the way there by now. If you know what you're doing, you can fill that 5%. If you don't, you might have some frustrating googling ahead.</p>
<h3>App Compatibility</h3>
<p>I'm sure everyone has heard enough of how the M1's seamless ability to run x86 applications, but it really has to be said that it's hard to tell that you're running a program that's not in the devices native architecture.</p>
<p>Almost <em>too difficult</em> to tell. I really wanted to make sure I ran everything native that I could - and honestly sometimes it was hard to tell if I was downloading the native or emulated version. Package files don't seem to say if they're universal binaries, so you have to extract them first. I suppose this is not something Apple wants, but I wish there were an easier way to tell if an application was native or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/">This database</a> is a good reference. As a side note, it also seems to have awful SEO - I consistently get articles <em>ABOUT</em> the page rather than the page itself. </p>
<p>In any case, my two main languages for my personal works are python and rust. Here is the compatibility status of my most used applications</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Application</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Homebrew</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>macports</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Python3</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>VSCode</td><td>Native*</td></tr>
<tr><td>iTerm2</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rust</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>x86</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spotify</td><td>x86</td></tr>
<tr><td>Discord</td><td>x86</td></tr>
<tr><td>Slack</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chrome</td><td>Native</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>* The stable release of VSCode is not native, but the "Insiders" release is.</p>
<p>Very recently true: Homebrew is native now! </p>
<p>Note that, somewhat ironically, most of the applications that are not native are electron apps - they'll likely gain an M1 native version when they eventually update their electron version (I can understand why that would be more of a challenge than it seems), but it is strange having <em>Chrome</em> work natively but not the apps that depend on it.</p>
<p>For Spotify and Discord, I actually currently run them as Chrome webapps (shortcuts-&gt;launch as window). Works fine, since I'm a fairly light user of both. I did try them as translated, but there were some graphical hitches on Discord (although I seem to be alone on that), and why run translated stripped down Chrome when I'm already running native Chrome?</p>
<p>I have to say, though, Spotify and Discord are all the more disappointing because they also disabled the iPhone clients from being used on Apple silicon. Especially for Spotify - the iPhone version would be perfectly fine for my use case and probably run better to boot!</p>
<p>Slack<em>does</em> have an M1 native version. And so does VSCode. So it seems (as you'd expect) there's no technical reason why the electron apps don't have native versions.</p>
<p>The other major exclusion is Dropbox (yes, I'm apparently one of the few people that still subscribe to dropbox), although it seems to be in the works.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Mouse Issues</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if this was just a weird issue with my specific peripheral configuration or what, but disabling mouse acceleration also crippled the sensitivity of the mouse - so much that even at max DPI on MxMaster, it was still too slow. If you moved the sensitivity in settings, it would re-enable mouse acceleration. </p>
<p>I fixed this in the end with SteerMouse, which allows you to modify the acceleration and sensitivity separately, but I remember that the good ol' <code>defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1</code> would not have this behavior. Probably a Big Sur behavior, rather than an M1 thing, but I'm a little surprised to never see this mentioned. Maybe more people use mouse acceleration than I thought? Am I the weird one?</p>
<hr>
<h3>In the Wild</h3>
<h4>Python</h4>
<p>There were some rough edges. For instance, many of my projects are in python and use postgresql, so I have <code>psycopg2-binary</code> as a dependency on many of them. While running <code>pipenv install</code> (yes, I use <code>poetry</code> now, but some of them predate that and I don't care enough to switch them) I received some linker errors.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/1200">Here's a github issues thread on it</a></p>
<p>In my case, linking <code>openssl</code> fixed it. <code>psycopg2</code> is popular enough that there were other users having the issue and finding solutions, but it's possible that less used packages, especially ones that have to interface with native code, rather than be pure python, would have issues.</p>
<p>Another python issue came with <code>PyQt5</code>. Trying to install it caused this error</p>
<pre><code>hook = backend.prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel
AttributeError: module 'sipbuild.api' has no attribute 'prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel'
</code></pre>
<p>With an ugly traceback accompanying it. This led me on a wild goose chase with <code>pyqt5-sip</code>, and Googling the error led to no useful outcomes - just people recommending others to upgrade pip. </p>
<p>Turns out, the actual issue was that qmake wasn't in my path. It is building it from source, I suppose? But what a stunningly unhelpful error. The M1 related issue is that the platform is too new for there to be wheels for PyQt5, so it had to built from source. The rest is the python packaging being an idiot.</p>
<h4>Rust</h4>
<p>On the rust side, well, Cargo seems to just compile everything from source anyway, so there's no issues here (although, if you'd believe it, the build directory for this blog, between debug and release, is almost <em>5 GB</em> in size).</p>
<h4>Flutter (and Android)</h4>
<p>I was shocked how easy it was to get the Android toolchain set up. It's running in translation, but I only know that because I checked the binary afterwards. You just install it, and it works, and Flutter has no issues interfacing with it. </p>
<p>I had to use the beta channel of flutter - before then I was hanging on a gradle build - but otherwise this is a stunningly complex chain of technologies and it all works perfectly. I had a flutter app running on my physical Android device. Of course, there is no issues with the iOS toolchain.</p>
<h4>Docker</h4>
<p>I'll admit I'm not a super heavy user of Docker, but it is the elephant in the room. It's released under a Technical Preview (and considering how stable the intel release of docker on MacOS is that's fairly foreboding)... but it seems to work? </p>
<p>Of course, with ARM containers. I believe x86 containers technically can run through QEMU, but boy that is another level of unstable. I think whether or not this is okay will depend on your use case. For me, mostly working on small servers with languages like python, it's fine. </p>
<p>It does break the "contract" that your local and prod environments were virtually the same; the ARM container may not work in the same way as your prod environment. And for some that will be a dealbreaker. You'll have to decide here.</p>
<hr>
<p>The tl;dr seems to be that for more fragile packaging systems, platform binaries for Apple Silicon have not yet been made in many cases, so they must be built from sources, and that can cause issues that other users don't expect. Be aware of that, although it will surely get better over time. And by that I mean Python, since it was where I had by far the most issues, although all were resolvable so far.</p>
<hr>
<h3>A Note on Vertical Stands</h3>
<p>I have a vertical clamshell stand for the first time, since I am no longer afraid of the device's thermal performance. However, I did have one hitch. it's very natural with the Air's wedge shape to put the back of the wedge into the stand, however, if you have a stand that's fully metal, and you center it, the stand can cover up the device's wifi antenna. </p>
<p>With the unibody metal chassis, you need somewhere to stick the wifi antenna, and on modern macbooks that's here</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/current-state-of1da9/macbook" alt=""></p>
<p>on the back, around where the hinge is. I had quite bad wifi performance until I changed this which mystified me for a bit. Just place it in a different orientation (or get a stand that's more airy) and it'll be fine.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The performance is as lovely as everyone has said it is. I did two hours or so of chrome browsing, which reduced the battery by all of 1%. It's icey cold the entire time, too. Surprisingly a big deal when you actually have it on your lap.</p>
<p>The first day I had it, it was just okay - about what you'd expect from a laptop with a powerful CPU. But after a day, and all the first-launch processes like spotlight indexing, OS updates, and so forth finish running, it's noticeably smoother in operation. Especially small things like having the display turn out, changing the resolution, moving windows around. I'm not even sure specifically what causes this; perhaps improvements with the integrated GPU instead?</p>
<p>It really cannot be overstated how cool it runs. The USB-C dongle that is attached to it runs hotter than the chassis of the laptop even after some ostensibly expensive task, like when I compiled Qt5 from source. </p>
<p>Clamshell mode is a game changer too. Never has a clamshell mode worked so well; I rarely used it before because I would always need to manually press the power button, or use the keyboard and touchpad built in whenever it inevitably bugs out. But it just works on the new M1. This is by far the best "laptop-as-desktop" experience I've had.</p>
<p>I really think the Air is the best for developers for now; you get an actual function row, you really don't notice any performance decreases because, other than long from-scratch compiles, the developer workflow is very bursty and not about sustained performance. And you reap the benefits of having no fan; there are zero moving parts in this laptop. </p>
<p>Perhaps the rumored 14'' Pro will change that for those that need more performance (especially RAM), but honestly it is perfectly fine for my purposes.</p>
<p>But so it's been good on the Air, and with most the kinks worked out on my setup, I'm enjoying the benefits, and man are those benefits great.</p>

Their programming skills get better and more solid solutions are shipped. At some point, developers start looking for more and more technical challenges. Unfortunately, not all of them are able to fulfill this need, and as a result, they jump between different companies.</p><p id="6ddf">Changing jobs does not always lead to satisfaction. Challenging yourself through learning is a more practical way to keep growing as a professional. In this article, I will provide a list of technical books that every senior software engineer should read. They will encourage you to look at certain things from a different perspective.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="c2ae"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/" rel="noopener">This book</a> is full of insight into how processing and storing data works. It covers database topics deeply. You will learn different types of databases and their most common use cases.</p><p id="3899">As developers, we know what database indexes and transactions are. But do we really know the costs of these features? How often do we question whether the performance may suffer from every newly added operation in a transaction? The author’s answers to those questions are well-described and followed by a bunch of real-world examples.</p><p id="e004">The author guides readers not only through the databases, but the topics of data consistency and synchronization are also covered in depth. For example, the mechanisms and approaches for achieving data consistency across distributed instances, when database replications are necessary, etc. You will learn about Atomic Commit and Two-Phase Locking in transactions when multiple writers are used.</p><p id="bdfc">This book is definitely for advanced engineers. It assumes you know the basics of computer science subjects, such as binary trees and hash tables. If you already have some experience in the field and want to better understand how big data systems work, then this is a great starting point.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="f7ba">After learning how to program and releasing multiple solutions, every developer starts observing some similarities in code. In certain cases, they would usually apply one approach. In other cases, a different common technique would be used. If you feel the same way, you have reached a turning point.</p><p id="3670">Your next reading should be about design patterns. A software design pattern is a technique for solving common problems in a conventional way. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we can take advantage of the well-known solutions and instead focus on business challenges.</p><p id="08d0"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/" rel="noopener">The best book</a> about design patterns is from the “Gang of Four” (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides). It is famous among senior software developers and architects. It covers many design patterns, starting from simple ones like Singleton and finishing with more complex ones like Command and Visitor.</p><p id="8a42">After reading this book, you may feel a little overwhelmed and tempted to apply complex design patterns to simple problems even when it is not needed.</p><blockquote><p id="1b24">“I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.” — <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13932-i-suppose-it-is-tempting-if-the-only-tool-you" rel="noopener">Abraham Maslow</a></p></blockquote><p id="cf25">Use this book as learning material to expand your knowledge. Study all the examples they provide for every pattern. With that said, next time you have to deliver a project, carefully pick the right pattern and strive for simplicity.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="feb2">At first, we learn programming in a single thread — usually the UI thread. Things work well until we have to perform heavy computations or read/write files. The blocked user interface becomes a problem as it waits for the completion of the operation. That is the case when the job has to be done asynchronously and the user interface should remain responsive.</p><p id="6903">Even if your main specialization is not Java, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/" rel="noopener">this book</a> can teach you about common problems in multi-threading systems. It starts by explaining what a thread is and how the system actually executes tasks in parallel. Then the book explains the most common problems with threads, like race conditions and deadlocks.</p><p id="c531">The book reminds us of the “dining philosophers problem.” This is a good example of starvation and a possible deadlock, as every person requires two forks:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Dining philosophers problem" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2260/1*SdI7qwsNa05IkyiMXlAmPg.png" width="1130" height="1172" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*SdI7qwsNa05IkyiMXlAmPg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*SdI7qwsNa05IkyiMXlAmPg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*SdI7qwsNa05IkyiMXlAmPg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SdI7qwsNa05IkyiMXlAmPg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*SdI7qwsNa05IkyiMXlAmPg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Dining philosophers problem by Benjamin D.

Therefore, all examples are in Java. But you should not feel discouraged, as many other frameworks use similar ideas (e.g. .NET).</p><p id="fc22">Concurrency is an advanced subject indeed. Start with this book when you feel confident in at least one programming language. After completing the book, you will have a clear picture of the costs of parallel work, non-blocking algorithms, and best practices in multi-threading systems.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="a89a">Being a software engineer involves a lifetime of learning. New technologies are continually appearing, and if we want to grow and build reliable solutions, we have to catch up with the trends in the industry.</p><p id="e06e">Staying curious is the key to succeeding as a developer.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>With its high viscosity, no one would ever pick honey to beat water in a race. But a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba5197">new study</a> shows there’s at least one circumstance where honey wins: inside a narrow, <a href="https://fyfluiddynamics.com/tagged/superhydrophobic/">superhydrophobic</a> tube with one or both ends closed. Inside these specially coated tubes a narrow cushion of air stays between the drop and the wall, reducing friction and increasing flow speed for both fluids. </p>



<p>But when one or both ends of the tube are blocked, the drops can only move when air squeezes past. In less viscous fluids, like water, the researchers found rapid internal flows inside the drop. These flows pressed the surface of the drop outward, reducing the air cushion and making it harder for air to squeeze past so that the drop could flow. In contrast, honey showed very little internal flow and so was able to flow through the tubes ten times faster than water!

February 27, 2021 | https://gru.gq/2021/02/28/solarwind-enough-with-the-password-already/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gru.gq/2021/02/28/solarwind-enough-with-the-password-already/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is a much delayed discussion on the complexity and nuance of the SolarWind hack. The simplistic and wrong messaging from some quarters of the infosec community has resulted in an atrocious misunderstanding of the hack in the public sphere. This has extended into the policy world as these bad takes are treated as cogent analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/1341439709487087618?s=21">I wrote this back in December</a>, but months later this <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/26/politics/solarwinds123-password-intern/index.html">bad analysis is still brought up in the policy space.</a></p>
<h2>Espionage is the second oldest profession</h2>
<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that with spying, the ends justify the means. This is true for all espionage organisations, the opposition’s and your own. Why is that relevant? Because any standard which is used to hamper the opposition will also apply to, and hamper, yours.</p>
<p>Sometimes laying down blanket rules about acceptable espionage behaviour is not a problem. Almost always this is when a certain type of operation is out of character with the society that produces the espionage agency. China makes extensive use of their diaspora community for espionage. The US has thousands of trained professionals and doesn’t use their diaspora community for organic bottom up collection. The US sometimes coopts civilians (and China has professionals) but generally speaking the diaspora method is one that only China uses extensively.</p>
<p>Extending this a bit further: if an espionage rule was proposed that banned the use of professionals but allowed the use of amateur civilians, China would be able to easily adapt to the new espionage environment. The US would be severely constrained. For this reason, the US wouldn’t sign up to, or abide by, such a requirement. (This is complicated further by the nature of targets for espionage, and national policy, but we can explore that another day.)</p>
<p>This brings me to targeting civilian companies and supply chain attacks. The US uses these methods just as, if not more, frequently than the Russians. FLAME, a strain of malware that targeted entities in the Middle East, exploited a cryptologic bug in the way Microsoft signed their updates. The NSA was then able to inject malicious code into the updates of Microsoft software. And just like SolarWinds, it was specifically targeted to ensure only legitimate espionage targets were infected and collected.</p>
<p><strong>There is no rule that would prohibit the SolarWinds espionage campaign which the US would be willing to abide by itself.</strong></p>
<h2>Russian Intelligence aren’t script kiddies</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing: the attackers are Russian foreign intelligence, the cream of the old KGB, and they will find a way to gain access to their target. Do they need to recruit a developer at the company and trick them into installing malware? They will do that.</p>
<p>They do not need to access the target via a weak password on the build servers. If that is what they use, then that is what they use, but it is not the make or break factor for the operation.</p>
<p>Part of the problem here might be that a superficial understanding of the cyber kill chain gives the impression that if you just stop <strong>The One Critical TTP</strong> in the chain then you will defeat the opposition. This is only true for an opposition that is inflexible and using just one technique. That description does not apply to the Russian intelligence services.</p>
<p>Intelligence agencies have targets and they will find the techniques to access them. The don’t start with a technique and look for targets that they can access.</p>
<p>The SolarWind backdoor was deeply integrated into the code, it was injected during their build process, and there is no way that the server having a weak password was the pivotal factor. As if Russian Intelligence would just give up if there were a strong password instead!</p>
<p>There is practically no chance that the server’s password was in anyway relevant to the hack overall. I can forgive the ignorance from the news media, but some infosec people are repeating this garbage as if it is important part of the SolarWind compromise.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The offense is routinely underestimated. When companies are hacked, they react as if they had only done this one thing or avoided this one mistake everything would have been okay. The adversary is treated as if they just got lucky.” — Network Attacks and Exploitation <a href="https://twitter.com/networkattack">@networkattack</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People suggesting that the weak password example is relevant because it illustrates the poor security practices overall. I would agree with you if that was the argument presented. It was not. You have to work with the words ppl said, not what you wish they’d said.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘’Security researcher Vinoth Kumar told Reuters that, last year, he alerted the company that anyone could access SolarWinds’ update server by using the password “solarwinds123”<br>
“This could have been done by any attacker, easily,” Kumar said.’’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I absolutely agree with the “it is illustrative of poor security practice” but… that isn’t what was said. They literally said that the weak password means that the attacker could be anyone. Anyone could do it. That is the dumbest take.</p>
<h2>The KGB vs a software vendor? Bet KGB.</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing.</p>
<p>I’m perfectly willing to believe that their build servers were using “admin:admin” and that’s how the Russians gained access to inject their code… but, this was a clandestine intelligence operation. They did not succeed merely because SolarWind had poor password hygiene.</p>
<p>The SVR was formed from the cream of the KGB — the first chief directorate (FCD). The most prestigious directorate in the KGB. As the SVR they are still formidable.</p>
<h2>Was SolarWind picked due to its poor security?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I suspect the primary motivation was the access that would be enabled by the attack, not the vulnerable nature of the company. This is the SVR, the cream of the KGB (first chief directorate). They are not going to be bothered by password policy.</p>
<p>That’s what kinda annoys me… however easy SolarWind may have been to hack, they were hacked by the fucking First Chief Directorate of the KGB. Quite possibly the people that are frying diplomats brains with microwaves in Havana. They’re pretty fucking metal.</p>
<p>Could SolarWind have been too difficult for the KGB to use them in an enablement operation? Yes, it is possible to achieve that level of security. Creating a strong fast detection capability with rapid remediation and incident response will make it hard for attackers to dwell for any length of time, or persist on the system after they gain access. It requires vigilance and some effort, but it can be done. Of course, SolarWind wasn’t close to reaching that level.</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/">Advent of Code</a> is a popular yearly programming competition. It's an
Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and
levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.</p>
<p>Puzzles are released daily throughout December. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/stats">More</a> than 150k
people take part in this event. The toughest battle to solve each puzzle as soon
as possible to become the best on the global <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard">leaderboard</a>.</p>
<p>In my timezone, puzzles are released at 6 o'clock in the morning. Since I'm a
night owl, the biggest challenge for me here is to get up so early. I,
therefore, set a different goal instead.</p>

<p>I want to develop a standalone, short, compact, fast and, elegant solution for
each problem this year. In past competitions, I took part using the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
language. I've been using it a lot for other projects lately, and believe it is
a fantastic language to build performant, secure, and robust software. This has
always sparked my interest so Rust is a good fit.</p>
<p>Last year I came across <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/solving-advent-of-code-in-under-a-second/">this</a> article, solving all puzzles in
under a second. Yes, in less than one second total. This inspired me to
challenge myself to the same this year:</p>
<p><em>Solving Advent of Code 2020 in under a second on a single CPU core.</em></p>
<p>Spoiler alert: I succeeded!</p>

<p>In this article, I'd like to show you some optimizations I found appealing which
I used to keep the solutions blazingly fast. I'll only talk about the most
significant optimizations and the interesting bits. Most are algorithmic and are
consequently language agnostic.</p>
<p>I'm just using basic time measurements on my machine. I won't be theoretically
proving the efficiency of an approach. I optimized the runtime of my solutions
based on my personal input. I did not make assumptions other than what is clear
from the puzzle description though, so each solution should work for all inputs
with comparable runtime. All user input is similar after all.</p>
<p>I hope this article will present you with some out-of-the-box approaches you can
take away to make your future code more performant. Hence this piece is intended
for programmers that value performance.</p>

<p>On the first day <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1#part2">part 2</a>, we're given a list of numbers. We must find 3 numbers
that have a sum of 2020. All numbers are around 1000, so we're likely trying to
find a pair of 3 small numbers.</p>

<p>On <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9#part2">day 9 part 2</a> we must find a sequence of numbers in a list of
numbers that sums up to a specific value.</p>
<p>The common approach seems to be to use a <code>for</code> in a <code>for</code> loop. This walks
over each position with the outer loop and tries to find a sequence with the
correct sum with the inner loop.</p>
<p>I'm <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day09b/src/main.rs#L9-L20">using</a> a <em>dynamic sliding window</em> approach instead (I better
give it a fancy name you know). I start by sliding the <em>head</em> forward, making
the window and the sum larger. When the sum becomes larger than the target value
I stop. Then I start sliding the <em>tail</em> forward, making the window and the
sequence sum smaller. When the sum becomes smaller than the target value I stop.</p>
<pre><code><span>   &gt;&gt; tail &gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt; head &gt;&gt;
         |           |
         +-----------+
... 35 20|15 25 47 40|62 55 65 95 102 ...
         +-----------+
         | tot: 127  |
</span></code></pre>
<p>I keep alternating between sliding the <em>head</em> and <em>tail</em>. Once the sum equals
the target value, we've found the sequence and can solve the puzzle. This
minimizes the number of required loops, making it more efficient.</p>

<p>On <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10#part2">day 10 part 2</a> we get a list of adapter voltages. Adapters may be
plugged into each other if the adapter is 1 to 3 volts higher than the adapter
you're plugging into. The puzzle is to figure out how many distinct adapter
arrangements are possible.</p>
<p>I started with a sorted list because you can only plug higher-rated adapters
into lower-rated ones. The maximum difference is 3, so I soon discovered that
you can chunk the sequence of adapters. Each chunk of adapters has a difference
of 3, which only gives one way to connect between them. You can now process each
chunk separately to find distinct arrangements, multiplying their calculations.</p>
<pre><code><span>Chunks with adapters:

C1 &gt;&gt; C2 &gt;&gt; C3 &gt;&gt; C4 &gt;&gt; C5
--    --    --    --    --
1     4     10    15    19
      5     11    16
      6     12
      7
--    --    --    --    --
1x    7x    4x    2x    1x

Ways to connect:

1  +  7  +  4  +  2  +  1  =  15
</span></code></pre>
<p>This resulted in chunks that always consisted of 2, 3, or 4 adapters. This makes
it easy to find distinctions between them. I finally figured that I could
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day10b/src/main.rs#L13-L20">optimize</a> it to a <em>fixed number of distinctions per chunk size</em>
greatly reducing complexity.</p>
<p>I found 74049191673856 distinct ways to connect all adapters in just <code>5μs</code>. I
can't even count to 1 within that time.</p>

<p>On <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11">day 11 part 1</a> we're given a variation of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of
Life</a> represented as a 2D arrangement of seats on a plane. Each iteration
seat occupation changes based on a set of rules considering their neighbors, but
seats don't move.</p>
<pre><code><span>L.LL.LL.LL    L = empty seat
LLLLLLL.LL    . = nothing
L.L.L..L..
LLLL.LL.LL
L.LL.LL.LL
L.LLLLL.LL
..L.L.....
LLLLLLLLLL
L.LLLLLL.L
L.LLLLL.LL
</span></code></pre>
<p>With regular <em>Game of Life</em> you'd have to loop through all positions each
iteration and evaluate all rules to determine their new state. Because this
puzzle does not have a seat at every position (nor do seats always have 4
neighbors) our plane is more like a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_array">sparse array</a>. A lot of
cycles would be wasted if we'd keep looping over all plane positions.</p>
<p>I decided to make a list of all seat positions and their respective neighbors.
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day11a/src/main.rs#L38-L54">This</a> way I only had to go through this list of seats for each
iteration. Determining what neighbors a seat has just needs to be performed
once.</p>
<p>This is especially great for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11#part2">part 2</a> which makes things worse. It
doesn't just consider direct neighbors anymore, but neighbors in line of sight
making searching much more expensive. Luckily it doesn't affect my approach from
the first part too much, as I only search <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day11b/src/main.rs#L28-L39">once</a>. This is much more
efficient than looping through all positions and finding neighbors every time.</p>

<p>On <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12">day 12 part 1</a> we're given a sequence of navigation instructions for
a ship. It includes cardinal directions, rotation, and forward instructions. We
must figure out the distance between the start and destination position.</p>
<p>What makes this tricky is the rotation and forward instructions. The forward
movement is dependent on your current rotation.</p>
<p>I use a single byte of which the first 4 bits define the current rotation. The
first bit means north, the second bit means east, et cetera. Because the ship
starts looking east, I start with the <code>0b01000100</code> pattern. For each rotation
instruction, I simply <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#bit_rotation">rotate</a> the bits left or right. Rotating
right would update the direction to <code>0b00100010</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>Direction bits, shift to rotate 90 degrees left or right:

    &lt;&lt; rotate left &lt;&lt;               &gt;&gt; rotate right &gt;&gt;

... &lt;&gt; 01000100 &lt;&gt; 00100010 &lt;&gt; 00010001 &lt;&gt; 10001000 &lt;&gt; ...


                Bit meaning:

              [ y-1 ] [ y+1 ]
              [north] [south]
                    | |
Direction bits  00100010  would move ship south (y+1)
                     | |
                [east] [west]
                [ x+1] [x-1 ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>To move forward I <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day12a/src/main.rs#L12-L18">take</a> this direction byte and use bitwise
arithmetic to update the ship position. This removes branching (<code>if</code> statements
and such) you'd normally expect for logic like this. Quite elegant.</p>

    <p>It was quite a while since I did the last post about the progress in rg3d (November 2020, ouch). 
Now it’s the time to fix that! For last three months rg3d and rusty-editor has gained 
lots and lots of big features and improvements. Also I started making new game using the engine - a 
Sci-Fi 3D shooter called Station Iapetus, check the end of the post for more info, but for now just
check the video:</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2 id="rg3d">rg3d</h2>

<p>Lets start from the engine, it has 139 new commits from November 2020, here are the most interesting
changes (prepare for the wall of text :) ):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved dark UI theme - <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-editor/master/screenshots/latest.png">default dark theme is more elegant now</a>.</li>
  <li>Added verbosity levels for logger - now you can reduce “noise” levels from the engine by setting
verbosity for the logger.</li>
  <li>Improved lightmap quality - lightmaps are now smoothed and almost seam-free.</li>
  <li>Added proper syncing between physics and scene graph - which means that it is possible now to
add a static physical body to a node and every descendant node will provide its geometry as collider
for the body.</li>
  <li>Improved examples - added navigational mesh example which demonstrates how to use 
navigation agents.</li>
  <li>Improved particle systems - added cylinder emitter for particle systems, improved performance.</li>
  <li>TextBox widget now have multiline mode and different “commit” modes (LostFocus, Enter, etc).</li>
  <li>Improved lots of UI widgets and added VectorImage widget.</li>
  <li>rg3d-sound is now able to manage multiple contexts - which means that you can easily create multiple
sound scenes and operate on them separately! This is extremely useful for multi-scene games: for example
you can now create a sound scene for a menu and one for game level and all entities on the sound scenes
will be completely decoupled from each other.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/hrtf">hrtf</a> crate now has 2 times better performance - thanks for
performance improvements in rustfft crate.</li>
  <li>Added support for 64-bit FBX format (version 7500+) - it is very important because mixamo.com migrated
to latest FBX SDK and all of the animations and character models have become “unloadable” - now it is fixed.</li>
  <li>Animation blending state machines were improved - I added BlendAnimationsByIndex state machine node which
allows you to switch animations by index with given amount of time for transition.</li>
  <li>It’s now possible to copy nodes in-place - previously it was possible only to copy node from scene
to scene.</li>
  <li>The number of draw calls for UI was reduced by 70% - I changed the way of how clipping works: previously
it was using stencil buffer, now it uses scissor test.</li>
  <li>Fixed UI clipping issues - this is related to previous point - it seems that using stencil test wasn’t a
good idea.</li>
  <li>Fixed text measurement in the UI - previously text’s height was measured incorrectly.</li>
  <li>Opacity for UI widgets was added - this extensively used to greyout disabled widgets.</li>
  <li>Layout of Scroll- and Wrap- panels was fixed.</li>
  <li>Light scatter issues for spot lights were fixed - due to incorrect trigonometry calculations light
volumes were clipped.</li>
  <li>Support for transparent meshes - simple forward renderer was added to render transparent meshes.</li>
  <li>Migrated to rapier 0.5 - which fixed lots of issues in the physics.</li>
  <li>Animation signal handling is fixed when animation playing in reverse.</li>
  <li>Animation tracks now are able to filter position/scale/rotation.</li>
  <li>Sprite rendering fixes - there was incorrect blending options that were causing graphical issues.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d/blob/master/rg3d-core/src/pool.rs">Pool</a> now implements FromIterator 
trait.</li>
  <li>Navigation meshes are now correctly copied when instantiating model resource, however inheritance is
not yet implemented.</li>
  <li>Fixed polygon triangulation - there was an incorrect loop exit condition.</li>
  <li>Now FBX loader does not add redundant “root” node in the scene during instantiation.</li>
  <li>Fixed layout issues in FileBrowser and FileSelector widgets.</li>
  <li>Now it is possible to render instances of UserInterface in separate render targets - this is extremely
useful when you need to draw offscreen UI (for example a touch screen panel in a sci-fi game).</li>
  <li>Added Fast Approximate AntiAliasing (FXAA) - not the best solution for anti-aliasing, but very cheap
and easy to implement.</li>
  <li>Fixed lots of Clippy warnings.</li>
  <li>Added integrity checks for resource instances - now engine automatically adds missing nodes from resource
if an instance of the resource does not have it.</li>
  <li>Improved resource inheritance - now the engine is able to correctly resolve dependencies of resources.</li>
  <li>Scene nodes now have tags - very useful feature to mark nodes with game info. For example, lights can be
marked with “FlashingLight” tag and later on you can search all the lights with such tag and add “flashing” 
behaviour.</li>
  <li>Now scene graph allows to perform custom search using custom predicate.</li>
  <li>Slightly improved user interface performance.</li>
  <li>Improved performance of animation machine’s <code>set_parameter</code> method.</li>
  <li>Now it is possible to select binding direction between a rigid body and a scene node - previously only
node-to-body binding was possible, but now body-to-node binding is available too.</li>
  <li>Lots of improvements in SceneDrawingContext - fixed drawing of shapes, added <code>draw_capsule</code> and 
<code>draw_sphere_section</code>, <code>draw_segment_capsule</code> methods.</li>
  <li>Fixed calculation of isometric transform which was used in physics-to-graph transform syncing.</li>
  <li>Now scene gathers performance statistics per frame.</li>
  <li>Added ColorGradientBuilder which allows to build ColorGradient in declarative manner.</li>
  <li>Added navigation agents (commonly known as NavmeshAgent) which are used for navigation on arbitrary
navigation meshes.</li>
  <li>Added path smoothing for navmeshes - now behaviour of agents are much nicer, check the video below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rusty-editor"><a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-editor">rusty-editor</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://rg3d.rs/assets/rusty_editor_27_02_21_00.jpg" alt="Screenshot1"></p>

<p>rusty-editor changes rapidly too, it has 96 new commits from November 2020, here are the most interesting
changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added an editor for navigation meshes - there is still no automatic generation for navmeshes, so I added
simple navmesh editor.</li>
  <li>Added an editor for particle systems - currently is not so flexible, but powerful enough for some
not too complex effects.</li>
  <li>Improved copy/paste in rusty-editor - now it correctly copies all associated entities (rigid bodies,
colliders, etc)</li>
  <li>Configurator now remembers history of previously selected working directories, which is very useful for 
quick iterations.</li>
  <li>Now gizmos have shadows disabled.</li>
  <li>Interaction modes now behaves <em>almost</em> correctly.</li>
  <li>Added debug drawing of the physics - this allows a user to precisely configure location of colliders and rigid 
bodies.</li>
  <li>Now it is possible to edit properties of colliders.</li>
  <li>Fixed deletion of complex selection - this means that editor won’t panic or behave unexpectedly when you
trying to delete multiple nodes at once.</li>
  <li>Added support for joints of various kinds.</li>
  <li>Disabled ability to delete root node.</li>
  <li>Added ability to create directional lights.</li>
  <li>Added scene validation before saving.</li>
  <li>Some menu items are now disabled when there is no active scene.</li>
  <li>Asset previewer now has grid which allows you to quickly understand the size of a model.</li>
  <li>Now editor prints current scene’s path.</li>
  <li>Added “breadcrumbs” - it shows a path from selected node to scene root, it is very useful for quick navigation.</li>
  <li>Limited camera pitch - now it is impossible to be upside-down.</li>
  <li>Added switch for binding direction for rigid bodies.</li>
  <li>Added “Is Sensor” flag for rigid bodies.</li>
  <li>Disabled editing node names of resource instances - this is related to resource inheritance, it relies on the 
suggestion that name won’t change after instantiation.</li>
  <li>Track instantiated animations - previously editor just “forget” about instantiated animations which was leading
to orphaned animations.</li>
  <li>Added ability to edit tags.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stationiapetus"><a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/StationIapetus">StationIapetus</a></h2>

<p>As I mentioned in the beginning of the post, I started making a new game. It will eventually be released in the Steam,
and I hope it will become the proof that the engine is production-ready quality. Here are some fresh screenshots:</p>

<img src="https://rg3d.rs/assets/station_iapetus_27_02_21_01.jpg" alt="Screenshot1"></p>

<p>I’m planning to release demo in at 29th of March to get some feedback and improved the game before release it in
Steam. Check the <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/StationIapetus">repository</a> for more info.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-the-engine">The future of the engine</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the future of the engine heavily depends on the money. I’ve tried to get some sponsorship from various
companies, but with no luck yet. I hope to get some money by selling Station Iapetus in the Steam. I’m working on 
the engine for more than 2 years now and getting very little financial support. If you want to see the project alive,
<strong>please consider to make a donation</strong> on <a href="https://patreon.com/mrdimas">Patreon</a> or
<a href="https://liberapay.com/mrDIMAS">LiberaPay</a> , unfortunately GitHub sponshorship is not available in my country.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WordPress 5.7 is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/02/23/wordpress-5-7-field-guide/">coming out soon</a>. As it has been for many releases now, the WP REST API will also be <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/02/23/rest-api-changes-in-wordpress-5-7/">shipping several new features</a>.</p><p>Among the new features, one caught my attention: "Image Editor Accepts a List of Modifiers".</p><blockquote><p>The <code>/wp/v2/media/&lt;id&gt;/edit</code> endpoint introduced in WordPress 5.5 came with a limited API that accepted top-level rotation and crop declarations. In <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/50124">50124</a> this API was made more powerful and flexible by accepting an array of modifications in the new <code>modifiers</code> request parameter.</p></blockquote><pre><code><span><span>import</span> apiFetch <span>from</span> <span>'@wordpress/api-fetch'</span><span>;</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span>const</span> data <span>=</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  modifiers<span>:</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>    <span>{</span></span><br><span>      type<span>:</span> <span>'crop'</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>      args<span>:</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        left  <span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        top   <span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        width <span>:</span> <span>80</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        height<span>:</span> <span>80</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>    <span>{</span></span><br><span>      type<span>:</span> <span>'rotate'</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>      args<span>:</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        angle<span>:</span> <span>90</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>]</span></span><br><span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>apiFetch</span><span>(</span> <span>{</span> data<span>,</span> method<span>:</span> <span>'POST'</span><span>,</span> path<span>:</span> <span>'/wp/v2/media/5/edit'</span> <span>}</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>This development has been a while on the making.</p><p>First, on WordPress 5.5, the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/16/new-and-modified-rest-api-endpoints-in-wordpress-5-5/#image-editing">image editing endpoint</a> was introduced.</p><p>This endpoint was initially a bit rigid, requiring to pass all the data together concerning all operations to apply on the image. For instance, to rotate the image, and modify its size, we would pass this data:</p><pre><code><span><span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>"x"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>  <span>"y"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>  <span>"width"</span><span>:</span> <span>80</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>  <span>"height"</span><span>:</span> <span>80</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>  <span>"rotate"</span><span>:</span> <span>90</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Then, in WordPress 5.6, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/20/rest-api-batch-framework-in-wordpress-5-6/">batch operations</a> were introduced to the WP REST API.</p><p>Finally, in the upcoming WordPress 5.7, the operations to apply on the image have been decoupled, so we have operations <code>"crop"</code> and <code>"rotate"</code>. These operations can be executed on their own, but also together on the same request via batching.</p><p>As seen earlier on, passing data to the endpoint now looks much more elegant:</p><pre><code><span><span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>"modifiers"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>    <span>{</span></span><br><span>      <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"crop"</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>      <span>"args"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>"left"</span>  <span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        <span>"top"</span>   <span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        <span>"width"</span> <span>:</span> <span>80</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        <span>"height"</span><span>:</span> <span>80</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>    <span>{</span></span><br><span>      <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"rotate"</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>      <span>"args"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>"angle"</span><span>:</span> <span>90</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>]</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="heading-re-doing-what-already-exists">Re-doing what already exists?<a href="#heading-re-doing-what-already-exists"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>The WP REST API is not the only API for WordPress. There are (at least) two alternatives:</p><ul><li>GraphQL, via <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">WPGraphQL</a></li><li>GraphQL + persisted queries, via the <a href="https://graphql-api.com/">GraphQL API for WordPress</a><br>(☝🏽 This is me, your host for this blog post ☝🏽)</li></ul><p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a newish type of API, which excels at batching operations.

				<p>The world of ARM processors has been getting very interesting over the last few years. Until fairly recently, for most people, ARM CPUs were reserved for their phone or maybe a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Raspberry Pi running their home DNS</a>. However now the Raspberry Pi 4 has a pretty decent quad-core CPU and up to 8GB RAM, Apple have blown away the industry with the M1 chips and AWS have launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/">Graviton2</a> instances which depending on who you ask have 20-40% better price/performance than the Intel equivalents.</p>

<p>Despite all this, until recently I wasn’t convinced trying to use arm64 nodes in a production Kubernetes cluster was worth the effort. However the combination of all these events has caused a lot of the software to catch up and support for arm64 in Kubernetes distributions from Amazon EKS to k3s is now excellent! It is likely that a good proportion of the container images you’re using in production now support “multi-arch” and will run on both arm64 and amd64 machines.</p>

<h2 id="container-images">Container Images</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the container images, as that’s what you’ll need to tackle first if you want to start using arm64 in your environments. Historically if you wanted to support multiple CPU architectures for your container image you would have to have two separate tags e.g. myimage:1.2.3-amd64 and myimage:1.2.3-arm64. This was both a pain for people building the images and for people trying to use them; if you’re deploying a Helm Chart for example you would have to override the image tags if you wanted to run on ARM and there was no hope for you if you wanted to use mixture of arm64 and amd64 nodes in a cluster and have the same pods seamlessly schedule on either (without some extra tooling).</p>

<p>This problem has gone away with Manifest Lists in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/">Image Manifest V2 spec</a>. This allows you to specify a list of container images for a number of different architectures in a single “Manifest List”. In newer container runtime versions (like Docker) this means if you do a <code>docker pull nginx:alpine</code> on your Raspberry Pi you’ll get an image for arm64 and on your Intel laptop you’ll get an amd64 image without any further effort. Previously you would have got the godforsaken “exec format error”.</p>

<p>You might think that this means we’ve reached multi-arch nirvana and everything will “just work” now, but unfortunately this is not the case. If you’re using an existing public image, you will need to make sure that it is using a manifest list and supports both amd64 and arm64. Some registries make this really easy, such as Docker Hub, where you’ll get a nice list of architectures on the Tags tab.</p>

<p>However some don’t make it obvious at all! The easiest way I’ve found so far to determine if an image is multi-arch, is to use the experimental <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest/">docker manifest command</a> in the latest Docker versions. As it says in the documentation you will have to enable experimental features in <code>~/.docker/config.json</code> then you will be able to run a command like:</p>

<p>As you can see the nginx:alpine image is a “manifest list” rather than a plain old manifest and supports the two architectures we’re after. Great! However distroless-java is still single architecture:</p>

<p>I won’t go into building these multi-architecture manifest lists here, as it very much depends on which tool you’re using. If you’re using Docker to build your images you can use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/">docker buildx</a> experimental feature. We’re currently using the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin#extended-usage">jib-maven-plugin</a> for our Java-based apps, which has recently added the <code>platforms</code> feature. There are many other ways to do it and GitHub actions you can use, so it’s not too hard, and you don’t need an arm64 machine to build an arm64-compatible image anymore thanks to integration with QEMU.</p>

<h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>

<p>Getting arm64 nodes in your cluster is as simple as just creating an extra autoscaling group (or one per Availability Zone) in AWS or using <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup">k3sup</a> to join your Raspberry Pi 4 to your k3s cluster. I’ll try to keep this post generic to however you deploy Kubernetes, but as we’re using EKS in production, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html#arm-ami">here is the documentation</a> on getting the right AMI for your architecture. I also have a k3s cluster at home with two old Intel laptops and a Raspberry Pi 4, and this guide works exactly the same on that.</p>

<p>Before you add arm64 nodes to your cluster you must consider whether you want to specifically exclude incompatible Pods from running on these nodes with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes-using-node-affinity/">node affinity rules</a>, or if you want to exclude all Pods by default and specifically allow the ones you know work on arm64 with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/">taints and tolerations</a>. I went with the latter on our EKS clusters because the majority of our workloads aren’t yet multi-arch, but on my home Raspberry Pi cluster I went with the former.</p>

<h3 id="node-affinity">Node Affinity</h3>

<p>The node affinity rule option requires no configuration of the nodes themselves because recent Kubernetes versions have a standard <code>kubernetes.io/arch</code> node label; this should be set to arm64 or amd64. However it will require a lot of effort if you have a large number of workloads which don’t yet work on arm64.</p>

Labels:             kubernetes.io/arch=arm64
                    kubernetes.io/hostname=myarmnode
                    kubernetes.io/os=linux
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>All you need to do is set up a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes-using-node-affinity/">node affinity rule</a> in the PodSpec of any Pods which don’t have multi-arch images like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: "kubernetes.io/arch"
            operator: In
            values: ["amd64"]
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You could also do the opposite and use the <code>NotIn</code> operator and values set as <code>["arm64"]</code>.</p>

<h3 id="taints-and-tolerations">Taints and Tolerations</h3>

<p>The option I went with in our EKS clusters is to set up a <code>NoSchedule</code> “taint” on all arm64 nodes which we then “tolerate” on any pods we know to work on arm64. I’ve done this in the user-data script in the Launch Template used by our Graviton2 Auto Scaling Groups through the <code>--kubelet-extra-args</code> flag of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/improvements-eks-worker-node-provisioning/">bootstrap.sh</a>; the extra arg you need to pass to the kubelet is <code>--register-with-taints="arch=arm64:NoSchedule"</code>. You can also just use this command after your nodes are registered to the cluster: <code>kubectl taint no myarmnode arch=arm64:NoSchedule</code>.</p>

<p>Once all your arm64 nodes are tainted, only Pods with the right <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/">tolerations</a> will be scheduled to run on them. As with affinity rules, they are specified in the PodSpec of your Pod. In our case the toleration needed will be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tolerations:
- key: "arch"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "arm64"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might see some system-level DaemonSets like kube-proxy already have tolerations like this, which will also work:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>tolerations:
- effect: NoSchedule
  operator: Exists
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you get issues with certain DaemonSets not being scheduled on your arm nodes, even though they have the right tolerations, check that the affinity rules don’t exclude nodes by the <code>kubernetes.io/arch</code> label.</p>

<h3 id="finding-multi-arch-images">Finding multi-arch images</h3>

<p>The first Pods I had to make sure were running on our arm64 nodes were the DaemonSets for things like fluentd (our logging agent) or jaeger-agent (our tracing agent). Unfortunately neither of these images were multi-arch which would have been a blocker for running our workloads on arm64 nodes. However as is often the case in the Open Source world, somebody had already had the same problem and a bit of searching GitHub showed up an open Pull Request or Issue with links to un-official images; <a href="https://github.com/kokuwaio/helm-charts/issues/12">this in the case of fluentd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/querycap/jaeger">this in the case of jaeger-agent</a>. This is course not as good as the project providing official multi-arch images (like everything except kube-state-metrics in the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack">kube-prometheus-stack Helm Chart</a>) but in more and more cases official multi-arch images are available and this will only get better over time.</p>

<h3 id="cluster-autoscaler">Cluster autoscaler</h3>

<p>After I’d got a number of our workloads set up to run on either arm64 or amd64 nodes, I of course wanted to run as many arm64 nodes as possible due to the lower cost. I did this using the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/expander/priority/readme.md">Priority based expander for cluster-autoscaler</a> by setting the Auto Scaling Groups for arm64 nodes to a higher priority than the rest of our groups. You could also set up <code>preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution</code> affinity rules on arm64 compatible Pods but we found the Cluster Autoscaler configuration to be sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="bash-one-liner-for-good-measure">Bash one-liner for good measure</h3>

<p>This will (on Linux at least) list out all the arm64 …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

					Having a memory of past events enables us to take smarter decisions about the future. Researchers at the Max-Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPI-DS) and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have now identified how the slime mold Physarum polycephalum saves memories – although it has no nervous system.
				</p></header><section><p>The ability to store and recover information gives an organism a clear advantage when searching for food or avoiding harmful environments. Traditionally it has been attributed to organisms that have a nervous system.</p><p>A new study authored by Mirna Kramar (MPI-DS) and <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/alim-karen" title="Profile of Prof. Dr. Karen Alim" target="_blank">Prof. Karen Alim</a> (TUM and MPI-DS) challenges this view by uncovering the surprising abilities of a highly dynamic, single-celled organism to store and retrieve information about its environment.</p><div id="c62766"><div><div><p>The slime mold Physarum polycephalum has been puzzling researchers for many decades. Existing at the crossroads between the kingdoms of animals, plants and fungi, this unique organism provides insight into the early evolutionary history of eukaryotes – to which also humans belong.</p><p>Its body is a giant single cell made up of interconnected tubes that form intricate networks. This single amoeba-like cell may stretch several centimeters or even meters, featuring as the largest cell on earth in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p></div></div></div><div id="c62767"><div><div><p>“It is very exciting when a project develops from a simple experimental observation”, says Karen Alim, head of the Biological Physics and Morphogenesis group at the MPI-DS in Göttingen and professor for the <a href="http://www.bpm.ph.tum.de/" target="_blank">Theory of Biological Networks</a> at the Technical University of Munich.</p><p>When the researchers followed the migration and feeding process of the organism and observed a distinct imprint of a food source on the pattern of thicker and thinner tubes of the network long after feeding.</p><p>“Given P. polycephalum's highly dynamic network reorganization, the persistence of this imprint sparked the idea that the network architecture itself could serve as memory of the past“, says Karen Alim. However, they first needed to explain the mechanism behind the imprint formation.</p></div></div></div><div id="c62768"><div><div><p>For this purpose the researchers combined microscopic observations of the adaption of the tubular network with theoretical modeling. An encounter with food triggers the release of a chemical that travels from the location where food was found throughout the organism and softens the tubes in the network, making the whole organism reorient its migration towards the food.</p><p>“The gradual softening is where the existing imprints of previous food sources come into play and where information is stored and retrieved”, says first author Mirna Kramar. “Past feeding events are embedded in the hierarchy of tube diameters, specifically in the arrangement of thick and thin tubes in the network.”</p><p>“For the softening chemical that is now transported, the thick tubes in the network act as highways in traffic networks, enabling quick transport across the whole organism”, adds Mirna Kramar. “Previous encounters imprinted in the network architecture thus weigh into the decision about the future direction of migration.”</p></div></div></div><div id="c62769"><div><div><p>„Given the simplicity of this living network, the ability of Physarum to form memories is intriguing. It is remarkable that the organism relies on such a simple mechanism and yet controls it in such a fine-tuned manner,” says Karen Alim.</p><p>“These results present an important piece of the puzzle in understanding the behavior of this ancient organism and at the same time points to universal principles underlying behavior. We envision potential applications of our findings in designing smart materials and building soft robots that navigate through complex environments”, concludes Karen Alim.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>

<p>I spent over 25 hours building a cut-down version of Sapiens. The goal? Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to keep editing to a minimum: It’s the original text, edited to ensure it still flows like the book.</p>

<h2 id="development-of-brains">Development of brains</h2>

<p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>

<p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>

<p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>

<p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>

<p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-revolution">Cognitive Revolution</h2>

    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/sapiens-timeline-2.jpg" alt="" usemap="#image-map">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>

<!-- 
> All new humans are improvements over the past?
> As in, the de facto keeps rising.

>These mutated humans were praised for their initiative and were more successful
>Till everyone became like this and then even more better humans were praised and the previous became the normal -->

<p>What’s special about our language?</p>

<p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>

<!-- Most likely, both the gossip theory (who can be trusted and who can't) and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  -->

<p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>

<!-- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition -->

<p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>

<p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>

<!-- But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.  -->

<p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>

<!-- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.  -->

<!-- As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. -->

<p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>

<!-- > Because of the cognitive Revolution and the introduction of imagined reality -->

<p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>

<!-- One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding -->

<!-- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. -->

<p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of what the players are doing. -->

<!-- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging. Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. -->

<p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

<p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>

<!-- > The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers -->
<!-- 
--- Way of life being lost over generations
    Like with the foundation.
    Also short sightedness.
    As, working harder here meant more food => can better feed children => even more people exist => You're back where you started, except you're working harder.
 -->

<p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>

<p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>

<!-- In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. -->

<!-- How the agricultural revolution led to individual suffering -> -->

<!-- 6: Building Pyramids -->

<!-- This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature. -->

<h3 id="imagined-realities---solving-the-co-ordination-problem">Imagined Realities - Solving the co-ordination problem</h3>

<p>According to the science of biology, people were not ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of creation.</p>

<p>A natural order is a stable order. There is no chance that gravity will cease to function tomorrow, even if people stop believing in it. In contrast, an imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and …</p></div></div>

<p>If families are people, and corporations are people, it stands to reason that families should be allowed to incorporate and file their taxes accordingly.</p>
<p>The benefits to incorporating are fairly obvious: corporations are taxed on their net income, and they enjoy a lower tax rate. Families, on the other hand, pay taxes on their revenue. And while families enjoy a few miscellaneous deductions and credits, they largely miss out on the good stuff. Corporations get to deduct nearly all capital expenditures; families receive no direct tax benefit for feeding their kids, purchasing clothes, buying a minivan, filling that minivan with unleaded, homeschooling or other education expenses, fixing a furnace, upgrading technology, or even moving to a safer neighborhood. If a corporation can demonstrate a net loss on the year, even due to its own aggressive spending habits, it doesn’t pay taxes. If a family loses money, the tax code doesn’t care.<span id="more-3557"></span></p>
<p>As a result, families pay a disproportionate share of federal tax receipts. In <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p55b.pdf">2019</a>, individuals paid just under 70 percent of all federal taxes, while corporations paid just 25 percent. Take payroll taxes out of the equation, and those numbers become even more lopsided: individuals paid nearly $1.6 trillion to the federal government while corporations paid about $226 billion.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that corporations should be taxed on their revenue, or that we should dramatically increase corporate taxes. Lower taxes and reduced regulatory burdens can, at least in theory, encourage capital formation. So if Republicans are so eager to pass a $1.7 trillion, unfunded corporate tax cut on the belief that it would spur business investment, as they did in 2017, shouldn’t they be willing to consider a similar approach to other forms of capital formation—namely, human capital formation?</p>
<p>We are in the midst of a fertility crisis, which only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. has already reached an all-time-low fertility rate of 1.71 births per woman, and Brookings estimates that there will be a “<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/half-a-million-fewer-children-the-coming-covid-baby-bust/">baby bust</a>” in 2021 of at least 300,000 fewer American births. The long-term effects of such a decline in human capital would be far-reaching. Shrinking populations don’t often lend themselves to growing economies.</p>
<p>Financial pressures are one of the main, addressable sources of the crisis. As American Compass’s recent Home Building Survey <a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/home-building-survey-part-1/">showed</a>, half of parenting-age adults want more children than they currently have. And for all but the most well-off, these parents cite the inability to afford more children as the primary reason for this deficit.</p>
<p>If we were to find a similar impediment to the formation or growth of American businesses, wouldn’t we do something about it? Wouldn’t we have done something already?</p>
<p>We could create new deductions or expand existing credits to attempt to level the playing field between corporations and families. Options include: boosting the Child Tax Credit, reworking the Earned Income Tax Credit, extending the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit beyond two dependents or above the current $6,000 cap, or even expanding the scope of 529 savings accounts to include all K-12 schooling options.</p>
<p>Or, we could go big and allow families access to the same tax treatment that Amazon and General Electric enjoy. Instead of a Child Tax Credit, let families write off their grocery bills. Instead of deductions for mortgage interest that only kick in if tax filers earn enough income to itemize, let families deduct all housing costs. Instead of an inadequate childcare deduction, let families deduct the entire expense. Why not? Families are corporations, my friend.</p>
<p>For decades, supply-side ideology has led Republicans to cut taxes and regulation on behalf of corporations. Now, as financial pressures constrain the supply of future Americans, we should embrace supply-side <em>oikonomics</em> and let families incorporate.</p>

But what I didn’t do was answer the question: <em>What are some good examples of leadership craft moves?</em></p><p id="67eb">Leadership craft moves have several distinguishing properties. They tend to be localised, iterative, and require progressive refinement to get right:</p><ul><li id="9b3b"><strong>Locality</strong>: applies to a local area, such as to the leader or those directly around the leader</li><li id="3474"><strong>Iteration</strong>: involve iteration or repetition and can be somewhat algorithmically applied</li><li id="1730"><strong>Refinement</strong>: can be made materially better through improvement over time</li></ul><p id="f373">As an aside (if it isn’t apparent) these three attributes are also very similar to the kinds of things that make good software.</p><p id="59c3">A useful craft move also <span id="rmm">n</span>eeds to be specific because it entails direct action that the leader can execute in a particular moment rather than a broad statement of values, policy, or strategic intent. It is not that values or strategy or policy are unnecessary, because they are essential to great leadership, but they tend to fall more in the category of <em>art</em> than <em>craft</em>.</p><p id="0af8">As a leader, you need to develop personalised craft moves by experimenting and learning as you go. There isn’t a simple recipe that you can follow, and I sense that it is risky to try to blindly adopt others’ behaviours without due consideration of what works for you in your context.</p><p id="22e4">With that in mind, here are a few craft moves that I have developed over the years that I find useful. I am continually iterating and refining these moves, adding to the list and throwing out ones that are no longer useful.</p><p id="94e7">These five have been relatively enduring:</p><ul><li id="08e1"><strong>Make an effort to talk to the most junior person in the room.</strong> This is a low-cost activity that comes with practically zero risks. In the worst case, you will get a sense of what people <em>don’t know</em>, but in the best case, you will learn something about what people with fresh eyes on a problem might be thinking.</li><li id="fee1"><strong>Keep a log of failures — large and small — that you can reflect on and mine for patterns over time</strong>. Treat those patterns as signals for ongoing personal learning.</li><li id="102a"><strong>Always try to thank people for the good things they have done that you <em>didn’t ask them to do</em></strong>. Rewarding rule-following or procedural compliance is one thing, but you also want to be sure to reward innovative thinking that flexes the rules and takes things in new directions.</li><li id="b7f5"><strong>Use questions that seem simple — or even stupid — as a way to check that everyone in the room is working from the same basic set of assumptions</strong>. More often than you might imagine, a sophisticated discussion will have left at least some people in the room behind. Reset now and again (but not too often) with a simple, assumption-testing question to validate consistency and alignment.</li><li id="97a0"><strong>Routinely make sure that everyone has the same understanding of the question the team is trying to answer</strong>. I have a go-to question for this: “<em>What is the question that</em> this <em>is the answer to?</em>” Where “<em>this</em>” is whatever challenge the group currently <em>thinks</em> they are solving.</li></ul><p id="09da">Another way to think about these leadership craft moves is in terms of “<em>being smart</em>” versus “<em>acting smart</em>”.</p><p id="e753">The idea that someone is inherently intelligent is a tough one to shake as it has deep intuitive appeal.

At the very least, it is fraught with human cognitive biases, conscious <em>and</em> unconscious.</p><p id="c6e2">The above leadership craft moves allow anyone to <em>act smart</em> regardless of an objective measure of their intelligence, which is good news because, in practice, there is very little difference in outcome between <em>being</em> smart and <em>acting</em> smart.</p><p id="c7cd">Regards,<br>M@</p><p id="255c"><em>[ED: If you’d like to sign up for this content as an email, </em><a href="https://bit.ly/braingasm-signup" rel="noopener"><em>click here</em></a><em> to join the mailing list.]</em></p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

        <p>Today we'll continue our voyage into the graphics subsystem components.</p>

<p>The question we'll try to answer is what kind of communications occur between the GuC and the rest of the system. In this post we'll look at firmware components and next post at Windows components.</p>

<p>For a reminder what the GuC is, look at <a href="https://igor-blue.github.io/2021/02/10/graphics-part1.html">part1 post</a> .</p>

<p>The Intel Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) EFI DXE driver can be extracted in various versions from many UEFI capsules available through many vendors.
For this post I redid my original analysis on a recent version from a CanonLake system.</p>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to try and see whether the GOP driver communicates with the GuC over the PCIe bus (TL;dr: it doesn't)</p>

<p>The binary isn't to large - 84KB, so we can try to completely reverse engineer it. I used both IDA+HexRays and a dynamic analysis UEFI emulator I developed for just these cases. The emulator lets you run EFI DXE drivers in Windows simulating many UEFI services and allowing me to modify/inspect EFI interfaces, hook UEFI protocol structs, and even has some fuzzing capabilities.</p>

<p>Looking at the driver's entrypoint we see it stores the different service tables in globals and then jumps to the main() functions I called GopEntryPoint().</p>

<p>And then install four protocol handlers, three of which I identified: one for driver binding and two for component name handling. The InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces(..) can accept multiple protocols, each protocol has a GUID and the “virtual table” like structure used by UEFI. The final entry is NULL. Most UEFI protocol GUIDs are public (and appear in the EDK) so we can identify them easily and this identify the virtual table structures associated with them, for example for the UEFI binding protocol we have in DriverBinding.h:</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, in the Fabulous Land of Web Shops Where Rivers Are Made of Honey, there was me, fresh and young PHP developer with little experience, and my colleague and team leader, who was in the industry for 10 years.</p>
<p>It was the evening, at the office. I was pretty tired, but we had to develop a backend for an important client quickly, as always. I was in charge to develop a part of it.</p>
<p>My team leader was full of passion, agitating a weird diagram full of boxes and arrows:</p>
<p>“Here’s my idea. We should first create two interfaces, put two decorators here and maybe three factories above; we need the system to be flexible as much as we can, the client expect to keep his backend for 20 years!”.</p>
<p>My knowledge in design pattern was pretty poor at that time; heck, I even had difficulty to understand the difference between inheritance and composition. I was looking at his schema like Champollion might have looked at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosetta Stone</a> for the first time, bringing more questions than answer.</p>
<p>Speaking of questions, they were first flowing from my mouth: what’s a decorator? Why do we create interfaces? Why this factory, there? The explanations brought even more complex concepts I couldn’t really grasp either. The <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/programmer-stress-causes/">stress of the impostor syndrome</a> was beginning to kick in heavily. I was a fraud, a newbie who wanted to play in the gods’ playground.</p>
<p>My brain was boiling.  Sweat was pearling on my forehead. My confusion was growing proportionally to the amount of explanation given. The cleaning lady began to turn on her vacuum cleaner. I gave up, said yes to everything and went home.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the project didn’t go well. My team leader reproached me not to ask enough question for me to understand. Apparently, I wasn’t helping them enough to teach me correctly.</p>
<p>Why was that? I didn’t understand what was happening, but I swear to the Twelve Gods that I would remember this experience not to reproduce it. I wanted to be a better mentor when it would be my turn to be the Senior Ninja Developer of the Wizardry Crown explaining magic tricks to my apprentices.</p>
<p>At the same time, I knew that my team leader was not the only one responsible for my confusion. I was, too, and maybe even more than him. This lead me to another quest: <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/learning-developer-efficiently-effectively/">learning how to learn</a>.</p>
<p>Years forward, a miracle happened. I stumbled upon the theory of the expert blind spot, finally explaining partly what happened on this cursed project.</p>
<p>Why do I bother you with my life, you might wonder? As developers, we inevitably work with other developers who don’t know everything. It’s important to know how to share our knowledge.</p>
<p>Teaching is one of the best way of testing yourself that you understood what you’ve learned; teaching and learning are tightly linked. Doing it well will increase your understanding of any subject and, therefore, your level of expertise.</p>










  
  
  
  





  


<blockquote>
  <p>While we teach, we learn.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>However, to teach well, we need to understand and avoid the <em>expert blind spot</em>. This might begin to explain why, in my experience, good developers are not necessarily good teacher.</p>
<p>This article will specifically speak about teaching from a person to another. I believe that things are a bit different when you try to learn by yourself with a book, for example.</p>
<p>Here’s the menu for today:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I’ll explain what’s the expert blind spot.</li>
<li>Second, we will speak about the cognitive load theory in general, how understanding and learning work, and why the expert blind spot is a consequence of our learning process.</li>
<li>Finally, I’ll speak about principles as well as actionable solutions to avoid the filthy expert blind spot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, it’s time to embark together in this fabulous journey!</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-expert-blind-spot">What’s the Expert Blind Spot?</h2>
<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<p>To answer what’s the expert blind spot, we shall first define what’s an expert is, to be sure we agree on the semantic of the key terms. From the <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/expert_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford Dictionary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person with special knowledge, skill, or training in something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond the obvious, I like to define expert as well as somebody who knows what he doesn’t know, as mentioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>.</p>
<p>According to this theory, a beginner has often a lot of confidence about his own knowledge and skills, because he’s not aware about what he doesn’t know. Thus, he thinks he knows a lot. This is called illusion of competence.</p>
<p>More you become skilled and knowledgeable, more you’ll know what you need to focus on to increase your expertise.</p>










  
  
  
  





  


<blockquote>
  <p>We live on an island surrounded by a sea of ignorance. As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>Even if an expert is more aware about what he doesn’t know, he’s not necessarily aware about what he knows <em>in details</em>. This sound pretty weird, but it’s exactly what the expert blind spot is.</p>
<p>Even if he forgot the details of what he knows, our expert can still apply his knowledge to perform tasks, but he will only use a <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/abstraction-software-development/">higher level of abstractions</a> of it.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>If an expert can still use the knowledge he’s not entirely aware of anymore, why is it a problem, you might ask, rightfully?</p>
<p>A developer, explaining to a beginner his knowledge, will brush away everything he’s not consciously aware of anymore. The learner, even if he needs this hidden knowledge to understand and learn the whole concept, won’t be able to access it. Thus, he won’t understand.</p>
<p>As a result, the expert won’t understand why the beginner doesn’t understand. After all, for the expert, the concept is obvious.</p>
<p>The learner, on the other side, won’t be able to ask the good questions, since he’s not aware about what he doesn’t know. This brings us back to the lengthy story I was narrating in the introduction.</p>
<p>Even worst: the beginner might <em>misunderstand</em> what the expert try to teach without even knowing it. Absence of knowledge is better than misconceptions, which are the <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/confident-idiots-92793" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basis of ignorance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-on-earth-there-is-such-a-thing-as-the-expert-blind-spots">Why On Earth There Is Such a Thing as the Expert Blind Spots?</h2>
<p>Researches on cognitive learning show us why there’s such a thing as the expert blind spot. First, we need to see how cognitive learning works.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-memories">Types of Memories</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cese.nsw.gov.au/images/stories/PDF/cognitive-load-theory-VR_AA3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive load theory</a>, we have two types of memory: the working memory and the long term memory.</p>
<h4 id="the-working-memory">The Working Memory</h4>
<p>The working memory is very limited in space (we can only process 4 <em>elements of information</em> at the same time) and time (around 20s). These numbers can change from an individual to another.</p>
<p>You can use this memory to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn a new resource.</li>
<li>Perform a task.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine, problems pop up when you try to learn too much at the same time. Your working memory can’t process everything simultaneously, because of its limited space.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you perform a task, you need to <em>recall</em> what you have in your long term memory (what you learnt) in the working memory to do that task, with the same spatial constraints. That’s why <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/kiss-principle-explained/">simplicity is so important</a> in software development.</p>

</figure>

<h4 id="the-long-term-memory">The Long Term Memory</h4>
<p>When you learn a new resource using effective learning methods, what’s in your working memory will go in your long term memory. To do so, you need to <em>understand</em> the knowledge you’re trying to process.</p>
<p>To understand, you need to have every <em>piece of information</em> required in your working memory. From there, you’ll create <em>schemata</em> (plural of schema, if you wonder) in your long term memory to organize this knowledge.</p>
<p>Later, you can use your new schemata to perform a task.</p>

<figcaption>Understanding the Linux pipe thanks to new pieces of information and prior knowledge of the command line.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="pieces-of-information-and-chunking">Pieces of information and Chunking</h3>
<p>We didn’t define what a <em>piece of information</em> is. Each of them will occupy one spot in your working memory. The content itself will depend on what is learned and who’s learning it.</p>
<p>What’s in your long term memory are layers of schemata abstracting one another. When performing a task, you need to reduce the number of schemata you bring back to your working memory not to overload it.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example. Carl, your colleague developer, is running a shiny Ubuntu in his powerful laptop. He wants to know how many files, with names beginning with a “z”, are in a folder.</p>
<p>In my example, you are the famous command line expert of the whole company. Naturally, because of your extreme empathy and your out-of-this-world generosity, you come to help to solve his problem.</p>
<p>“Hey Carl!”, you said, in the most friendly tone a human can produce. “It’s super easy! All you have to do is a good old <code>ls | grep "^z" | wc -l</code>. You see, you first run <code>ls</code>, you pipe with <code>grep</code>, <code>wc</code> and voilà! Your dreams come true!”</p>
<p>However, Carl doesn’t have your knowledge. Raised in the comfortable and boring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GUI</a> world, he doesn’t understand anything of your magical skills. He knows <code>ls</code>, but he doesn’t understand what a pipe is, and he has an artificial understanding of regular expressions. What about <code>grep</code> and <code>wc</code>? He has no clue whatsoever.</p>
<p>Do you think he would understand your explanation? I’m doubtful too. When you type your command line, you don’t have to remind yourself (bring from your long term memory to your limited working memory) what a pipe is and how it works.
The whole concept is abstracted under the word <code>pipe</code> for you. You don’t need to even think about it. The concept is <em>automatically</em> applied to your task at hand.</p>
<p>Because of your expertise in the command line, you save space in your working memory. It reduces the mental energy you need to perform that task, too.</p>
<p>For Carl, things are different. To understand this command, he has to bring the concept of pipe into his working memory, what’s <code>grep</code>, what’s <code>wc</code>, how regular expressions work, and link all of that.</p>
<p>It’s a lot. Too much, even for a command which seems so trivial to you. Unfortunately, you have fallen into the expert blind …</p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="against-packaging-rust-crates">

<p>Recently the discussion has once again come up around the notion of packaging Rust crates as
libraries in distributions. For example, taking a library like <cite>serde</cite> and packaging it to
an RPM. While I use RPM as the examples here it applies equally to other formats.</p>
<p>Proponents of crate packaging want all Rust applications to use the “distributions” versions of a crate.
This is to prevent “vendoring” or “bundling”. This is where an
application (such as 389 Directory Server) ships all of it’s sources, as well as the sources of
it’s Rust dependencies in a single archive. These sources may differ in version from the bundled
sources of other applications.</p>
<div id="packaging-crates-is-not-reinventing-cargo">
<h2>“Packaging crates is not reinventing Cargo”</h2>
<p>This is a common claim by advocates of crate packaging. However it is easily disproved:</p>
<p><em>If packaging is not reinventing cargo, I am free to use all of Cargo’s features without conflicts to distribution packaging.</em></p>
<p>The reality is that packaging crates <em>is</em> reinventing Cargo - but without all it’s features. Common
limitations are that Cargo’s exact version/less than requirements can not be used safely, or Cargo’s ability to
apply patches or uses sources from specific git revisions can not be used at all.</p>
<p>As a result, this hinders upstreams from using all the rich features within Cargo to comply with
distribution packaging limitations, or it will cause the package to hit exceptions in policy and
necesitate vendoring anyway.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-can-vendor-only-in-these-exceptional-cases">
<h2>“You can vendor only in these exceptional cases …”</h2>
<p>As noted, since packaging is reinventing Cargo, if you use features of Cargo that are unsupported
then you may be allowed to vendor depending on the distributions policy. However, this raises some
interesting issues itself.</p>
<p>Assume I have been using distribution crates for a period of time - then the upstream adds an exact version
or git revision requirement to a project or a dependency in my project. I now need to change my spec file and tooling to use vendoring
and all of the benefits of distribution crates no longer exists (because you can not have any dependency
in your tree that has an exact version rule).</p>
<p>If the upstream ‘un-does’ that change, then I need to roll back to distribution crates since
the project would no longer be covered by the exemption.</p>
<p>This will create review delays and large amounts of administrative overhead. It means pointless effort to swap between
vendored and distribution crates based on small upstream changes. This may cause packagers to avoid
certain versions or updates so that they do not need to swap between distribution methods.</p>
<p>It’s very likely that these “exceptional” cases will be very common, meaning that vendoring will be occuring.
This necesitates supporting vendored applications in distribution packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-don-t-need-to-package-the-universe">
<h2>“You don’t need to package the universe”</h2>
<p>Many proponents say that they have “already packaged most things”. For example in 389 Directory Server
of our 60 dependencies, only 2 were missing in Fedora (2021-02). However this overlooks the fact
that I do not want to package those 2 other crates just to move forward. I want to support 389 Directory Server
the <em>application</em> not all of it’s dependencies in a distribution.</p>
<p>This is also before we come to larger rust projects, such as Kanidm that has nearly 400 dependencies. The
likelihood that many of them are missing is high.</p>
<p>So you will need to package the universe. Maybe not all of it. But still a lot of it. It’s already
hard enough to contribute packages to a distribution. It becomes even harder when I need to submit 3, 10, or 100
more packages. It could be months before enough approvals were in place. It’s a staggering
amount of administration and work, which will discourage many contributors.</p>
<p>People have already contacted me to say that if they had to package crates to distribution packages to
contribute, they would give up and walk away. We’ve already lost future contributors.</p>
<p>Further to this Ruby, Python and many other languages today all recommend language native tools
such as rvm or virtualenv to avoid using distribution packaged libraries.</p>
<p>Packages in distributions should exist as a vehicle to ship bundled applications that are created
from their language native tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="we-will-update-your-dependencies-for-you">
<h2>“We will update your dependencies for you”</h2>
<p>A supposed benefit is that versions of crates in distributions will be updated in the background
according to semver rules.</p>
<p>If we had an exact version requirement (that was satisfiable), a silent background update will cause
this to no longer work - and will break the application from building. This would necesitate one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A change to the Cargo.toml to remove the equality requirement - a requirement that may exist for good reason.</li>
<li>It will force the application to temporarily swap to vendoring instead.</li>
<li>The application will remain broken and unable to be updated until upstream resolves the need for the equality requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Background updates also ignore the state of your Cargo.lock file by removing it. A Cargo.lock file
is recommended to be checked in with binary applications in Rust, as evidence that shows “here is
an exact set of dependencies that upstream has tested and verified as building and working”.</p>
<p>To remove and ignore this file, means to remove the guarantees of quality from an upstream.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that packagers will run the entire test suite of an application to regain this
confidence. They will “apply the patch and pray” method - as they already do with other languages.</p>
<p>We can already see how background updates can have significant negative consequences on application stability. FreeIPA
has hundreds of dependencies, and it’s common that if any of them changes in small ways, it can cause
FreeIPA to fall over. This is not the fault of FreeIPA - it’s the fault of relying on so many small
moving parts that can change underneath your feet without warning. FreeIPA would strongly benefit from
vendoring to improve it’s stability and quality.</p>
<p>Inversely, it can cause hesitation to updating libraries - since there is now a risk of breaking
other applications that depend on them. We do not want people to be afraid of updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="we-can-respond-to-security-issues">
<h2>“We can respond to security issues”</h2>
<p>On the surface this is a strong argument, but in reality it does not hold up. The security issues
that face Rust are significantly different to that which affect C. In C it may be viable to patch
and update a dynamic library to fix an issue. It saves time because you only need to update and change
one library to fix everything.</p>
<p>Security issues are much rarer in Rust. When they occur, you will have to update and re-build all
applications depending on the affected library.</p>
<p>Since this rebuilding work has to occur, where the security fix is applied is irrelevant. This frees
us to apply the fixes in a different way to how we approach C.</p>
<p>It is better to apply the fixes in a consistent and universal manner. There <em>will</em> be applications
that are vendored due to vendoring exceptions, there is now duplicated work and different
processes to respond to both distribution crates, and vendored applications.</p>
<p>Instead all applications could be vendored, and tooling exists that would examine the Cargo.toml to
check for insecure versions (RustSec/cargo-audit does this for example). The Cargo.toml’s can be
patched, and applications tested and re-vendored. Even better is these changes could easily then be forwarded to
upstreams, allowing every distribution and platform to benefit from the work.</p>
<p>In the cases that the upstream can not fix the issue, then Cargo’s native patching tooling can
be used to supply fixes directly into vendored sources for rare situations requiring it.</p>
</div>
<div id="patching-20-vulnerable-crates-doesn-t-scale-we-need-to-patch-in-one-place">
<h2>“Patching 20 vulnerable crates doesn’t scale, we need to patch in one place!”</h2>
<p>A common response to the previous section is that the above process won’t scale as we need to find
and patch 20 locations compared to just one. It will take “more human effort”.</p>
<p>Today, when a security fix comes out, every distribution’s security teams will have to be made aware of
this. That means - OpenSUSE, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Arch, and many more groups all have to
become aware and respond. Then each of these projects security teams will work with their maintainers
to build and update these libraries. In the case of SUSE and Red Hat this means that multiple developers
may be involved, quality engineering will be engaged to test these changes. Consumers of that library
will re-test their applications in some cases to ensure there are no faults of the components they
rely upon. This is all before we approach the fact that each of these distributions have many supported
and released versions they likely need to maintain so this process may be repeated for patching and
testing multiple versions in parallel.</p>
<p>In this process there are a few things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a huge amount of human effort today to keep on top of security issues in our distributions.</li>
<li>Distributions tend to be isolated and can’t share the work to resolve these - the changes to the rpm specs in SUSE won’t help Debian for example.</li>
<li>Human error occurs in all of these layers causing security issues to go un-fixed or breaking a released application.</li>
</ul>
<p>To suggest that rust and vendoring somehow makes this harder or more time consuming is discounting

allows further collaboration with upstreams to be involved in the security update process, which ends up
benefiting <em>all</em> distributions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this post we're going to be looking at a more advanced use of <a target="_blank" href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a>'s type system, known as phantom types. Hopefully by the end of this you'll have another tool in your belt to help you better model data in your programs. And fear not, because many languages support phantom types (most common functional programming languages support them, but so do others like Rust, and TypeScript, and even <a target="_blank" href="https://marcosh.github.io/post/2020/05/26/phantom-types-in-php.html">PHP</a>) so you can apply this knowledge elsewhere! </p>
<p>Before we get stuck into some examples, let's tackle the obvious question.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-are-phantom-types">What are phantom types?</h2>
<p>A phantom type is a type parameter that appears on the left hand side of a type's definition but not on the right hand side. In other words, it's a type parameter that is never used by any of a type's constructors.</p>
<pre><code>pub type Example(phantom) {
    Example
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>Example</code> type we have a type parameter, <code>phantom</code>, that isn't used in the type's constructor. Phantom types can be used to provide additional safety or context to values without paying the runtime cost of carrying additional data around. Everything is handled at compile time!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 In some languages, the compiler may emit a warning (or refuse to compile at all) when a type has unused type parameters. Often there are language-specific solutions to this, like <a target="_blank" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/struct.PhantomData.html">PhantomData</a> in Rust or <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@dhruvrajvanshi/advanced-typescript-patterns-6cf8826c7944">impossible fields</a> in TypeScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of this article will see us going over <strong>four</strong> different scenarios where phantom types can come in to play. The whole article is a bit long so if any of the examples describes a scenario that fits you perfectly, feel free to jump straight to it!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="example-one-dealing-with-ids">Example One: Dealing with Ids.</h2>
<p>To understand why phantom types might be useful, let's start with a common scenario. Imagine we're building a social blogging platform like <a target="_blank" href="http://dev.to/">dev.to</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://medium.com/">medium.com</a>. We want to support different users and blog posts, so we assign a unique id to all of these things.</p>
<p>We're a scrappy, fast-moving startup so we implement the simplest possible system for managing IDs: just type aliasing <code>Int</code>s to get things going.</p>
<pre><code>pub type Id = Int

pub fn next (id: Id) -&gt; Id {
    id + 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our platform supports Reddit-style upvoting or liking of posts, and we have a function just for that. It takes in the <code>Id</code> of a post to upvote and the <code>Id</code> of the user that upvoted it, and does some magic to make the upvote happen.</p>
<pre><code>pub fn upvote_post (user_id: Id, post_id: Id) -&gt; Nil {
    // Get a post from the database and upvote it.
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This lets us rush to production, but maybe you've already spotted a potential problem with what we have so far. It's only a matter of time until someone gets the parameters the wrong way round and now a totally unrelated user has upvoted a random post.</p>
<p>One solution would be to stop aliasing <code>Int</code> and define new types for <code>PostId</code> and <code>UserId</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code>pub type PostId { PostId(Int) }
pub type UserId { UserId(Int) }
</code></pre>
<p>Now the two id types are successfully disjoint, but as a consequence we'll end up with a lot more duplicated code. We'll have to have separate <code>next</code> methods to increment each id type, similarly if we want to unwrap the type we'll need separate <code>to_int</code> functions, and the story is the same for <code>to_string</code>, and so on...</p>
<p>Really, the underlying representation of an <code>Id</code> stays the same no matter how we use it. Instead, we'd like the context an <code>Id</code> is used in to determine whether it is valid or not.</p>
<pre><code>pub opaque type Id(a) {
    Id(Int)
}

pub fn new () -&gt; Id(a) {
    Id(0)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We've now redefined our <code>Id</code> type to include a type parameter, <code>a</code>, but notice how that parameter isn't used in the type's constructor: this is where the name <strong>phantom type</strong> comes from. The second  thing to notice is that our <code>new</code> function returns an id with that generic <code>a</code> parameter. This lets <em>callers of the function</em> determine what the type of <code>a</code> should be.</p>
<pre><code>let foo: Id(String)      = new()
let bar: Id(Float)       = new()
let baz: Id(Option(Int)) = new()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and <code>baz</code> are all incompatible with each other. We couldn't check them for equality, for example, because the types don't match up. Fundamental to phantom types is the fact that there is no runtime component, <code>foo</code> may be annotated as <code>Id(String)</code> but no such string exists at runtime, the same for <code>Id(Float)</code> or any other parameter. </p>
<pre><code>foo == bar // Uh oh, compile error!
</code></pre>
<p>This is powerful because we gain the ability to tell the compiler a fact about a particular <code>Id</code>, and the compiler will do extra work to ensure we don't make any mistakes.</p>
<pre><code>pub type User {
    User(id: Id(User), name: String)
}

pub type Post {
    Post(id: Id(Post), content: String)
}

pub fn upvote_post (user_id: Id(User), post_id: Id(Post)) -&gt; Nil {
    // Get a post from the database and upvote it.
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the snippet above, we've defined <code>User</code> and <code>Post</code> types and parameterised the <code>Id</code> type accordingly. Knowing what we know so far about phantom types, we can see that the new type signature for <code>upvote_post</code> will prevent us from accidentally swapping the order of the ids.</p>
<pre><code>let user = User(id: new(), name: "pd-andy")
let post = Post(id: new(), content: "Phantom Types in Gleam...")

upvote_post(post.id, user.id) // Uh oh, compile error!
</code></pre>
<p>Even though our phantom type lets us specialise the <code>Id</code> type, we can still write functions that work on <em>all</em> ids by leaving the type parameter as a variable.</p>
<pre><code>pub fn show (id: Id(a)) -&gt; String {
    let Id(n) = id
    int.to_string(n)
}

show(user.id)
show(post.id)
</code></pre>
<p>The ability to restrict or open up functions to different <code>Id</code>s is where a lot of the power with phantom types comes from. </p>
<h2 id="example-two-handling-money">Example Two: Handling money.</h2>
<p>Let's consider another scenario. We want to build an application that can handle monetary transactions such that we can easily work with currencies of the same type, but different currencies must be explicitly converted via an exchange rate before they can be used together.</p>
<p>Similar to our id scenario, the underlying representation for a value of currency is always the same.</p>
<pre><code>pub opaque type Currency(a) {
  Currency(Float)
}

pub fn from_float (x: Float) -&gt; Currency(a) {
  Currency(x)
}
</code></pre>
<p>As before, our <code>Currency</code> type has a single type parameter that we'll use to <em>tag</em> values with a particular type of currency. We also need to define some types to act as our currency tags. Because these types are only used for annotations, we'll make them opaque. </p>
<pre><code>pub opaque type USD { USD }
pub opaque type GBP { GBP }
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use everything we've defined so far to create some different currencies.</p>
<pre><code>let dollars: Currency(USD) = from_float(2.50)
let pennies: Currency(GBP) = from_float(0.55)
</code></pre>
<p>Right now we have some currency values, but we can't do a whole lot with them. While they're wrapped up in our <code>Currency</code> type, we can't use any arithmetic operators or pass these values to functions expecting <code>Float</code>s.</p>
<p>Let's remedy that by writing two functions, <code>update</code> and <code>combine</code>. We'll use <code>update</code> to apply a function to the value wrapped by a <code>Currency</code>, and we'll use <code>combine</code> to apply a function to two <code>Currency</code> values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 For other data structures these functions might be called <code>map</code> and <code>map2</code>. These imply the type can change, for example <code>list.map</code> can be used to turn a <code>List(a)</code> into a <code>List(b)</code>. </p>
<p>Because we want to preserve the type (so we can't convert <code>Currency(USD)</code> to <code>Currency(GBP)</code>) we give these functions different names so there aren't any mismatched expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>pub fn update (a: Currency(a), f: fn (Float) -&gt; Float) -&gt; Currency(a) {
  let Currency(x) = a
  x |&gt; f |&gt; from_float
}

pub fn combine (a: Currency(a), b: Currency(a), f: fn (Float, Float) -&gt; Float) -&gt; Currency(a) {
    let Currency(x) = a
    let Currency(y) = b
    f(x, y) |&gt; from_float
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because the type parameter for <code>Currency</code> doesn't change (these function take a <code>Currency(a)</code> and return a <code>Currency(a)</code>), they can't change the tag of any currency passed in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Both <code>update</code> and <code>combine</code> are examples of <strong>higher-order functions</strong>.  That is, they are functions that take <em>other functions</em> as one of their arguments (or return a new function themselves).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can use these two functions to define some more functions so we can actually <em>do</em> things with currency values, like doubling something or adding two currencies together.</p>
<pre><code>pub fn double (a: Currency(a)) -&gt; Currency(a) {
    update(a, fn (x) { x * 2 })
}

pub fn add (a: Currency(a), b: Currency(a)) -&gt; Currency(a) {
    combine(a, b, fn (x, y) { x + y })
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can call these functions with any type of currency, but for something like <code>add</code> we get compile-time safety that ensures we only add two currencies of the same type.</p>
<pre><code>double(dollars)       //=&gt; from_float(5.00): Currency(USD)
add(pennies, pennies) //=&gt; from_float(1.10): Currency(GBP)

add(dollars, pennies) //=&gt; I won't compile!
</code></pre>
<p>But what if we <em>want</em> to add two currencies together? To do that we need a way of converting one currency to another with an exchange rate. We can use phantom types again here to define an</p>
<p><code>Exchange</code> type that describes the exchange rate from one currency to another.</p>
<pre><code>pub opaque type Exchange (from, to) {
    Exchange(Float)
}

pub fn exchange_rate (r: Float) -&gt; Exchange(from, to) {
    Exchange(r)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, just like we did for currencies, we can define an exchange rate to go from <code>GBP</code> to <code>USD</code> (and vice versa).</p>
<pre><code>let gbp_to_usd: Exchange(GBP, USD) = exchange_rate(1.41)
let usd_to_gbp: Exchange(USD, GBP) = exchange_rate(0.71)
</code></pre>
<p>Using everything we know about phantom types, we can define a <code>convert</code> function that is type safe; we'll never be able to pass in the wrong exchange rate because all the phantom types have to match up!</p>
<pre><code>pub fn convert (a: Currency(from), e: Exchange(from, to)) -&gt; Currency(to) {
    let Currency(x) = a
    let Exchange(r) = e
    x *. r |&gt; from_float
}
</code></pre>
<p>Although our module provided the <code>USD</code> and <code>GBP</code> types to act as currency tags, the functions we've written are general to all currencies but retain their type safety. If consumers of the module want to define another type of currency, they can do that and our functions will still work.</p>

<p>So far the two examples we have seen in <code>Id</code> and <code>Currency</code> have been used to provide a general API across types …</p></div></div>

<p>February 25, 2021</p>
<p><img src="https://www.coconutlizard.co.uk/images/article/missing.jpg" alt="Missing">
</p>
<div>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>It's been quite a while now since we last used PVS-Studio, an excellent static code analysis tool, on UE4. So we fired it up - not expecting much, to be honest, as the last time we ran the tool, UE4 was looking pretty clean. With a mixture of pulling across our recommended changes and making fixes themselves, the engine was looking much more stable.</p>
<p>Years have passed since then, though, new systems have been added, code has been overhauled, changes have been made across the board. So we were keen to see whether any problems could be found.</p>
<p>This blog post is here.. and we're not about to end it here.. so let's roll on. In this first new look, we're investigating some performance optimizations identified for Sequencer.</p> </div>

<div>
<h3>PVS Issue V822: Object is Created Where a Reference is Expected</h3>
<p>"The analyzer has detected an issue where a new object is created instead of a reference to an already existing object. The creation of an unnecessary object takes up some amount of time and memory."</p>
<p>This is a common problem and one that we've seen before. When a function returns a reference to an object, the callee can either use the reference directly or use it to make a copy of an object - this latter option often being much more expensive and, usually, not necessary.</p> </div>

<p>The first case that we'll look at is in SequencerSectionCategoryNode.cpp. Take a look at the following code:-</p>
<div>
<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-highlight="79" data-enlighter-lineoffset="72">FSlateFontInfo FSequencerSectionCategoryNode::GetDisplayNameFont() const
{
	bool bAllAnimated = false;
	for (TSharedRef&lt;FSequencerDisplayNode&gt; ChildNode : GetChildNodes())
	{
		if (ChildNode-&gt;GetType() == ESequencerNode::KeyArea)
		{
			const FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode KeyAreaNode = static_cast&lt;const FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode&amp;&gt;(ChildNode.Get());
			for (const TSharedRef&lt;IKeyArea&gt;&amp; KeyArea : KeyAreaNode.GetAllKeyAreas())
			{
				FMovieSceneChannel* Channel = KeyArea-&gt;ResolveChannel();
				if (!Channel || Channel-&gt;GetNumKeys() == 0)
				{
					return FSequencerDisplayNode::GetDisplayNameFont();
				}
				else
				{
					bAllAnimated = true;
				}
			}
		}
	}</pre> </div>
<p>Note the highlighted line. We're taking a reference to a&nbsp;FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode and storing it as a new object, KeyAreaNode. Looking at the following code you can easily see that only a reference is needed. So we change the line to:-</p>
<div>
<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-lineoffset="79">const FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode&amp; KeyAreaNode = static_cast&lt;const FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode&amp;&gt;(ChildNode.Get());</pre> </div>
<p>Believe it or not but this single character change, on my system at least, reduced that function from 2,567 bytes of machine code to 567 - a saving of around 78%. It also dropped some calls to Realloc() and Free() - so this is a significant improvement for sure. What performance improvement this might give would depend I guess on what's visible in Sequencer.</p>

<p>Next up, let's look at this block of code from SequencerNodeTree.cpp:-</p>
<div>
<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-highlight="1201" data-enlighter-lineoffset="1199">case ESequencerNode::KeyArea:
{
	const FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode KeyAreaNode = static_cast&lt;const FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode&amp;&gt;(StartNode.Get());
	for (const TSharedRef&lt;IKeyArea&gt;&amp; KeyArea : KeyAreaNode.GetAllKeyAreas())
	{
		FMovieSceneChannel* Channel = KeyArea-&gt;ResolveChannel();
		if (Channel)
		{
			if (Filters-&gt;Num() == 0 || Filters-&gt;PassesAnyFilters(Channel))
			{
				bPassedAnyFilters = true;
				break;
			}
		}
	}
</pre> </div>
<p>As in the last case, we could be using a reference here. So we can go ahead and change the line to:-</p>
<div>
<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-lineoffset="1201">const FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode&amp; KeyAreaNode = static_cast&lt;const FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode&amp;&gt;(StartNode.Get());</pre> </div>
<p>While the output code this time is only marginally smaller, it means we're not calling the contructor for&nbsp;FSequencerSectionKeyAreaNode, which in turn isn't copying the KeyAreas TArray, which presumably could be quite large:-</p>
<div>
<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-lineoffset="87">TArray&lt;TSharedRef&lt;IKeyArea&gt;&gt; KeyAreas;</pre> </div>

<p>The third and final finding in this theme for today is also in SequencerNodeTree.cpp around line 1140:-</p>
<div>
<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-highlight="1140" data-enlighter-lineoffset="1136">case ESequencerNode::Object:
{
	bIsTrackOrObjectBinding = true;

	const FSequencerObjectBindingNode ObjectNode = static_cast&lt;const FSequencerObjectBindingNode&amp;&gt;(StartNode.Get());
	for (TWeakObjectPtr&lt;&gt;&amp; Object : Sequencer.FindObjectsInCurrentSequence(ObjectNode.GetObjectBinding()))
	{
		if (Object.IsValid() &amp;&amp; (Filters-&gt;Num() == 0 || Filters-&gt;PassesAnyFilters(Object.Get(), StartNode-&gt;GetDisplayName()))
			&amp;&amp; LevelTrackFilter-&gt;PassesFilter(Object.Get()))
		{
			bPassedAnyFilters = true;
			break;
		}
	}
</pre> </div>
<p>Exactly the same problem again... so let's go ahead and change that to:-</p>
<div>
<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-lineoffset="1140">const FSequencerObjectBindingNode&amp; ObjectNode = static_cast&lt;const FSequencerObjectBindingNode&amp;&gt;(StartNode.Get());</pre> </div>
<div>
<p>This time let me show you a little of the machine code that's generated from this C++, for Win64 platforms, just so that you can clearly see the difference.</p>
<p>Here's how the code looked before adding the reference:-</p> </div>
<div>
<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp">const FSequencerObjectBindingNode ObjectNode = static_cast&lt;const FSequencerObjectBindingNode&amp;&gt;(StartNode.Get());

00007FF854331E01  mov         rbx,qword ptr [r15]  
00007FF854331E04  mov         rdx,rbx  
00007FF854331E07  lea         rcx,[rbp+260h]  
00007FF854331E0E  call        FSequencerDisplayNode::FSequencerDisplayNode (07FF8542E3CC0h)  
00007FF854331E13  lea         rax,[FSequencerObjectBindingNode::`vftable' (07FF8545E0118h)]  
00007FF854331E1A  mov         qword ptr [rbp+260h],rax  
00007FF854331E21  movups      xmm0,xmmword ptr [rbx+80h]  
00007FF854331E28  movaps      xmmword ptr [rbp+2E0h],xmm0  
00007FF854331E2F  mov         eax,dword ptr [rbx+90h]  
00007FF854331E35  mov         dword ptr [rbp+2F0h],eax  </pre> </div>
<p>And here's how it looked after - you might notice that it's a little bit more compact ;-)</p>
<div>
<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp">const FSequencerObjectBindingNode&amp; ObjectNode = static_cast&lt;const FSequencerObjectBindingNode&amp;&gt;(StartNode.Get());

00007FF854461F67  mov         r15,qword ptr [rsi]</pre> </div>

<div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The above problems wouldn't be easy to find without the right tools. On this occasion I used PVS-Studio and looked out for some of the standout warnings. Good memory tracking tools can also help with this when the problems are happening in performance-critical code.</p>
<p>The downside to static analysis is hinted at by that first word - static. The analyser looks at the entire codebase and will find problems in code that perhaps is never even called .. or find optimizations in code that's called 2 or 3 times per hour. That shouldn't stop you from using one of these, though - often they'll find a diamond in the rough. We've seen many, many before.</p>
<p>Now go find your own.</p>
<p>Feel free to check out PVS Studio here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/</a>&nbsp;.. check out their blog too for some excellent nuggets that they've found in various bits of software (commercial and free).</p> </div>

Luckily an el-rando, now friend, saw that I was in need and reached out:</p><blockquote>"Heading camping to Stradbroke week after next if you want to totally unplug. <strong>If you need anything, let me know</strong>."</blockquote><p>I just want to say, thank-you. I needed that. </p><p>Dear reader, if you ever find yourself in crisis or a situation similar to mine please do not hesitate to <a href="https://ghuntley.com/contact">contact me</a> if you need a shoulder or advice. You deserve to live a life that makes you happy and not miserable.</p><p>People often ask me what got you interested in #vanlife, now you know. It wasn't an interest as-per-say but more of a necessity and a key ingredient to ensuring my children would grow up with a father in their lives. </p><p>I first heard about the concept of #vanlife back in 2015 after reading this article about a <a href="https://jalopnik.com/google-software-engineer-lives-in-a-van-to-avoid-san-fr-1737619550">Google employee who lived in a box-truck in the company's parking lot</a>:</p><blockquote>“I realized I was paying an exorbitant amount of money for the apartment I was staying in — and I was almost never home,” he says. “It’s really hard to justify throwing that kind of money away. You’re essentially burning it — you’re not putting equity in anything and you’re not building it up for a future — and that was really hard for me to reconcile"</blockquote><p>The events that followed the Stradbroke camping trip put me on a path towards thinking about okay, what-next and how will I get there? Fast-forward a couple of months later I found myself on my own month-long camping trip down in Tasmania where I learned some important life lessons, bushcraft skills and met some <a href="https://www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/2015/10/australia-at-home-in-crunchy-town/">interesting characters</a>, some of whom were living #vanlife.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/93956755_10157390553498505_8259160674995798016_o.jpg" width="1438" height="772" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/93956755_10157390553498505_8259160674995798016_o.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/93956755_10157390553498505_8259160674995798016_o.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/93956755_10157390553498505_8259160674995798016_o.jpg 1438w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/1-dLCs9WWLvE1Goul018u-Jg-1.jpeg" width="2000" height="2872" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/1-dLCs9WWLvE1Goul018u-Jg-1.jpeg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/1-dLCs9WWLvE1Goul018u-Jg-1.jpeg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/1-dLCs9WWLvE1Goul018u-Jg-1.jpeg 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/1-dLCs9WWLvE1Goul018u-Jg-1.jpeg 2162w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/IMG_20200222_091110.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/IMG_20200222_091110.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/IMG_20200222_091110.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/IMG_20200222_091110.jpg 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/IMG_20200222_091110.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-15-36.jpg" width="2000" height="914" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-15-36.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-15-36.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-15-36.jpg 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-15-36.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-14-28.jpg" width="2000" height="872" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-14-28.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-14-28.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-14-28.jpg 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-14-28.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-18-14.jpg" width="2000" height="856" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-18-14.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-18-14.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-18-14.jpg 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/2021-02-23_14-18-14.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/IMG_20200308_082035-1.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/IMG_20200308_082035-1.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/IMG_20200308_082035-1.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/IMG_20200308_082035-1.jpg 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/IMG_20200308_082035-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/Alana-Una-Divine.jpg" width="960" height="720" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Alana-Una-Divine.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/Alana-Una-Divine.jpg 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/26756404_10155262413212066_7256284448836424591_o.jpg" width="1440" height="1080" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/26756404_10155262413212066_7256284448836424591_o.jpg 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/26756404_10155262413212066_7256284448836424591_o.jpg 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/26756404_10155262413212066_7256284448836424591_o.jpg 1440w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div></figure><p>I was amazed at the quality of life these people had, how they were able to make ends meet and their resourcefulness.

A large part of that is due to some early advice I received from a man who had also recently divorced:</p><blockquote>It will all work out. Just keep the focus on the kids and relationship will improve. We're at the stage where my ex will come around and have drinks with my girlfriend and I. You have drop everything (hurt, money, etc) from before on the floor and move past it. You'll be much happier.</blockquote><p>To that person, thank you for sharing your perspectives and advice on how to ensure that, unlike you see in the movies, co-parenting does not need to be adversarial.</p><figure><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2021/02/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-2.png 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image-2.png 1000w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/image-2.png 1600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/image-2.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>So, in summary - everything has been going well but there was still one thing left to resolve:</p><p>✔️ housing.<br>✔️ conflict free co-parenting.<br>✔️ children having quality time with their father.<br>🚧 <em>meaningful </em>work</p></div><p>Approx 21% to 35% of our time awake is spent at work and every two years that goes by at a company you don't like (or unemployed) is wasting 2% of your working life.

            <p>Welcome to the third part of this series aimed to help you unleash a power never seen on Earth using the Almighty Vim. If you don’t understand what’s happening in this article, I recommend you to read the previous ones of the series first:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-beginner/">Vim for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-intermediate/">Vim for intermediate users</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll see together in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some nice keystrokes beginning with <code>g</code>.</li>
<li>What ranges are and how to use them.</li>
<li>The quickfix list and the location lists.</li>
<li>The marvelous substitute command.</li>
<li>The crazy useful <code>:global</code> (or <code>:g</code>) command.</li>
<li>What marks are and what you can do with them.</li>
<li>How to increase and decrease numbers with a single keystroke.</li>
<li>How to sort text with a nice command.</li>
</ul>
<p>But before going into the juicy content of this article, I’ve some recommendations for you, dear reader:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fire up your Vim and play around with the commands and keystrokes while reading. It’s the best way for you to remember everything which blew you away. You’ll then be able to be blown away whenever you like for the rest of your life.</li>
<li>Don’t use a cheatsheet; write your own as you read. It will allow you to come back easily to the commands you find the most useful for <em>your own needs</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enough rambling. Let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="useful-g-keystrokes">Useful “g” Keystrokes</h2>
<p>Let’s begin gently with a mixed bag of keystrokes starting with <code>g</code>. There are many of these “g” commands in Vim, and we already saw some of them in the previous articles. Can you recall them?</p>
<p>You can use these keystrokes in NORMAL mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gf</code> - Edit the file located at the filepath under your cursor.
<ul>
<li>You can use <code>CTRL+W CTRL+F</code> to open the file in a new window.</li>
<li>It can open the URL under your cursor if you have the plugin <code>netrw</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>gx</code> - Open the file located at the filepath under your cursor.
<ul>
<li>It will use the default application used by your OS for this filetype.</li>
<li>It works with URLs too. It will open your favorite browser and load the website.</li>
<li>It only works if you have the plugin <code>netrw</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>gi</code> - Move to the last insertion you did and switch to INSERT mode.
<ul>
<li>Pretty useful if you stopped your editing to look at some other file.</li>
<li>It uses marks under the hood: more on that later in this article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>gv</code> - Start VISUAL mode and use the selection made during the last VISUAL mode.</li>
<li><code>gn</code> - Select the match of your last search:
<ol>
<li>Move to the last searched match.</li>
<li>Switch to VISUAL mode (if you weren’t in VISUAL mode already).</li>
<li>Select the match.</li>
<li>You can continue to hit <code>n</code> (or <code>gn</code>) to select the area between the current match and the next match.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><code>gI</code> - Insert text at the beginning of the line, no matter what the first characters are.
<ul>
<li>The keystroke <code>I</code> insert text <em>just before the first non-blank characters</em> of the line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To try out <code>gf</code> and <code>gx</code>, you can write for example <code>https://www.google.com/</code> in Vim, place your cursor on it, and hit the keystrokes. Don’t forget the trailing slash in your URL.</p>
<p>You’ll soon discover an inconvenience with <code>gx</code>: when you use it on a filepath, Vim will hang till you close the file. That’s why I’ve created the following mapping you can add to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>nnoremap gX :silent :execute
            \ "!xdg-open" expand('%:p:h') . "/" . expand("&lt;cfile&gt;") " &amp;"&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre><p>It maps the keystroke <code>gX</code> to use <code>xdg-open</code>  with the filepath under your cursor. It will open the file with your favorite application <em>in the background</em>. The program <code>xdg-open</code> will only work on Linux-based systems; for MacOS, try <code>open</code> instead.</p>


  




    





  





<h2 id="ranges">Ranges</h2>
<p>Now that we’re done with the appetizers, let’s discover the first real dish of our Vim feast: the ranges. You can apply them to many commands, making them terribly powerful.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>In Vim’s help, every command accepting a range will have the string of characters <code>[range]</code> in front of them. Multiple line specifiers are possible, separated by commas <code>,</code>.</p>
<p>Here are the most interesting ranges you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;number&gt;</code> - Any number <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> in your range refers to a line number.</li>
<li><code>.</code> - Represent the current line (often the default range).</li>
<li><code>$</code> - Represent the last line of the current buffer.</li>
<li><code>%</code> - Represent the entire file (same as <code>1,$</code>).</li>
<li><code>*</code> - Use the last selection you’ve made during the last VISUAL mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, using the command <code>:d</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:1,40d</code> - Delete line 1 to 40 included.</li>
<li><code>:2,$d</code> - Delete every line from the second one till the end of the file.</li>
<li><code>:.,$d</code> - Delete every line from the current one till the end of the file.</li>
<li><code>:%d</code> - Delete every line.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also do some arithmetic with ranges if you want. For example, let’s imagine your cursor is on the line 60: the range <code>.,.+10</code> will be equivalent to the range <code>60,70</code>.</p>
<h3 id="visual-mode-and-range">Visual Mode and Range</h3>
<p>If you switch to COMMAND-LINE mode after doing some selection in VISUAL mode, you’ll see these two symbols appearing: <code>'&lt;</code> and <code>'&gt;</code> with a comma <code>,</code> in between. This is a range too!</p>
<p>The symbols <code>'&lt;</code> represents the first line you’ve selected and <code>'&gt;</code> the last line. Each of these are marks; again, we’ll see more about marks below.</p>
<p>In practice, the ranges <code>'&lt;,'&gt;</code> and <code>*</code> are synonym, but you’ll have more flexibility with the first. For example, you can execute a command from the first line you’ve selected till the end of the file with the range <code>'&lt;,$</code>.</p>


  




    





  

<div>
    
    <div>
         <ul>
<li><code>:help [range]</code></li>
<li><code>:help v_:</code></li>
<li><code>:help '&lt;</code></li>
<li><code>:help '&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
 
    </div>
</div>



<h2 id="vims-quickfix-and-location-list">Vim’s Quickfix And Location List</h2>
<p>Now, let’s talk about a very useful data structure available in Vim, the quickfix list.</p>
<p>Don’t confuse the quickfix list and the quickfix window: these are two different entities. The first is a data structure, the second can display this data structure.</p>
<h3 id="quickfix-lists">Quickfix Lists</h3>
<p>You can think of a quickfix list as a set of positions in one or multiple files.</p>
<h4 id="basics-1">Basics</h4>
<p>Let’s take an example: what happens if you run the command <code>:vimgrep hello *</code>?</p>
<ol>
<li>It will search the pattern “hello” in every file of your working directory.</li>
<li>It will populate a quickfix list with every position matching your pattern “hello”.</li>
<li>It will move your cursor to the first position of the quickfix list.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to know more about vimgrep and other tools you can search with, I <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-search-find-replace/">wrote an article about that</a>. Other commands (like <code>:make</code> or <code>:grep</code>) also populate automatically a quickfix list.</p>
<p>Let’s expand the mystery around marks: these positions in the quickfix list are in fact hidden mark!</p>
<p>The quickfix list is often used to display specific errors in a codebase, often spit out from a compiler or a linter (via the command <code>:make</code> for example), but not only, as we just saw. I call the entries of a quickfix list “positions” to be more general, but sometimes Vim’s help will refer to them as “errors”. Don’t be confused: it’s the same idea.</p>
<p>Among other conditions, a quickfix list entry needs to have a filename for you to be able to jump to its position. Otherwise, the entry doesn’t point to anything. Difficult to move to anything.</p>
<h4 id="useful-commands">Useful Commands</h4>
<p>Here are the commands you can use to navigate through the current quickfix list:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:cl</code> or <code>:clist</code> - Display all valid entries of the current quickfix list. You can add a range as argument (only numbers).</li>
<li><code>:cc &lt;number&gt;</code> - Move to the <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>th entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cnext</code> or <code>:cn</code> - Move to the next entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cprevious</code> or <code>:cp</code> - Move to the previous entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cfirst</code> or <code>:cfir</code> - Move to the first entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:clast</code> or <code>:clas</code> - Move to the last entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are additional commands which make quickfix lists really powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:cdo &lt;cmd&gt;</code> - Execute a command <code>&lt;cmd&gt;</code> on each valid entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cexpr &lt;expr&gt;</code> or <code>:cex &lt;expr&gt;</code> - Create a quickfix list using the result of evaluating the Vimscript expression <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>:caddexpr &lt;expr&gt;</code> or <code>:cadde &lt;expr&gt;</code> - Appends the result of evaluating the Vimscript expression <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> to the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have no clue how to use the last two commands, you can do for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:cex []</code> - Empty the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cex system("&lt;cmd&gt;")</code> - Populate your quickfix list with any shell command <code>&lt;cmd&gt;</code>. You can try it with <code>ls</code> for example.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-quickfix-window">The Quickfix Window</h3>
<p>What about displaying the current quickfix list in a new buffer? You can do that with the following command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:copen</code> or <code>:cope</code> - Open a window (with a special buffer) to show the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only have one quickfix window open. To move to the position of the selected entry of the quickfix list in the quickfix window, hit <code>ENTER</code> or <code>.cc</code>.</p>
<h3 id="location-lists">Location Lists</h3>
<p>A location list is similar to a quickfix list, except that the first is local to a window and the second is global to your Vim instance. In other words, you can have multiple location lists available at the same time (one per window open), but you can only have access to one quickfix list.</p>
<p>The commands for location lists are similar to the ones for the quickfix lists; often, you’ll only have to replace the first <code>c</code> (qui<code>c</code>fix) of the command with <code>l</code> (<code>l</code>ocation).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:lli</code> or <code>:llist</code> - Display all valid entries of the current location list. You can add a range as argument (only numbers).</li>
<li><code>:ll &lt;number&gt;</code> - Move to the entry <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> of the current location list.</li>
<li><code>:lnext</code> or <code>:lne</code> - Move to the next entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>To populate your location list you can also use the commands <code>:lvimgrep</code> or <code>:lmake</code> for example.</p>
<p>Often, Vim users will use the quickfix list for anything related to errors in their codebase, and the location list for search results. But it’s up to you at the end of the day. With Vim, you’re the master of your destiny.</p>

<h2 id="vims-registers">Vim’s Registers</h2>
<p>The registers are another big dish in our Vim feast. You can think of registers as places where you can read or write some text. I like to think about them as Vim’s clipboards.</p>
<h3 id="specifying-a-register">Specifying a Register</h3>
<p>Here’s a command and a NORMAL mode keystroke to display and <em>specify</em> registers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:registers</code> or <code>:reg</code> - Display the content of your registers.</li>
<li><code>"&lt;reg&gt;</code> - This keystroke <em>specif…</em></li></ul></section></article></div></div>

            <h2>A simpler way...</h2>
            <p>
  Started out of dissatisfaction with products like <b>ReactJS</b>, <b>AngularJS</b> and <b>VueJS</b>,
  Ajah is a fairly simple progressive Ajaxifier for your web application, adding
  Ajax-style requests and reload-less updates to your site without breaking
  compatibility with <b>non-JS</b> clients.
			
			</p>
			
			            <p>
  On a link or form button:
  </p>
<pre>data-ajah-replace="&lt;id of the node to inject&gt;"

<p>
	Ajah is free and open source (BSD-like license).

<div><p>
  On a link, <b>Ajah</b> reads the href to fetch the <b>HTML</b>.</p><p>
  On a form button, <b>Ajah</b> reads the action/method attribute of the form,
  submits the form and injects the resulting HTML from the redirected request,
  this works with both <b>GET/POST</b> forms. </p><p>
  
  On buttons outside of forms, the form-attribute
  will be respected.
  </p><p>
  You can only perform one <b>AJAH-request</b> at a time (the system will
  lock itself), you can use the <i>data-ajah-lock="locked"</i> attribute in your CSS.
  </p><p>
  Hashes in URLs are also respected.

            <p>
            
              <b>Ajah</b> emits the following custom events for advanced uses:
 </p>
 <table>
	<tbody><tr><td>AJAHAttach</td><td>before attaching event listeners</td></tr>
	<tr><td>AJAHLoadStart</td><td>before the HTTP request</td></tr>
	<tr><td>AJAHLoadDone</td><td>after receiving HTTP status 200, before callback</td></tr>
	<tr><td>AJAHLoadFinish</td><td>after callback</td></tr>
	<tr><td>AJAHHTTPError</td><td>in case of HTTP error</td></tr>
 </tbody></table>
  <div>
	  <p>
	You can also manually call <b>Ajah</b>, for instance to implement progressive 'infinite scroll':
	</p></div>
 <pre>function load_more(node) {
 if( node.scrollTop &gt;= 
 (node.scrollHeight - node.offsetHeight)) {
	var oldNode = document.getElementById(`page-${page++}`);
	Ajah.load({
		url: `?page=${page}`,
		id: `page-${page}`,
		node: oldNode,
		apply: 'after' });
 }
}

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613466945845/4IA1RiWoR.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>It’s the era of the Internet of things(IoT), of driverless cars that talk to automated garage doors, that in turn talk to a house’s lighting system, which knows just when its owner who has an artificial pacemaker walks in. This individual’s artificial pacemaker talks to his mobile device, which talks to his doctor. The point is, everything is talking to every other thing. And it is fastly becoming the new normal. There’s no stopping it, there are only more and more developments coming up. So, why should you be concerned about these talkative devices and sensors? Well, because a human-like you can talk to all your devices without your permission, yes, including the artificial pacemaker stimulating the next heartbeat of an individual with such an implant. So I've compiled a list of things I know about cybersecurity that I think you should too. 
It’s not an exhaustive list, it’s a personal one meant to spread awareness and cause you to take actionable steps to protect your present and future interests and assets and maybe even your life. 
Here are the standard methods I use:</p>
<p><strong>Protect your data:</strong> 
This had to come first as it’s the most important. Protect your data online and offline. Be careful about how you respond to unsolicited calls and emails. Try not to share debit card details or anything personal. No matter who the caller claims to be, don’t share any passwords, or other private details. If the person is genuinely from a service you’ve subscribed to, then surely they can afford to call back later. Later, being a time when you’ve confirmed the identity of the caller directly from the service provider. By service provider, I’m referring to banks, Internet Service providers, or any other subscription service. It is important to also state here that you should always do your own research. The more you know about the services and promos your bank or subscription service is offering, the easier it is for you to detect lies when you receive unsolicited emails, calls, and text messages from phishers. 
Lastly, don’t be too quick to provide your email address or other personal details to apps or other internet services(more on this later). </p>
<p><strong>Use VPNs:</strong>
 VPN stands for Virtual private network. A virtual private network is a service that provides a secure and encrypted connection for its users by hiding their IP addresses. Think of a VPN as your personal invisibility cloak. It enables you to have a high degree of anonymity online and allows you to go to places you normally wouldn’t be allowed to if the gatekeepers could see you. Pretty neat right? It’s mostly legal to use VPNs. I used 'mostly' because some countries that censor websites or outrightly ban access to external networks also have bans placed on VPN use. China has a ban on most VPNs but it has a list of state-allowed VPNs. That defeats the purpose of using a VPN because they can track the users of such sanctioned VPNs. Also, hackers gain access to people’s computers through their IP addresses. So if you’re using a VPN, you’re doing yourself a world of good, as your VPN provides you with its own IP address and any attack would be directed at its own secure servers, not your computer or mobile device. </p>
<p><strong>Use Password managers:</strong>
There are a number of secure and easy-to-use password managers out there where you can safely store your passwords and you’ll be given a master key which you should keep offline, don’t go saving it somewhere on your device. I repeat keep your master key offline. A good number of these managers are paid products, but there are free ones such as bitwarden(I use this and I recommend it). Bitwarden uses salt hashing(a really cool way of encrypting your data such that in the unlikely eventuality of a breach, the attackers would only see gibberish and not your real password), and other technologies to keep your data safe and secure. In addition, Bitwarden randomly generates safe passwords for you. A rule of thumb for the creation of safe passwords is that “passwords shouldn’t be memorable”. If you can easily remember your password, then it’s probably not as strong or as safe as you think because, hackers use really complex algorithms to crack passwords these days. So a password manager such as bitwarden is a safer choice. </p>
<p><strong>Use authenticators:</strong> 
You probably are used to the not-so-recent trend in registering for online services where you have to set up two-factor authentication. Well, it’s a pretty good trend. But, there’s a catch, if you’re using text message or email as your factors then you’re at risk of a man-in-the-middle(MITM) attack. A man-in-the-middle attack is one in which an attacker is able to intercept communication between two parties. The MITM then alters the messages as they desire in order to gain access to secure data. This is where the use of authenticators comes in handy. Authenticators work by generating a passcode that is created from a secret code shared between you and the authentication service. Examples of authentication services are the Google authenticator app, kraken, and bitwarden. </p>
<p><strong>Practice safe online habits:</strong>
Safe online habits such as being cautious about the links you click on, checking and double-checking websites you visit to be sure they aren’t cloned versions, and keeping your personal life as far away as possible from the online space are vital in ensuring online attackers can’t get to you through phishing. Phishing is a method of hacking that crackers use to obtain valuable information from unsuspecting individuals by stealing sensitive data through various means in a bid to create a profile of the individual which they then use to access the individual's private accounts(bank, social media, crypto wallets, etc). 
Other cybersecurity practices are</p>
<ul>
<li>Create multiple emails for different purposes: Use one for all your financial processes, use another for social media, and then use another for the random services you sign up for daily. </li>
<li>Keep your social media accounts as private as possible: Keep important details off of social media. Details like addresses, phone numbers, emails, and location. Keep them private. </li>
<li>Lastly, deep fakes are becoming a thing. The likeness of individuals – their faces, voices, and mannerisms – can be captured and used to impersonate them. So, as much as it depends on you, keep pictures and videos away from the online space.

This feeling of chronic stress that does not subside is rising not just in healthcare professions, but across all types of professions. </span></p><p id="viewer-1kaiu"><span>What often goes unmentioned is that in psychology everything is a spectrum. The difference between someone who is chronically stressed and the person that is burnt out is only in the eye of the clinician. Many people are living with levels of stress that are unhealthy but are not burnt out. </span></p><p id="viewer-1bqdh"><span>Just because someone is functioning at a somewhat normal level does not mean that they should not concern themselves with mental and physical health optimization. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-71nul"><span>We could all get a little better at optimizing our lifestyles to support our human needs. Many of us have a hard time accepting this humanness. Yet like sleep, our need for mental rest and purpose is real and does not go away. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-biii1"><span>I notice a lot of talk about self-care and the need for the individual person to care for their needs. But I would like to draw attention to the fact that burnout and chronic stress are typically environmental. Meaning that burnout is more often caused by the work environment and not by an individual’s self-care routine. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-9m3qv"><span>According to scientists from Berkeley and Rutgers, burnout has <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246546370_Making_a_significant_difference_with_burnout_interventions_Researcher_and_practitioner_collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>six main causes</span></a>:</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-da98q"><p>Unsustainable workload</p></li><li id="viewer-doq1a"><p>Perceived lack of control</p></li><li id="viewer-55t14"><p>Insufficient rewards for effort</p></li><li id="viewer-a9okm"><p>Lack of a supportive community</p></li><li id="viewer-c9lj4"><p>Lack of fairness</p></li><li id="viewer-6an1q"><p>Mismatched values and skills</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-auilq"><span>Many of these causes are difficult to address without organization-wide changes. The opportunity for intervention that may be the most beneficial is in “perceived lack of control”.</span></p><p id="viewer-5utp4"><span>As many of you know who attended my webinar, perception is everything in psychology. And we can shift even our physiological response to stress by shifting our perception. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-4qp9i"><span>So as you start this week, I encourage you to try to shift your thinking around your tasks from, “what do I have to do today?” To: </span></p><p id="viewer-7fjsn"><span><strong>“What am I choosing to do today?”</strong>

</span></p><p id="viewer-7vbjj"><span>Because in reality, almost all the things we do are choices. We do not have to do anything. We file our taxes because we don’t want to go to jail. We make dinner because we want to feed our families well. </span></p><p id="viewer-7lokk"><span>We have so many choices in life and we do the things we choose. Remembering that they are choices is key. </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p>Welcome to the 4th edition of our performance analysis and tuning challenge. If you haven’t participated in our challenges before, we highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/02/Performance-optimization-contest">introductory post</a> first.</p>

<p>The fourth edition of the contest will be run by Ivica Bogosavljevic from <a href="https://johnysswlab.com/">Johny’s Software Lab</a> blog. Ivica also writes about software performance, so feel free to go and check out his blog, there is a ton of useful content there.</p>

<p>The benchmark for the 4th edition is canny edge detection algorithm. The source code, compilation, and run script as well as the test image are available in Denis’ github <a href="https://github.com/dendibakh/perf_challenge4">repo</a>.</p>

<p>Canny is an image edge detector algorithm that exists for a long time. You can find more information about it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector">Wikipedia article</a>. They say an image is worth a thousand words, so here is the before and after image so you can get the impression of how it works.</p>

<p><img src="https://easyperf.net/img/posts/PerfContest/4/221575-small.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://easyperf.net/img/posts/PerfContest/4/22157-canny.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h3>

<p>The implementation used for the challenge is available <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~turkel/notes/canny_source.c">online</a>. The same version (with very few changes) is available in the repository.</p>

<p>To download and build canny do the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/dendibakh/perf_challenge4.git
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>perf_challenge4
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>canny_baseline
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>build
<span># cmake also honors the following env variables:</span>
<span># export CC=/usr/bin/clang</span>
<span># export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++</span>
<span>$ </span>cmake .. <span>-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER</span><span>=</span>clang <span>-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER</span><span>=</span>clang++
<span>$ </span>make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To run the benchmark:</p>


<p>If the program finished correctly, and the image it produced is good, you will see information about the runtime and a message <code>Validation successful</code>.</p>

<p>You may also find useful Denis’ python <a href="https://github.com/dendibakh/perf_challenge4/blob/master/run.py">script</a> for conducting multiple experiments. See the decription inside it.</p>

<p>The target configuration for this challenge is Skylake CPU (e.g. Intel Core i7-6700) + 64-bit Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04) + Clang 10. Although you are free to use whatever environment you have access to. It’s fine if you solve the challenge on Intel, AMD, or ARM CPU. Also, you can do your experiments on Windows<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> or Mac since <code>cmake</code> is used for building the benchmark. The reason why we define the target configuration is to have a unified way to assess all the submissions. In the end, it is not about getting the best score, but about practicing performance optimizations.</p>

<h3 id="couple-of-hints">Couple of hints</h3>

<p>Here is the workflow that I recommend:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Collect the baseline. You can use <code>time</code>, my personal preference is <code>multitime</code> which available in the repositories.</li>
  <li>Find the hotspot. The default choice would be <code>perf record</code>, but again, Intel’s Advisor or Intel’s VTune profiler are my go-to choices, especially for less experienced engineers who are still trying to get a feel on performance tuning.</li>
  <li>Find performance headroom in the hot code:
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the data is accessed sequentially in the innermost loop of the hot code. If the data is accessed with a constant stride, you can try different techniques like loop exchange (exchange inner and outer loop), loop tilling, etc. to move towards sequential accesses.</li>
      <li>Make sure the innermost loop has a high trip count. This will allow compiler optimizations like loop unrolling, vectorization, etc. to speed up the code processing.</li>
      <li>Move all loop-invariant code outside of the loop. Make the innermost loop as compact as possible.</li>
      <li>Run your code through the <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/09/Top-Down-performance-analysis-methodology">TMA</a> or Intel’s VTune profiler to understand which line of code causes the CPU to get stalled (due to cache misses, branch mispredictions, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fix the issue, build the benchmark, run it and compare against the baseline.</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 2-5.</li>
</ol>

<p>Canny is a typical image processing algorithm that runs through the image, sometimes row-wise, sometimes column-wise, and processes pixels. Processing is done in several stages. Collecting the performance profile will help you focus on the right functions; collecting information about stalled cycles will help you understand why that code is slow.</p>

<p>I also have a few general hints:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do not try to understand the whole algorithm</strong>. For some people, it’s crucial to understand how every piece of code works. For the purposes of optimizing it will be wasted effort. There are CPU benchmarks with thousands LOC (like <a href="http://spec.org/cpu2017/">SPEC2017</a>) it’s absolutely impossible to understand them in a reasonable time. What you need to familiarize yourself with, are hotspots. That’s it. You most likely need to understand one function/loop which is not more than 100 LOC.</li>
  <li><strong>You have a specific workload for which you optimize the benchmark</strong>. You don’t need to optimize it for any other input/workload. The main principle behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">Data-oriented design</a> is that you know the data of your application.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel you’re stuck, don’t hesitate to ask questions or look for support elsewhere. I don’t have much time to answer every question promptly, but I will do my best. You can send questions to me directly using the <a href="https://johnysswlab.com/contact/">contact form on my web site</a> or to <a href="https://easyperf.net/contact/">Denis</a>.</p>

<p><strong>See the Q&amp;A post about what optimizations are <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/02/Performance-optimization-contest#q5-what-optimizations-are-allowed">allowed</a> and what <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/02/Performance-optimization-contest#q6-whats-not-allowed">not</a>.</strong></p>

<h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>

<p>If the produced image is correct it will print <code>Validation successful</code>. A slight tolerance between the reference output image and the image produced by your algorithm is allowed in order to fully exploit the hardware’s resources.</p>

<h3 id="submissions">Submissions</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will not use submissions for any commercial purposes. However, we can use the submissions for educational purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The baseline we will be measuring against is Skylake client CPU (e.g. Intel Core i7-6700) with 64-bit Linux and Clang 10 compiler used with options <code>-ffast-math -O3 -march=core-avx2</code>.</p>

<p>We conduct performance challenges via Denis’ mailing list, so it’s a good idea to <a href="https://mailchi.mp/4eb73720aafe/easyperf">subscribe</a> (if you haven’t already) if you would like to submit your solution. The benchmark consists of a single file, so you can just send the modified <code>canny_source.c</code> source file via email to <a href="https://johnysswlab.com/contact/">Ivica</a> or <a href="https://easyperf.net/contact/">Denis</a>. The general rules and guidelines for submissions are described <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/02/Performance-optimization-contest#q7-how-should-the-submission-look-like">here</a>. We also ask you to provide textual description of all the transformations you have made. It will be much easier for us to analyze your submission.</p>

<p><strong>We are collecting submissions until 28th February 2021.</strong></p>

<h3 id="spread-the-word">Spread the word</h3>

<p>If you know someone who might be interested in participating in this challenge, please spread the word about it!</p>

<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I’m also open to your comments and suggestions. Especially if you have a proposal of a benchmark for the next edition of the challenge, please let me know. Finding a good benchmark isn’t easy.</p>

But I needed a few features that were only available in their premium plans.</p>
<p>Instead of upgrading, I decided to build my own version of Calendly. I used <a target="_blank" href="https://appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a> for the UI and APIs by Google Calendar and Zoom to build this.</p>
<p>You can build this too by following the steps below. <a target="_blank" href="https://app.appsmith.com/applications/600186605b452f525458d6d2/pages/600186605b452f525458d6d4">Click here to try mine.</a> Block my time for a live demo 😬</p>
<h2 id="connecting-google-calendar">Connecting Google Calendar</h2>
<p>First, we need to set up an API that can fetch calendar events from my Google Calendar.  I specifically needed to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events/list">list events</a> endpoint. This endpoint is authenticated using OAuth so I also had to grab a <code>refresh token</code> to access my calendar. Ideally, this is done by authenticating the user using the app but because other users need to see <em>my calendar</em>, we'll hardcode this.</p>
<p>To grab a <code>refresh token</code>, you have to create an app in your google cloud console and generate a set of OAuth credentials with a client Id and secret. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Follow <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en">these steps to generate the client ID</a> and come back to the tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You have to then obtain an authorization code by visiting this URL with the client Id and redirect URI (can be any URI. I used <a href="https://app.appsmith.com/applications" target="_blank">app.appsmith.com/applications</a>).</p>
<pre><code><span>https:</span>/<span>/accounts.google.com/o</span><span>/oauth2/v</span>2/auth?client_id=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&gt;&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri=&lt;<span>https:</span>/<span>/app.appsmith.com/applications</span>&gt;&amp;scope=<span>https:</span>/<span>/www.googleapis.com/auth</span><span>/calendar&amp;access_type=offline&amp;prompt=consent</span>
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You will be prompted to grant your google app permission to view and modify your calendar. (You don't need to wait for Google to approve your OAuth app, you can simply use the unapproved version since we're building a personal tool).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once you grant the permission, it will redirect to the URL you provided with a code parameter. This is your authorization code which you can use to generate your refresh token</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>YOUR_REDIRECT_URI</span>&gt;</span>?code=<span>&lt;<span>AUTH_CODE</span>&gt;</span>&amp;scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar
</code></pre><p>Taking the authorization code, I generated my refresh token using the following curl</p>
<pre><code>curl --location --request POST <span>'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token'</span> \
--header <span>'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'code=&lt;YOUR_AUTH_CODE&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'redirect_uri=https://app.appsmith.com/applications'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'client_id=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'client_secret=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'grant_type=authorization_code'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar'</span>
</code></pre><p>This request responds with an Access token &amp; a Refresh token but the Refresh token is all we really need.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="fetching-calendar-events">Fetching Calendar Events</h2>
<p>Now we have a token to talk to our calendar, the next step is to create an Appsmith app and fetch all the calendar events.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for <a target="_blank" href="https://app.appsmith.com/user/signup?">Appsmith</a></li>
<li><p>We first need to create an API to generate Access Tokens using the Refresh token we received from the previous CURL. Use the CURL importer and REST client and then replace our Refresh token in the API client.</p>
<pre><code>curl --location --request POST <span>'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token'</span> \
--header <span>'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'refresh_token=&lt;YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'client_id=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'client_secret=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'grant_type=refresh_token'</span>
</code></pre><p>Let's name this API refresh_token and hit run to fetch a new access token.
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/t33z88sj2jlyfouqlu32.gif"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Configure the refresh_token API to run onPageLoad in the API settings so that we always have a fresh access_token whenever the page is accessed.

</li>
<li><p>We then configure an API to fetch events from our calendar and call it fetch_calendar_events. </p>
<pre><code>curl --location --request GET <span>'https</span>:
--header <span>'Authorization</span>: Bearer &lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;'
</code></pre><p>We don't want to hard code the value of the access token because it expires fairly quickly and we also want the start and end times to be dynamic depending on the current time. To do this, we'll use Javascript and moment.js, both of which can be used in Appsmith by writing '{{ }}' in any field. Use this to reference the value of the <code>access_token</code> returned by our <code>refresh_token</code> API and also use <code>moment.js</code> to configure the default value of the start and end times. The following are the javascript snippets I used in my API.</p>
<pre><code>{{<span>refresh_token</span><span>.data</span><span>.access_token</span>}} 
{{<span>moment</span>()<span>.format</span>(<span>"YYYY-MM-DDT00:mm:ss+05:30"</span>)}} 
{{<span>moment</span>()<span>.add</span>(<span>1</span>,<span>"days"</span>)<span>.format</span>(<span>"YYYY-MM-DDT00:mm:ss+05:30"</span>)}} 
</code></pre><p>Replace the placeholders with the above js snippets and hit run to fetch your calendar events!

<h2 id="displaying-free-slots">Displaying Free Slots</h2>
<p>Once we have the events from our calendars, we need to build out a UI to display these events. Appsmith has a simply DnD interface to build UI. We can use the Table to display our events, a date picker to select which day we should fetch events for, and a dropdown to select the duration of the meeting we'd like our users to schedule. My UI looks <a target="_blank" href="https://app.appsmith.com/applications/600186605b452f525458d6d2/pages/600186605b452f525458d6d4">like this</a> but you can get creative and built something that feels intuitive to you. Be sure to name your widgets well. The naming I'm following in this post is</p>
<ul>
<li>durationDropdown</li>
<li>slotDatePicker</li>
<li>eventsTable
With an idea of the layout and inputs we need, we can configure our Table to display the events our API is returning using javascript. <code>{{fetch_calendar_events.data.items}}</code>
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xgugvgiw145ppqbuetpk.png" alt="Alt Text">
No surprise our table doesn't look very readable because APIs are rarely built to work with views out of the box! Now with a little Javascript we can transform the ugly API response into something human-readable and add some logic to show us the free slots instead of the calendar event. The following code goes into the table data property of the <code>eventsTable</code>.<pre><code>{{
<span><span>function</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
<span>let</span> bookings = fetch_calendar_events.data.items;
<span>let</span> bookingIndex = <span>0</span>;
<span>const</span> startHour = <span>10</span>;
<span>const</span> endHour = <span>20</span>;
<span>let</span> startingTime = moment(slotDatePicker.selectedDate, <span>"DD/MM/YYYY"</span>);
startingTime.hour(startHour);
startingTime.minutes(<span>0</span>);
<span>const</span> hr = startingTime.hour();
<span>let</span> slots = [];
<span>const</span> slotDuration = <span>Number</span>(durationDropdown.selectedOptionValue);
<span>while</span> (startingTime.hour() &lt; endHour) {
  <span>if</span> (startingTime.isBefore(moment())) {
    startingTime = moment();
    <span>if</span> (startingTime.minutes() &gt; <span>30</span>) {
      startingTime.minutes(<span>0</span>);
      startingTime.hour(startingTime.hour() + <span>1</span>);
    } <span>else</span> startingTime.minutes(<span>30</span>);
  }
  <span>const</span> booking = bookings[bookingIndex];
  <span>let</span> bookingStart = <span>undefined</span>;
  <span>if</span> (booking) {
    bookingStart = moment(booking.start.dateTime);
  } <span>else</span> {
    bookingStart = moment(DatePicker1.selectedDate, <span>"DD/MM/YYYY"</span>);
    bookingStart.hour(endHour);
    bookingStart.minutes(<span>0</span>);
  }
  <span>const</span> slotNum = <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.round(moment.duration(bookingStart.diff(startingTime)).asMinutes()) / slotDuration);
  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; slotNum; i++) {
    <span>const</span> slotStartTime = startingTime.format(<span>"HH:mm"</span>);
    startingTime.add(slotDuration, <span>"minutes"</span>);
    <span>const</span> slotEndTime = startingTime.format(<span>"HH:mm"</span>);
    slots.push({
      <span>startTime</span>: slotStartTime,
      <span>endTime</span>: slotEndTime
    });
  }
  startingTime = booking ? moment(booking.end.dateTime) : startingTime.hour(endHour);
  bookingIndex += <span>1</span>;
}
<span>return</span> slots.map(<span>(<span>slot</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>return</span> {
    <span>slot</span>: slot.startTime + <span>" - "</span> + slot.endTime
  }
})
}()
}}
</code></pre>The above logic was really the hardest part of building this application and took the longest to get right (but that was also the most fun part). The code declares a self-invoking function that iterates over the response of the <code>fetch_calendar_events</code> API and adds free time slots to an array <code>slots</code> that is returned by the function. It begins iterating from 10 am to 8 pm (again hardcoding my workday for convenience 😬) and makes use of the value in the <code>durationDropdown</code> to determine the number of free slots of selected duration that can fit between the current available time and the next calendar event.<pre><code><span>const</span> slotNum = <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.round(moment.duration(bookingStart.diff(startingTime)).asMinutes()) / slotDuration);
</code></pre>It then skips to the end of the next busy calendar event and continues this till it reaches the end of my workday!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-calendar-events">Creating Calendar Events</h2>
<p>To schedule a meeting, we can create a button on the table and configure it to open a modal once it is clicked. The modal UI can also be custom-built using DnD to capture a user's name, email, and purpose of the meeting. </p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ozi01s0vdum84jd4olk7.gif"></p>
<p>Name the inputs as <code>nameInput</code>, <code>emailInput</code> and <code>purposeInput</code> so we're able to use them in our API. Let's import the following CURL and name the API create_event</p>
<pre><code>curl 



    "<span>start</span><span>": {
        "</span>dateTime<span>": "</span>&lt;START_TIME&gt;<span>"
    },
    "</span><span>end</span><span>": {
        "</span>dateTime<span>": "</span>&lt;END_TIME&gt;<span>"
    },
    "</span>description<span>": "</span>&lt;DESCRIPTION&gt;<span>",
    "</span>summary<span>": "</span>&lt;TITLE&gt;<span>",
    "</span>attendees<span>": [{ "</span>email<span>": "</span>&lt;EMAIL&gt;<span>" }]
}'</span>
</code></pre><p>In the above API we need to accept dynamic values from our app, so we need to replace some of the params and headers. Below is the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ACCESS_TOKEN</code> with <code>{{refresh_token.data.access_token}}</code>, </li>
<li><code>USER_NAME</code> with <code>{{nameInput.text}}</code>, 
-<code>START_TIME</code> with <code>{{moment(slotDatePicker.selectedDate+" "+eventsTavble.selectedRow.slot.split(" - ")[0], "DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm").toISOString()}}</code>, </li>
<li><code>END_TIME</code> with <code>{{moment(slotDatePicker.selectedDate+" "+eventsTavble.selectedRow.slot.split(" - ")[1], "DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm").toISOString()}}</code>, </li>
<li><code>DESCRIPTION</code> with <code>{{purposeInput.text}}</code>, </li>
<li><code>TITLE</code> with <code>{{nameInput.text + " Meeting with Nikhil"}}</code> and finally</li>
<li><code>EMAIL</code> with <code>{{emailInput.text + " Meeting with Nikhil"}}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With this, our API is reading values from the <code>eventsTable</code> and the <code>slotDatePicker</code> to create the right event for the selected slot (<code>eventsTable.selectedRow</code>). We can now bind the onClick of the confirm button to call the <code>create_event</code> API and close the modal onSuccess.

<h2 id="video-conferencing">Video Conferencing</h2>
<p>Finally I needed it to send out a Zoom link for every event so I integrated with Zoom's APIs and created a zoom link for my calendar events. (This is one of the things I love about Calendly)
To integrate with zoom, we have to fetch a JWT to authenticate our application requests with zoom. I followed <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/auth/jwt">this guide</a>.
With a JWT in hand, it became as easy as importing another CURL and naming it create_zoom</p>
<pre><code>curl

  <p><span>2001-05-11</span></p><h2 id="preface-from-the-future-2013">Preface FROM THE FUTURE!  (2013)</h2>
<p>HQ9+ may wind up being my legacy.  Created as an elaborate (and admittedly
obscure) joke over 12 years ago, it's somehow developed an enduring popularity
that took me completely by surprise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone wrote a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HQ9%2B">Wikipedia article</a> sometime in the mid 2000s, which has
apparently been the subject of an ongoing revert/delete war.  <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/HQ9%2B">Its
counterpart on the Simple English Wikipedia</a> has survived; since HQ9+ is
itself a simple language, this seems fitting.</li>
<li>It's the topic of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2766428/what-is-the-accumulator-in-hq9">at least one Stack Overflow question</a>.</li>
<li>I still get interpreter implementations in my inbox, which unfortunately I
never have time to post here.</li>
<li>Several colleagues at Google, mostly from the programming languages
community, have asked if I'm "that" Cliff L. Biffle — "the one who wrote
HQ9+?"  (<em>Wrote</em> is too strong a word, since I never released an
implementation.)</li>
<li>This may be apocryphal, but someone once told me they heard HQ9+ mentioned
in a talk by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele_Jr.">Guy Steele</a>, who is an <em>actual programming language designer.</em>
If true, this is hilarious.</li>
</ul>
<p>In hindsight, HQ9+ is the first in a series of minimal, highly-optimized runtime
designs that has led to my Forth implementations and my work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client">Native
Client</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Level_Virtual_Machine">LLVM</a>.</p>
<p>After a redesign of my website in 2010, the HQ9+ page went away.  Three years
later I'm still getting several hits per week.  So, I've recreated it using the
exact text from my old website — preserved as a historical artifact except
for this preface.</p>
<p>I'd like to give shouts out to the research community for extending HQ9+:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/hq9plusplus.html">David Morgan-Mar's HQ9++</a> adds object-oriented features, which one needs
to complete any language tutorial since the late 90s.</li>
<li><a href="http://melikamp.com/features/hq9pm.shtml">Melikamp's HQ9+-</a> adds support for modern error handling paradigms,
including asynchronous exceptions, user-defined exception types, and syntax
checking.</li>
<li><a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/HQ9%2B2D">Kenner Gordon's HQ9+2D</a> extends the instruction space to two dimensions,
which is an improvement for writing complex programs, but seems like it would
scale poorly compared to a proper <a href="http://cliffle.com/esoterica/hq9plus/4dl.html">four dimensional language</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>HQ9+ is a <em>tutorial-complete</em> programming language, but I often receive
complaints that it is not <em>Turing-complete</em> — typically from people who are
not <em>sense-of-humor-complete</em>.  To such critics, I offer a variant, HQ9+T; the
new <code>T</code> instruction is a programming language combinator that transforms an
existing language into a Turing-complete superset.  Unfortunately there is not
enough room in this preface for my implementation.  [<em>Edit:</em> I am not <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/CHIQRSX9%2B">the
first to make this joke!</a>]</p>
<p>Original content follows.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-research">The Research</h2>
<p>Over winter break of 2000-2001, I ran across Brainf*ck and other extraordinarily esoteric languages. As most students of programming do, I began searching for examples of these languages to help me learn. A great many examples were available, from a great many different authors, but I soon began to notice a pattern: these examples fell neatly into a few categories.</p>
<h3 id="hello-world">Hello, World!</h3>
<p>The quintessential example in any programming language was invented by K&amp;R in their C tutorial. It's called the Hello World. When a Hello World program is run, it--can you guess?--prints "Hello, world!" to the screen (or teletype or laser-projecting-on-clouds or whatever). This is generally a simple one-line easily-readable statement, which is why it makes for a good first example. (One of the most common exercises for esoteric languages, however, is to make the Hello World as obtuse and and mind-bendingly complex as possible. Take a look at the program that prints "Hi" in <a href="https://cliffle.com/esoterica/beatnik.html">Beatnik</a>.  The full Hello World would be about twelve times as long.)</p>
<h3 id="99-bottles-of-beer-on-the-wall">99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall</h3>
<p>The next set of examples I ran across originated on Usenet many years ago: programs that attempt to print the entire canonical lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" in the smallest (or craziest) code possible. This is an excellent exercise in recursive, iterative programming, and I knew I had to take it into account.</p>
<h3 id="quines">Quines</h3>
<p>The next (particularly cool) set of examples were called "quines." A quine reproduces its source code to the screen. This is more difficult than it sounds, because very few languages have methods for accessing their own source code. Take this pseudocode example:</p>
<pre>print "print "print "print .....
</pre>
<p>As you can see, to simply print the source code of a program as a literal string (like I tried to do there), your program quickly becomes <em>infinitely</em> long. Thus, quines require the programmer to use all sorts of crazy tricks, making them a wonderful exercise.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>As a result of this research, I created a language called HQ9+. HQ9+ is a very simple language consisting of four operations: H, Q, 9, and +. These operations can be used to create any of the types of example programs described above. They work as follows:</p>
<pre>H  Prints "Hello, world!"
Q  Prints the entire text of the source code file.
9  Prints the complete canonical lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"
+  Increments the accumulator.
</pre>
<p>HQ9+ is very simple, but allows you to do some things that are very difficult in other languages. For example, here is a program that creates four — count 'em, four — copies of itself on the screen:</p>
<pre>qqqq
</pre>
<p>This produces:</p>
<pre>qqqq
qqqq
qqqq
qqqq
</pre>
<p>Wow! Wasn't that straightforward?</p>
<h2 id="interpreters">Interpreters</h2>
<p>HQ9+ was well-accepted by the esoteric languages community, and a flurry of interpreters for it, written in every language available, were released. Most of those have been lost to the winds of time (or rather, the winds of my delete key), but I'm working on re-collecting them for distribution here. Those that I've managed to find are listed below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Because while frameworks like Django claim that “templates include a restricted
language to avoid for the HTML coder to shoot themself in the foot”, the GoF on
the other hand states that Decorator is the pattern that is most efficient for
designing GUIs, which is actually a big part of the success encountered by
frameworks such as React.</p><p>Ryzom basically offers Python Components, with extra sauce of bleeding edge
features such as “<a href="https://yourlabs.io/oss/ryzom/-/blob/dc218062/src/ryzom_mdc.py#L441-470">compiling Python code to
JS</a>”,
and “<a href="https://yourlabs.io/oss/ryzom/-/blob/dc218062/src/ryzom_django/pubsub.py">data
binding</a>”
which is “DOM refreshes itself when data changes in the DB” if you enable
websockets. Currently support Django, but Starlette is also planned in the near
future.</p><p>Currently in Beta stage, we are brushing up for a production release in an Open
Source project for an NGO defending democracy, with an online voting platform
secured with homomorphic encryption, basically a Django project built on top of
microsoft/electionguard-python.</p><p>It’s <strong>not</strong> ready for general use, but should hopefully be pretty soon…
after all, this project has been under R&amp;D sponsored by YourLabs for years now.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>django</span> <span>import</span> <span>forms</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  					<p>I think the first thing we should discuss is: what is an exception. In a short definition: an exception is a notification of an execution error occurrence.</p>
<p>What kind of errors can occur: programming errors and system failure.</p>
<p>Wait! How is a programming error different from a system failure? Let me explain: A programming error is an error that could have been avoided with a little more attention, an error that can only be resolved by a programmer. Why? Because the error is his fault. I’ll give you a clear example of this: every time the <strong>NullPointerException</strong> is thrown, is because you didn’t check if the object instance was null before you use it. Isn’t it? That’s a programming error. Programming errors in java are defined as <strong>Unchecked Exceptions</strong>. Java does not obligate you to catch this kind of exceptions. Why? Cause you can avoid them by programming correctly or with more attention and discipline.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a system failure error is a non programming error that is stopping the system from reaching a goal. For example: we are inserting a record into a database and suddenly an <strong>SQLException</strong> is thrown by the <strong>Statement</strong> object, notifying us that the connection to the database was lost due to network problem. The connection loss is not a programming error, you couldn’t have avoided it. These kind of exceptions are denominated <strong>Checked Exceptions</strong> in Java.</p>
<p>Now that we agree on what exceptions are, lets get back to the headline of this post : <strong>When things go wrong, please don’t make em worst</strong>.</p>
<p>What was the point here?</p>
<p>Look, an exception is a notification of something bad. What I was trying to say is: act correctly when you receive that notification. Don’t ignore it, you will make it worst. But what do I mean by “don’t ignore it”? To be more specific, first: never have empty catch blocks like that one on the cover picture of this post.</p>
<p>When you catch an exception, you are supposed to do something about it and not just hide it. Why? “Why do I have to do something about it?”. I can hear you. Let me make it clear for you once and for all:</p>
<ol>
<li>An exception is an indication of a bad thing</li>
<li>Bad things should not happen repeatedly on reliable systems</li>
<li>We have to avoid the occurrence of bad things, reduce them.</li>
<li>To reduce the occurrence of bad things we have first to know that they happened.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will repeat the number 4: <strong>To reduce the occurrence of bad things we have first to know that they happened</strong>. If you wrap your exceptions in an empty catch block, you will never know they happened and you will never ever have a reliable system. You have to let the others know. It should not be something you keep in secret. If you don’t want to do something about it, just don’t catch it, make you method throw it or re-throw it inside your catch block (usually a bad practice).</p>
<p>What is the best way of letting the people know that something bad happened (an exception was thrown)?</p>
<p>A log file. Logging the errors makes it easier for anyone to know that something bad happened. Why a log file? Why don’t I just call the ex.printStackTrace()? Printing the stack trace on your console will show the error to you while you still programming and running tests, but what if someone comes and closes the console or the console just quits? What if you want to run your application on a remote server? How will you be able to detect the bad things without the console? A log file is your best shot. You might not use a file, use a database, anything, just log it.</p>
<p>Wait MJ. You want me to log every single exception I catch? I say: Log every exception that will help you improve your system or detect an anomaly. Don’t log exceptions because I told you to. Log them after understanding the value it will add.</p>
<h3>Log and keep quiet?</h3>
<p>Remember that exception are thrown by methods. If a method catches an exception that it finds interesting to log, then it logs it. It doesn’t mean you log it and keep quiet. Tell the method that called your method that something went wrong: re-throw the exception or wrap it in another.</p>
<p>I keep saying “Wrap it” or “Re-throw” and you might be asking yourself what the hell each of that things mean? Wrapping an exception means to create an exception of another type, set the current exception as its cause and them throw it . Why would you wrap an exception? For abstraction and separation of concerns. If for example you have a DAO class that inserts records into a database using <strong>JDBC</strong>: your DAO methods should not throw the <strong>SQLException</strong>, they should throw a different kind of exception. Why? Because one day your DAO can stop using JDBC, meaning it wont throw the <strong>SQLException</strong> anymore, so, You have to create your own exception type and wrap the original cause when throwing the exception. Congratulations, you just met the so called “<strong>abstraction</strong>“. Re-throwing an exception on the other hand, means to throw the same exception instance inside a catch block.</p>
<p>How do you create your own programming exception? you create a class that extends java.lang.RuntimeException (programmer will not be forced to catch). To create a non programming exception (programmer will be forced to catch) you create a class that extends java.lang.Exception.</p>
<p>How do you throw an Exception without having to create your own class?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEpEj1UYHU8PQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520423999442?e=1619654400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=75xWngiFGQdcDINjacFDLSkUYYr0x4CvH0_ysDu4AmQ" width="1312" height="922"></p>
<p>Well, this works: you have encapsulated the original exception (as I said you should), but you have created a problem. Before I explain the problem, <strong>be AWARE THAT THIS APPROACH IS A BAD PRACTICE AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED</strong>. You method throws an Exception of type java.lang.Exception. It means that the caller of your method will catch a java.lang.Exception. If the money is not enough, the caller has to give the user a chance to change the amount, if there is another problem, the caller has to give the user a chance to try again. This raises one question: How is the caller going to distinguish the two kinds of exceptions if they are the same (java.lang.Exception)? The obvious answer here is “USING The message”. Now ask yourself how comfortable is that?<strong> Remember:</strong> you should write less and do more and keep the code clear and easy to understand. That is definitely not the best way of doing any of that.</p>
<h3>Creating your own exception types</h3>
<p>To solve it correctly we should create 2 classes. One class that extends java.lang.Exception, and one class that extends our new class: <strong>OperationException</strong>, <strong>NoEnoughMoneyException</strong> (extends OperationException). How do we use them?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQEVBkOiCF3jqw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520147344540?e=1619654400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=yYqEL3-kczeQGUNwlXREl81bJ6l7RB5WDSv6-U61ytI" width="1376" height="946"></p>
<p>Its looking awesome now, isn’t it? But how how is the caller supposed to distinguish the exceptions? That’s one of the reasons why we made that change, so, lets see:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQFlaDYMN43EDw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520170287777?e=1619654400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=r4jhVMqnoVM5oxWNu-uUGx5HBUqXm-zVxCPPnW1lLSs" width="1328" height="746"></p>
<p>Can you see how easy it was to verify the type of the exception? That’s why you should adopt that practice (Assuming you said yes :)).</p>
<h3>Things you should take in consideration when creating your own exception classes.</h3>
<ol>
<li>The more detailed the exception is, the more helpful it becomes. Be careful, if it becomes too much informative it might also not help and might actually not be informative (My GOD this is so paradoxal).</li>
<li>Exceptions are classes, so, be free to add custom attributes</li>
<li>You can set the exception message on the exception class (internally), making it possible avoiding to pass a message every time you want to throw it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This it too much for a single POST, don’t you think? What am I thinking? Why didn’t I split this is in two or more posts? Because this is web content, meaning you can stop reading anywhere and come back to it anytime. You see? You are the problematic here. :). Just kidding.</p>
<p>Lets discuss one last thing before I rest in peace (its 12 AM now).</p>
<p>Do you remember the transferMoney method? Of course you do! Great!Imagine if one of the two parameters you receive is null. What should you do?</p>
<p>What Iam asking you, is how should the method react to things like this: transferMoney (null,null,-1000);</p>
<p>Please don’t tell me we should create a new type of a exception! Why? Because java already comes with exceptions to help us handle this kind of situations. It’s a pleasure for me to introduce you the <strong>NullPointerException</strong> and <strong>IllegalArgumentException.</strong> Please be polite “say nice to meet you”. But You already know these guys, they have been bothering you since you define yourself has a java programmer.</p>
<p>Lets cut to the chase, how are we supposed to use them?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQEF6052CVZcwA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520172052326?e=1619654400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=NyFomrXtH07VOPyPb6dfjOGBMnIQ6lMFELABBaoZwZA" width="1312" height="874"></p>
<p>If for some reason you are considering to catch these exception at the moment you call that method, please forget it. Burry that idea and burn its origin (don’t burn you head). You should do your best to never let none of this exceptions show up. How are u supposed to do that? Check if the Account objects are not null before you call the method and check if the amount is valid before you call the method. If these exceptions show up, you haven’t done your job correctly, remember, these are programming errors, the java language does not require you to catch them. These two exception types (NullPointerException and IllegalArgumentException) extend the class RuntimeException that extends Exception. Every child class of RuntimeException is an unchecked exception, meaning that you are not forced to catch it. When you call a method, you should make sure a RuntineException never shows up. When you write your own method, you should make sure a bad programmers gets them. You got me!</p>
<p>There is more to be told, but, I’m a human being and I appreciate my bed. It never throws an Exception.</p>
<p>It’s always a pleasure.</p>
<p>MJ</p>

<![CDATA[What You Need to Know About NPM Workspaces]]>

February 27, 2021 | https://hyperfoo.io/posts/npm-7-workspaces-1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hyperfoo.io/posts/npm-7-workspaces-1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The newest major release of <a href="https://npmjs.com/">npm</a> came out in October this year. Together with it came one very anticipated feature: <strong>npm Workspaces</strong>.</p>
<p>Workspaces are a way to work with repositories that have multiple packages - more than one <code>package.json</code> file. These projects are also known as <em>monorepos</em>.</p>
<p>But npm is a bit late to the party. Managing monorepos is already possible with other package managers such as <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> and <a href="https://pnpm.js.org/">pnpm</a>. Libraries like <a href="https://lerna.js.org/">Lerna</a> also bring swift tools to work with multi-package repositories.</p>
<p>That being said, npm Workspaces are still a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>What changes with Workspaces?</h2>
<p>If you have a single <code>package.json</code> on your repository, you will not need Workspaces and nothing is going to change for you.</p>
<p>In a multi-package repository, npm will now scan your folders looking for other packages and dependencies to install. This was made possible after changes made to <a href="https://github.com/npm/arborist">Arborist</a>, npm's dependency tree manager.</p>
<p>Duplicated dependencies across packages will be <strong>hoisted</strong>. This means they are going to be stored on the top-level of the packages. This is done mainly for performance reasons - we all know how big <code>node_modules</code> can get.</p>
<h2>Using Workspaces</h2>
<p>You can try Workspaces today by updating your npm to version 7. To update, run this command on your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g npm@7</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 7 is still not marked as <code>latest</code>, so running <code>npm install -g npm</code> will still install 6.x.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you install Node.js 15 today, it should already come with npm 7.</p>
<p>You can create a minimal monorepo setup to play around. Here’s an example of how a simple repository structure would look like:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── package.json
└── packages
    ├── package-a
    │   └── package.json
    └── package-b
        └── package.json</code></pre>
<p>A <code>package.json</code> file on the root of your repository is still needed, even if you don't have any dependencies there. On that file you will tell npm where your subpackages live by adding the <code>workspaces</code> entry:</p>
<pre><code>
{
  
  <span>"workspaces"</span>: [
    <span>"./packages/*"</span>
  ]
}</code></pre>
<p>With this, when you run <code>npm install</code> on the root, npm will be smart enough to install <code>package-a</code> and <code>package-b</code> dependencies.</p>
<p>I made a GitHub repository with this example if you wanna check it in more detail. Here’s the link: <a href="https://github.com/ruanmartinelli/npm-workspaces-demo">npm-workspaces-demo</a>.</p>
<h2>Are Workspaces ready?</h2>
<p><em>“Should I change all my code to use npm Workspaces?”</em></p>
<p>Workspaces are definitely a welcome addition, but a bit more work is needed to make it a complete solution for managing monorepos.</p>
<p>As of the writing of this post, it still hasn't reached feature parity with Lerna, pnpm or Yarn Workspaces. Technical details about how Workspaces will work are still being voted and discussed on <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/117">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
<p>The toolset is still limited. There is no <code>npm workspaces</code> subcommand or anything equivalent. If you want to be an early adopter, you’ll need to combine it with tools like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nx">nx</a> or Lerna for a complete monorepo workflow.</p>
<h2>npm Workspaces vs. Yarn Workspaces</h2>
<p>Yarn is the second biggest package manager for JavaScript, so it might be fair to make a comparison.</p>
<p>Yarn Workspaces is around for much longer (it was launched somewhere around 2017). It is a complete feature. The <code>yarn workspaces</code> interface already gives you the tooling that npm is still missing. npm Workspaces is still an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that npm Workspaces shouldn't differ that much from existing solutions like Yarn Workspaces - it even borrowed the "Workspaces" name! I believe we can expect a similar API and an easy way to switch between other implementations (but again, that's an opinion).</p>
<h2>What’s next for npm Workspaces?</h2>
<p>We can expect new things to come for Workspaces. It will not be just an improvement to the <code>npm install</code> command (<a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/implemented/0026-workspaces.md#rationale-and-alternatives">source</a>).</p>
<p>On GitHub discussions you can see that Workspaces will evolve in a way to bring tools for a more complete workflow.</p>
<p>If you want to keep up-to-date with Workspaces development and new features, there are a few things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch the ongoing Workspaces RFC discussions on <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/">this repo</a>;</li>
<li>Keep an eye on the <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/">npm Blog</a> for new releases;</li>
<li>Subscribe to <a href="https://hyperfoo.io/">hyperfoo.io</a>'s newsletter, where I will publish a fresh new article about the next Workspaces iteration. :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>Single points of failure become invisible.</p>


<p>Postmortems, COEs, incident reports. Whatever your organization calls them, when done right they are a popular and effective way of formalizing the process of digging into system failures, and driving change. The success of this approach has lead some to believe that postmortems are the <em>best</em>, or even <em>only</em>, way to improve the long-term availability of systems. Unfortunately, that isn't true. A good availability program requires deep insight into the design of the system.</p>

<p>To understand why, let's build a house, then a small community.</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avail_slide_1.png" alt="A house, with four things it needs to be a working home"></p>

<p>Our house has four walls, a roof, and a few things it needs to be a habitable home. We've got a well for water, a field of corn for food, a wood pile for heat, and a septic tank. If any one of these things is not working, let's say that the house is <em>unavailable</em>. Our goal is to build many houses, and make sure they are unavailable for as little of the time as possible.</p>

<p>When we want to build a second house, we're faced with a choice. The simple approach is just to stamp out a second copy of the entire house, with it's own field, wood, well, and tank. That approach is great: the failure of the two houses is completely independent, and availability is very easy to reason about.</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avail_slide_2.png" alt="Two houses, with full redundancy"></p>

<p>As we scale this approach up, however, we're met with the economic pressure to share components. This makes a lot of sense: wells are expensive to drill, and don't break down often, so sharing one between many houses could save the home owners a lot of money. Not only does sharing a well reduce construction costs, but thanks to the averaging effect of adding the demand of multiple houses together, reduces the peak-to-average ratio of water demand. That improves ongoing economics, too.</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avail_slide_3.png" alt="Five houses, sharing a well"></p>

<p>In exchange for the improved economics, we've bought ourselves a potential problem. The failure of the well will cause all the houses in our community to become <em>unavailable</em>. The well has high <em>blast radius</em>. Mitigating that is well-trodden technical ground, but there's a second-order organizational and cultural effect worth paying attention to.</p>

<p>Every week, our community's maintenance folks get together and talk about problems that occurred during the week. Dead corn, full tanks, empty woodpiles, etc. They're great people with good intentions, so for each of these issues they carefully draw up plans to prevent recurrence of the issue, and invest the right amount in following up on those issues. They invest in the most urgent issues, and talk a lot about the most common issues. The community grows, and the number of issues grows. The system of reacting to them scales nicely.</p>

<p>Everything is great until the well breaks. The community is without water, and everybody is mad at the maintenance staff. They'd hardly done any maintenance on the well all year! It wasn't being improved! They spent all their attention elsewhere! Why?</p>

<p>The problem here is simple. With 100 houses in the community, there were 100 fields, 100 tanks, 100 piles, and one well. The well was only responsible for 1 in every 301 issues, just 0.33%. So, naturally, the frequency-based maintenance plan spent just 0.33% of the maintenance effort on it. Over time, with so little maintenance, it got a little creaky, but was still only a tiny part of the overall set of problems.</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avail_slide_4.png" alt="Plot showing how the percentage of action items related to the well drops with scale"></p>

<p>This is one major problem with driving any availability program only from postmortems. It feels like a data-driven approach, but tends to be biased in exactly the ways we don't want a data-driven approach to be biased. As a start, the frequency measurement needs to be weighted based on impact. That doesn't solve the problem. The people making decisions are human, and humans are bad at making decisions. One way we're bad at decisions is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">Availability Heuristic</a>: We tend to place more importance on things we can remember easily. Like those empty wood piles we talk about every week, and not the well issue from two years ago. Fixing this requires that an availability program takes <em>risk</em> into account, not only in how we measure, but also in how often we talk about issues.</p>

<p>It's very easy to forget about your single point of failure. After all, there's just one.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>My backup tool <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> stores backups in a repository as an evergrowing set of
encrypted data trees which use content addressing and structural sharing
to deduplicate data. In order to delete unused backups we need to do something very similar to how
many programming languages free unreferenced memory - garbage collection. This post will
explain the evolution and implementation of the garbage collector in bupstash for the curious.</p>
<h2 id="stop-mark-and-sweep">Stop, mark and sweep.</h2>
<p>The initial version of the bupstash garbage collector was a naive stop-the-world
garbage collector. It walks all backup data trees creating a set of reachable data chunks
by address and then deletes unreachable data.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop the world.</li>
<li>Mark.</li>
<li>Sweep.</li>
<li>Restart the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>lock_repository()
reachable_addresses = empty_set()

for data_tree in all_backups():
  
  work_list = new_work_list_from_backup(data_tree.root_address)
  
  until work_list.is_empty():
    
    node_height, node_address = work_list.pop()
    reachable_addresses.add(node_address)
    
    if node_height != 0:
      add_child_nodes_to_worklist(work_list, node_address)

for chunk_address in repository:
  if not reachable_addresses.has(chunk_address):
    delete_chunk(chunk_address)

unlock_repository()
</code></pre><p>This algorithm is short and sweet, but if the repository is very large our repository becomes unavailable
for a potentially long time. The next version shortens the downtime of the repository significantly.</p>
<h2 id="mark-stop-mark-and-sweep">Mark, stop, mark and sweep.</h2>
<p>The bupstash v0.6.4 garbage collector takes advantage of two facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because many backups share data with each other, we can memoize the walk phase to skip work.</li>
<li>Because backups are immutable while the repository is unlocked, we can walk most of them without
stopping the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time we walk the repository without the repository locked, then lock it and walk
the repository again using our memoization to quickly complete the job. If any new backups
appeared during our first walk, we are guaranteed to mark them now that the repository lock is held. Doing the majority of the slow mark phase without locking the repository greatly increases
the repository availability for other operations.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memoized mark repository.</li>
<li>Stop the world.</li>
<li>Memoized mark repository.</li>
<li>Sweep.</li>
<li>Restart the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>walked_trees = empty_set()
reachable_addresses = empty_set()

func walk_repository():

  for data_tree in all_backups():

    if walked_trees.has(data_tree):
      continue

    walked_trees.add(data_tree)
    
    work_list = new_work_list_from_backup(data_tree.root_address)
    
    until work_list.is_empty():
      
      node_height, node_address = work_list.pop()
      already_walked = reachable_addresses.has(node_address)
      reachable_addresses.add(node_address)
      
      if node_height != 0 and not already_walked:
        add_child_nodes_to_worklist(work_list, node_address)

walk_repository()
lock_repository()
walk_repository()

for chunk_address in repository:
  if not reachable_addresses.has(chunk_address):
    delete_chunk(chunk_address)

unlock_repository()
</code></pre><h2 id="mark-stop-mark-bloom-adjust-and-sweep">Mark, stop, mark, bloom adjust, and sweep</h2>
<p>The next version of the garbage collector is a WIP unreleased version.</p>
<p>In bupstash each data chunk address is 32 bytes, which means we need at least 32 bytes of RAM per chunk in the repository to successfully perform a garbage collection. For a repository containing a 100 million chunks or
more this could easily exhaust memory on a busy or small system.</p>
<p>If we are willing to accept a very low probability of retaining some extra data, we can reduce this down
to a few <em>bits</em> per chunk reducing memory usage by 64x or more.
To do this we use a probabilistic data structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filter</a> to track reachable addresses.</p>
<p>Bloom filters have two downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can have false positives. For us this means we might keep a data chunk by accident we could have actually freed.</li>
<li>We must presize them. They cannot grow if we got the size wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily for us these downsides are not bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because memory use is so low per address, we can generously size our bloom filter reducing false positives to less than one percent, even for large repositories.</li>
<li>We can easily detect when a bloom filter gets overly full and produces many false positives, and thus adjust it’s size for future garbage collections.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, the bupstash implementation of a bloom filter is actually simpler than a hash table, with the implemenation
weighing in at around 30 lines of code plus tests and helpers.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memoized mark repository.</li>
<li>Stop the world.</li>
<li>Memoized mark the repository.</li>
<li>Adjust bloom filter size.</li>
<li>Sweep.</li>
<li>Restart the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>walked_trees = empty_set()
walked_addresses = empty_cache()
reachable_addresses = empty_bloom_filter(repository_bloom_size())

func walk_repository():

  for data_tree in all_backups():

    if walked_trees.has(data_tree):
      continue

    walked_trees.add(data_tree)
    work_list = new_work_list_from_backup(data_tree.root_address)
    
    until work_list.is_empty():
      
      node_height, node_address = work_list.pop()
      already_walked = walked_addresses.has(node_address)
      reachable_addresses.add(node_address)
      walked_addresses.add(node_address)
      
      if node_height != 0 and not already_walked:
        add_child_nodes_to_worklist(work_list, node_address)

walk_repository()
lock_repository()
walk_repository()

if bloom_filter_overutilized(reachable_addresses):
  increase_bloom_filter_size_for_next_gc()
else if bloom_filter_underutilized(reachable_addresses):
  decrease_bloom_filter_size_for_next_gc()

for chunk_address in repository:
  if not reachable_addresses.has(chunk_address):
    delete_chunk(chunk_address)

unlock_repository()
</code></pre><p>One thing to note about this implementation is that because the bloom filter has false positives we can not use it to skip processing addresses, instead
we must introduce a new cache for this purpose. A cache also lets us put a fixed upper bound on memory usage for large repositories.</p>
<p>Overall for large repositories, the addition of a bloom filter reduces ram requirements from the gigabyte range down to tens of megabytes while increasing the repository size by only a fraction of a percent.</p>

<p>The bupstash garbage collector tries hard to keep the repository avaliable as long
as possible while also providing excellent performance with a small memory profile. If you are implementing
a content addressed storage system, this post will hopefully provide you with some new ideas.</p>
<p>In the future bupstash could follow the same path as programming language garbage collectors to find more improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallelism in the mark phase.</li>
<li>Parallelism in the sweep phase.</li>
<li>Incremental collection.</li>
<li>Object generations.</li>
<li>Write barriers</li>
<li>Yet to be invented techniques…</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, thanks for reading and please feel free to give <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> a try.</p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>It’s a story that’s becoming more and more common.</p>
<p>You’re smack dab in the middle of harvest and an error code appears on your combine’s monitor. A call to the dealership results in a long wait for a technician to come out, with anxiety rising with every passing hour because priceless harvesting time is being lost or, worse, nasty weather is moving in.</p>
<p>Then when the technician gets to your farm, he determines what is needed is to reset (or ‘flash’) the onboard computer.</p>
<p>That happened to Cole Siegle last fall when he was harvesting canola, leaving the Fairview-area producer to wonder why he can’t have access to the same diagnostic tools.</p>
<div id="attachment_133445"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></p><p>Cole Siegle.<br><small><i>photo:</i><span> Supplied </span></small></p></div>
<p>“If I could have done that myself or been able to use a mechanic or a technician who’s closer to me, our downtime could have gone from six hours to two hours,” he said. “That four hours could have been the difference between getting&nbsp;a crop off before the snow or not.”</p>
<p>But these days it’s dealerships — via sales and service agreements with manufacturers — that have legal access to these diagnostic tools. So when an error message pops up, farmers and independent mechanics are out in the cold, sometimes literally.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Read more: <a href="https://www.albertafarmexpress.ca/news/remote-diagnostics-blocked-by-poor-internet-on-farms/">Remote diagnostics blocked by poor internet on farms</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<p>“As a producer I think we need access to these diagnostic tools,” said Siegle. “If (manufacturers) want to continue to build equipment like this that’s fine, but we need access to the laptops with the programs that we can plug into our equipment so we can buy whatever part we need.”</p>
<p>Equipment manufacturers make a lot of repair information public, including what codes mean, but giving access to proprietary tools raises several issues, said John Schmeiser, CEO of the Western Equipment Dealers Association.</p>
<p>The hardware and software Siegle and other farmers wish to acquire for repair purposes can also be used to modify equipment to the detriment of machinery, warranties, the lawfulness of their operations and even their own safety, he said.</p>
<p>“I applaud the manufacturers that put a lot of stuff online&nbsp;like parts, service manuals and operational guides. But it’s a slippery slope,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“When you provide special tools to somebody outside a controlled environment like the manufacturer/dealer&nbsp;relationship, that opens the door for illegal modification. They lose that control when they provide&nbsp;diagnostic or special tools to a third-party retailer with whom they don’t have the same sales and services agreement.”</p>
<h2>Repair versus modify</h2>
<p>‘Right to repair’ is a term being thrown around a lot in ag circles today, but it means different things to different people.</p>
<p>For Siegle and other like-minded producers, it means the right to either repair equipment themselves or hire an unaffiliated local mechanic — just as farmers have done throughout the history of mechanized agriculture.</p>
<div id="attachment_133446"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></p><p>John Schmeiser.<br><small><i>photo:</i><span> Supplied </span></small></p></div>
<p>But Schmeiser argues that farmers’ right to repair is already entrenched in law in many jurisdictions (including Alberta) as long as the owner is using the equipment for its intended purpose and doesn’t violate manufacturer standards.</p>
<p>The right to repair (R2R) movement (which started in the tech sphere but expanded to other areas, such as ag equipment) is actually a front for promoting the ‘right to modify,’ he said.</p>
<p>Often that means making modifications to bypass environmental controls in order to boost vehicle horsepower.</p>

<p>“There are over 25 states that had R2R bills introduced — every one impacting farm equipment has been defeated,” said Schmeiser. “They haven’t passed&nbsp;because as the state representatives were hearing the rationale coming from R2R advocates, they were finding out that what they were really looking for is to modify the equipment in a manner where&nbsp;it can get around emission standards and violate U.S. Environmental Protection Agency laws and regulations.”</p>
<h2>DEF delete and chipping</h2>
<p>There are two specific actions that concern Schmeiser’s association (a Missouri-based advocacy group for equipment dealerships with a Canadian headquarters in Calgary).</p>
<p>One is circumventing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (or DEF) emissions systems using grey-market ‘DEF delete’ kits to boost horsepower on tractors and combines. Another is ‘chipping’ or ‘tuning,’ which usually refers to adding a specific chip to increase horsepower.</p>
<p>Bypassing emissions control systems contravenes the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, leaving producers open to fines, said Schmeiser, adding he was unsure of the Canadian penalties but breaches of similar U.S. laws have produced fines in excess of $300,000.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that not everyone knows this practice is illegal. Another is it comes with a host of potential risks including damaged equipment, voided warranties, reduced trade-in value, insurance cancellation and even safety, he said.</p>
<p>“We have seen an unusual number of combine fires this (past) year,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“Now, we have had some dry conditions but in some of those cases the combines were running hotter (due to alterations).</p>

<p>“The insurance company will look at it from the standpoint that you have altered your combine away from the manufacturer’s original standards and you are going to be denied insurance coverage in a situation like that.”</p>
<p>But Siegle isn’t convinced.</p>
<p>He said he has no interest in making such modifications to his equipment and suggested it’s a straw man argument from manufacturing and dealership interests seeking exclusive control over the diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>The kind of modification Siegle is concerned about losing is the legal ability to place, for example, a third-party manufacturer’s custom header on a John Deere combine. Specifically, he worries about big manufacturers denying third-party companies the codes required for an implement to interact with a tractor or combine.</p>
<p>Schmeiser said this isn’t considered modification but rather interoperability or connectivity: A third party designing an implement to attach to another manufacturer’s product. This is a long-standing tradition in the manufacturing and dealership industries that few if anyone has any interest in ceasing, he said (see accompanying story).</p>
<h2>The business aspect</h2>
<p>All of this still does not answer Siegle’s fundamental question: Why can’t I — or mechanics unaffiliated with specific manufacturers — have all the tools required to diagnose and fix a mechanical problem?</p>
<p>In the past it was relatively easy for mechanically minded producers and unaffiliated mechanics to repair machinery because it ran on tried-and-traditional engineering principles. This is still by and large the case, said Schmeiser, adding 95 per cent of equipment issues can still be fixed mechanically.</p>
<p>He said he understands the frustration farmers feel by not having diagnostic tools at their fingertips. But at the same time dealerships have rights as well, especially when one considers the considerable training and expense needed to obtain service contracts with manufacturers.</p>
<p>“What the farmer is speaking to is the frustration of being down. He wants to get up and running as quickly as possible. We get that,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“But the moment the manufacturers start providing special tools or diagnostics&nbsp;equipment to businesses that are outside of their dealer contracts, doesn’t that diminish the value of the contract in the dealer’s eyes as well?… So what’s the incentive for the manufacturer&nbsp;to provide special tools or even service manuals to a third party that would be competing with somebody they have a contractual relationship with&nbsp;(and) who is also making a substantial financial investment to be the representative for the manufacturer?”</p> </div>

February 26, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>

some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function
epilogue</a>),
and then return to our caller with <code>retq</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at a different example. Suppose that we want to print
an uppercased C string and we’d like to avoid heap allocations for
smallish strings.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We might write something like

        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>

store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch

      <p><span>Greenwashing is when a company pretends to be </span><b>eco-friendly</b><span> despite using toxic ingredients and unsustainable practices to manufacture their product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When a company engages in </span><i><span>greenwashing</span></i><span>, they effectively influence consumers to believe that they’re working towards saving the environment when they’re not. In fact, companies that go to great lengths to create a </span><b>greenwashed marketing strategy</b><span> are sometimes covering up their lack of </span>environmentally friendly products or processes<span>. They are interested only in improving their sales and making more money, and they do so by projecting a green image and deceiving </span><b>conscious consumers</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It should be noted that some companies greenwash their products accidentally. Misinformation surrounding sustainability is so widespread that companies can get the wrong idea about what's sustainable and what's not. Although there's no excuse for large corporations with hefty research budgets, smaller companies sometimes think they're being eco-friendly when they're not.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Why do companies use this marketing strategy?</b></h2>
<p><span>The short answer is that companies who deliberately use this strategy do so to attract more customers and increase revenue.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Over the past couple of decades, there has been a shift toward holding companies accountable for their carbon footprint and environmental impact. At the same time, consumers have become more conscious of their impact on the environment. Naturally, conscious customers try their best to buy </span><b>environmentally friendly products</b><span> when possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There isn’t currently a lot of regulation around sustainable terms such as: natural, green, eco-friendly, and environmentally friendly. Any company can include green colors and imagery on their products and use terms such as </span><i><span>natural</span></i><span>. Therefore, it’s usually easy for brands to attract well-meaning consumers and improve their sales. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Another reason for companies using this marketing strategy is to stand out from their competitors in the market. They promise the consumers that their product is more efficient, saves more power, or is </span><b>sustainable</b><span>. In response, many people start purchasing from them believing that they are helping the environment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many companies see this </span><i><span>green agenda</span></i><span> as an opportunity to gain a competitive advantage, especially because “natural products” are usually priced higher.&nbsp;Particularly when shopping on-the-go at the grocery store or mall, consumers don’t have time to research every single product they put into their cart. And with good reason! Unless you only buy from trusted brands, it’s hard to distinguish between the truly sustainable products and the fake ones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Examples of Greenwashing</b><b><br></b><span><br></span><span>A very common example of greenwashing is when a company rebrands as natural or eco-friendly. If a company changes their name, logo, or slogan to appear greener without actually changing their business to be environmentally friendly, then chances are it's an attempt to greenwash. Food companies, cosmetic companies, and household product manufacturers are often seen involved in greenwashing. &nbsp;</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Another example of greenwashing is when a company labels its products with buzz-words and meaningless statistics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever seen one or more of the the following descriptions on a product?<br></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>"99% naturally derived"&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><span>"100% recyclable"</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>"Made with natural ingredients"&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span>"Biodegradable"&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>While these things all sound great to the conscious consumer, these phrases don't mean anything.</p>
<p>Single-use plastic can be 100% recyclable, but it isn't sustainable or eco-friendly. Many chemicals are naturally-derived, yet are still harmful to the environment. Food, cosmetics, textiles, and more can all be made with "natural" ingredients, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're inherently healthy or environmentally friendly. Lastly, most things are biodegradable, but that doesn't mean it's okay to dump them in a landfill.</p>

<h2><b>Impact of Greenwashing</b></h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/4346/4271/files/pexels-catherine-sheila-2409025_480x480.jpg?v=1613572719" alt="false green claims"></p>
<p><b></b><span>Greenwashing is unethical.&nbsp;False green claims have&nbsp;a negative impact not only on consumers but also on the environment. Let’s look at some of the problems that arise because of greenwashing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Encourages Uninformed Decisions</b> <b><br></b><b><br></b><span>The most important danger of greenwashing is that it misinforms people, leading them to make wrong decisions and contribute to unintended environmental harm. Customers, without knowing if a company’s eco-friendly claims are genuine or not, act unsustainably, and make an uninformed decision. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><b>Harms the Environment</b></p>
<p><a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.118-a246"><span>Greenwashing harms the environment and public health</span></a><span>. When consumers are unable to understand the false practices of a company and they decide to buy from a greenwashing company, they contribute to the growth of that company.</span></p>
<p><span>Their support gives such companies more revenue and they continue with their greenwashed marketing and non-environmentally friendly products. Many companies that use greenwashing are often found to be using toxic ingredients in their products or using unsustainable practices such as excess water usage, causing unnecessary air pollution,&nbsp;or producing toxic run-off. To stop this, consumers should look into what they are buying and support the company only if they are genuinely working towards protecting the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Harms Genuine Brands</b><b><br></b><b><br></b><span>Apart from harming the environment, greenwashing also causes trouble for companies that are genuinely working towards saving the environment. This happens because greenwashing breaks consumer trust and consumers start suspecting </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> brands</span><b>, </b><span>even those that are working hard to produce </span><b>environmentally friendly products</b><span>. The reputation of true eco-friendly companies are hindered, making it difficult for them to gain significant market share.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>How to Identify Greenwashing&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/4346/4271/files/Webp.net-resizeimage_3_480x480.jpg?v=1613572793" alt="greenwashed" width="480x480" height="480x480"></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, it can be hard to know if a company is greenwashing or not.&nbsp;It is important for consumers to be educated and aware about which companies and products are truly green and which are not, but this takes time and a lot of effort.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, there are some things you can look out for that might help you make more informed decisions. Here are a few tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Many companies use specific phrases like natural, sustainable, organic, healthy, vegan, etc. to attract consumers. The use of such words gives the impression that they are eco-friendly and green. However, be skeptical. You should read the information provided by the company on the packaging material, label, and website. The only way to know about the product is to read the label carefully.&nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li>
<span>You should know what common products are inherently not eco-friendly: PVC, triclosan, microbeads, aerosols, phosphates, and chlorine bleach are just a few toxic materials that companies use while still marketing themselves as safe and natural. </span><span></span>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<span>Product imagery that depicts natural scenery is also a tool used by many companies to deceive potential buyers. Consumers should be aware not to be fooled by pictures of fruit, nuts, farms, or any other natural-looking imagery on the labels of the product. Using a particular image does not represent the true sustainability of a company’s products.</span><span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Besides using earth-centered imagery, companies also using earthy tones to promote a natural vibe. They use greens, browns, and blues instead of bright and flashy colors while packaging their products. This is to lure the consumers who are drawn to earth-friendly products. However, consumers should remember that greens and browns don’t necessarily imply that the product is earth-friendly.</span><span><br></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Ways to Verify Sustainable Brands&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><b><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/4346/4271/files/MG_1114_copy_480x480.jpg?v=1613568843" alt="what is greenwashing"></b></p>
<p><span>These days, the number of environmentally-conscious buyers is growing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you find it hard to obtain information about a company’s factory or production details, there's a chance&nbsp;that the company is greenwashing or it has something to hide.To verify the sustainability of a brand,&nbsp;you&nbsp;should try to find out more and more about the way a company operates. <p>Here are some things you can look out for:</p></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Don't trust everything that a company shares or says if they don't have evidence to back it up. There is a possibility that the company is sugar-coating their information or spinning the truth.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Try to find out about the company’s supply chain, their production facilities, the employees, working conditions, contractors, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Evaluate the logistics of the product. If a company is claiming they're sustainable, but they're still using single-use plastics...you know something is off.&nbsp;Look for the trademarks of true sustainability such as zero waste practices and/or materials.</span></li>
<li><span>For textiles and household goods, check the material and quality of the product. For food and cosmetic products, check the ingredients and learn more about the production processes of common ingredients. For example, "palm oil" sounds relatively unproblematic, but is actually one of the <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/8-things-know-about-palm-oil">greatest&nbsp;drivers of deforestation</a>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Ask tough questions! Even true eco-friendly companies are not perfect, but they'll be happy to answer your questions and show you how they're willing to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you really want to avoid giving business to companies who are&nbsp;intentionally greenwashing, you'll need to screen your purchases carefully. Keep an eye out for harmful ingredients, materials, and production practices. When you're informed, you can spot fake eco-friendly companies much more easily.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<p><span>Continue to read labels and always think about the entire product lifecycle - all the way from the sourcing of materials all the way down to&nbsp;discarding, recycling, or reusing the product.</span></p>
<p><span>Greenwashing needs to be stopped and we need to hold companies accountable. Let’s continue to do our part by becoming conscious consumers and buying environment friendly products.</span></p>

<p>When you and your friends put your fingers on the ouija board planchette and it starts moving around, there's a chance your friends are just yanking your chain – but just as possible is that your friends are experiencing the ideomotor response.</p>
<p>That's when your unconscious mind directs your muscles without your conscious knowledge. The movement of the planchette doesn't tell you what's going on in the spirit world, but it does tell you something about the internal weather of your friend's psyche, fears and hopes.</p>
<p>Our narratives are social-scale planchettes, directed by mass ideomotor response. When a fake news story takes hold, it reveals a true fact: namely, the shared, internal models of how the world really works.</p>
<p>Fake news is an oracle, in other words.</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2019/07/cory-doctorow-fake-news-is-an-oracle/">https://locusmag.com/2019/07/cory-doctorow-fake-news-is-an-oracle/</a></p>
<p>There's no spirit-realm directing planchettes. Supernatural phenomena are nonsense, in all their guises. Mediums are fraudsters or deluded – and so are soothsayers who claim to be able to predict the future. That goes for fortune-tellers and futurists alike.</p>
<p>A shocking number of self-described "rational" science fiction writers share the delusional view that they can predict the future. These pulp Nostradamii point to "predictions" of sf that have "come true" and claim to have an inside line on the world of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sf <em>has</em> an important relationship to the future, though! It can be a planchette: all the futures imagined by all the sf writers are a kind of mutation-space, and the fitness factor that determines whether a story thrives or sinks is whether it captures public imagination.</p>
<p>Sf writers and readers are a means for society to reflect back, amplify and examine our unarticulated hopes and fears about our <em>present</em> technology. Sf doesn't predict the future, but sf readers and writers do an excellent job of predicting the present.</p>
<p>And since the present is the standing wave where the past is being transformed into the future, knowing about the present can be a source of insights into what's coming – and not just because sf reveals what's going on in the present, but also because it influences it.</p>
<p>People who are captured by imaginative, futuristic parables about the problems and possibilities of technology acquire a set of intuition-pumps for coping with the future when it arrives, reflexive views and actions about what the future demands of us.</p>
<p>Gene Rodenberry didn't predict the Motorola flip-phone. Rather, when a generation of Motorola designers and engineers were asked to make a mobile communications device their minds immediately flew to the Star Trek communicators they grew up with.</p>
<p>Thinking of fantastic fiction as measurement device and influence machine is a productive way to pick apart the meaning of literary trends.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my intro to the bicentennial re-release of FRANKENSTEIN, the rise and fall of Shelley's book tracks to the rise and fall of fears related to the book's various themes:</p>
<p><a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1974387">https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1974387</a></p>
<p>So what are we to make of K-zombies? Korean pop culture is experiencing a golden age of zombie movies, games, comics and other media.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-02-23/zombies-are-everywhere-south-korea-fears">https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-02-23/zombies-are-everywhere-south-korea-fears</a></p>
<p>Zombies have a lot of different themes, of course, and some are easy to map to the current situation: the fear of contagion and the need to distance yourself from loved ones who have become infected. The parallels to covid hardly need explaining.</p>
<p>But the K-zombie phenomenon predates the pandemic, and zombie stories aren't merely contagion stories – they're often stories about the lurking bestiality of nearly everyone around us.</p>
<p>That's behind stories like The Walking Dead, about the propensity of all our "normal" friends and neighbors to transform into an insensate, rampaging mob. These zombie stories are a throwback to the "cozy catastrophes" of John Wyndham and co:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/29/grifters-gonna-grift/#wyndhamesque">https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/29/grifters-gonna-grift/#wyndhamesque</a></p>
<p>These are stories of racial and class anxiety, of xenophobia and the literal othering of someone who <em>seems</em> to be just like you but is actually a secret monster. Again, on a divided peninsula, it's not hard to see how stories of lurking otherness would catch hold.</p>
<p>Zombie stories are also stories about the fragility of social cohesion: stories about how we're never "all in this together" and how, when the chips are down, it'll be "the war of all against all." That, too, feels very zeitgeisty given recent South Korean politics.</p>
<p>South Korea has an ugly, authoritarian past that is at odds with its founding myth as the "good Korea," the "democratic Korea." But the post-war reconstruction of the country by the US elevated an elite to a position of near-total authority and impunity.</p>
<p>They abused this power in ghastly ways, running forced-labor camps for poor people and people with disabilities, with rampant physical and sexual abuse. Families who lost their loved ones were traumatized to learn that they'd ended up in the camps.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423131643/https://bigstory.ap.org/article/c22de3a565fe4e85a0508bbbd72c3c1b/ap-s-korea-covered-mass-abuse-killings-vagrants">https://web.archive.org/web/20160423131643/https://bigstory.ap.org/article/c22de3a565fe4e85a0508bbbd72c3c1b/ap-s-korea-covered-mass-abuse-killings-vagrants</a></p>
<p>These forced-labor camps (which continue in a slightly modified form to this day) supplied slaves to chaebols, the conglomerates that represent the country on a world stage. Unsurprisingly, the leadership of these companies is also grossly corrupt:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2052871/samsung-chief-jailed-for-2-5-years-over-corruption-scandal">https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2052871/samsung-chief-jailed-for-2-5-years-over-corruption-scandal</a></p>
<p>Korea is also riven by messianic cults, and the leaders of these cults have close ties to the Korean political class, an incredibly politically destabilizing fact that has caused recent Korean governments to collapse:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37971085">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37971085</a></p>
<p>South Korea, in other words, isn't just haunted by the spectre of aggression from the north – but also by the possibility of internal rupture. It has a huge, authoritarian secret police force that has been caught secretly meddling in electoral politics.</p>
<p>Far from reining in this spookocracy, the South Korean political class has tried to hand them even MORE powers, with LESS oversight. Today is the fifth anniversary of the Korean opposition's filibuster to stop the worst of these.</p>
<p>(Seo Ki-Ho, a politician with the affectionate nickname "Milhouse" for his resemblance to the Simpsons character read the Korean edition of my novel LITTLE BROTHER into the record during the filibuster!)</p>

<p>This othering is also sharply illustrated in the country's culture of misogynistic voyeurism, which goes beyond "upskirt" videos and includes a roaring trade in videos captured with hidden cameras in toilets, changing rooms and hotel rooms.</p>
<p>It's hard to overstate the reach of this practice, and its political salience: it has provoked a vast mass-movement of women and allies demanding an end to the practice and a reckoning with institutional sexism:</p>

<p>Zombies aren't ever just about contagion – they're also always an expression of a deep anxiety that your neighbors aren't what they seem, that in a pinch, they'll turn on you, and not just because they've been infected, but also to protect themselves and their comfort.</p>
<p>US zombie booms always have an element of this: 1950s (reds under the bed); 1980s (red menace redux); 2000s (immigration "crisis"), etc. It'd be amazing if the only thing driving K-zombies' popularity was the pandemic, or even less plausibly, a mere aesthetic coincidence.</p>

<p>When all you have is market orthodoxy, everything looks like a market failure. Take privacy: giant, rapacious corporations have instrumented the digital and physical worlds to spy on us all the time, so some people think they should pay us for our data.</p>
<p>There's a pretty rich theoretical history explaining why this "data dividend" is a stupid idea. First of all, private information isn't very property-like. And not  just because it shares all the problems of digital works (infinitely, instantaneously copyable at zero cost).</p>
<p>Private information makes for bad "property" because it is "owned" by multiple, overlapping parties who generally disagree about when and who to share it with. When you and I have a conversation, we both own the fact that the conversation took place.</p>
<p>What happens if I won't sell, but you will? Tech companies are <em>really</em> good at finding the cheapest seller of an information good, after all. For example, whenever you visit a "quality newspaper's" site, there's a real-time auction to bid on the right to show you ads.</p>
<p>Say there are 13 bidders for that right. One gets to show you an ad, but the other 12 get something too: your unique identifier and the fact that you read, say, the New York Times.</p>
<p>That fact is then sold on to garbage chumbox sites like Tabouleh, whose pitch to advertisers is "I can show your ads to NYT readers at 15% of the price that the Times charges." If the same fact is "owned" by lots of people, it's a commodity.</p>
<p>Buyers will find the lowest, least-discerning seller. What's more, you can't solve this by requiring consensus of all "owners" of a fact before it is disclosed – who owns the fact that your boss sexually harassed you: you or him? Does he get a veto over your disclosures?</p>
<p>Even if we could get property rights to work in privacy (which, for the record, we cannot), all we'd manage to do is transform privacy into a luxury good wherein poor people are coerced into selling their data for pennies, as Malavika Jayaram reminds us:</p>

February 26, 2021 | https://mikewest.github.io/post-spectre-webdev/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mikewest.github.io/post-spectre-webdev/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
   <h2 data-level="1" id="intro"><span>1. </span><span>Introduction</span><a href="#intro"></a></h2>
   <p>In early 2018, Spectre made it clear that a foundational security boundary the web aimed to
maintain was substantially less robust than expected. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-spectre">[SPECTRE]</a> This revelation has pushed web
browsers to shift their focus from the platform-level <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#concept-origin" id="ref-for-concept-origin">origin</a> boundary to an OS-level
process boundary. Chromium’s threat model, for instance, now asserts that "active web content …
will be able to read any and all data in the address space of the process that hosts it". <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-post-spectre-rethink">[POST-SPECTRE-RETHINK]</a> This shift in thinking imposes a shift in development practice, both
for browser vendors, and for web developers. Browsers need to align the origin boundary with the
process boundary through fundamental refactoring projects (for example, <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-site-isolation">[SITE-ISOLATION]</a> and <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-project-fission">[PROJECT-FISSION]</a>). Moreover, browsers must provide web developers with tools to mitigate risk
in the short term, and should push the platform towards safe default behaviors in the long term.
The bad news is that this is going to be a lot of work, much of it falling on the shoulders of
web developers. The good news is that a reasonable set of mitigation primitives exists today,
ready and waiting for use.</p>
   <p>This document will summarize the threat model which the Web Application Security Working group
espouses(?), point to a set of mitigations which seem promising, and provide concrete recommendations
for developers responsible for protecting users' data.</p>
   <p id="issue-bdf75540"><a href="#issue-bdf75540"></a> Propose this to WebAppSec.</p>
   <h3 data-level="1.1" id="threat-model"><span>1.1. </span><span>Threat Model</span><a href="#threat-model"></a></h3>
   <p>Spectre-like side-channel attacks inexorably lead to a model in which active web content
(JavaScript, WASM, probably CSS if we tried hard enough, and so on) can read any and all data which
has entered the address space of the process which hosts it. While this has deep implications for
user agent implementations' internal hardening strategies (stack canaries, ASLR, etc), here we’ll
remain focused on the core implication at the web platform level, which is both simple and profound:
any data which flows into a process hosting a given origin is legible to that origin. We must design
accordingly.</p>
   <p>In order to determine the scope of data that can be assumed accessible to an attacker, we must make
a few assumptions about the normally-not-web-exposed process model which the user agent implements.
The following seems like a good place to start:</p>
   <ol>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>User agents are capable of separating the execution of a web origin’s code into a process
distinct from the agent’s core. This separation enables the agent itself to access local
devices, fetch resources, broker cross-process communication, and so on, in a way which remains
invisible to any process potentially hosting untrusted code.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>User agents are able to make decisions about whether or not a given resource should be delivered
to a process hosting a given origin based on characteristics of both the request and the
response (headers, etc).</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>User agents can consistently separate top-level, cross-origin windows into distinct processes.
They cannot consistently separate same-site or same-origin windows into distinct processes given
the potential for synchronous access between the windows.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>User agents cannot yet consistently seperate framed origins into processes distinct from their
embedders' origin.</p>
     <p role="note"><span>Note:</span> Though some user agents support out-of-process frames <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-oopif">[OOPIF]</a>, no agent supports it
consistently across a broad range of devices and platforms. Ideally this will change over time,
as the frame boundary <em>must</em> be one we can eventually consider robust.</p>
   </li></ol>
   <p>With this in mind, our general assumption will be that an origin gains access to any resource which
it renders (including images, stylesheets, scripts, frames, etc). Likewise, embedded frames gain
access to their ancestors' content.</p>
   <p id="issue-340f57a5"><a href="#issue-340f57a5"></a> <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-coi-threat-model">[COI-THREAT-MODEL]</a> spells out more implications. Bring them in here for more nuance.</p>
   <h3 data-level="1.2" id="tldr"><span>1.2. </span><span>TL;DR</span><a href="#tldr"></a></h3>
   <ol>
    <li data-md="">
     <p><strong>Decide when (not!) to respond to requests</strong> by examining incoming headers, paying special
attention to the <a data-link-type="http-header" href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#origin-header" id="ref-for-origin-header"><code>Origin</code></a> header on the one hand, and various <code>Sec-Fetch-</code> prefixed headers on the other, as described in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-resource-isolation-policy">[resource-isolation-policy]</a>.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><strong>Restrict attackers' ability to load your data as a subresource</strong> by setting a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cross-origin-resource-policy" id="ref-for-http-cross-origin-resource-policy">cross-origin resource policy</a> (CORP) of <code>same-origin</code> (opening up to <code>same-site</code> or <code>cross-origin</code> only when necessary).</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><strong>Restrict attackers' ability to frame your data as a document</strong> by opt-ing into framing
protections via <code>X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN</code> or CSP’s more granular <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#frame-ancestors" id="ref-for-frame-ancestors">frame-ancestors</a> directive (<code>frame-ancestors 'self' https://trusted.embedder</code>, for example).</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><strong>Restrict attackers' ability to obtain a handle to your window</strong> by setting a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#cross-origin-opener-policies" id="ref-for-cross-origin-opener-policies">cross-origin opener policy</a> (COOP). In the best case, you can default to a restrictive <code>same-origin</code> value, opening up to <code>same-origin-allow-popups</code> or <code>unsafe-none</code> only if
necessary.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><strong>Prevent MIME-type confusion attacks</strong> and increase the robustness of passive defenses like <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#corb" id="ref-for-corb">cross-origin read blocking</a> (CORB) / <a href="https://github.com/annevk/orb">opaque response blocking</a> (<a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-orb">[ORB]</a>) by setting
correct <code>Content-Type</code> headers, and globally asserting <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code>.</p>
   </li></ol>
   <p id="issue-db0b0c7b"><a href="#issue-db0b0c7b"></a> Describe these mitigations in more depth, swiping liberally from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JBUaX1xSOZRxBk5bRNZWgnzyJoCQC52TIRokACBSmGc/edit?resourcekey=0-cZ7da6v52enjwRSsp_tLyQ">Notes on the threat model of <em>cross-origin isolation</em></a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDlfvfTJ_9e8Jdc8ehuV4zMEu9ySMCiTGMS9y0GU92k/edit">Safely reviving shared memory</a>, etc.</p>

   <h3 data-level="2.1" id="subresources"><span>2.1. </span><span>Subresources</span><a href="#subresources"></a></h3>
   <p>Resources which are intended to be loaded into documents should protect themselves from being used
in unexpected ways. Before walking through strategies for specific kinds of resources, a few headers
seem generally applicable:</p>
   <ol>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Sites should use Fetch Metadata to make good decisions about when to serve resources, as
described in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-resource-isolation-policy">[resource-isolation-policy]</a>. In order to ensure that decision sticks, servers
should explain its decision to the browser by sending a <a data-link-type="http-header" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.4" id="ref-for-section-7.1.4"><code>Vary</code></a> header
containing <code>Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site</code>. This ensures that the server has
a chance to make different decisions for requests which will be <em>used</em> differently.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Subresources should opt-out of MIME type sniffing by sending an <a data-link-type="http-header" href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-x-content-type-options" id="ref-for-http-x-content-type-options"><code>X-Content-Type-Options</code></a> header with a value of <code>nosniff</code>. This increases the
robustness of MIME-based checks like <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#corb" id="ref-for-corb①">cross-origin read blocking</a> (CORB) / <a href="https://github.com/annevk/orb">opaque response blocking</a> (<a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-orb">[ORB]</a>), and mitigates
some well-known risks around type confusion for scripts.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Subresources are intended for inclusion in a given context, not as independently navigable
documents. To mitigate the risk that navigation to a subresource causes script execution or
opens an origin up to attack in some other way, servers can assert the following set of headers
which collectively make it difficult to meaningfully abuse a subresource via navigation:</p>
     <ul>
      <li data-md="">
       <p>Using the <a data-link-type="http-header" href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#header-content-security-policy" id="ref-for-header-content-security-policy"><code>Content-Security-Policy</code></a> header’s to assert the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#sandbox" id="ref-for-sandbox"><code>sandbox</code></a> directive ensures that these resources remain inactive if navigated to
directly as a top-level document. No scripts will execute, and the resource will be pushed
into an <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#concept-origin-opaque" id="ref-for-concept-origin-opaque">opaque origin</a>.</p>
       <p role="note"><span>Note:</span> Some servers deliver <code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=file.name</code> to obtain
a similar effect. This was valuable to mitigate vulnerabilies in Flash, but the sandbox
approach seems to more straightforwardly address the threats we care about today.</p>
      </li><li data-md="">
       <p>Asserting the <a data-link-type="http-header" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#cross-origin-opener-policies" id="ref-for-cross-origin-opener-policies①"><code>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy</code></a> header with a value of <code>same-origin</code> prevents cross-origin documents from retaining a handle to the resource’s
window if it’s opened in a popup.</p>
      </li><li data-md="">
       <p>The <a data-link-type="http-header" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#the-x-frame-options-header" id="ref-for-the-x-frame-options-header"><code>X-Frame-Options</code></a> header with a value of <code>DENY</code> prevents the resource
from being framed.</p>
     </li></ul>
   </li></ol>
   <p>Most subresources, then, should contain the following block of headers, which you’ll see repeated a
few times below:</p>
<pre>Content-Security-Policy: sandbox
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
</pre>
   <p>With these generic protections in mind, let’s sift through a few scenarios to determine what headers
a server would be well-served to assert:</p>
   <h4 data-level="2.1.1" id="static-subresources"><span>2.1.1. </span><span>Static Subresources</span><a href="#static-subresources"></a></h4>
   <p>By their nature, static resources contain the same data no matter who requests them, and therefore
cannot contain interesting information that an attacker couldn’t otherwise obtain. There’s no risk
to making these resources widely available, and value in allowing embedders to robustly debug, so
something like the following response headers could be appropriate:</p>
<pre><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin
Timing-Allow-Origin: *</strong>
Content-Security-Policy: sandbox
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Vary: Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
</pre>
   <p>CDNs are the canonical static resource distribution points, and many use the pattern above. Take
a look at the following common resources' response headers for inspiration:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"><code>https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js</code></a></p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"><code>https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js</code></a></p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.5.1/dist/jquery.min.js"><code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.5.1/dist/jquery.min.js</code></a></p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js"><code>https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js</code></a></p>
   </li></ul>
   <p>Similarly, application-specific static resource servers are a good place to look for this practice. Consider:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y2/r/zVvRrO8pOtu.png"><code>https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y2/r/zVvRrO8pOtu.png</code></a></p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://www.gstatic.com/images/branding/googlelogo/svg/googlelogo_clr_74x24px.svg"><code>https://www.gstatic.com/images/branding/googlelogo/svg/googlelogo_clr_74x24px.svg</code></a></p>
   </li></ul>
   <h4 data-level="2.1.2" id="dynamic-subresources"><span>2.1.2. </span><span>Dynamic Subresources</span><a href="#dynamic-subresources"></a></h4>
   <p>Subresources that contain data personalized to a given user are juicy targets for attackers, and
must be defended by ensuring that they’re loaded only in ways that are appropriate for the data
in question. A few cases are well worth considering:</p>
   <ol>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Application-internal resources (private API endpoints, avatar images, uploaded data, etc.)
should not be available to any cross-origin requestor. These resources should be restricted to
usage as a subresource in same-origin contexts by sending a <a data-link-type="http-header" href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cross-origin-resource-policy" id="ref-for-http-cross-origin-resource-policy①"><code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</code></a> header with a value of <code>same-origin</code>:</p>

<p>TL;DR: It’s possible to mine Ethereum on a M1 Mac GPU. Hashrate is about 2Mh/s.</p>

<p>I’ve had my M1 MacBook Air for a bit of time now, and I also recently started mining Ethereum. I can’t help asking myself: What’s Ethereum mining performance like on a M1 Mac?</p>



<p>The obvious thing to do first is to run the off-the-shelf <code>ethminer</code>, which gives the following error:</p>



<pre><code>ethminer 0.19.0-alpha.0
Build: darwin/release/appleclang

Unrecognized platform Apple
Error: No usable mining devices found</code></pre>



<p>Not good. Apparently Apple GPUs are not whitelisted in ethminer. That should be easy to fix. Relevant lines are in <code>libethash-cl/CLMiner.cpp</code>, and I added Apple GPUs to the whitelist, pretending it’s an Intel GPU.</p>



<p>Then <code>boost</code> won’t compile since it’s trying to compile with a <code>-fcoalesce-templates</code> argument, which doesn’t exist in recent clang versions. So I have to update <code>boost</code> to the latest version, and fix relevant <code>asio</code> code since <code>ethminer</code> was using deprecated <code>asio</code> APIs.</p>



<p>I also need to upgrade OpenSSL to the latest version to have it support darwin + arm64.</p>



<p>After getting everything to compile. Here’s the result:</p>

<h2>Is it worth it?</h2>



<p>Um. Not really. At current Ethereum prices (2021-02-26), it generates $0.14 of profit per day. It’s still a profit, but very miniscule.</p>

February 26, 2021 | https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2021/02/26/standards-in-arm-space-part-iii/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2021/02/26/standards-in-arm-space-part-iii/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In <a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2020/10/12/standards-in-arm-space-part-i/">the first part</a> I went from
board files and ugly bootloaders to <span>SBSA</span>/<span>SBBR</span> and <span>EBBR</span>.
<a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2020/11/13/standards-in-arm-space-part-ii/">The second part</a> went through <span>BSA</span>,
<span>BBR</span> etc. <abbr title="Three Letter Acronym">TLAs</abbr> and what changes they brought into <abbr title="Other Four Letter Acronym">OFLAs</abbr>.</p>
<p>And both were about specifications written for developers (both hardware and
software). This time I will write something about ones written for marketing&nbsp;people.</p>
<h3><span>SBSA</span>, <span>SBBR</span>, <span>EBBR</span>, <span>LBBR</span>&nbsp;etc</h3>
<p>Who is gonna remember all those acronyms and what they mean? Only those who
really have to. Rest of people needs something easier to&nbsp;remember.</p>
<h3>ServerReady</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Design a System that “Just&nbsp;Works”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2018 Arm brought <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/platform-design/server-systems">ServerReady program</a>.
Name sounds much better than “hardware needs to comply with <span>SBSA</span> and firmware
has to be <span>SBBR</span> compliant”, right? Ah, and “has to pass <span>ACS</span>” (which stands for
Architectural Compliance&nbsp;Suite).</p>
<p>Yeah — one simple name instead of three acronyms. So imagine situation when you
need to convince your boss that project needs a serious AArch64 machine for
Continuous Integration builds. You can say “We buy <span>XYZ</span> because it is a Server
Ready system” and they assume that it is a server so <span>IT</span> should be able to handle&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Try to say “we buy <span>XYZ</span> because it is <span>SBSA</span> and <span>SBBR</span> compliant and passes <span>ACS</span>” and
you can get asked about your mental&nbsp;health…</p>
<h3>SystemReady</h3>
<p>But not every AArch64 system is server class hardware. Or needs what whole <span>UEFI</span>,
<span>ACPI</span> etc. things in&nbsp;firmware.</p>
<p>So in 2020 Arm came with <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/system-architectures/arm-systemready">SystemReady program</a>.
It is basically ServerReady renamed and extended to cover wider selection of
hardware and firmware&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>It came around same time as <span>BSA</span>, <span>BBR</span>, <span>LBBR</span> etc. which I described in <a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2020/11/13/standards-in-arm-space-part-ii/">the second
part</a> already so will not repeat
what those acronyms&nbsp;mean.</p>
<h4>certification&nbsp;bands</h4>
<p>There are four ‘bands’&nbsp;defined:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Certification</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>hardware specs</th>
<th>firmware spec</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>SystemReady <span>SR</span></td>
<td>ServerReady</td>
<td><span>BSA</span> + <span>SBSA</span></td>
<td><span>SBBR</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SystemReady <span>ES</span></td>
<td>Embedded Server (*)</td>
<td><span>BSA</span></td>
<td><span>SBBR</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SystemReady <span>IR</span></td>
<td>IoT Ready</td>
<td><span>BSA</span></td>
<td><span>EBBR</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SystemReady <span>LS</span></td>
<td>LinuxBoot ServerReady</td>
<td><span>BSA</span> + <span>SBSA</span></td>
<td><span>LBBR</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>*) spec says “Embedded ServerReady” but it is probably an error as it was also
mentioned as “Embedded Server” in few places outside of&nbsp;specification.</p>
<p>What that means for&nbsp;developers?</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Certification</th>
<th>hardware type</th>
<th>usual firmware</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>SystemReady <span>SR</span></td>
<td>server class</td>
<td><span>UEFI</span> + <span>ACPI</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SystemReady <span>ES</span></td>
<td>some <span>SBC</span></td>
<td><span>UEFI</span> + <span>ACPI</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SystemReady <span>IR</span></td>
<td>some <span>SBC</span></td>
<td>(<span>UEFI</span> or U-Boot) + <span>DTB</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SystemReady <span>LS</span></td>
<td>server class</td>
<td>LinuxBoot</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Where <span>UEFI</span> means Tianocore <span>EDK2</span> or similar. And U-Boot needs <span>EFI</span> layer enabled
(to fulfill <span>EBBR</span>&nbsp;requirements).</p>
<h4>recertification</h4>
<p><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0109/latest">SystemReady specification</a> 
says that <span>SR</span> systems are also <span>ES</span> compliant. There is no need for recertification
if someone wants to put other&nbsp;sticker.</p>
<p>There are changes in progress. One of them is Devicetree requirement for <span>IR</span>
band. So not every <span>ES</span> will be compliant with <span>IR</span> unless firmware be&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p><span>BTW</span> — specification mentions 32-bit systems. But IoT Ready only as they are not
covered by <span>BSA</span>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Creation of ServerReady and later SystemReady specifications was good move. We
got simple name which can be understood by mere&nbsp;mortals.</p>
<p>Developers and other interested people can go deeper and read about <span>BSA</span>, <span>BBR</span>,
<span>EBBR</span>, <span>LBBR</span>, <span>SBBR</span>, <span>SBSA</span> and other <abbr title="Three Letter Acronym">TLAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Other Four Letter Acronym">OFLAs</abbr>.</p>

<blockquote><p>That’s why I had to write this book: to set the record straight about online businesses and generating wealth in general.</p><cite><a href="https://alexbecker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Becker</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>PS: This is a long post for focused and curious minds only. So if you are a caffeine addict, grab a cup of coffee (like these <a href="http://benwajdi.com/go/bulletproof-tanzania-coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clean bulletproof bean from Mlama, Tanzania</a>), and follow through this post about WEALTH.</p>



<p><em>Pillar: an upright shaft that supports an overhead structure. (Merriam-Webster’s Online Thesaurus)</em></p>



<p>Oh Pillars! And the first thing that came to mind is a picture of these beautiful Greek temples. Good old style marble Greek Pillars. But in Alex Becker’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZUf6MX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a>, there are Pillars too, but pillars of wealth, and they count up to 10. These are your Core Beliefs, your basic yet essential weapons on your way to wealth.</p>



<p>This book is about grounding new beliefs in our heads, while eliminating old poisonous and limiting ones that we usually inherit from our environments. It turns out there is a way to win in life (at least financially) and there is a way that gets us there. Once we figure out the road, once we start making ‘a little bit of money’ we can’t help but want to make even more. </p>



<p>The reason why so many people get rich and others stay poor, is that those who have gotten rich came to a very low or bad point in life AND consequently they decided there is no way they are going to stay that way, they reached rock bottom and they know how things look, feel, and smell down there so they decided to promise themselves that no matter what they will escape serfdom, they said to themselves ‘By god I am gonna be financially independent’. </p>



<p>You have to reject the idea that to become rich you need to e special, a marketing genius, or lucky. The author warns us from the start, that is the number one prerequisite before plunging into the rest of the book.</p>



<p>I like how Alex compares the difficulty of getting rich to that of improving at video games, though I don’t pay video games, I could get his point, which is summarized in 3 parts:<br></p>



<ol><li>Believe you can get great at something.</li><li>Then play the ‘game’ over and over again</li><li>Don’t give up until 1 is accomplished</li></ol>



<p><em><strong>==&gt;Break the limiting beliefs.</strong></em></p>




<h2><span id="About_Alex_Becker"></span>About Alex Becker<span></span></h2>



<p>The most woke empty house billionaire business guy, also known as Alex Becker.</p>



<ul><li>He completed his four years term with the Air Force.</li></ul>



<ul><li>He started looking for way to generate income online.</li></ul>



<ul><li>He stumbled upon SEO.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Alex started building websites, ranking them really good on Google, and started to make an income. At one point he got <a href="http://benwajdi.com/go/sogoodatseo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so good at SEO</a>, within few months, that he was offered a job at a marketing agency; he took it.</li></ul>



<blockquote><p>I began to work on my own business every second I got so I could grow it enough that I could quit my marketing agency job. When I got home from my job, I worked. While my friends were playing video games at night, I worked. While everyone I knew was at the pool drinking on the weekend, I worked.<br>Then, two months later, I was generating over $20,000 a month from my business, not including my job’s paycheck. At that point, I quit my job and never looked back.</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>With $6,000 in his retirement account, he went all in with his online business.</li></ul>



<ul><li>He built an SEO business from scratch called ‘Source Wave’, scaled it, and then sold it.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Founded HYROS, an ad AI-based tracking tool for businesses that spend 6 figures+ per month on ads. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hyros.com/" target="_blank">Hyros</a> work with celebrity/influencer such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.deangraziosi.com/" target="_blank">Dean Graziosi</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TomBilyeu" target="_blank">Tom Bilyeu</a>, eCommerce brands such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://billygeneismarketing.com/" target="_blank">Billy Gene</a>, Dan Henry, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kinobody.com/" target="_blank">Kinobody</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://clickfunnels.com/" target="_blank">clickfunnels</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.impacttheory.com/" target="_blank">ImpactTheory</a>.</li></ul>

<p>Cash Flow Businesses (CF) are the easiest to start. They require little to no capital.No staff or overhead. You can start a CF business from your bedroom if you want.<br>These businesses take a lot of time to run and manage, because it is usually a one -man operation; you will be the one providing a service to a client, marketing and promoting your services, and also the one doing the accounting and every other details. And that’s why, scaling this business is often not an option, and a well-defined cap on revenues, income &amp; profits can estimated from the beginning. With all this being said, expect a profit margin up to 90%.</p>



<ul><li>High Investment Scalable Businesses (HIS):<br></li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="678" src="https://benwajdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differenttypesofbusinessesHIS-1024x678.png" alt="" srcset="http://benwajdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differenttypesofbusinessesHIS-1024x678.png 1024w, http://benwajdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differenttypesofbusinessesHIS-300x199.png 300w, http://benwajdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differenttypesofbusinessesHIS-768x508.png 768w, http://benwajdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differenttypesofbusinessesHIS-1536x1017.png 1536w, http://benwajdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differenttypesofbusinessesHIS-2048x1356.png 2048w, http://benwajdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differenttypesofbusinessesHIS-1200x794.png 1200w, http://benwajdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differenttypesofbusinessesHIS-1980x1311.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>High Investment Scalable Businesses</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is the type of business that Venture Capitalists, like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Ravikant" target="_blank">Naval Ravikant</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, are constantly looking for to invest in. These businesses oftentimes ‘explode out of nowhere’ even after years of being stuck or incurring losses.<br>These businesses are very scalable by their own definition. In a business like this, you need to pay close attention to every little detail: hiring the right people, studying competitors, and doing proper market research, etc…<br>Lunching a High Investment Scalable business requires some chunk of starting capital however. And that’s why, Alex Becker advises the reader who are still beginners to start with Cash Flow Business and then they can put their into a HIS business, should they want to.

<p>This is where you can ‘park’ your money and can expect sometimes as high as 10%-15% ROI per year. Think investing in rental properties or in restaurants. It is relatively safe form of investing (as long as the economy doesn’t collapse) and the businesses you invest your money in are still sell-able.</p>

<blockquote><p>The longer I live, the more I am certain that the great difference between men—between the feeble and the powerful, the great and the insignificant—is energy, invincible determination—a purpose once fixed, and then—death or victory!</p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fowell_Buxton" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fowell_Buxton" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas Fowell Buxton</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>By god, I am going to get rich! It’s a personal decision, a kind-of an intimate transaction between you and you only, you have your own reasons and motives and no body has the right to ask you about them. Just make them fuel you. Alex Becker, and throughout the book, emphasize the importance of getting to a very low point or extremely bad situation in life where for some people this decision becomes inevitably, and hence becoming wealthy becomes inevitable. (it’s just a matter of time)</p>



<p>Most people never become wealthy. Why? They never decide to get rich. And why? Because, they don’t believe that they can get rich because of X, Y, and Z.</p>



<p>As selfish as it looks on paper, and in life, believing it, seeing it, perceiving the whole thing before it comes to fruition is an indispensable prerequisite to actually getting it.<br>You may not a be spiritual person, you may not believe in superstitions, and stick only to reason and rationality, even so, you got to have this one belief, a one that has nothing to back it in today’s reality but that you have to have to get to your destination.</p>



<h2><span id="Reject_Getting_Rich_Slow"></span>Reject Getting Rich Slow<span></span></h2>



<p>This one from Becker really reminds me of <a href="http://benwajdi.com/2020/12/30/mj-demarco-the-millionaire-fastlane-book-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MJ DeMacro’s The Millionaire FastLane</a>. I wouldn’t even be surprised that DeMacro inspired Alex to go on and achieve what he has achieved so far</p>



<p>Don’t be “mildly miserable” like the rest. They are wrong, and that’s why they are the stuck traffic fighter who end up in jobs they hate because it’s ‘secure’.</p>



<p>The slow low risk way to getting wealthy is not risk free at all. In fact, its risks are uncontrollable. You are gambling your future’s outcome on variables outside the scope of your control; things like the economy, the value of the currency you are holding your savings in, the performance of the company you are working for(and whether or not they are going to lay off some employees when the going gets tough).</p>



<blockquote><p>getting rich slowly requires you to spend 71 percent of your days for the rest of your young life at work.</p></blockquote>



<p>The big reward at the end of the work tunnel. It’s an illusion! You might day before even get to there.</p>



<p>Get-rich slowly:</p>



<ul><li>extreme financial hardships</li><li>zero control on your financial future</li><li>spend 71% of your young lifespan on work(5 days out of 7 a week)</li><li>No chance of getting your dream/fantasy life</li><li>Constantly living under financial stress (worrying about money all the time)</li><li>All you your decision are based around money (or the lack of it)</li></ul>







<h2><span id="Separate_Your_Time_from_Your_Income"></span>Separate Your Time from Your Income<span></span></h2>



<p>Everyone have limited time (24 hours a day), so trying to tie your income to your disposable time is a very bad idea and it is literally putting a cap on how much money you will be making from the start. It’s been said over and over again, nobody ever got rich alone. You need other people to help you produce, sell , promote, communicate, and eventually buy from you. This is the reason why many successful business-people are good at dealing with people. And even the ones who are not so good at dealing with people and still went on to be successful, often you will discover that they hired the right employees to take care of that for them.</p>



<p>And so, you are facing two options:<br>=&gt;Either you spend all your time trying to do everything by yourself, and therefore your income isn’t under your control<br>=&gt;Or you increase the value of your time and completely separate your time from your income<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Instead of spending our time working, we should spend our time creating systems that do the work for us.</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>Clone yourself, either by hiring a super productive team, by building or buying, or subscribing to AI/tech/tools, that will bring your expenses down and profits up.

<p>See our <a href="https://laurencemolloy.github.io/RepoDash/"><strong>github.io pages</strong></a> 
for detailed instructions on how to use RepoDash.</p>



<p>Do you maintain a project codebase on Github? Would you like to be able to collate statistics 
that summarise historic monthly activity on that codebase and see, at a glance, how that impacts 
the project issues list over time? Would you like to be able to perform this analysis for any 
given time period of your choosing?</p>

<p>RepoDash can do just this. It uses the Github API to collect repository data and generate a 
data visualisation of a range of historic metrics of the project issues list over a user-specified 
period of time. For each calendar month in the time period of interest, it displays the following 
metrics:</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of new issues created</li>
<li>How many of these issues are still open at the time of generating the dashboard</li>
<li>How many of these issues still require triage (labelling) at the time of generating the dashboard</li>
<li>The number of existing issues resolved</li>
<li>The percentage split between opened / closed issues</li>
<li>The aggregate number of open issues in the issues list (month start &amp; month end)</li>
<li>The aggregate number of open issues in the issues list requiring triage (month start &amp; month end)</li>
<li>The change in total number of open issues over the month</li>
<li>The average age and age spread of open issues in the isssues list</li>
</ul>


<p>It also displays aggregate counts for the most frequently used labels for all issues that remained open
at the end of the displayed time period.</p>

<h3>Typical Use Cases</h3>

<p>Perhaps you are managing an open source project, the maintenance of which you'd like to keep on top 
of. Or perhaps you manage a software product at work where you are required to provide your boss with 
exective summary updates of your support team's progress on an ongoing monthly basis. Either way, if 
your codebase is managed via Github, RepoDash could be just what you need.</p>

<h3>Demo Mode</h3>

<p>For demo purposes, this code processes the first 10 pages of the matplotlib<sup>1</sup> project and 
displays the most recent 12 months of metrics by default. Command line arguments allow you to set your
own project repository and analysis timeframe. It couldn't be simpler.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em><a href="https://matplotlib.org/"><strong>matplotlib</strong></a> is a popular open science 
plotting library for python which is utilised by RepoDash to generate its data visualisations</em></p>

<h3>Future Development</h3>

<p>This project is a work in progress. The current version of RepoDash has only been tested with open 
source (public) projects. However, there are plans to ensure that it works with private ones as well. 
Over time, we also plan to build on the range of metrics offered and make it easy for the user to select 
which metrics to display... watch this space!</p>

        <p>Over-fitting is a lie.</p>

<h2 id="backgroud">Backgroud</h2>

<p>I <a href="https://drorcohengithub.github.io/website/decoding/encoding/fmri/2020/07/31/decoding_visual_experience.html">previously talked about</a> predicting and decoding brain activity as recorded using fMRI. In that post I followed the tried and true approach of (1) extracting some features from the stimulus and (2) fitting a regularised linear regression from the features to brain activity. It works really well.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we use linear regression in these type of “encoding” studies is that there is not much data. For example in that study the training set had only about 7200 samples (which is quite a lot by fMRI community standards). The traditional thinking is that very rich models, such as deep neural nets (NNs) with millions of parameters, will disastrously over-fit in this type of situation, resulting in low performance. However, this traditional thinking may be out of date.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293878v1">recent paper uploaded to bioarxiv</a> generated some discussion in our lab. It is a very thorough study looking at predicting brain activity using deep NNs with many interesting results. Among these results, the authors show that replacing the linear regression with a NN provides a substantial improvement over linear regression (see also <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00021/full">here</a>).</p>

<p>I think is pretty likely that with some effort and a lot of NN know-how an expert can improve on the performance of a linear model. But I figured that avoiding over-fitting in this situation is going to be really hard, and that an out of the box implementation would perform disastrously. So I thought I’d give it a go.</p>

<p>In this post I go through fitting a simple NN, though still with millions of parameters, to predict brain activity. I’ll use a vanilla NN paired with the same data I analyzed in my previous post. This way we will have a direct comparison with the linear model. A full notebook to reproduce this is up on my <a href="https://github.com/drorcohengithub/Prediciting_BOLD_with_TensorFlow">github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>

<p>We will use the same data from last time. For convenience I put everything you’ll need <a href="https://figshare.com/s/9803543b6736009e7a83">here</a>.</p>

  <li><strong>voxel_test_data</strong> this is the brain activity data we will use in the final test of the model</li>
  <li><strong>ME_features_train_data</strong> this is the ME feature data we will use to train the model. The feature vector consists of stacking together four consecutive delays (t-3 to t-6, see the <a href="https://drorcohengithub.github.io/website/decoding/encoding/fmri/2020/07/31/decoding_visual_experience.html">original post</a> for details)</li>

  <li><strong>linear_model_acc</strong> this is the accuracy data for the linear model. This is calculated as the pearsons correlation between the model predictions and the test data (i.e. voxel_test_data)</li>
</ul>

<p>I restrict the analysis to the 2000 voxels that were best predicted using the linear model. This is a bit harsh on our NN here because it is possible that the NN improves on voxels that the linear model was poor at predicting, so keep that in mind.</p>

<h2 id="the-network">The network</h2>

<p>We first need to decide on the structure of the network. There is now a whole zoo of network architectures and I think it is pretty likely that many of them are superior to the linear model. However, the point here to see how well an “out of the box” NN works. Nothing is more vanilla than a tutorial, so I will use the architecture from the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression">TensorFlow regression tutorial</a>. The architecture has two hidden, densely connected layers with relu activations. We will be fitting a mere 1,812,304 parameters.</p>

<p>There really is no reason to think that this architecture is suited to our specific problem. But if something like this <em>does</em> work, then it may not be so difficult to come up with a NN that is superior to the linear model.</p>

<p>To the model.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-the-training-and-validation-data">Prepare the training and validation data</h2>

<p>I will keep some data aside for validation as we train the model. The key thing to remember here is that we are using time series data. This means that the data is not iid. If we just grabbed samples randomly for validation then there is a good chance that dependent samples will be in the training set. For example, we may end up with sample at t=n in the val set but t=n-1 in the training set. These are dependent, and in fact likely to be quite similar. In this case performance on the validation test will reflect something of double dipping and probably be much higher than what we get on the final test set.</p>

<p>I will very crudely grab three chunks of 200 samples at intervals of 2000, 4000 and 6000 samples. This is completely arbitrary and pretty poor practice. We did much better on the ridge regression in the previous post, but I think it is good enough for illustration. Note that we might have a bit of leakage (since the samples around these chunks are still in the training set), but I think it is not too much of a worry.</p>

<p>flatcat invites to experience a new dimension of touch and motion. Cuddle with it, have a gentle romp, or just watch it do weird things on its own, to caress your soul. The robot feels everything exactly with cognitive sensorimotor loops based on ten years of developmental robotics research. flatcat has no face, no app, no cloud, full privacy. It is built around a 3D printed skeleton and is powered by Jetpack Cognition Lab‘s own electrical motor design.</p>



<p>The new product will be available on Kickstarter and selected outlets beginning March 3, 2021. Visit https://flatcat.berlin for more information.</p>
