      <p><em>What do <strong>I</strong> know? What do <strong>we</strong> know?</em></p>
<p><em>How do we know what we know and what is there that we should know?</em></p>
<p>Video games like Age of Empires, Civilisation and others have the concept of technology trees.</p>
<img src="https://zorbash.com/images/posts/knowledge_map/aoe.jpg">
<p>I study a lot, where should I spend my time? What should I read next? Is my knowledge broad enough?
I’ve used Goodreads quite extensively, it’s great to discover new books to read, mark your progress,
make friends and such.</p>
<p>Nowadays there’s so much information readily available, but not that many tools to help you
organise and allocate your “research points”.</p>
<h2 id="learning-together">Learning Together</h2>
<p>The recent COVID-19 pandemic surfaced the shortcomings of humanity to work together
to solve fundamental healthcare issues.
Some “experts” rushed to call it a black swan, despite it clearly not being one (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pandemic-isnt-a-black-swan-but-a-portent-of-a-more-fragile-global-system">read more</a>).</p>
<p>Thousands of Americans are victims of the opioid crisis and countless ones
are shoveling their money in the wild-west of unregulated fintech companies
with mottos like “anyone can be a trader” or in cryptocurrencies 🙃.</p>
<p>The media promote optimising for the short-term, making us think we’re the last generation to walk the planet.
Our countries are involved in wars, we fund wars with our taxes, yet the disasters
that war brings always seem so remote.</p>
<p>How do we respond? We <strong>educate</strong> ourselves, we <strong>talk</strong>, we <strong>act</strong>. A university degree or a code
bootcamp might help you land a job, but securing your freedom of thought is a never-ending struggle.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-learn">Learning to Learn</h2>
<p>Be more systematic, build your knowledge map and start exploring branch
by branch.
You don’t need a degree as a reward, nor any imaginary internet points.
The real reward is that you’ll be able to better understand the natural world and society.
Think of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackLivesMatter">#BlackLivesMatter</a> how much do you know about it? Do you want to be the person who forms
an opinion based on a couple of tweets or headlines?
Create a list of books, films, articles to go through and keep track of your progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading, has this incredible effect that it minimises your chances of becoming a racist,
an anti-vaxxer, a climate-change denier or a flat earther. Quite a reward ain’t it?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="universities">Universities</h2>
<p>Universities play the role of gatekeepers of knowledge and the perpetuation of class segregation.
Your studies have a certain duration and you get a degree. While such a concept is valuable to maintain
the status quo and keep the economy going it doesn't really seem to be about knowledge.
Learning is a continuous process and universities should not extinguish your passion for knowledge in exchange for a degree.
For me, receiving my degree wasn't something to celebrate. It was rather a warrant to stay away from the
supposed mecca of learning.</p>
<img src="https://zorbash.com/images/posts/knowledge_map/university.jpg">
<p>Fortunately in the digital age there are plenty of choices when it comes to expanding your knowledge.
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khanacademy</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> to name a few.
Most of them seem heavily leaning towards STEM studies though. Where do we learn about the world?</p>
<p>First things first, by “the world” I mean outside the tech bubble.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I can fix your computer, but how do I fix racism, how do I get to know my body, improve my health,
manage my personal finances and understand democracy and political science, so to meaningfully
participate in the commons?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="theres-hope">There's Hope</h2>
<p>The open-source community is a fantastic example of people working asynchronously together and
having colossal impact in our lives.</p>
<p>A laughably simple algo to keep learning could be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Map your knowledge in a graph format</li>
<li>Keep notes / annotate your readings publicly</li>
<li>Pick another branch from the tree</li>
<li>Go to step 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, there's nothing embarrassing in admitting you don't know
something, it's empowering and the first step to master any subject.</p>
<p>What about the cover image of this post?
Well, I couldn't help it and wrote some code to support it.</p>

<p>Khanacademy used to have a <a href="https://khanacademy.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_Map">knowledge map</a> feature which I found
inspiring. Browsing a universe of infinite topics, continuing education ftw.</p>
<img src="https://zorbash.com/images/posts/knowledge_map/ka_map.jpg">
<h3 id="building-my-knowledge-map">Building my Knowledge Map</h3>
<p>So, I decided to build my own map and needed to bootstrap it somehow. I
quickly extracted, cleaned and analysed the tags of my Tefter bookmarks.
For the uninitiated, <a href="https://tefter.io/">Tefter</a> is a social bookmarking app I use heavily and I also develop 🤠.</p>
<img src="https://zorbash.com/images/posts/knowledge_map/banner.jpg">
<p>On the graph, tags are nodes and edges connect topics when they appear as tags on the same bookmark.</p>
<p>Is this a real knowledge map? No, it's the minimum viable hack, a
compass to aid me steer towards building the real one.</p>
<p>Feel free to have a look and remix the code of the visualisation on <a href="https://glitch.com/~helpful-kind-beechnut">Glitch</a>.</p>
<p>To make progress I'll attempt to bring order to that
chaotic graph by grouping some topics together. I'm also starting this
book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consilience_(book)">“Consilence: The Unity of Knowledge”</a> which might help me with that.</p>
<p>I'll also try to evaluate some apps and methodologies below:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I often speak about the origins of Venmo in person and finally wrote down the story here to share with our latest intern class that started this week. (You can also watch an excellent video of Iqram speaking about even more of the history of Venmo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX7JCCCmLJw">here</a>. It’s a good place to pickup the story where this post leaves off.)</p>

<p>My friend Iqram and I started Venmo to solve a very simple problem for ourselves and for our friends: we noticed that we were still using cash and checks to pay each other back and thought this was silly. Everyone should be using PayPal to pay each other back, but no one we knew was. We thought something must be not quite right about the PayPal experience for casual use, and we decided to design something that felt “right,” something that felt consistent with all of the other mobile tools we used to interact with our friends, like SMS, Gmail, Facebook, etc. This is the story of how we got to Venmo.</p>

<h2 id="penn">Penn</h2>

<p>Iqram and I met as randomly paired freshman year roommates at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001. We’ve been great friends ever since.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/git/origins-of-venmo/iqram-kortina-college.png">
<figcaption>Oldest pic I could find of me and Iqram.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Iqram studied computer science at Penn. I started in computer science, but found that much of the learning I was doing happened while I was doing homework exercises, and I was getting no additional value out of the University. I couldn’t justify tuition costs when I was only learning by spending time doing programming exercises, and I developed a hypothesis that I would maximize the value of tuition costs by studying the least practical subjects possible, the things I would not get to do after graduation / outside of University, like reading and discussing great books with a group of incredibly smart students and professors (this backfired, btw–liberal arts is very practical stuff!). I eschewed big lectures and things like On Campus Recruiting, and tried to spend as much time possible in seminars and writing workshops. I ended up with majors in Philosophy and Creative Writing and minors in Computer Science and Logic.</p>

<p>I remained interested in building things during this time, however, and always took the opportunity to build websites for various clubs I was in or for friends with bands, etc.</p>

<p>During our senior year, Iqram and I built our first real project together, a college classifieds site called My Campus Post. It was our first taste of all night coding sessions to get a product to market, and we learned a bunch about grassroots marketing and retention challenges that arise from products with seasonal usage.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/git/origins-of-venmo/mycampuspost.png">

</figure>

<p>I loved spending all of my time reading philosophy, working on fun side projects, and actively ignoring practical things like interviewing for jobs, but I clearly remember the day when my Mom was in town for graduation and she asked, “What are you doing after you graduate?” I was sitting on the floor of my dorm room, and I remember being very scared about the question, thinking, “I have no idea what I want to do with my life,” but also feeling OK about the short term, eventually answering, “I don’t have to move out of my dorm until 2 weeks after graduation. I’ll figure something out.”</p>

<h2 id="post-grad-door-to-door-sales">Post Grad Door to Door Sales</h2>

<p>Iqram ended up finding a cheap sublet in West Philly, and we spent the summer building websites for restaurants, salons, bars, etc. We went door to door selling, “Hey, you need a website. We’ll build it for $500…. $100? OK, deal.” We learned a lot as we tried to abstract the sites we were building into something modular, and we got a lot of experience pitching and hearing “no.” One “no” that I still regret more than most of the others I have subsequently heard (for much bigger deals) was for this amazing Pakistani restaurant, Kabobeesh, that served a chicken kabob sandwich on fresh naan bread for $3.50: we tried to sell them a site for 100 chicken rolls, but failed to close them.</p>

<img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/git/origins-of-venmo/kabobeesh.png">
<figcaption>Kabobeesh: I recommend the chicken rolls and chicken karahi.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once, we were chatting at a bar about how we might pad our sporadic income with some part time jobs. We noticed the bar was hiring, got two applications, and started filling them out. We spent a few minutes getting through all the basic background stuff, education, personal info, and got to the references section. We didn’t really have past employers to list at the time, so I put Iqram as a reference, and he put me. We were still rooming together at the time, so we had the same street address. We did not get a call back.</p>

<h2 id="swooge-and-philafunk">Swooge and Philafunk</h2>

<p>During this period, we were always also working on startup-y things, like a realtime website analytics tool called Swooge (which now reminds me of Chartbeat + Google Analytics) and a web based music selling platform, Philafunk (it was like iTunes + MySpace).</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/git/origins-of-venmo/philafunk.jpg">
<figcaption>Philafunk site and flyer.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After working on a few of these, we realized we had a lot to learn about building a successful startup, so we decided to go find one and work there. Many of these projects we worked on were still in my opinion great ideas and solid evidence that execution matters much more than the idea.</p>

<h2 id="iminlikewithyou">iminlikewithyou</h2>

<p>So we found this NYC company, iminlikewithyou.com, that was just getting started out of Y Combinator, and we joined as 2 of the first 3 employees, all engineers starting together the day we moved to NYC. We had a talented team, built a really innovative, immersive web experience, and learned a bunch about doing startups for real. Eventually, the company pivoted from the original flirting-site idea into a casual games company (OMGPOP), and we both left because we weren’t interested in building games.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="ticketleap-and-bitly">Ticketleap and Bit.ly</h2>

<p>Iqram worked at Ticketleap as the VP of Engineering for a few years, and I bounced around and ended up spending a bunch of time working at Betaworks, on Bit.ly.</p>

<p>We both learned a lot during this period, but I looked forward to the time when we would work on a new project together, with more knowledge and experience this time. Over the years, I often brought up this idea, but the timing was never quite right.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-new-product-ideas">Exploring New Product Ideas</h2>

<p>In early 2009, Iqram chatted me mentioning that he was feeling ready to move on from Ticketleap, and I remember thinking, “Great let’s do this.” We began getting together on weekends (he was in Philly and I was in NYC) to hack on different ideas.</p>

<h2 id="yogorino">Yogorino</h2>

<p>We had a friend in Philadelphia who was opening a yogurt shop, and while helping her get up and running technically, we realized how horrible traditional point of sales software was. We prototyped a web based point of sales software that would turn any laptop into a cash register with a $50 USB magtek swiper. As we thought about it more, it seemed like this would present a really challenging distribution problem (we remembered our days of door to door restaurant sales…). Plus, although this was designed to solve a problem for one of our friends, it wasn’t software that we would be using ourselves daily.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<h2 id="back-to-music">Back to Music</h2>

<p>Another idea we explored came to us at a local jazz show: we thought, “It would be awesome to be able to download this show by sending a text message to this band right now, and then have an mp3 show up in our email.” This was getting closer to the Venmo concept we ultimately arrived at, and the detailed wireframes we constructed for this definitely informed a lot of the original Venmo service.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/git/origins-of-venmo/rootsbuy.png">
<figcaption>Wireframe for selling music downloads via SMS.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This concept even bore the Venmo name. Lots of people ask about the origin of the name. The brainstorming process was one of many we tried and was not important as the requirements. We were exploring the Latin root vendere “sell” and mo for mobile, but purely as a means to get to a name that (1) was short, 5-6 letters, (2) could be a verb, (3) didn’t have a unintuitive spelling, and (4) was cheap. Venmo was available on GoDaddy and met the important criteria, so we grabbed it.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<h2 id="discovering-venmo">Discovering Venmo</h2>

<p>One of the weekends we were getting together to work on this idea, Iqram was visiting me in NYC and left his wallet in Philly. I covered him for the whole weekend, and he ended up writing me a check to pay me back. It was annoying for him to have to find a checkbook to do this, and annoying for me to have to go to the bank if I wanted to cash it (I never did). We thought, “Why are we still doing this? We do everything else with our phones. We should definitely be using PayPal to pay each other back. But we don’t, and none of our friends do.”</p>

<p>So we decided, let’s just try to solve this problem, and build a way to pay each other back that feels consistent with all of the other experiences we have in apps we use with our friends.</p>

<p>We got pretty excited about this idea, and thought, “Surely someone else must be doing this.” We found a laptop and started googling, and soon came across Obopay: a way to send money to anyone directly from your cell phone. They had recently raised $70M from Nokia, and we thought, “Uh-oh.” But then we poked around the website and the product and found that there was no feel and it seemed a little clunky and not like something anyone we knew would ever use.</p>

<h2 id="evolution-of-the-note">Evolution of the Note</h2>

<p>We got a prototype working pretty quickly. It worked over SMS, and was dead simple. To send iqram $20, text “iqram 20” to our number (a hacked Google Voice account, because the alternative, Textmarks, required that you prefix every text message with a keyword–this was back in the days before Twilio…). The recipient saw “kortina paid you $20.”</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/git/origins-of-venmo/gvhack.png">
<figcaption>Google Voice SMS hack.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Right after we got this working we decided we needed to have a note with each payment so we could keep track of what all of these random amounts were for: “iqram 20 for thai lunch at Nooch.”</p>

<p>The interface was SMS, so we immediately thought, of course it would only be natural for the person on the other end to see the message, so we updated …</p></article></div>

What are the challenges of writing portable BPF programs that developers need to deal with? This post will describe BPF portability problem and how BPF CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere) is helping to address this problem.</p>
<!--truncate-->

<h2>BPF: state of the art</h2>
<p>Since the inception of (e)BPF, it’s been a constant priority for the BPF community to simplify BPF application development as much as possible, make it as straightforward and familiar of an experience as it would be for a user-space application. And with the steady progress around BPF programmability, writing BPF programs has never been easier.</p>
<p>Despite these usability improvements, though, one aspect of BPF application development has been neglected (mostly for technical reasons): portability. What does "BPF portability" mean, though? We define <strong>BPF portability</strong> as the ability to write a BPF program that will successfully compile and pass kernel verification, and will work <strong>correctly</strong> across <em>different kernel versions</em> without the need to recompile it for each particular kernel.</p>
<p>This note describes the BPF portability problem and our solution to it: BPF CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere). First, we’ll look at the BPF portability problem itself, describing why it is a problem and why it’s important to solve it. Then, we will outline high-level components of our solution, BPF CO-RE, and will give a glimpse into the pieces of the puzzle that needed to be put together to make it happen. We’ll conclude with a tutorial of sorts, describing the user-visible API of the BPF CO-RE approach and demonstrating its application with examples.</p>
<h2>The problem of BPF portability</h2>
<p>A BPF program is a piece of user-provided code which is injected straight into a kernel. Once loaded and verified, BPF programs execute in kernel context. These programs operate inside kernel memory space with access to all the internal kernel state available to it. This is extremely powerful and is one of the reasons why BPF technology is successfully used in so many varied applications. However, this powerful capability also creates the BPF portability pains we have today: BPF programs do not control memory layout of a surrounding kernel environment. They have to work with what they get from independently developed, compiled, and deployed kernels.</p>
<p>Additionally, kernel types and data structures are in constant flux. Different kernel versions will have struct fields shuffled around inside a struct, or even moved into a new inner struct. Fields can be renamed or removed, their types changed, either into some trivially-compatible ones or completely different ones. Structs and other types can get renamed, or they can be conditionally compiled out (depending on kernel configuration), or just plain removed between kernel versions.</p>
<p>In other words, things change all the time between kernel releases and yet BPF application developers are expected to cope with this problem somehow. How is it even possible to do anything useful with BPF today considering this ever-changing kernel environment? There are a few reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, not all BPF programs need to look into internal kernel data structures. One example is <code>opensnoop</code> tool, which relies on kprobes/tracepoints to track which processes open which files, and just needs to capture a few syscall arguments to work. As syscall parameters offer a stable ABI, these don’t change between kernel versions and as such portability is not a concern to begin with. Unfortunately, applications like this are quite rare. These types of applications are also typically quite limited in what they can do.</p>
<p>So, additionally, BPF machinery inside kernel provides a limited set of "stable interfaces" that BPF programs can rely on to be stable between kernels. In reality, underlying structures and mechanisms do change, but these BPF-provided stable interfaces abstract such details from user programs.</p>
<p>As one example, for networking applications it is usually enough to look at a limited set of <code>sk_buff</code>'s attributes (and packet data, of course) to be extremely useful and versatile. To that end, BPF verifier provides a stable <strong><code>__sk_buff</code></strong> "view" (notice underscores in front), which shields BPF programs from changing <code>struct sk_buff</code> layout. All the <code>__sk_buff</code> field accesses are transparently rewritten into an actual <code>sk_buff</code> accesses (sometimes quite elaborate ones – doing a bunch of internal pointer chasing before finally fetching requested field). Similar mechanisms are available to a bunch of different BPF program types. They are done as program type-specific BPF contexts understood by BPF verifier. So, if you are developing a BPF program with such context, consider yourself lucky, you can blissfully live in a nice illusion of stability.</p>
<p>But as soon as you need to get a glimpse at any raw internal kernel data (e.g., very commonly a <code>struct task_struct</code> which represents a process/thread and contains a treasure trove of process information), you are on your own. It is commonly the case for tracing, monitoring, and profiling applications, which are a huge class of extremely useful BPF programs.</p>
<p>In such cases, how do you make sure you are not reading garbage data when some kernel added an extra field before the field you thought is, say, at offset 16 from the start of <code>struct task_struct</code>? Suddenly, for that kernel, you'll need to read data from, e.g., offset 24. And the problems don't end there: what if a field got renamed, as was the case with <code>thread_struct</code>'s <code>fs</code> field (useful for accessing thread-local storage), which got renamed to <code>fsbase</code> between 4.6 and 4.7 kernels. Or what if you have to run on two different configurations of a kernel, one of which disabled some specific feature and completely compiled out parts of the struct (a common case for additional accounting fields, which are optional, but extremely useful if present)? All this means that you can no longer compile your BPF program locally using kernel headers of your dev server and distribute it in compiled form to other systems, while expecting it to work and produce correct results. This is because kernel headers for different kernel versions will specify a different memory layout of data your program relies on.</p>
<p>So far, people have been dealing with this problem by relying on <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/">BCC</a> (BPF Compiler Collection). With BCC, you embed your BPF program C source code into your user-space program (control application) <em>as a plain string</em>. When control application is eventually deployed and executed on target host, BCC invokes its embedded Clang/LLVM, pulls in local kernel headers (which you have to make sure are installed on the system from correct <code>kernel-devel</code> package), and performs compilation on the fly. This will make sure that memory layout that BPF program expects is exactly the same as in the target host's running kernel. If you have to deal with some optional and potentially compiled-out stuff in kernel, you'll just do <code>#ifdef</code>/<code>#else</code> guarding in your source code to accommodate such hazards as renamed fields, different semantics of values, or any optional stuff not available on current configuration. Embedded Clang will happily remove irrelevant parts of your code and will tailor BPF program code to specific kernel.</p>
<p>This sounds great, doesn't it? Not quite so, unfortunately. While this workflow works, it's not without major drawbacks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clang/LLVM combo is a big library, resulting in big fat binaries that need to be distributed with your application.</p></li>
<li><p>Clang/LLVM combo is resource-heavy, so when you are compiling BPF code at start up, you'll use a significant amount of resources, potentially tipping over a carefully balanced production workfload. And vice versa, on a busy host, compiling a small BPF program might take minutes in some cases.</p></li>
<li><p>You are making a big bet that the target system will have kernel headers present, which most of the time is not a problem, but sometimes can cause a lot of headaches. This is also an especially annoying requirement for kernel developers, because they often have to build and deploy custom one-off kernels as part of their development process. And without a custom-built kernel header package, no BCC-based application will work on such kernels, stripping developers of a useful set of tools for debugging and monitoring.</p></li>
<li><p>BPF program testing and development iteration is quite painful as well, as you are going to get even most trivial compilation errors only in runtime, once you recompile and restart your user-space control application. This certainly increases friction and is not helping to iterate fast.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, while BCC is a great tool, especially for quick prototyping, experimentation, and small tools, it certainly has lots of disadvantages when used for widely deployed production BPF applications.</p>
<p>We are stepping up the game of BPF portability with BPF CO-RE and believe this is a future of BPF program development, especially for complex real-world BPF applications.</p>
<h2>High-level BPF CO-RE mechanics</h2>
<p>BPF CO-RE brings together necessary pieces of functionality and data at all levels of the software stack: kernel, user-space BPF loader library (libbpf), and compiler (Clang) – to make it possible and easy to write BPF programs in a portable manner, handling discrepancies between different kernels within the same pre-compiled BPF program. BPF CO-RE requires a careful integration and cooperation of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BTF type information, which allows to capture crucial pieces of information about kernel and BPF program types and code, enabling all the other parts of BPF CO-RE puzzle;</p></li>
<li><p>compiler (Clang) provides means for BPF program C code to express the intent and record relocation information;</p></li>
<li><p>BPF loader (<a href="https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf">libbpf</a>) ties BTFs from kernel and BPF program together to adjust compiled BPF code to specific kernel on target hosts;</p></li>
<li><p>kernel, while staying completely BPF CO-RE-agnostic, provides advanced BPF features to enable some of the more advanced scenarios.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Working in ensemble, these components …</p></span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a few years, they're going to be everywhere: slow feeds, one-off digests, highly filtered content from your favorite sources.</p>
<p>Fewer algorithms, less recommended content, more good stuff from people you actually care about.</p>
<p>We're already seeing it with <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>. How cumbersome is it to subscribe to a different newsletter from each writer you want to follow? Still, people would rather do this than get lost in yet another platform where the signal gets lost in a sea of noise.</p>
<p>The transition is also <strong>from synchronicity to asynchronicity.</strong> Staying home locked down for months helped us realize that we could easily spend 8 full hours per day scrolling feeds, and yet no end would ever be in sight.</p>
<p>Why? Because that's how feeds are built: they're intrinsically <strong>synchronous, addictive, and endless</strong>.</p>
<p>The solution? <strong>Slower feeds.</strong> Better feeds. Purposeful and controlled digests, versus endless and mindless flows of information. A few companies are attempting to build them — <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">mine</a> among them — and I bet they're going to be everywhere soon.</p>
<p>While many tech companies will still try to get AIs to guess what's the next article you want to read, others will hopefully give back control in our hands, and try to unlearn what years of obsession for algorithms taught us. That's how we ended up here anywhere.</p>
<p>There must be a reason we miss Google Reader.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Typically, your annual charge depends on whether you hold funds or shares in your investment ISA. Here, we assume you'll invest in shares only. If you plan to invest in funds, have a look at our <a href="https://www.koody.co/investing/compare-funds-isa-charges">funds' comparison charts</a>. When you invest in shares, you'll have to pay several charges. In our pricing table below, we've only considered platform and dealing fees. You can find out more about online share dealing and its associated costs in our <a href="https://www.koody.co/investing/shares">Investing in Shares guide</a>.<br>‍<br><span><strong>Important:</strong></span><strong><br></strong>The table below shows annual charges of several share dealing platforms when you invest lump sums of £5,000, £20,000 or £100,000 in one year and make 12 ad hoc deals in the same year. A deal is either one of buying or selling an investment. It is also called a trade. We've used the colour red to indicate what platforms are more expensive compared to the others. This means the darker the shade of red, the more expensive the platform. Dark red doesn't mean bad or too expensive; it just means the platform is more expensive than others. If you would like to see a breakdown of fees charged by each platform, have a look at our <a href="https://www.koody.co/investing/charges-directory">Platform Charges Directory</a>.</p><p>We haven't included any calculations for regular investing, but we do note in the second column, regular investing dealing fees for your information.</p><p>Finally, it is important to let you know we show the costs which apply to the first year only. This is especially important because, with platforms such as iWeb, your charges reduce after the first year. Whereas, with platforms such as EQi, your charges might increase after the first year. You'll find all the details you need below. For each provider we list, your money is protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means you could get your money back up to £85,000 if any of the companies goes bust.</p></div></div>]]>

                        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels </a>makes about $600,000 a year. He taught himself to code and has an unconventional philosophy. This is not an interview but an analysis piece. Pieter defied the critics and built Nomad List and Remote OK into successful businesses without cutting edge tools like React or other modern frameworks. I send articles like this twice a week - <a href="https://nocsdegree.carrd.co/">join 2,000 developers that get the newsletter</a>.</p><h2 id="who-is-pieter-levels">Who is Pieter Levels</h2><p>Pieter is a self-taught developer from The Netherlands. He has an MBA but no coding qualifications. As we will see in today's article he has a rough and ready approach to coding but it pays off handsomely. </p><p>His <a href="https://www.nomadlist.com/">Nomad List</a> directory and community for digital nomads draws in over $300k a year and that's despite a recent fall in revenue due to people not travelling during the Corona virus crisis. </p><figure><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-14-at-23.30.06.png" alt=""></figure><p>His Remote Ok job board for remote workers made <a href="https://remoteok.io/open">$300,000 over the last 12 months</a></p><figure><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-14-at-23.23.51.png" alt="Revenue chart for Remote OK job board"></figure><p>So that's a total of $600,00 from the last 12 months! Not bad for a self-taught developer! Pieter is active on Twitter and has a very stong following there. </p><p>As he works for himself he is able to travel extensively and live where he choses. Although, rather than the common misconception of digital nomads being constantly on the move, Pieter recommends spending a few months in each place. This way you avoid travel burnout. </p><h2 id="how-did-pieter-levels-learn-to-code">How did Pieter Levels learn to code?</h2><p>Not a lot is known about his very earlies forays into coding apart from the fact that as a teenager he played around programming. His first attempt at a web business was an analytics service for Youtube which would let you see how all your videos/channels were performing in one place. Unfortunately, he worked on it for a year without making any money from it. </p><p>From that point Pieter adopted his now familar approach to coding and business - build websites quickly and monetize from the beginning. He only adds more features if there is money coming in and the idea is validated by the market.</p><p>Pieter takes the "search on Google" approach to Google. So when he wanted to connect a database to a website or make a button do something on his website he would just search the terms on Google and find solutions in places like Stackoverflow. Pieter is a strong critic of the approach of doing courses as he believes people learn best by doing and building. </p><p>One analogy would be different approaches to learning Spanish. One person might study a course, learn the correct grammar and then go to Spain. Whereas Pieter would go to Spain, ask for the words he needs to use and go from there. </p><p>When asked in the past why he didn't use modern frameworks like React he made the point that as he was a solo founder he couldn't afford to spend time re-building his websites as this would mean his project would stall. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://gum.co/GGofo"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/08/monetize.png" alt="monetize"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-technologies-does-pieter-levels-use">What technologies does Pieter Levels use?</h2><p>Pieter is famous (or infamous) for having a rather eccentric choice of stack by modern standards. It's essentially the easiest, least glamorous tools you could imagine. But that's ok because Pieter makes $600k a year! </p><p>Here is his stack:</p><ul><li>HTML (hand coded so no template to make life easier)</li><li>CSS (He has used pre-processors like LESS and SASS in the past)</li><li>Javascript (No frameworks - this is sometimes referred to jokingly as Vanilla Javascript. There is no such thing as Vanilla JS though. It's just plain-old Javascript without a framework such as React, Vue or Angular) </li><li>jQuery (An unfashionable choice nowadays but it does the job)</li><li>PHP (He doesn't use any frameworks like Laravel)</li><li>SQLite - Pieter says it's super quick and swears by it. SQLite is a database written in a single file so Pieter doesn't need to set up a server for it. &nbsp;</li><li>his sites are hosted on a single VPS running Ubuntu with NGINX.</li></ul><p>Here are some modern options Pieter doesn't use </p><ul><li>React - he jokes a lot about how he never wants to learn it due to it's (perceived) complexity. </li><li>Node - for a time he considered using it but he's never used it in production</li><li>Angular/ Vue - he doesn't use any Javascript frameworks </li><li>SQL/ Postgres - he doesn't use any of the conventional databases </li></ul><h2 id="get-a-job-without-a-cs-degree-">Get a job without a CS degree 👇</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="http://nocsok.com/"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-07-at-17.35.28-2.png" alt="No-CS-OK-screenshot-1"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-results-has-pieter-had-with-this-approach-to-coding">What results has Pieter had with this approach to coding?</h2><p>Despite the technical critics, Pieter has been consistently making six figures since 2014. He currently makes approximately $600,000 a year which is far more than most developers. He has been able to live in countries with a low cost of living so he will likely be able to have financial independence and not need to work relatively soon. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📈 Record sales yesterday of $2,342.04 on <a href="https://t.co/S9Qv34rpbP">https://t.co/S9Qv34rpbP</a> for no apparent reason (maybe companies are spending their EOY HR budgets?).

</figure><h2 id="what-is-pieter-levels-working-on-now">What is Pieter Levels working on now?</h2><p>He just released a new project, <a href="https://remoteworkers.dev/">Remote Workers</a>, where people can post their resumé. He "built in public" - that is to say he gave daily updates of his code on Twitter. This is also a great way for developers to build an audience! You can check out what people are saying about Remote Workers on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/remote-workers">Product Hunt</a>. </p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Pieter is like a bare knuckle boxer so don't compare him to a Judo practioner going to the Olympics. One is going to win no matter what and one is going to follow the rules they have trained under and have finer technique. Neither is better or worse. It depends on the situation. </p><p>Pieter's approach would not be good if you were trying to get a job in a lot of companies. But Pieter isn't looking for a job and the proof for him is in his bank balance. So Pieter's scrappy technique is better suited if you are attracted to coding for entrepreneurship and being a solo founder who doesn't have to share their code with others to work on. He doesn't use Github to save his code, for instance and this is an industry standard that most employers expect. If you want to be an indie hacker/entrepreneur though then Pieter is a fine act to follow. </p><h3 id="if-you-enjoyed-this-article-please-send-it-to-a-friend">If you enjoyed this article please send it to a friend </h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="and-you-should-totally-sign-up-for-the-newsletter">And you should totally <a href="https://nocsdegree.carrd.co/">sign up for the newsletter</a> </h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Back in 2011, I happened to get a job writing <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> app. If you never did that, don’t. I was complaining about difficulties with composition left and right to whoever would listen. As I started digging into alternatives for the front-end, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">FRP</a> and <a href="https://www.flapjax-lang.org/">Flapjax</a>, and <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a>. The last one got me hooked on <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. I even did a <a href="https://fwdays.com/event/js-frameworks-day-2013/review/Functional-Reactive-Programming-&amp;-ClojureScript">successful talk</a> on FRP and ClojureScript (and precursor to <a href="https://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a>, called hlisp).</p>
<h2 id="react">React</h2>
<p>Then in May 2013 React was released. I championed it on my new job and discovered during Clojure-themed hackaton (<a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2013/clojurecup/">Clojure Cup 2013</a>) that CLJS and React are a great match. What’s so good about React though? To me, the main selling point is that it composes well.</p>
<p>When you use predecessors like jQuery or Backbone or Angular or whatever after just a year of development your code is a mess of event listeners and triggers. Don’t get me started on unobtrusive JS, code locality is non-existent with jQuery. Which handler is bound where and what it does? It’s too hard to discover to be a good base for a good codebase!</p>
<p>Then I started working at <a href="https://kasta.ua/">Kasta</a>, where web frontend was exactly that jQuery-ish mess. Nobody ever wanted to touch checkout, since you could spend hours, if not days, making the smallest change. Then QA would find more invalid states than you can dream of. And then users would report more bugs to our call center. It was just as awful as you can imagine.</p>
<p>So after some experiments, tests, and checks, I decided that we’re going React + ClojureScript way with server-side rendering done in Clojure.</p>
<h2 id="demise">Demise</h2>
<p>And for a while, things were looking good. We had this <a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2017/server-side-rendering/">architecture</a> where our components are executed as Clojure on the backend, so no Node.js on the server, hurray! And developer UX is through the roof with the excellent live reload (thanks CLJS), ability to connect from your editor to browser REPL, and experiment there. It is just great!</p>
<p>To make a long story short, our frontend grew bigger and bigger. Incremental compilation started to become slower — it now routinely takes more than a second or two. And while there were few attempts on keeping the whole app performant, ultimately we failed. It’s a death by a thousand cuts. The application became too big and its boot time became too long. Server side rendering helps partially, but then hydration freezes the browser. On the older hardware or Androids it became unacceptable!</p>
<p>One of the main reasonings back in 2016 was that we take a hit on startup time, but in turn, get no page loads and have a rich web application with a lot of interactions. And for a while that worked! But startup time became longer and longer, leading to a shameful rating of 5/100 from Google’s PageSpeed (okay, it was sometimes up to ~25/100, whatever).</p>
<p>More than that, while doing what is described below, we’ve discovered that React also leads to some questionable practices. Like hovers in JS (rather than in CSS), drop-down menus in JS, not rendering hidden (under a hover) text (Google won’t be happy), weird complex logic (since it’s possible!), etc. You can have a React app without those problems, but apparently, you have to have better self-control than we had (nobody’s perfect!).</p>
<p>Also since then, the vast majority of our users switched to mobile apps. This made the web app the main entry point for new users. This means its main goal is rendering fast for a newcomer, because old-timers, which want more functionality, are on mobile app now. And <a href="https://web.dev/tti/">TTI</a> (time to interactive) is so much more important here.</p>
<h2 id="time-for-a-change">Time For A Change</h2>
<p>So given that circumstances have changed, what do we do? I read articles “how I survive on vanilla JS” since before React appeared and they usually don’t make sense — it’s either a pink-glassed rant about how great it is, disregarding all the problems (separation of concerns, cohesion, composability, code locality) or a project by one (or few) persons, who just keep everything in their head.</p>
<p>Somewhere back in February I stumbled upon <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">Intercooler.js</a>. I’m not sure if I ever saw it before — maybe I did but skimmed over — it does not matter. This time it captured my attention.</p>
<p>The idea is that all HTML is rendered on the server. And client updates parts of HTML, controlled by element’s attributes. Basically like HTML+XHR on steroids. You can’t do anything you want, but that’s partially the point: some limits are good so you won’t do crazy stuff. And you need some support from the server, so you can render partial results — just an optimization, but quite an important one.</p>
<p>There is an alternative library — <a href="https://unpoly.com/">Unpoly</a>. It has more features around layout and styling but has a little bit less thought out XHR stuff (hard to do a POST request with parameters without having a form, for example). And the library size is much bigger. And it’s written in CoffeeScript with lots of classes, <a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/inheritance/">ugh</a>.</p>
<p>So I made a proof-of-concept implementation of our catalogue page in Intercooler and it worked! Except there was a dependency on jQuery and some other irritating stuff… As I was struggling to make a batch request for HTML fragments I understood one thing: when I wrote down a roadmap for catalogue the last point was “small intercooler-like thing for analytics”.</p>
<p>So why wait?</p>
<h2 id="twinspark">TwinSpark</h2>
<p>I liked Intercooler’s coherent approach to working around AJAX, so I decided to name the library after some automotive stuff as well, and TwinSpark seems like an appropriate name. So what’s the deal?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kasta-ua/twinspark-js">TwinSpark</a> is a framework for declarative HTML enhancement: you put additional attributes on your element and TwinSpark does something with them. Like makes an AJAX call and replaces target with a response, or adds a class, or… well, see <a href="https://kasta-ua.github.io/twinspark-js/">examples</a>, shall you?</p>
<p>There are some differences with Intercooler, of course, because why would it exist? The most noticeable one is that there is no dependency on jQuery. It supports only modern browsers (not IE or Opera Mini) but drops that 88kb monster.</p>
<p>It also has:</p>
<ul>
<li>no inheritance — can’t stress that enough!</li>
<li>clear extension points for your directives</li>
<li>support for batching requests to a server</li>
<li>tighter attribute name convention (my own opinion, but <code>ic-get</code> and <code>ic-post</code> irritate me: do not make me change keys!)</li>
<li>much smaller payload (thanks to no jQuery!)</li>
<li>should be faster (thanks to no jQuery again)</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly speaking, the main reasons are <a href="https://kasta-ua.github.io/twinspark-js/#batch">batching</a> and <a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/inheritance/">no inheritance</a>. Inheritance is particularly painful here. In Intercooler, if you declared <code>ic-target</code> on the body, all tags inside will think it’s their target too. So you include a component somewhere in HTML tree and an attribute higher on tree changes this component behavior. I mean this is a freaking dynamic scope, I want none of that! :)</p>
<p>Funnily enough, after about a month of dabbling with TwinSpark, Intercooler’s author announced that he’s doing a jQuery-less modern version: <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>. :) It has really good extensions points, so maybe it’s possible to add batching… but inheritance is still there. :-(</p>
<h2 id="why-is-that-a-good-idea">Why is that a good idea</h2>
<p>We need to look at it from two sides: if it’s good for developers and if it’s good for users. React was great at former and terrible at later.</p>
<p>TwinSpark approach is much better in most cases for the user: less JavaScript, less jitter, more common HTML-like behavior. In the worst case, we would serve you 2.5MB of minified (non-gzipped) JS and 700KB of HTML (half of it were initial data for React) for catalogue. JS bundle is not that big because of embedded images or css or some other obscure stuff, it’s big because it’s the whole app, with a lot of views and logic.</p>
<p>Now it’s 40KB of minified non-gzipped JS (TwinSpark, analytics, some behavior, IntersectionObserver polyfill) and 350KB of HTML. Two orders of magnitude difference and even HTML is smaller! This is just like Christmas in childhood!</p>
<p>On the developer side, I think React is better still, but code locality is great, composability is much better (since you are forced in a limited world of working in a simplistic model) than with jQuery. Plus there are a lot of ways to improve it.</p>
<p>The good news is that the development process did not change that much! We’re still writing components that query necessary data from site-wide memory store (and make a call to API when needed), but they are executed only on the server. We effectively piggy-backend on our previous architecture, and this gives us the perfect ability to render “partial” HTML - since components do not wait for some “controller” to give them all necessary data. This is what allowed us to have both React and non-React versions to co-exist and make an A/B test without writing the markup twice.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>It took us four months since the first experiments to release. Not exactly the amount of time I imagined when we started (“should take two to three weeks at most!"), heh, but we were not exclusively doing that. It still took a lot of time and energy to remove React-isms from the code and wrangle our app to be a server-side citizen. It still could use some polishing, but we decided to release it despite that just to cut it short. And A/B test showed that we were right — especially for Android phones.</p>
<p>Google gives our catalogue 75/100 now instead of 5/100. Hurray, I guess? :)</p>

<p><em>This article is part of a </em><a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/"><em>series on managing managers</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>Making the switch to managing managers, and hence managing many teams, can be taxing on the brain. If you’ve not done it before, then you may look at others in more senior roles, potentially running organizations of hundreds of people, and wonder to yourself how they ever find any clock time or mental time for getting anything done.</p>



<p>If you’re used to running one team, that’s a reasonable thought to have. After all, running a team is a tough job. It involves balancing your time between managing others and making your own contributions, working with people outside of your team, deeply understanding the personalities and desires of your staff, and, of course, let’s not forget the most important thing: shipping software.</p>



<p>When viewed through this lens, the thought of having multiple teams may seem quite overwhelming. How are you meant to carry everything in your head that you did before, but at many times the scale? Well, the answer is that you <em>shouldn’t have to</em>. That’s exactly why you have managers reporting to you, which allows you to work at a higher level of abstraction.</p>



<p>Working at this higher level of abstraction allows you to focus your efforts on what’s important; whether that importance manifests in the <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/vp-director-what/">operational running of work streams or strategic planning for the future</a>. It allows you to step back and to focus your energy where it pays the greatest dividends: the outputs of tens, if not hundreds, of people.</p>



<p>Since those that read this website typically have a background in writing software, I’ll lean on a software engineering analogy in order to explain how you use your managers to work at this higher level of abstraction. We’re going to be looking at the interface between yourself and your managers by looking at, erm, <strong>interfaces</strong>. How handy.</p>



<h2>Interfaces</h2>



<p>The programming language that I have the most experience in is Java, so I’m going to lean on it for this particular analogy. An interface in Java, like in other languages, is a type that allows you to define abstract methods that other classes must have if they implement that interface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for example, you may define an interface for a CurseGenerator:</p>



<pre><code>interface CurseGenerator {
  public String curse();
}</code></pre>



<p>Of which we could then implement a British version:</p>



<pre><code>public class BritishCurseGenerator implements CurseGenerator {
  public String curse() {
    return “Oh, bloody hell!”;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>An interface allows extensibility in software systems because a particular piece of code can work with any class that implements a given interface, since the interface’s methods are checked to be present in the implementing class at compilation time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly,&nbsp;the code that works with an interface <em>does not need to know the details of the implementation</em>.<em> </em>The implementing class can do whatever it wants as long as it abides by the contract of the method signatures. The interface <em>delegates </em>the implementation to the implementing class. </p>



<p>Do you see where this is going? I’m sure you do. Back to the management analogy:</p>



<ul><li><strong>As a manager of managers, you define what the interface that represents each of your teams looks like.</strong> For example, you may define particular measurements that are important, such as KPIs like application uptime, daily active users, and so on. You may also require that your managers hold weekly one to ones with each of their staff, write a report on progress to the rest of the company every two weeks, or to fix critical priority bugs in one business day.</li><li><strong>Each of your managers has the flexibility of deciding exactly how those teams are run, as long as they follow the interface contract.</strong> So the way in which they decide to tackle improving the uptime percentage or the number of daily active users is entirely up to them. Which member staff works on which part of the codebase is down to them and the team. How and when they schedule their one-to-ones and the content that they discuss is for them to decide. But fundamentally, they should be done to abide by the contract of the interface.</li></ul>



<p>Clear interfaces allow you to not have to worry about the exact implementation details of how each of your managers run their teams, but they allow you to make it clear <em>exactly what you expect of each of them in doing so, and therefore how you define success</em>. OK, I’ll stop the programming analogy now.</p>



<h2>Defining the interface</h2>



<p>So you start by defining that interface with each of your managers. There’s a neat exercise for your first one-to-one meetings (although you can do it at any time) called <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/contracting/">Contracting, that I’ve written about before</a>. You can expand on that Contracting exercise by having you both think about the answers to the following questions, which make up the interface:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What success looks like for the team.</strong> What measurements are being used to prove that the team is being successful? Is it working towards an outcome, or some KPI, or shipping particular projects on time? Does it also take into account the happiness, productiveness and psychological security of their staff? How will this information be gathered and made accessible to you?</li><li><strong>Which processes will be used to run the team.</strong> In order to be successful, how are they going to compose themselves? Will they use scrum, kanban, just get on with it, or something else? How do they intend to ship to production regularly? How will they prioritize and execute on their work? Each team of yours may operate differently depending on the skills and seniority of the people on each.</li><li><strong>How the manager interfaces with each of their own staff.</strong> They’ll need to think about the different personalities, skills and career development trajectories for each of their staff and consider what that means for how each of them can operate with autonomy, mastery and purpose. What is an acceptable cadence for one-to-ones? Do they prefer synchronous or asynchronous communication?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>How will you know if something is going wrong? </strong>Code throws errors or performs slowly, bringing problems to your attention. How will issues with the team be made visible so you can work on them together?</li><li><strong>Whether you’d occasionally like to inspect the implementation yourself.</strong> Although defining an interface is meant to hide the complexity from you, occasionally it’s interesting to look under the hood and see what’s going on there. You might have some suggestions to make it better, or you may even learn something new. You can arrange a cadence for skip-level meetings, occasionally pop-up in their group meetings to listen, and get feedback from the individuals and the team as a whole.</li></ul>



<p>With a little work up front on the interface, you can make it absolutely clear at what level of involvement you both feel comfortable with having in your relationship. This allows you to abstract away from issues you don’t need to know about as a manager of managers, and gives your direct report the freedom to run the team how they want, as long as the fundamentals that you expect are being implemented. And that’s great, because you can build a great coaching relationship from that foundation, rather than being at risk of micromanaging or firing and forgetting.</p>



<h2>Debugging problems</h2>



<p>Occasionally things will go wrong, as they do in code. You may need to get the debugger out to see what’s going on. But that’s OK, since you’ve already discussed the interface between you, your direct report, and their team. That interface gives you a number of methods to attach your debugger to.</p>



<p>Perhaps if the team’s cadence is slowing down, you can dig deeper into the processes that are being used to run the team. How often are they shipping? If that’s not very often, why is that? How does code get written, reviewed and deployed? You can keep <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/first-principles-and-asking-why/">asking why</a> in order to get to the bottom of quirks that might be bugs. And then you can fix them together.</p>



<p>Sometimes it’s interesting to attach the debugger out of pure curiosity. You can do this in your one-to-ones with your direct report. Focus on one area of your interface and go deep into the implementation by asking questions. You’ll always find something worth discussing, and often there’s some neat performance optimizations to try out.</p>



<h2>Beginning with the end in mind</h2>



<p>So why have interfaces?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ideal end state is that you have clear expectations and boundaries between yourself and the managers that are reporting into you. When you’ve made it clear which high-level functions that each of your managers should be performing, you can delegate the implementation to them so they can do so in whichever way they feel is best for them and their team.</p>



<p>This allows you to move away from details that you don’t need to spend your time focussing on, enabling you to work at a higher level of abstraction. If you were programming, this abstraction would allow you to concentrate on making the system surrounding the interface more efficient, extensible, performant and elegant. That’s exactly what you’ll be wanting to do with the organization, structure and strategic direction of teams as well.</p>

August 24, 2020 | https://herman.bearblog.dev/moonwalking-with-einstein/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://herman.bearblog.dev/moonwalking-with-einstein/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>It's been a while since I've read a book that covers something as novel as the art and science of being able to remember everything. Moonwalking with Einstein was certainly interesting. It follows the author, Josh Foer, on his journey to becoming the top mental athlete in the USA.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, memory championships are fairly obscure events where participants perform seemingly impossible feats of memory like memorizing multiple decks of cards and recalling them perfectly or recalling a page full of binary digits in perfect order.</p>
<p>The feats, while extraordinary, are accomplished using the ancient art of mnemonics; a series of memory techniques that use our innate ability to clearly remember images and places (especially if they are lewd or novel). The data the mnemonist is trying to remember are chunked (broken into smaller pieces) and associated with images and places.</p>
<p>The book runs readers through a few of these techniques (the <a href="https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Major_System">Major System</a>, <a href="https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Person-Action-Object_(PAO)_System">Person-Action-Object</a>, and the <a href="https://artofmemory.com/wiki/How_to_Build_a_Memory_Palace">Memory Palace</a>), which had me memorizing my shopping list and a bunch of books on the nearby shelf. It worked perfectly.</p>
<p>The usefulness of a good memory is discussed at length, and the book points out that modern humans rarely use their memory, rather looking up information than retaining it. Historically the ability to externalize information was a luxury (due to the availability and expense of books and writing material) and most people had to find a way to retain all information in their memory. A few religious groups today still practise the art of memorising their sacred texts.</p>
<p>It also argues that for contextual learning and novel ideation to take place, the person needs to have memorized the knowledge necessary to form those connections. It follows that if, as a species, we abandon memorization, we will have fewer novel ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Memory is like a spiderweb that catches new information. The more it catches, the bigger it grows. And the bigger it grows, the more it catches.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book concludes, however, that while it is useful to have a great memory, what mental athletes do is more akin to a parlour trick and that real-world applications for that level of memorization, bar studying for an exam, are few and far between.</p>
<p>As for how this book impacted me; I have a newfound respect for memory as a whole, and will be practicing keeping information (generally my reading list, which grows daily) in my memory palace. I'm also becomming adept at remembering phone numbers, mostly cause I think it's neat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m convinced that remembering more is only the most obvious benefit of the many months I spent training my memory. What I had really trained my brain to do, as much as to memorize, was to be more mindful, and to pay attention to the world around me. Remembering can only happen if you decide to take notice.”</p>

<p>Besides that, I am a fan of clicky keyboards. I have a <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4C-ultimate/">DasKeyboard 4C ultimate</a> tenkeyless with Cherry Blue switches and a <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4C-tenkeyless-professional/">4C Profressional</a> with brown switches. Sitting at home during the
corona period, made me google old skool stuff a lot.</p>
<p>So first I laid my eyes on a <a href="https://clickykeyboards.com/product/ibm-model-m2-1395300-made-by-ibm-06-30-1993/">IBM Model M2</a> and got this pretty cheap on
the dutch eBay. Getting this to work on my modern laptop was not rocket science, but not straight forward either. I warned my collegues
that the quiet days at the office were over. But this also opened up a window into vintage computers and computing. What if I could get a vintage computer, I thought. How awesome would that be?</p>
<p>How cool would it be to program a vintage computer with my collegues, or my kids. With all the speed we get nowadays, who still thinks about the limits of computing power. This will be totally different if you have just a fraction of the memory and chip available.</p>

<p>I am from 1983. So I was looking for a computer from that year. IBM was <em>the company</em> in those days for personal computing and when it came to makeing PC’s (I am NOT an apple fan). So I found that IBM produced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT"><strong>IBM PC XT</strong></a> in that year. I also found out that you could still get them online for a reasonable price.
Luckliy I was able to lay my hands on one, in a pretty good state. It came with an <a href="https://clickykeyboards.com/product-category/1986-1989-ibm-model-m-silver-label/">IBM Model M</a> keyboard with the silver label (the PC is from 1986). The sound of that is even better than than the <code>Model M2</code>.</p>

<p>After introducing my kids to th <code>DIR</code> command (it was the only one I was pretty sure about it would work), they wanted to type “words” on the old computer (first success).</p>
<h2 id="exiting-vim-is-hard">Exiting Vim is hard?</h2>
<p>So, I know the <code>DIR</code> command. But now what. Let’s see what commands are available.</p>
<ul>
<li>No tab completion. <code>TAB</code> just places the cursor somewhere down the line</li>
<li>No <code>HISTORY</code>. You can repeat the last command by pressing the right-arrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a starters, on <code>IBM DOS</code> (version 5.0) there is no <code>$PATH</code>. The executables are located in <code>C:\DOS</code> (or <code>c:\dos</code>, because <code>DOS</code> don’t care about casing). the most executables are located. After a day or two I figured this out, so I finally managed to open my first <code>BASIC</code> program. All fine, until I wanted to quit the program. It’s not that easy as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor">exiting <code>Vim</code></a>. It took me quite some time googling, until I finally found this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44253055/how-can-i-exit-microsoft-gw-basic-ibm-basica-or-other-similar-old-dialects-of">lifesaver</a>.</p>

<p>So, now I can start a few commands, but getting all available commands is not that straight forward. There is a lot in the <code>DOS</code> directory, but there is no scrolling, and the monitor only is 25 lines.</p>
<p>So figuring out the available commands is using a lot of <code>DIR *.EXE</code>'s and <code>DIR *.COM</code>'s.</p>
<p>First class fun.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>
<p>So far I had to explain to my son what a <code>file(name)</code> and a <code>command</code> is (when they were typing “words” the IBM kept returning</p>
<p>So the experience is already educational :)</p>
<p>To be honest, I do not have a clear idea what I am going to do with it next. I will be playing with it for a while like an 8 year old with his trains.
After the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stayathome"><code>#stayathome</code></a> is over, hopefully I can take it to the office, so we can start doing real cool things with it.</p>
<p>I will definitely have to up my <a href="https://www.qb64.org/wiki/GOTO"><code>GOTO</code></a> skills :)</p>
<p>I will start using my Model M2 for work (sorry collegues), for sure. I will have to remap my function key in <a href="https://i3wm.org/"><code>i3</code></a>, because I am currently using the
windows key for this. But the Model M2 does not have one. But I will overcome.</p>
<p>Besides that, I found this great archive with <a href="ihttps://archive.org/search.php?query=dos%20ibm">manuals</a> and <a href="http://www.retroarchive.org/dos/disks/">bootdisks</a> and even <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/40c2a543-4218-c39a-11c3-a4e284a2c3a5">PC DOS 5.02</a>. Currently I am trying to get a VM up running PC DOS 5.0 (yes, that is possible in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfjUkJMe_kw">virtualbox</a>)</p>
<p>The downside, my Cherry MX blue switches feel like second class now.</p>
<h2 id="update">UPDATE</h2>
<p>When I was installing my VM with <code>PC DOS</code>, at the end of the installation I was aske if I wanted to start in <code>shell</code> mode. It turns out there is a command <code>DOSSHELL</code> (needs to be executed fron <code>C:\DOS</code>) which gives you a very fancy
gui.</p>

It is the first of a pair of posts describing core support for treating ZIP archives as virtual file systems within Tcl. This post focuses on base operations dealing with existing ZIP archives. The next describes the creation of ZIP archives and their use for building <em>zipkits</em> and single file executables.

                    <p>
                        With Tcl 8.6, access to files in ZIP archives was already possible. Tcl itself offered the ability to compress and decompress data with the <code>zlib</code> command. The <code>zipfile</code> module in <code>tcllib</code> then made use of these to permit access to files within an archive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tcl 8.7 goes beyond these capabilities by treating ZIP archives as mountable <em>virtual file systems</em> (VFS). This makes access to the files within the archive much simpler through the standard Tcl channel commands <code>open</code>, <code>gets</code> etc.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Mounting ZIP archives
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The first step to accessing ZIP archives is to mount them as a Tcl VFS. This is done with the <code>zipfs mount</code> command.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs mount mnt demo.zip</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This results in the archive <code>demo.zip</code> being mounted as a VFS under the path <code>zipfs:/mnt</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The root of all ZIP file systems is given by the <code>zipfs root</code> command.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs root
zipfs:/</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This root is platform-specific, <code>zipfs:/</code> on Windows and <code>//zipfs:/</code> on Unix(y) systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Naturally, you can mount multiple archives or even the same archive multiple times. The mount points of course have to be different but one can be nested inside another. For example,
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs mount mnt2 demo.zip
% zipfs mount mnt/nested demo2.zip</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Invoking <code>zipfs mount</code> without any arguments will return the currently mounted ZIP archives as a flat list of mount points and the archive file path.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs mount
zipfs:/mnt demo.zip zipfs:/mnt/nested demo2.zip zipfs:/mnt2 demo.zip</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        ZIP archives may be protected with a password. In that case the password must be supplied as the last argument to the command.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When no longer needed the each VFS should be unmounted with <code>zipfs unmount</code>.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs unmount mnt2
% zipfs unmount mnt/nested

                        Introspecting archives
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Once mounted, the archives can be introspected.

                    <p>
                        The <code>zipfs list</code> command returns a list of the files in the ZIP file system. Optionally, regular expression or glob wildcard patterns may be specified to filter the returned paths.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs list

% zipfs list -regexp {\.txt$}

                    <p>
                        Notice there is no mount point specified above. The command lists all files and directories under the ZIP VFS root. To restrict to a specific archive, specify it as a pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A similar command returns a list of all file paths under a specific directory.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs find zipfs:/mnt/demo/subdir
zipfs:/mnt/demo/subdir/file.txt</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        <strong>TIP:</strong> The <code>zipfs find</code> command will work with any file system, not just ZIP VFS'es.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the ZIP archive is mounted as a Tcl VFS, standard Tcl commands for retrieving generic file information can be used. For example,
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% file size zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt
12
% clock format [file atime zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt]
Sun Aug 23 12:33:24 IST 2020</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The <code>zipfs info</code> command returns additional information that is specific to the ZIP archive format.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs info zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt
demo.zip 12 14 50</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The returned list contains the name of the ZIP archive (as originally passed), the original file size, the compressed file size and the offset of the file's compressed data within the ZIP archive. (As an aside, note in our example that the "compressed" size is greater than the actual size as often happens for small files.)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Data transfer from compressed files in the archive is achieved through the standard Tcl channel I/O commands.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% set chan [open zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt]
zipfs_32_1
% gets $chan
Demo file 
% close $chan</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        You can also open the file for writing. However, the ZIP VFS does not support the append mode.
                    </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="bodyContent"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div><p>This page tells the story of a software design tool for engineers, business analysts, and domain experts, with 3 parts:

</p>


<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>After a year or two of effort I've produced something I believe structurally improves both software development and the developed software. I am, however, neither salesman nor entrepreneur born and have already explored all the options I know for commercializing this work. As no crisis should ever go to waste, job hunting during one of the ...less ideal... times in recent history gives me an opportunity to demonstrate the nature of the tool I've produced. So without further ado, let me introduce acorn.
</p><p>In short, acorn is a design and documentation tool that generates functioning software systems. The central premise of this low-code platform is declarative specification of the language-agnostic elements of a back-end system. Domain-driven design is leveraged to create a common language shared by engineers, business analysts, and domain experts, while acorn avoids the trap of turning business analysts into programmers by ensuring any imperative programming is implemented using industry standard tooling. The core DNA of the tool is maturity by default without the associated lock-in of proprietary hosting or custom programming languages. This section of the wiki both explains and embodies the tool itself, so read on if I've captured your attention. Less detail can be found <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wiki.squirreltechnologies.nz/">here</a>.
</p>
<h3><span id="Background">Background</span></h3>
<p>Right off the bat - let's be clear. I didn't come up through software, though I have fond memories of making games on my graphics calculator in math class in school. Instead, my pedigree starts with mechanical engineering, a segue through biomedical engineering for a Ph.D, and finally analysis/data science to round out my little path-less-travelled. The common thread? Using my rudimentary mathematical skills to understand and influence the world around me. The fundamental issue at hand? You <b>need</b> software to make that happen.
</p><p>Either software systems produce the data you rely on, or software systems are required to implement the outcomes. Both, as it happens, is the more likely scenario, and I rapidly found myself frustrated with the state of the software world. When presented with a new and complex domain, I want to understand:
</p>
<ul><li>What data exists within the system, and what it means</li>
<li>How you can interact with that data</li>
<li>The pedigree of that data, and how it has evolved over time</li></ul>
<p>In practice, that means attempting to digest 15 years of messy development of an organically grown system. Reading code, spelunking outdated wikis, interpreting artistic architectural diagrams that boil down to a single individual's mental model, and generally hoping that the assumptions you make are safe enough for you to rely on your own analysis. The final straw was how fraught it was to actually evolve these bespoke organic systems.
</p><p>I tried to learn the professional lessons of the engineers around me that I respected, and so my journey towards acorn began.
</p>
<h2><span id="Key_concepts">Key concepts</span></h2>
<p>Before I continue on, there a few concepts that set the scene. First, acorn sees three important archetypes relevant to the development of software:
</p>
<ol><li>Experts: Knowledgeable about the domain, perhaps non-technical</li>
<li>Engineers: The ones who make it happen, perhaps despite not knowing what <i>it</i> is to begin with</li>
<li>E... Users: Anybody who relies on the resulting system, from non-technical users to external engineers</li></ol>
<p>You management types keep the world from descending into chaos&nbsp;:) but these three groups need to communicate clearly for the process to be successful. As good fences make good neighbours there are three levels of formality of data access required by these groups:
</p>
<ol><li>External: Highly formal contracts that have consequences when they change because external parties rely on them [Users, Experts, Engineers]</li>
<li>Internal: Formal, but manageable boundaries that different sections of your organization build upon [Experts, Engineers]</li>
<li>Private: Flexible boundaries enforced by a team on themselves purely for data consistency and ergonomic reasons [Engineers]</li></ol>
<p>Why do these two concepts matter? Because acorn is a tool that enables those three archetypes to collaborate, and to build software that requires no extra effort to maintain the different formality levels required for safe, productive development work. Keep these concepts in mind as a lens through which to understand the meta tool that follows.
</p>
<h2><span id="Terminology">Terminology</span></h2>
<p>My non-traditional route makes for non-traditional nomenclature, so this section should help explain what I mean by the terms I use for acorn's meta model of a software system.
</p>
<h3><span id="General_terms">General terms</span></h3>
<dl><dt>library</dt>
<dd>A software system that has been designed to be embedded in other systems, as opposed to run as a stand-alone entity</dd>
<dt>module</dt>
<dd>What you get when you wrap enough extra detail around a library such that it can be deployed</dd>
<dt>project</dt>
<dd>The design for a library/module along with its documentation and implementation</dd>
<dt>realm</dt>
<dd>Individual components within a project</dd></dl>
<p>Thus acorn is a tool that allows you create software projects while writing perhaps 20% of the normally required lines of back-end code. These projects are standardized to allow them to be embedded (for libraries) or connected (modules) in a modular fashion. This connection could be realized as either a microservice, monolithic, or function-as-a-service deployment model. These projects themselves consist of realms, where each realm is a bounded context in domain-driven design terminology, and could be individually owned by different teams if such scale is called for.
</p>
<h3><span id="Data-specific_terms">Data-specific terms</span></h3>
<dl><dt>primitive</dt>
<dd>The basic form of data within a system, everything from raw binary information to free text or dates</dd>
<dt>data type</dt>
<dd>An envelope of data containing perhaps many fields containing either primitives or other data types</dd>
<dt>event</dt>
<dd>A meaningful occurrence within the system, represented as a data type that is published under specific conditions</dd>
<dt>subscription</dt>
<dd>An asynchronous process that listens for specific events and allows a system to respond to changes</dd>
<dt>regular expression</dt>
<dd>a custom primitive with a specified pattern</dd>
<dt>lookup</dt>
<dd>a custom primitive that can take on a specific set of values that are defined at runtime</dd></dl>
<p>Thus acorn is a tool for creating data-intensive applications, where an application can be seen as a graph of primitive data fields described within data types. Editing this graph produces events at differing levels of granularity, which can be leveraged to perform meaningful responses to business-relevant changes. Oh, and realms containing data are effectively mutually exclusive sections of this graph.
</p>
<h3><span id="Domain-specific_terms">Domain-specific terms</span></h3>
<p>A domain is the foundational realm within a system. It contains data, and provides an <b>internal</b> boundary for manipulating that data. There are a number of specialized concepts within a domain, and the details of the internal boundary are intended to permit standardized, flexible data access where performant, and controlled access when potentially non-performant.
</p>
<dl><dt>Aggregate root</dt>
<dd>A data type that is persisted, has a defined lifecycle, and is queriable</dd>
<dt>Entity</dt>
<dd>A named sub-graph within an aggregate root that has additional lifecycle</dd>
<dt>Command</dt>
<dd>A mutation operation that has side-effects and produces an event</dd>
<dt>Query</dt>
<dd>A read-only aggregation or transformation of data within the domain</dd></dl>
<p>Thus projects created within acorn store data in domains, where command/query responsibility segregation is utilized to provide a set of meaningful interactions with this information. The underlying principle behind acorn is that the internal boundary formed by these domains is necessary and sufficient for rapid development, exploratory analysis, and eventual extension.
</p>
<h3><span id="Portal-specific_terms">Portal-specific terms</span></h3>
<p>A portal is a realm that forms an <b>external</b> boundary for the system. Analogous to an application service in domain-driven design, portals handle inter-domain co-ordination that goes beyond pure asynchronous event subscription. Portals contain a number of specialized concepts to create a intelligible view over the use-cases of a system.
</p>
<dl><dt>Context</dt>
<dd>An externally facing set of nodes on the formal boundary of the system that share a common definition and may be associated with other contexts</dd>
<dt>View</dt>
<dd>A simple query that may belong to a context</dd>
<dt>Action</dt>
<dd>A formal mutation operation, perhaps belonging to a context, that may return enough information to navigate to a new/existing context</dd>
<dt>Navigation</dt>
<dd>Information on how to reach different contexts from the data returned by a read operation</dd>
<dt>Component</dt>
<dd>An embeddable javascript widget that supports interactions too complex for a form-based interface</dd></dl>
<p>Thus portals, while stateless, contain all the information required to make the internal boundaries of a system both legible and safe to use for external users/downstream systems. The degenerate form of a portal is simply a layer over a domain that calls aggregate roots "contexts", commands "actions", and queries "views". In other words, a typical CRUD layer over a SQL database.
</p>
<h3><span id="Engine-specific_terms">Engine-specific terms</span></h3>
<p>Domains support asynchronous processing, and portals form the boundary that initiates this processing. An engine is a realm that can co-ordinate asynchronous processing and solicit user input when required. Engines contain a number of specialized concepts to define state machines for these processes and thus simplify development of the inevitable BPMN-style flow charting and saga creation.
</p>
<dl><dt>User input</dt>
<dd>A request for additional input, represented by an action in a portal if the request cannot be automatically fulfilled</dd>
<dt>Subprocess</dt>
<dd>A logical set of background processing, starting with a command and terminating in an event after perhaps many subscriptions</dd>
<dt>Process</dt>
<dd>A…</dd></dl></div></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\top}A = AA^{\top} = I
\end{align}\]

</p><p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\det(I) &amp;= \det(A^{\top}A) \\
&amp;= \det(AA^{\top}) \\
&amp;= \det(A) \det(A^{\top}) \\
&amp;= \det(A) \det(A) \\
&amp;= \det(A)^2 \\
&amp;= \det(A^{\top})^2 \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\top}A A^{-1} &amp;= I A^{-1}\\
A^{\top} I &amp;= A^{-1} \\
A^{\top} &amp;= A^{-1} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\dagger}A = AA^{\dagger} = I
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\overline{Av} &amp;= \overline{\lambda v} \\
&amp;= \overline{A} \overline{v} \\
&amp;= A \overline{v} \\
&amp;= \overline{\lambda} \overline{v} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
v^{\dagger} A v &amp;= \lambda v^{\dagger} v \\
&amp;= v^{\dagger} A^{\top} v \\
&amp;= \overline{v}^{\top} A^{\top} v \\
&amp;= (A\overline{v})^{\top} v \\
&amp;= (\overline{\lambda} \overline{v})^{\top} v \\
&amp;= \overline{\lambda}^{\top} \overline{v}^{\top} v \\
&amp;= \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x^{\dagger} A x &amp;= x^{\dagger} \lambda x \\
&amp;= \lambda x^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;\geq 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p><p>

\[x^{\dagger} (A^{\dagger} A) x = (Ax)^{\dagger} Ax\]

</p><p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x^{\dagger} (A^{\dagger} A) x \geq 0
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p><p>

\[A_{m \times n} = U_{m\times m} \Sigma_{m \times n} V_{n \times n}^{\dagger}\]

</p><p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\dagger} A &amp;= (U \Sigma V^{\dagger})^{\dagger} U \Sigma V^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} U^{\dagger}  U \Sigma V^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} I \Sigma V^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma V^{\dagger}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\dagger} A V &amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma V^{\dagger} V \\
&amp;=  V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma I \\
&amp;=  V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma \\
&amp;= \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma V \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A A^{\dagger} U &amp;= \Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger} U \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|x_i| \cos \theta &amp;= \frac{\langle x_i, w \rangle}{|w|} \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, w \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w |^2 &amp;= \langle x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w, x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - \langle x_i, \langle x_i, w \rangle w \rangle - \langle \langle x_i, w \rangle w, x_i \rangle + \langle \langle x_i, w \rangle w, \langle x_i, w \rangle w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - \langle x_i, w \rangle \langle x_i, w \rangle - \langle x_i, w \rangle \langle w, x_i \rangle + \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \langle w,  w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - 2 \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 + \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 |w| ^2 \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - 2 \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 + \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle -  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{MSE}(w) &amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} | x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w |^2 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \big( \langle x_i, x_i \rangle -  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \big)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, …</p></div></div>

<p>Microsoft’s statement was shared by the head of Xbox Phil Spencer. It’s not about Epic’s original requirements, but about requests from the creators of Unreal Engine to keep them accessing developer accounts on the Apple platform.</p>




<blockquote><p>We filed an application today in support of Epic Games’ request to keep its access to Apple’s Unreal Engine toolbox. Keeping Epic’s access to the latest Apple technology will be the right choice for developers and gamers.</p><p><br> Phil Spencer<br> head Xbox</p></blockquote>



<p>In its document, the company says that the Unreal Engine is a critical engine for many developers around the world, including Microsoft itself, many of whose games for Xbox and PC are created on it.</p>



<p>Microsoft also noted that while large studios can afford to develop their own game engines, smaller teams are much more profitable to use off-the-shelf technologies like the Unreal Engine.</p>



<blockquote><p>Many indie developers don’t have the resources or ability to write their own engine. They rely entirely on third-party technologies.</p><p><br>from Microsoft statement</p></blockquote>



<p>The Epic vs. Apple standoff began on August 13 over Fortnite. The game developers added their in-game currency payment system to the applications, bypassing Apple’s service fee, after which the second removed the online action from the mobile store. Epic has filed a lawsuit against Apple, believing that the company maintains a monopoly by cutting off any competition.</p>



<p>Once submitted Apple <a href="http://nintendosmash.com/apple-has-threatened-epic-games-with-deleting-its-app-store-accounts-this-will-prevent-all-ios-apps-running-on-unreal-engine/">lawsuit</a> said of Epic, which will remove it from your system developer account August 28, depriving them of their ability to support the applications on iOS and Mac and to produce new ones.</p>



<p>This may mean that the Unreal Engine, in principle, will no longer be supported by Apple systems, and games on this engine will not be able to be released on iOS. As Epic itself says, not only they will suffer, but also many other developers who work with its engine.</p>



<p>At the same time, Microsoft has its own conflict with Apple, since it previously refused to launch iCloud on iOS. Apple explained this by the fact that such services allow you to run applications that it has not tested.</p>



<p>As for the proceedings with Epic Games, Apple said that before the conflict began, Tim Sweeney tried to achieve special conditions for his company, also mentioning that he would like the same for other companies.</p>

When surveyed again in May, during the pandemic which forced schools to shut and placed unprecedented restrictions on people’s lives, the figures dropped by nearly 10 per cent among girls to less than half (45 per cent) and to less than one in five of boys (18 per cent).</p><p>“With the whole world in the grip of a devastating pandemic, which has thrown everyone’s lives into turmoil, the natural expectation would be to see an increase in anxiety said lead author Emily Widnall, Senior Research Associate in Population Health Sciences at the University of Bristol’s Medical School.</p><p>"While we saw anxiety levels rise for a few of our participants, it was a big surprise to discover quite the opposite was the case for many of them. Of particular interest, those students who felt least connected to school before the lockdown saw a larger decrease in anxiety which raises questions about how the school environment affects some younger teenagers’ mental well-being.”</p><p>Depression levels remained fairly consistent over time, with a 2 per cent decrease of boys at risk of depression and a 3 per cent increase in girls at risk of depression.</p><p>“This was again unexpected and arguably shows the resilience of young people and their ability to adapt to challenging situations,” Widnall said.</p><p>“Amidst other headlines highlighting concerns about young people’s mental health being negatively affected, this is in one sense very welcome news, but at the same time it raises interesting questions about what the key drivers and triggers of anxiety or depression are for this particular age group.”</p><p>Many students’ sense of well-being also improved during lockdown, with boys showing a bigger improvement than girls. Those with the lowest levels of well-being pre-pandemic benefited most, with their scores increasing by 14 per cent compared to no increase in those with average to above average well-being.</p><p>“The survey gives a unique insight into how many younger teenagers feel without the day-to-day pressures of school life, for example academic achievement and challenging peer relationships, in their lives,” Widnall said.</p><p>Despite not attending, boys and girls both reported stronger connectedness to school during lockdown, with marked increases in the number of students who said they get the opportunity to talk with their teachers.</p><p>“This was another surprise finding. You would imagine being away from school would logically make you feel more distant and less connected. It will be interesting for further research to explore the reasons why young people reported feeling more connected to school, but one possible explanation could be the new ways that teachers found to engage with students via digital platforms, which of course young people are already very familiar with,” Widnall said.</p><p>Survey results showed reduced anxiety and improved well-being coincided with significantly greater usage of social media among girls. The biggest increase was seen during the week, when more than half of girls (55 per cent) reported spending in excess of three hours daily on social media during lockdown.</p><p>“This challenges the common perception that social media has a detrimental impact on young people’s mental health. The statistics for girls within this survey suggest these channels may play an important role in helping teenagers bond, feel more connected and in touch, especially during a period of physical isolation,” Widnall said.</p><p>“Respondents, especially girls, also reported using social media as a tool for learning, rather than just browsing or chatting amongst friends.”</p><p>The survey involved more than 1,000 year nine students from 17 secondary schools across the South West. Based on its findings, the report makes policy recommendations including prioritisation of student’s mental health and wellbeing alongside catch up on academic work and considering ways to prevent a rise in anxiety back to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>Dr Judi Kidger, senior author and Lecturer in Public Health at the University of Bristol, said: “Our findings raise questions about the role of the school environment in explaining rises in mental health difficulties among teenagers in recent years. As schools re-open, we need to consider ways in which schools can be more supportive of mental health for all students.</p><p>"With children and young people having been out of the classroom for so long, and with many students in this study seeing improvements in mental health and well-being during that time, the case to address issues weighing on their quality of life at school is stronger than ever.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurekalert.org%2Fpub_releases%2F2020-08%2Fuob-rry082120.php&amp;t=ZmMxMTlhYjkzOTc5Y2E3MGIwOWNlMzM1ZDMzOTM1MTE0MWM1NWJlMSwyb1RJU01saQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627296328752447488%2Fteenage-anxiety-covid-19-lockdown&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598444806">University of Bristol</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/620827694184185856/lock-down-sleep-quality">Sleep during COVID-19 lockdown: Longer and more regular, yet worse</a></p><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/615500611887235072/social-distancing-2022">New study: Social distancing could be needed until 2022</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A refinement of O'Neill's colonies.</p><div>

<!-- BEGIN CONTENT -->
<p><a href="https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/70sArtHiRes/70sArt/art.html"><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/Spacecolony1.jpg" alt="[A pair of O'Neill cylinders. https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/70sArtHiRes/70sArt/art.html Interior view looking out through large windows. Art work: Rick Guidice.  NASA ID Number AC75-1086]" width="1920" height="1512"></a></p>
<p>Start with the idea of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder">O'Neill cylinder</a>: a spinning cylindrical space habitat 8 km in diameter and 32 km long.  The frequency of revolution is about two minutes.  This is a good diameter for a space habitat: if it is an order of magnitude larger, the structure won't hold together when it spins; an order of magnitude smaller, the Coriolis force is more noticeable.</p>
<p>The giant windows are a huge hazard for both radiation and meteor impacts.  Instead, make the cylinder a solid steel vessel, thick enough to block most radiation.  Make it out of many layers of steel sheeting, with a thick layer of ablative insulation on the outside that can absorb and redirect the kinetic energy of a meteor impact.  Construct it as several independent 8 km long segments, each with its own shielded endcaps, all sharing a common axis.  Each hab segment has airlocks at the axis, leading to rotating joints that connect the segment to two small non-rotating modules at the axis, where there are ports for visiting spacecraft to dock.  This is also where arrays of directional communication antennas are located.</p>
<p>At one end of the axis, there is a massive array of solar panels (not rotating with the hab), at the other, there is an array of radiators.  If the hab is too far from a star for solar power, a nuclear power plant is located outside of the hab, along the axis, in its own shielded module, as far away as needed to minimize radiation hazards to humans entering and exiting the habitat at the docking port module.</p>
<p>The ecology and economy of the hab is 99.9% closed - with energy as an input and heat as an output.  Occasionally, robots are sent out to mine asteroids or comets for material to replace material losses.  I expect that the solar power and radiator arrays will need constant maintenance and replacement to keep working at 100% capacity.  All of the habs in a star system exchange information, allowing the occupants of the habs to share and trade art, science, and culture.</p>
<p>The inside of the hab segment is either completely open or is segmented into many smaller "cells" big enough to feel open but small enough to give the human population more room.  A cell might have a ceiling 100 meters tall that looks like Earth's sky and provides similar light.  Some of the interior volume is taken up by light industry and vertical-farm-based agriculture.</p>
<p>This design is meant to be very robust and adaptable.  It doesn't matter if the hab is located in orbit around a red dwarf or a blue giant, as long as the solar panels work.  The hab can be sent on a thousand-year interstellar voyage as long as enough spare energy and material is taken along.  The occupants of the hab can remotely supervise robots to build new habs.</p>
<p>This is the future for humanity if we don't become post-human.  There aren't any planets out there that we can walk around in shirtsleeves on.  Terraforming projects would take many thousands of years at best, and might fall afoul of the law of unintended consequences.  Even Mars, one of the best possible places for humans to live outside of Earth, might not have enough gravity for standard humans to thrive.</p>
<p>I'm not saying rocky planets and moons aren't useful.  After all, that's where a lot of the useable material is.  But if you need that material, why not supervise robot miners from orbit?  Especially if the planet has a surface gravity of 1.5g or a surface temperature of 700 K.</p>

                <h2><a name="game-environment"></a>Game environment</h2>
<p>This is a wrapper for OpenAI gym game environment.
We do a few things here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply the same action on four frames</li>
<li>Convert observation frames to gray and scale it to (84, 84)</li>
<li>Take the maximum of last two of those four frames</li>
<li>Collect four such frames for last three actions</li>
<li>Add episode information (total reward for the entire episode) for monitoring</li>
<li>Restrict an episode to a single life (game has 5 lives, we reset after every single life)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Observation format</h4>
<p>Observation is tensor of size (84, 84, 4). It is four frames
(images of the game screen) stacked on last axis.
i.e, each channel is a frame.</p>
<pre><code>Frames    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15

  <h2>2020-02-26</h2>

<p>I used to spend all of my free time programming random toy projects. Over time, likely after spending a few years in industry, I started to spend so much time thinking about how to write maintainable code that I think I started to lose out on what makes programming fun: exploring new ideas and learning how to do things I’ve never done before. I’d like to rediscover that joy, and to do that, I need to stop being so much of a perfectionist.</p>
<p>I think that in an office setting, deadlines force me to move on and call things done, but in my personal life, lack of that kind of pressure means that I can spend literally forever architecting and rearchitecting the same piece of code until it’s perfect (it never is).</p>
<p>To fix this, I’m going to try blogging! If I can make myself excited to share my code with other people, imperfect and unfinished as it is, then maybe I can start to unlearn the paralysis that’s been plaguing me for the past few years.</p>
<p>To start, I just want to walk through a small program I wrote a few months ago. I wanted to learn how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol">SSDP</a> works, so I implemented an SSDP Directory! For those of you who aren’t aware, SSDP is a fairly simple protocol from the 90s that’s used to facilitate the discovery of network services. Nowadays, it’s also used by everything from smart TVs to Hue lights.</p>
<p>My implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory">here</a>, and the (very readable!) RFC is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cai-ssdp-v1-03">here</a>.</p>
<p>If I run the application, it discovers all of the devices on my network:</p>
<pre><code>iex(1)&gt; SSDPDirectory.list_services
%{
  "uuid:b236f169-9c9d-db64-ffff-ffffcff91970::upnp:rootdevice" =&gt; %SSDPDirectory.Service{
    location: "http://192.168.0.150:60000/upnp/dev/b236f169-9c9d-db64-ffff-ffffcff91970/desc",
    type: "upnp:rootdevice",
    usn: "uuid:b236f169-9c9d-db64-ffff-ffffcff91970::upnp:rootdevice"
  },
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The key to SSDP is what’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast">multicast addressing</a>. Essentially, services broadcast their presence to a specially designated multicast address, and then anyone else on the network is able to listen for those presence notifications in order to track the appearance and disappearance of new services.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Elixir, my language of choice, makes subscribing to these notifications <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/multicast_channel.ex">easy</a>!</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.MulticastChannel do
  use GenServer

  alias __MODULE__

  alias SSDPDirectory.{
    Discovery,
    Presence
  }

  @multicast_group {239, 255, 255, 250}
  @multicast_port 1900

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, opts)
  end

  @spec broadcast(GenServer.name(), iodata) :: :ok
  def broadcast(channel \\ MulticastChannel, packet) do
    GenServer.cast(channel, {:broadcast, packet})
  end

  @spec init(:ok) :: {:ok, %{socket: port}}
  def init(:ok) do
    udp_options = [
      :binary,
      active: true,
      add_membership: {@multicast_group, {0, 0, 0, 0}},
      multicast_if: {0, 0, 0, 0},
      multicast_loop: false,
      reuseaddr: true
    ]

    {:ok, socket} = :gen_udp.open(@multicast_port, udp_options)

    {:ok, %{socket: socket}}
  end

  def handle_cast({:broadcast, packet}, state) do
    :ok = :gen_udp.send(state.socket, @multicast_group, @multicast_port, packet)

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:udp, _socket, _ip, _port, data}, state) do
    Task.Supervisor.start_child(SSDPDirectory.DecodingSupervisor, fn -&gt;
      with {:ok, packet, rest} &lt;- :erlang.decode_packet(:http_bin, data, []),
           {:ok, handler} &lt;- packet_handler(packet),
           {:ok, decoded} &lt;- handler.decode(rest) do
        :ok = handler.handle(decoded)
      end
    end)

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  defp packet_handler({:http_request, "NOTIFY", _target, _version}),
    do: {:ok, Presence}

  defp packet_handler({:http_response, _version, 200, "OK"}),
    do: {:ok, Discovery.Response}

  defp packet_handler(_packet), do: :error
end</code></pre>
<p>Most of the magic happens in the <code>init/1</code> function. By opening a UDP socket and joining it to the protocol’s multicast group, our process is now able to receive packets that are broadcast to that group. That receiving logic is located in the <code>handle_info/2</code> function within the same file.</p>
<p>When receiving a packet, we spawn another process that is responsible for handling that packet. This process runs under a <code>Task.Supervisor</code> in order to isolate crashes of that process from the <code>MulticastChannel</code>. Also interesting, is that we’re able to decode the incoming packets using <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#decode_packet-3">:erlang.decode_packet/3</a>. This is a builtin function that allows us to decode a variety of packet formats, piece-by-piece. In this case, we’re using it to parse the packet as an HTTP packet. This is the same way that Elixir’s <a href="https://github.com/elixir-mint/mint/blob/master/lib/mint/http1/response.ex#L7">Mint</a> decodes HTTP responses too!</p>
<p>Based on the type of packet decoded, <code>packet_handler/1</code> then delegates the handling of that packet to another module. Either we’ve received an HTTP NOTIFY request, and we’re dealing with a <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/presence.ex">presence notification</a>, or we’ve received a <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/discovery/response.ex">response to a discovery request</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the presence case. In case you’re curious, here’s an example presence notification:</p>
<pre><code>NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1
Host: 239.255.255.250:reservedSSDPport
NT: blenderassociation:blender
NTS: ssdp:alive
USN: someunique:idscheme3
AL: &lt;blender:ixl&gt;&lt;http://foo/bar&gt;
Cache-Control: max-age = 7393</code></pre>
<p>And here’s where we handle it:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.Presence do
  require Logger

  alias __MODULE__
  alias SSDPDirectory.HTTP

  @type command :: Presence.Alive.t() | Presence.ByeBye.t()

  @spec decode(binary) ::
          :error
          | {:ok, command}
  def decode(data) do
    case HTTP.decode_headers(data, []) do
      {:ok, headers, _rest} -&gt;
        process_headers(headers)

      :error -&gt;
        _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Failed to decode NOTIFY request: " &lt;&gt; inspect(data) end)

        :error
    end
  end

  @spec handle(command) :: :ok
  def handle(%Presence.Alive{} = command) do
    Presence.Alive.handle(command)
  end

  def handle(%Presence.ByeBye{} = command) do
    Presence.ByeBye.handle(command)
  end

  defp process_headers(headers) do
    do_process_headers(headers, %{})
  end

  defp do_process_headers([], args) do
    case args do
      %{command: "ssdp:alive", usn: usn, type: type}
      when not is_nil(usn) and not is_nil(type) -&gt;
        {:ok,
         %Presence.Alive{
           usn: usn,
           type: type,
           location: Map.get(args, :location)
         }}

      %{command: "ssdp:byebye", usn: usn, type: type}
      when not is_nil(usn) and not is_nil(type) -&gt;
        {:ok,
         %Presence.ByeBye{
           usn: usn,
           type: type
         }}

      _ -&gt;
        :error
    end
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"nts", command} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :command, command)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"nt", type} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :type, type)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"usn", usn} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :usn, usn)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"al", location} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :location, location)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"location", location} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :location, location)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([_ | rest], args) do
    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>It looks like there’s a lot going on here, but it’s actually pretty simple. Starting in <code>decode/1</code>, we continue decoding the packet from <code>MulticastChannel</code>. This time it’s the headers we’re interested in, so we decode those, and then process them in order to determine what kind of command we’re dealing with.</p>
<p>The processing step simply involves recursing over the list of headers, and accumulating the relevant ones in a map . Once we’ve done that, we just construct the corresponding command!</p>
<p>Lastly, the command handler delegates to a third module based on the type of command being processed. For example, in the case of an <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/presence/alive.ex">ssdp:alive</a> command:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.Presence.Alive do
  require Logger

  alias __MODULE__

  alias SSDPDirectory.{
    Cache,
    Service
  }

  @enforce_keys [:usn, :type]
  defstruct [:location] ++ @enforce_keys

  @type t :: %Alive{}

  @spec handle(Alive.t()) :: :ok
  def handle(%Alive{} = command) do
    _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Handling ssdp:alive request: " &lt;&gt; inspect(command) end)

    service = %Service{
      usn: command.usn,
      type: command.type,
      location: command.location
    }

    :ok = Cache.insert(service)
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>Here we just construct a service using the parameters in the command, and then store it in our <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/cache.ex">cache</a>:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.Cache do
  use GenServer

  require Logger

  alias __MODULE__
  alias SSDPDirectory.Service

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.start_link(Cache, :ok, opts)
  end

  def contents(cache \\ Cache) do
    :ets.tab2list(cache)
    |&gt; Enum.into(%{})
  end

  def insert(cache \\ Cache, %Service{} = service) do
    GenServer.call(cache, {:insert, service})
  end

  def delete(cache \\ Cache, %Service{} = service) do
    GenServer.call(cache, {:delete, service})
  end

  def flush(cache \\ Cache) do
    GenServer.call(cache, :flush)
  end

  def init(:ok) do
    table = :ets.new(Cache, [:named_table, read_concurrency: true])

    {:ok, %{table: table}}
  end

  def handle_call({:insert, %Service{usn: usn} = service}, _from, data) when not is_nil(usn) do
    :ets.insert(data.table, {usn, service})

    _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Cached service: " &lt;&gt; inspect(usn) end)

    {:reply, :ok, data}
  end

  def handle_call({:delete, %Service{usn: usn}}, _from, data) when not is_nil(usn) do
    :ets.delete(data.table, usn)

    _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Evicted service: " &lt;&gt; inspect(usn) end)

    {:reply, :ok, data}
  end

  def handle_call(:flush, _from, data) do
    :ets.delete_all_objects(data.table)

    _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; …</code></pre></section></div>

                <p>by Richard Murphey</p>
                <p>
                <img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/tom_perkins_on_bob_swanson.png"></p><p>There is no shortage of online content about how to start a tech company, but there is comparatively little on how to start a biotech startup.  I recently came across an amazing set of interviews with the founders of Genentech that is the one of the best resources I've seen on biotech entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p>In this post, I'll highlight 16 key quotes from early Genentech leaders and comment on how they can be applied to biotech startups today.</p>
                <p>The interviews that these quotes came from were originally conducted as source material for Sally Smith Hughes' book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00629MDKI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech</a>.  This book is a must-read for anyone looking to learn about the industry (it's a quick and engaging read as well -- I finished it in a day).  The interview transcripts are worth reading in their entirety (especially the <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt9c6006s1&amp;query=&amp;brand=oac4">Bob Swanson</a> and <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt467nb7wh&amp;query=&amp;brand=oac4">Dave Goeddel</a> interviews) and are available for free online through <a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/biosci/oh_list.html">Berkeley's Bancroft Library Oral History Center</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Early Genentech at a glance</h3>
                
                <p>To set the stage, here is a chart with major value inflection points during the early days of the company.  At this time, Bob Swanson, the founding CEO, was in his late 20s / early 30s, and most of Genentech's scientists, led by Dave Goeddel, were also in their 20s and 30s.  Bob's co-founder, UCSF professor Herb Boyer, was more experienced, but he took a fairly hands-off approach to the science.  Prior to starting Genentech, Bob had been laid off by venture fund Kleiner Perkins.</p>
                <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/genentech_vc_valuation.png"></p><p>Genentech was created to use emerging genetic engineering technology to create new medicines.  When the company was founded, genetic engineering was a new and relatively unknown field.  The leading scientists in the area thought it would be years or decades before genetic engineering was advanced enough to create medicines.  Big pharma companies were universally dismissive of the technology.</p>
                <p>The venture capital and startup industry was also in its infancy.  There was no such thing as a biotech startup, and there hadn't been a new pharma company created in decades.  Kleiner Perkins, one of the first venture capital funds, had just started (Bob was an early employee of the fund).  Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, less than a week before Genentech was founded.</p>
                <p>(As a side note, Apple and Genentech have always been somewhat linked.  Steve Jobs and Bob Swanson were the original young tech entrepreneurs.  When Genentech went public in 1980, it was the biggest tech IPO ever -- until Apple went public months later.  Art Levinson, who took over as Apple's chairman after Steve Jobs passed away and was on Google's board from 2004-2009, was an early employee at Genentech and was Genentech's CEO in the 1990s and 2000s).</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Overview of early Genentech's strategy</h4>
                
                <p>Genentech's strategy was to first prove that the technology could work -- that bacteria or yeast could be engineered to make human proteins -- and then to use genetic engineering to make products.  They proved the concept by getting bacteria to produce somatostatin, a small hormone.  Somatostatin wasn't useful as a medicine, but it was a relatively simple molecule to make with their tech and thus a good proof-of-concept.</p>
                <p>Genentech's first major product was recombinant insulin.  At the time, insulin was obtained by killing pigs or cows and extracting it from their tissues.  This was an expensive and potentially less safe approach than producing human insulin from bacteria or yeast.  Cloning insulin put Genentech on the scientific and financial map and kickstarted the biotech industry.</p>
                <p>With that context in hand, here's how Genentech approached building a biotech startup:</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Create value by eliminating risk</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>Bill Hambrecht…has said the only common characteristic he has noticed in the successful entrepreneurs he's invested in has been that they're all basically conservative…they're willing to go for it, but everyone is looking at how you minimize the risks as you're doing so.</p>
                    <p>- Bob Swanson</p>
                </div>
                <p>In most industries, companies create value by growing revenue or profits.  In biotherapeutics, companies cannot sell products until FDA approves them, which can take years.  But pre-revenue drugs can still be immensely valuable.  In development-stage drug companies, value is created by eliminating technical risk.</p>
                <p>Like many other entrepreneurs, Bob had a unique attitude toward risk: part risk-averse, part risk-seeking.  In the <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/josh">words of Josh Wolfe</a>, co-founder of Lux Capital, "entrepreneurs aren't risk takers.  They're risk killers".</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Build a "staircase of value"</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>I tried to organize things so that once you had success and created value in the company, then you raised the next round of money for the next success that would create greater value…. So it's sort of building a staircase…to the point where your cash flow is positive from product sales.</p>
                    <p>- Bob Swanson</p>
                </div>
                <p>Bob's goal from the beginning was to build a fully integrated pharma company -- one that developed and sold its own products.  He broke this goal into small units of value creation, and raised a new round of capital to fund each unit.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>"Make something people want"</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>This is the essence of a company. The better you understand customers' needs…the more value the product has that they're willing to buy. Then you make more money, and the more money you make, the more it says, "I'm doing things right. I'm a healthy company.”</p>
                    <p>- Bob Swanson</p>
                </div>
                <p>Bob understood that the success of the company depended on its ability to create value for customers.  In the words of Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html">"make something people want"</a>.</p>
                <p>This holds true in biotech today.  Understanding a patient's condition, the available treatment options, and unmet clinical needs is the starting point for developing a drug.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Science first</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>One of the reasons companies succeed or fail is which projects get cut and which ones don’t…. It's a judgement call, and that's where you need the very top scientists and medical doctors and everybody to make that call--when to stop it, when is enough, and when to go the next round.</p>
                    <p>- Bob Swanson</p>
                </div>
                <p>Genentech focused on recruiting the best scientists and creating a culture that prized science above all else.  Genentech needed the best scientists because it was working in a competitive, cutting edge field, but also knew that the company needed to be rigorous and scientific in its business decision making.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Scientists first</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p><i>Bob Swanson</i>: Boyer's idea was…"Let's give [the young scientists] the credit." He didn't put his name on the insulin paper. And that, for a postdoc, is pretty attractive, rather than having your boss trying for the credit all the time and to keep you as the worker….</p>
                    <p>So the advantages were freedom from seeking out grants, a chance to be owners of the company.</p>
                    <p><i>Sally Smith Hughes</i>: Could you in addition to the equity offer them higher salaries than they were making in academia?</p>
                    <p><i>Bob</i>: Oh, yes. Postdocs continue to be very poorly paid. So yes, we could offer them good salaries.</p>
                </div>
                <p>To recruit the best scientists, Genentech combined the best attributes of academia and industry.  Genentech gave scientists the opportunity to work on important scientific problems, a large degree of freedom, and encouraged them to publish their results.  At the same time, Genentech gave credit based on merit, not seniority, paid scientists much more than they would make in academia, and issued stock grants that could provide life-changing financial gains if the company succeeded.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Work on ambitious problems</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>We don't work on any projects we can't get someone excited about…I think the key to any organization is hiring outstanding people, and helping them get excited about what they're doing.</p>
                    <p>- Bob Swanson</p>
                </div>
                <p>Genentech's ambition was key to recruiting and motivating the best scientists.  As <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful">Sam Altman</a> says, "It’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters."</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Products before platform</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>We were very focused on products, and that made a big difference. I know Cetus at the time was more into developing the technology. I said, "Well, let's make a product, and we'll develop the technology we need to make the product, and let the product drive the science, rather than the other way around." Actually, we wound up doing better science because of that, and also we got a product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The web is in need of some reinvention right now.</p><p>The web’s evolution over the last decade has mirrored the American economy. All of the essential indicators are going “up and to the right,” a steady stream of fundamental advances reassure use that there “is progress,” but the actual experience and effects for individuals stagnates or regresses.</p><p>The crisis affects platforms, creators, and consumers alike.</p><p><em>I’m going to try and dissect and diagnose this situation, a bit. You can skip forward if you just want to read my casual, unprofessional pitch for a reboot of the web. The idea is that we could choose a new lightweight markdown format to replace HTML &amp; CSS, split the web into documents and applications, and find performance, accessibility, and fun again.</em></p><details><summary>This post uses the pedantic definition of "the web"</summary>I've discussed attempts to reinvent the "Internet" a few times. Things like dat, IPFS, and arweave are all projects to reinvent an Internet, or a transport and data-sharing layer. The web is what lies on top of that, the HTML, CSS, URLs, JavaScript, browsing experience.</details><h3 id="the-platform-collapse">The platform collapse</h3><p>The platform side is what changed last week, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/">Mozilla laid off 250 employees</a> and indicated that it would affect Firefox development. Firefox wasn’t the #2 browser - that’s Safari, mainly because of the captive audience of iPhone and iPad users. But it was the most popular browser that people <em>chose</em> to use.</p><p><img alt="Chart of browser market share, with Chrome becoming the monopoly" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-chart-of-browser-market-share-with-chrome-becoming-the-monopoly.png"></p><p><em>Chart from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-202007">statcounter</a></em></p><p>The real winner is not just Chrome, but Chrome’s engine. One codebase, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML">KHTML</a>, split into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a> (Safari), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)">Blink</a> (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, etc.)</p><p>This a textbook monoculture. In one sense, it’s a victory for collaboration because nobody’s ‘wasting time’ on competing implementations and web developers can expect the same features and bugs across different browsers. But in a deeper way, it threatens one of the basic principles of how the web has evolved.</p><h3 id="specs--implementations">Specs &amp; implementations</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Decline" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.jpg"></picture></p><p>The web has evolved through a combination of <em>specifications</em> and <em>implementations</em>. Organizations like the <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> have been collaboration spaces for independent developers, corporations, and academics to discuss potential new features of the web. Then, browsers would test those ideas out in a variety of implementations.</p><p>This was an interesting structural piece: it reassured us all that it was <em>possible</em> to follow along, and that a multi-participant web was one of our goals. It was frustrating to pull up <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a> and see blank spots, but the idea was that different browsers may take the lead in some areas, but everyone catches up eventually. Chrome was not always the first to jump on features, or the first to optimize.</p><p>It’s slower to collaborate than to work alone, but it was beneficial in some ways that we’ve lost now. Chrome has been moving extremely fast, adding new specifications and ideas at a startling rate, and it’s becoming one of the hardest pieces of software to replicate.</p><p>Mike Healy I think <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_hasarms/status/1296575224599556097">said it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Do you think the web has almost ‘priced itself out of the market’ in terms of complexity if only 1-2 organisations are capable of building rendering engines for it?</p></blockquote><p>Not only is it nearly impossible to build a new browser from scratch, once you have one the ongoing cost of keeping up with standards requires a full team of experts. Read Drew DeVault’s <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html">Web browsers need to stop</a> for that point, and keep reading all of Drew’s stuff.</p><details><summary>What about Flow?</summary>Yep, there’s a <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/">browser called Flow</a>, which may exist and may support a full range of web standards. If it does exist, I’ll be very excited about it, but it has been teased for almost a year now without any concrete evidence, so it could equally be vaporware.</details><h3 id="the-problem-for-creators">The problem for creators</h3><p>The web has gotten much harder to develop for.</p><p>The web has had about 25 years to grow, few opportunities to shrink, and is now surrounded by an extremely short-sighted culture that is an outgrowth of economic and career short-termism. There are lots of <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/">ways to do anything</a>, and some of the most popular ways of building applications on the web are - in my opinion - <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">usually ghoulish overkill</a>.</p><p>The best way for folks to enter <em>web development</em> in 2020 is to choose a niche, like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> or <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, and hope that there’s a CSS and accessibility expert on their team.</p><p>For folks who just want to create a web page, who don’t want to enter an industry, there’s a baffling array of techniques, but all the simplest, probably-best ones are stigmatized. It’s easier to stumble into building your resume in React with GraphQL than it is to type some HTML in Notepad.</p><h3 id="the-problem-for-consumers">The problem for consumers</h3><p>We hope that all this innovation is <em>for the user</em>, but often it isn’t. Modern websites seem to be as large, slow, and buggy as they’ve ever been. Our computers are <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/11/15/something-is-wrong-with-computers.html">barely getting faster</a> and our internet connection speeds are stagnating (don’t even <em>try</em> to mention 5G). Webpage <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/webpages-are-getting-larger-every-year-and-heres-why-it-matters/">size growth</a> is outpacing it all.</p><p>The end result is that I no longer expect pages to be fast, even with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock</a> installed in Firefox and a good local <a href="https://sonic.net/">fiber internet provider</a>.</p><p>I don’t want to lay all of the blame at <em>those web developers</em>, though. Here’s a story from an old job that I find kind of funny. We were collecting some data from user interactions to answer simple questions like “do people click to upload or do they drag &amp; drop?” So we enabled <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>, a tool that lets you add data-collection pipelines by including a single script. The problem, though, is that Segment offered a big page of on/off switches with hundreds of data providers &amp; ad-tech companies on it. And, sure, enough, some folks closer to the business side started <em>clicking all those buttons</em>.</p><p>See, the problem with ads and data tracking is that <em>you can</em>, and who is going to say no? (In that instance, I said no, and added a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a> that would block new advertiser access at the page level.)</p><h2 id="recreating-simplicity">Recreating simplicity</h2><blockquote><p>You cannot get a simple system by adding simplicity to a complex system. - <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2012-March/065087.html">Richard O’Keefe</a></p></blockquote><p>Where do we go from here? Some of the smartest folks out there have been <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1296628134406692865">advocating for a major version revision</a> of the web.</p><p><em>I am in no way qualified to speculate on a whole new web from scratch, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/us/california-wildfires.html">air quality</a> is scary so I’m skipping my run and it’s Saturday morning so here we are.</em></p><p>How do we make the web fun, participatory, and good?</p><p>My first thought is that there are two webs:</p><h3 id="the-document-web">The document web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of web pages" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.jpg"></picture></p><p>There is the “document web”, like blogs, news, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook. This is basically the original vision of the web, as far as I can understand it (I was 2). Basically CSS, which we now think of as a way for designers to add brand identity and tweak pixel-perfect details, was instead mostly a way of making plain documents readable and letting the <em>readers</em> of those documents customize how they looked. This attribute actually <a href="https://twitter.com/autiomaa/status/1296755641164468224">survived for a while in Chrome, in the form of user stylesheets</a>, and <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/firefox-user-stylesheet">still works in Firefox</a>. Though it’s going to be a rough ride in the current web which has basically thrown away <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">semantic HTML</a> as an idea.</p><h3 id="the-application-web">The “application” web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of machines" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.jpg"></picture></p><p>Then there’s the “application web”. This started as <em>server</em> applications, built with things like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and before them a variety of technologies that will live forever in corporations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet">Java Servlets</a>.</p><p><a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> demonstrated that a lot of these applications could be moved into the browser, and then <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and its many SPA-style competitors established a new order for the web – highly-interactive, quite complex, client-side applications.</p><h3 id="the-war-between-the-parts-of-the-web">The war between the parts of the web</h3><p>I posit that this dual-nature is part of what gives the web its magic. But it’s also a destructive force.</p><p>The magic is that a simple blog can be creative expression, can be beautifully interactive. This one isn’t, but I’m just saying - <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day">it’s possible</a>.</p><p>The problem is that the “document web” is often plagued by application characteristics - it’s the JavaScript and animations and complexity that makes your average newspaper website an unmitigated disaster. Where document websites adopt application patterns they often accidentally sacrifice <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">accessibility</a>, performance, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">machine readability</a>.</p><p>And the “application web” is plagued by the document characteristics - interactive applications are going to great lengths to avoid most of the essential characteristics of HTML &amp; CSS and just use them as raw materials - avoiding writing any HTML directly at all, avoiding <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js">writing any CSS directly at all</a>, avoiding <a href="https://www.react-spring.io/">default animation features</a>, replacing <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">page-based navigation with something that looks like it but works completely differently</a>. The application web uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, not HTML, and would like that in the browser itself, or <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, instead of JavaScript, and would like that too.</p><p>When I read blog posts from ‘traditional web developers’ who are mad that HTML &amp; CSS aren’t enough anymore and that everything is complicated –&nbsp;I think this is largely that the application stack for building websites has replaced the document stack in a lot of places. Where we would use Jekyll or server-side rendering, we now use React or Vue.js. There are advantages to that, but for a lot of minimally-interactive websites, it’s throwing away decades worth of knowledge in exchange for certain performance perks that might not even matter.</p><p>The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create <em>documents</em> without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time. You don’t have to think about whether your last Facebook post will load quickly on your friend’s phone or whether your Instagram post will be correctly cropped and resized in the timeline - those things are taken care of.</p><p>To some extent, this doesn’t <em>need</em> to be something that only social networks provide, though: standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> and services like <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> show that pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the <em>platform level</em> and be provided on top of existing vanilla websites.</p><details><summary>These are not absolutes.</summary>Yeah, I can hear it now: but these categories are not …</details></div></div>

                    <h4>Close encounters with high speed Robots</h4>
                </p><div>
                    <p>I don’t know how to do this, and that’s where it all started.
So I am a member of my school’s <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC</a> team, <a href="https://www.raiderrobotics.org/">5024 Raider Robotics</a> and I decided to join because I love STEM related things and I decided that it would be a great idea to join the Robotics team.</p>

<p>At first I wasn’t planning on becoming a programmer. I was planning on being part of the build team, if I went through with being on the build team I wouldn’t be writting this.</p>

<p>So my father is also works with programming related things and he told me to at least give programming a shot, he told me it would be easier for me to do programming than doing build related related things. So I talked with one of the mentors on the team and he told me to give it a shot (and looking back at that time I think I made the right choice).</p>

<p>So I gave it a shot, and on the first few weeks I felt a little bit left out. I am the only girl in the programming subteam and sometimes I felt like I didn’t belong there just because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Most of the time I was just watching the older members do the work</li>
  <li>Some people told me I should have picked something like build or media (which I wasn’t mostly interrested in)</li>
  <li>Sometimes when I piched in my ideas people wouldn’t take me seriously.</li>
</ol>

<p>But as the season went on I started learning more, and more about programming and about what FRC actually is. And I made some good friends too.</p>

<p>You are probably very curious of what I mean by “Close encounters with high speed Robots”, it’s a fun story. But first I’ll give you some background information:</p>

<p>This year’s “game” for FRC was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiYWTmFRVE">Infinite Recharge</a>.</p>

<p>Our Robot <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5024">Death Raider</a>, is a robot that has a few powerful subsystems, like our Intake, Hopper, Shooter, Climber, Drivetrain, and our beloved Vision Target.</p>

<p>On a Friday night me and another one of the programmers were testing our Vision Target, the point of having that vision target is that we can get the robot to line up on a position by it’s self to shoot the balls into the goal.</p>

<p>We were testing that in our build room. Our build room has very bright lights and instead of the target the vision target tracked one of the lights and came back full speed at me and my friend. He managed to get out of the way but I got lucky enough to get trapped between a desk and a pile of scrap metal (It wasn’t a fun night).</p>

                    <h4>Using a lot of tech to replace a piece of paper</h4>
                </p><div>
                    <p><em>You can view my public demo for this post <a href="https://github.com/Ewpratten/school-notes-demo">here</a></em></p>

<p>Recently, I have been on a bit of a mission to improve my school workflow with software. Over the past month, I have built a cleaner <a href="https://github.com/Ewpratten/student_portal#unofficial-tvdsb-student-portal-webapp">student portal</a> for my school and <a href="https://github.com/Ewpratten/timeandplace-api#timeandplace-api--cli-application">written a tool</a> for automating in-class attendance. Alongside working on these projects, I have also been refining my notetaking system for school.</p>

<p>Since 9th grade, I have been taking notes in a private GitHub repository in markdown, and have been compiling them to HTML using a makefile for each course. While this system has worked ok, It has been far from perfect. Recently, I have been working very hard to give this system a much-needed upgrade. Here is the new tech stack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel buildsystem</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer">Beamer</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf">Tikz &amp; PGF</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">Zathura</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/language.html">Starlark</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a> CI</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is that every course I take becomes its own Bazel package, with subpackages for things like assignments, papers, notes, and presentations. I can compile everything just by running the command <code>bazel build //:all</code>. All builds are cached using Bazel’s build caching system, so when I run the command to compile my notes (I love saying that), I only end up compiling things that have changed since the last run. The setup for all of this is quite simple. All that is really needed is a Bazel workspace with the <a href="https://github.com/ProdriveTechnologies/bazel-pandoc"><code>bazel_pandoc</code></a> rules loaded (although I have opted to use some custom <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule">genrules</a> instead). Using these rules, markdown files can be concatenated, and compiled into a PDF. I also use a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template">Eisvogel</a> Pandoc template to make all my documents look a little neater.</p>

<p>In terms of workflow, I write all my notes as markdown files with <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#math">embedded LaTeX</a> for any equations and charts I may need. All of this is done inside of VSCode, and I have a custom <code>tasks.json</code> file that lets me press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> to re-compile whatever I am currently working on. I also keep Zathura open in a window to the side for a nearly-live preview system.</p>



<p><img src="https://retrylife.ca/assets/images/hs_notes_workflow.png" alt="">
<em>A screenshot of my workspace</em></p>

<p>Now, the question came up of <em>“how do you easily distribute notes and assignments to classmates and professors?”</em>. That question got me stuck for a while, but here is the system I have come up with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I write an assignment</li>
  <li>I push it to the private GitHub repository</li>
  <li>GitHub Actions picks up the deployment with a custom build script</li>
  <li>Every document is built into a PDF, and packaged with a directory listing generated by <a href="http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/tree.1.html#XML/JSON/HTML%20OPTIONS"><code>tree -H</code></a></li>
  <li>Everything is pushed to a subdomain on my website via GitHub pages</li>
  <li>I can share documents via URL to anyone</li>
</ol>

<p>This is almost entirely accomplished by a shell script and a custom CI script.</p>



<hr>

<p>If you have any questions about this system, want me to write another post about it, or would like me to walk you through setting up a notes workspace of your own, <a href="https://retrylife.ca/about">contact me</a></p>

August 23, 2020 | https://lemmalytica.com/posts/2020/08/23/exploring-stanza/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lemmalytica.com/posts/2020/08/23/exploring-stanza/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>August 23, 2020</p></header><section><p>The <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Stanford NLP Group</a> has long been an active player in natural language processing, particularly through their well-known <em>CoreNLP</em> Java toolkit. Until recently though, Stanford NLP has been a less well-known player in the Python community, which is a shame since many NLP practitioners work primarily in Python. But there’s good news! Stanford NLP’s <a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/index.html">Stanza</a> Python library is coming into its own with the recent release of version 1.1.1!</p>
<p>The new Stanza version supports 66 different human languages (which is a big step forward, since NLP has long been very English-centric) and can carry out core NLP tasks like <a href="https://lemmalytica.com/posts/2020/08/21/lemmatization/">lemmatization</a> and named entity recognition. Stanza is also customizable, which means that users can build their own pipelines and train their own models.</p>
<p>So, for all you Pythonistas out there, let’s take a look at Stanza and what it can do. We’ll start with a brief overview of core Stanza functionality and then we’ll use it to explore the characters in the classic novel, <em>Moby Dick</em>.</p>
<h2>Pipeline</h2>
<p>The stanza <code>Pipeline</code> can be configured with a variety of options to select the language model, processors, etc. The language model must be downloaded before it can be used in a pipeline.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
<span>import</span> stanza
<span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd


stanza<span>.</span>download<span>(</span><span>'en'</span><span>)</span>
nlp <span>=</span> stanza<span>.</span>Pipeline<span>(</span><span>'en'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For our exploratory project, let’s use the first paragraph from <em>Moby Dick</em>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
moby_dick_para1 <span>=</span> <span>"Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me."</span>

<h3>Entities</h3>
<p>Stanza includes a built-in named entity recognition (NER) module, with options for extension and customization. The default pipeline includes the built-in <code>NERProcessor</code>, which recognizes named entities for all token spans. Each <code>Entity</code> object includes attributes for <code>text</code>, <code>tokens</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>start_char</code>, <code>end_char</code>, and others.</p>

<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
<p>Stanza includes a built-in sentiment analysis processor, which can be customized as needed. Each <code>Sentence</code> object in a <code>Document</code> includes a <code>sentiment</code> score, where <code>0</code> represents negative, <code>1</code> represents neutral, and <code>2</code> represents positive. To make this a bit more human-readable, we’ll covert the scores to a string descriptor.</p>

<h2>Character Analysis</h2>
<p>Now that we know a little bit about how to use Stanza, let’s use it to see if we can learn anything about the characters in <em>Moby Dick</em>. First, we’ll have to load up the full text. As many of you will remember, <em>Moby Dick</em> is a long novel, so putting it through the Stanza pipeline can take a while. If you happen to have access to GPUs though, Stanza is GPU-aware and the process will go much faster.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>

</code></pre></div>
<h3>Moby Dick Characters</h3>
<p>Lets use Stanza’s entity recognition function to identify all the characters in Moby Dick. We’ll do this by selecting only those entities that have the type <code>PERSON</code>. Since each entity points back to its containing sentence, we’ll go ahead and save the sentiment of that sentence for future use.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>select_person_entities</span><span>(</span>doc<span>)</span><span>:</span>

<p>Now that we have all of the characters from <em>Moby Dick</em>, we can start to analyze the data to see what we can learn about them. First, how many characters are there?</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>num_unique_items</span><span>(</span>df<span>,</span> col<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>df<span>[</span>col<span>]</span><span>.</span>unique<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

num_unique_items<span>(</span>characters<span>,</span> <span>"text"</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Wow! 699 characters (or at least unique <code>PERSON</code> entities) is a lot. Most of those are mentioned just a single time, so perhaps we should take a look at just the major characters.</p>
<h4>Character Counts</h4>
<p>With our character dataframe in hand, we can now check which characters appear in the text most often. This will give us some idea about which characters are the most important.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly for anyone who has read <em>Moby Dick</em>, Captain Ahab is the most-mentioned character in the book. Other members of his crew like Stubb, Queequeg, and Starbuck make appearances in the most-frequent list as well. And of course, Moby Dick himself is in the top 10. </p>
<h4>Character Sentiment</h4>
<p>Since each <code>Entity</code> also includes a pointer to its parent sentence, we can now use the sentence sentiment rating that we saved earlier to make a judgement about the overall character sentiment. We’ll do this by converting our sentiment descriptors to a value of <code>-1</code> for “negative”, <code>0</code> for “neutral”, and <code>1</code> for “positive”. After that, we can group the various appearances of each character and sum the sentiment value for each sentence the character appears in. A negative …</p></section></article></div>

          <p><span>This is an introduction to the world of traditional Japanese instruments, also known as </span> <em>wagakki</em> <span> (和楽器). Here I include a music sample of each instrument, so you can quickly familiarize with them.</span></p> <p><span>Join me in exploring this wealth of distinct musical sounds, as well as new ways to relax, enrich, and appreciate life.</span></p>  <p><h2><span>String Instruments</span></h2></p> <p><h3><span>Koto </span></h3></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/koto1.jpg"></p>  <p><span>The koto is perhaps the most iconic Japanese instrument. A large zither with an elongated body, it is typically made of paulownia wood. The player would pluck the strings on the koto using fingerpicks, finger nails, or their fingers. </span></p> <p><span>The word "koto" (こと) actually refers to various types of instruments with subtle differences. "Kin" (琴, きん) refers to the type where the pitch is determined by where the string is pressed. Whereas "Sō" (箏, そう) refers to the type with a movable bridge. </span></p> <p><span>To get a better sense of the sound of the koto, enjoy this 3-hour session of koto music:
</span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RipkSFmuwfA?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Taishōgoto</span></h3></p> <p><span>Developed during the </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taish%C5%8D_period" target="_blank"><span>Taishō period</span></a> <span>&nbsp;(1912–1926), the </span> <em>taishōgoto</em> <span> (also known as the Nagoya harp) is a wooden hollow body with 2 to 12 metal strings attached to it. It is equipped with a simple keyboard, and played by holding the keyboard with your left hand and playing with your right hand pick (pick). </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9h0JHCJMo7E?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Biwa</span></h3></p> <p><span>Biwa (琵琶) entered Japan from China (Chinese </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipa" target="_blank"><span>pipa</span></a> <span>) in the 7th to 8th centuries. It is a short-necked lute that produces a sound by plucking. In ancient times, there was a four-string system and a five-string system (straight-neck biwa), and the latter has since been abolished. </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyUVT8sas6g?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Sanshin / Shamisen</span></h3></p> <p><span>Sanshin (三線) is primarily played in the Okinawa prefecture. As its name in Japanese suggests, it has three strings along a long and slender neck. It is similar to the Sanxian, a stringed instrument born in Fujian Province of China. </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kOU0xicDz94?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><span>The shamisen (三味線) is a related Japanese stringed instrument. Traditionally, cat or dog leather is used to cover both sides of the square flat wooden body of the shamisen. It is played using a ginkgo-shaped pick.</span></p> <p><span>Having multiple tuning styles depending on the context, it was commonly used to accompany </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki" target="_blank"><span>kabuki</span></a> <span> (a classical dance-drama). </span></p>  <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4etmNm-NHU?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>   <p><h2><span>Percussion instruments</span></h2></p> <p><h3><span>Taiko</span></h3></p> <p><span>Taiko is a generic term for Japanese drums. It is used in festivals, Kabuki, and rituals at shrines and temples. It has a hollow body made of wood, covered with a thin film. To produce a sound, the player would strike it their own hands or a drumstick.</span></p> <p><span>Enjoy this awe-inspiring taiko performance by Senzoku College of Music: </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZagsLrNzg3I?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><span>And chances are, you have likely seen it at an arcade, thanks to the popular game </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin" target="_blank"><span>Taiko no Tatsujin</span></a> <span>:</span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/taiko.jpg"></p>  <p><h3><span>Tsuzumi / Ōtsuzumi / Kotsuzumi</span></h3></p> <p><span>In the narrow sense of the word, tsuzumi (鼓) refers to the small drum. It has a leather cover on both sides of the hourglass-shaped wooden body, tied tightly with the cord. You play the instrument by striking one or both leathers with your hand while adjusting the tone by tightening or loosening this cord. </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6scDTMwM_8?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Suzu</span></h3></p> <p><span>The suzu (鈴) is a Japanese bell. It is a hollow ball made of metal or pottery containing a small ball inside of it. A sound produced by shaking the instrument.
</span></p> <p><span>In </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto" target="_blank"><span>Shinto</span></a> <span>, Suzu's are ringed in the shrine when worshiping. There is also a shrine maiden bell (kagura-suzu), which a shrine maiden holds in her hand when she dances a </span> <em>kagura dance</em> <span>. The main stick is a handle and a three-tiered upper part, with 15 small bells attached to it.</span></p> <p><span>Footage of a kagura dance: </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOBG-BDdeSQ?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Mokugyo</span></h3></p> <p><span>Mokugyo (木魚), literally meaning&nbsp;</span> <em>wooden fish, </em> <span>is a block of wood carved in the shape of a fish. It is struck with a wooden stick, and is commonly used to accompany Buddhist chanting, in  Zen Buddhism, Tendai Buddhism, and Jodo Buddhism.</span></p> <p><span>This is an audio clip of mokugyo striking, alternating on the left and right side, for 30 minutes straight. It is oddly satisfying:</span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nbq6cXDrja8?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h2><span>Wind instruments</span></h2></p> <p><span>The generic name for the flute (and more generally, wind instruments) in Japanese is "fue" (笛). Below are the most popular types.</span></p> <p><h3><span>Nōkan</span></h3></p> <p><span>The Nōkan (能管) is a flute made of bamboo, typically used for&nbsp;for the </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh" target="_blank"><span>noh</span></a> <span>&nbsp;theater. But it is also used in kabuki, banquet music and Gion music. It is characterized by a narrow inner diameter that creates a unique sound.</span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dR5JnSN0cKA?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Shakuhachi</span></h3></p> <p><span>The Shakuhachi (尺八) is vertically bamboo flute typically used in Zen Buddhism. In the making of a shakuhachi, it is common to use the root of the bamboo and include 7 bamboo nodes (the joints along the body). To make a sound, one would blow on its upper mouth. Generally, there are four hand holes on the front and one on the back.
</span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8R8PGMNdwIY?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Shō</span></h3></p> <p><span>The Shō is a 17-pipe mouth organ used for&nbsp;</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gagaku" target="_blank"><span>gagaku</span></a> <span>. It is believed to have been introduced to Japan along with Gagaku in the Nara era. 17 thin bamboo pipes are arranged in a circle on the part called "hō" (匏). The player would hold down different finger holes in the bamboo pipes, and blow into and out of the hole on the side of the hō. 15 of the 17 bamboo pipes are then made to vibrate via a metal reed attached to the bottom of the bamboo pipe.

There are similar types of instruments across East Asia, including the Chinese "</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_(instrument)" target="_blank"><span>Sheng</span></a> <span>". </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ry-hr05kTFk?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I've had the pleasure to work with very experienced firmware developers; the
kind of people who know the size of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">red
zones</a> and routinely
transform coffee into linker scripts and pointer dereferences. In other words,
the <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html">Mels</a> and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf">Zeus
Hammers</a> of the
world.</p>
<p>When it comes to the tools of our trade, many of them are curious and
experimental. Some of them—very much myself included—explore far enough to leave
pragmatism behind and veer into idealism, stubbornly forcing beautiful round
pegs into industrial square holes. Hey, maybe they're square for a reason, but
it doesn't hurt to try.</p>
<p>The majority of them aren't like that. Your average battle-tested firmware
developer has accrued a healthy distrust of the abstract, probably born of
watching shiny platonic constructs crash and burn with painfully <em>real</em> and
<em>concrete</em> error traces. It is sobering, having to chase a hardfault on a tiny
MCU across enough vtables and templated code to make Herb Sutter puke angle
brackets. No wonder modern approaches are met with some resistance unless the
LOADs and the STOREs are in clear view.</p>
<p>I felt this way too when someone suggested to me, back in 2014, that an
up-and-coming language called <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> showed promise
in the embedded field. <em>Surely not</em>, I thought, <em>too high level.</em> Even though I
had been playing with it already, my profoundly ingrained bit-twiddling
instincts told me not to trust a language that supported functional programming,
or one that dared to have an <em>opinion</em> on how I managed my memory. Bah! That's
how you get philosophers to run out of forks, and your forks to turn into
SIGSEGVs.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>Through the past five years of experimentation, I've gone from intrigued, to
optimistic, to <em>convinced</em> that Rust is an ideal language to build industrial
grade, bulletproof bare metal software. Beyond that, I've come to realize that
even the highest level constructs that the base language offers are applicable
to firmware development, very much unlike other languages that span a wide range
of paradigms (I'm looking at you, C++). There are a few reasons I felt this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust's safety guarantees and general strictness bring the debug time down
significantly, so there's less need to spend time developing mental maps of
how high level constructs correspond to hardware primitives.</li>
<li>The type system is <em>great</em> at enforcing local reasoning and preventing leaky
abstractions. Building decoupled systems with no runtime cost is easy.</li>
<li>The compiler error messages are worthy of an AI assistant with <em>concerning</em>
mind-reading abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately, I've had the chance to work on a Rust
<a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f412.html">STM32F412</a>
project in a professional setting, with one of the goals being to foster a Rust
knowledge pool at my company. The project, <code>Loadstone</code>, is a 32kb secure
bootloader targeting bare metal devices for the medical industry.</p>
<p>While it would've been easier—and much less of a headache to my colleagues—to
stick to a subset of Rust more familiar to C developers, with your <code>for</code>s, your
<code>*mut u8</code>s and your <code>unsafe</code>s, I instead decided not to pull any punches and
make liberal use of generics, iterator adapters, typestate programming and other
stuff that would've made 2010's cuervo cry blood and hug the closest copy of
Kernighan and Ritchie.</p>
<p>The pressures of a real collaborative project have taught me a lot, and many
assumptions have been refined thanks to the criticism of several skilled
outsiders who, as outsiders often do, had a privileged view on things I took for
granted.</p>
<p>A topic that came up frequently in code review is
<a href="https://thume.ca/2019/07/14/a-tour-of-metaprogramming-models-for-generics/">generics</a>.
Perhaps still recovering from a SFINAE nightmare, some colleagues were
unsure about the use of generics to group behaviour that we'd normally write
separate implementations for. The concerns tended to fall in one of three
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runtime performance.</li>
<li>Binary size bloat.</li>
<li>Habitability and readability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is easy to dispel, as it often comes from unfamiliarity with static
dispatch. No vtables or heap allocations in anything we're doing, promise! The
second concern is valid but I've found it to be negligible in practice; I have
plans for another blog post giving some concrete benchmarks.</p>
<p>The last concern is the most subjective and thus the hardest to argue, so I
decided to focus on it in this blog series. I'll go over the design process of
two similar flash memory drivers, and hopefully show how generic programming can
make the job easier and the result more habitable, even in the barren, heapless,
rugged world of bare metal firmware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compile times are another common—and very valid—argument against liberal use
of generics. However, it is not a big problem for low footprint embedded
projects like this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">Flash memory</a> is electronic
non-volatile storage. It's ubiquitous in consumer electronics; any time you
switch a small device off and it <em>remembers something</em>—whether it's settings,
songs, documents, even its own program—chances are you have flash memory to
thank. We'll be looking at two different <em>NOR</em> flash chips, since the first demo
port of <code>Loadstone</code> requires us to operate both:</p>
<ul>
<li>The embedded
<a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f412.html">STM32F412</a>
1MB MCU flash.</li>
<li>The external 128MB <a href="https://www.micron.com/-/media/client/global/documents/products/data-sheet/nor-flash/serial-nor/n25q/n25q_128mb_1_8v_65nm.pdf">Micron
N25Q128</a>
flash chip present in the <a href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f412gdiscovery.html">STM32F412ZGT6 Discovery
Kit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably knew what flash memory is used for already, but what non-firmware
developers may not know is that flash memory is <em>quirky</em>. You cannot simply
write a byte to a NOR flash address, sir, that would be rude. While a blob of
flash memory will happily turn a <code>1</code> into a <code>0</code>, the opposite operation will
fail silently.</p>
<p>You can think of every <code>1</code> bit (NOR flash's <em>erased</em> state) as a lit candle you
can blow out. However, in this metaphor you don't get a lighter
to light them back up; you get a flamethrower. Without getting into the hardware
principles involved, the design of NOR flash memory requires that you erase
(i.e. set to <code>1</code>) memory <em>in bulk</em>, in chunks often orders of magnitude bigger
than the minimum addressable memory. On most chips you even have a three way
mismatch: your read, write and erase sizes aren't equal. Ugh.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this makes writing flash drivers a bit of a pain,
particularly because even the smallest write operations turn into <em>read/write
cycles</em>. Writing a single byte requires reading the minimum erasable block
surrounding the targeted address (which may itself require multiple reads),
potentially erasing the entire block, then writing back the original data merged
with the desired byte.</p>
<p>As you can also imagine, nobody but the person writing this driver <em>wants to
care about this</em>. Even in the minimalistic world of bare metal software,
productive collaboration depends on developers filing away these sharp edges,
presenting interfaces that uniformize or hide any aspects of hardware irrelevant
to the bigger design. As such, a first stab at a flash memory interface should
simply offer a way to read and write ranges of memory.</p>
<p>Let's look at some code:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>ReadWrite {
   </span><span>type </span><span>Error;
   </span><span>type </span><span>Address;
   </span><span>fn </span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>address</span><span>: </span><span>Self::</span><span>Address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(), </span><span>Self::</span><span>Error&gt;;
   </span><span>fn </span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>address</span><span>: </span><span>Self::</span><span>Address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(), </span><span>Self::</span><span>Error&gt;;
   </span><span>fn </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; (</span><span>Self::</span><span>Address, </span><span>Self::</span><span>Address);
   </span><span>fn </span><span>erase</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(), </span><span>Self::</span><span>Error&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The above is what I converged on as a generic interface to a flash
driver. If you're unfamiliar with Rust generics, the above isn't a type, or a
parent class to inherit from. It's more like a Haskell typeclass; a set of
requirements for a concrete type to implement, described in this case in the
form of associated types (<code>Error</code> and <code>Address</code>) and method signatures (<code>read</code>,
<code>write</code>, <code>range</code> and <code>erase</code>).</p>
<p>Even at this early step, some tradeoffs have to be made. The keen,
hardfault-traumatized reader will notice that this interface doesn't lend itself
well to timing sensitive problems. All methods are blocking, and abstracting the
read/write cycle away will naturally lead to non-deterministic write times; a
write may take very little if it only requires toggling bits off, or it might
take very long if it straddles two big sectors requiring erase operations. The
<code>bytes</code> output parameter in <code>read</code> might also strike you as not too rusty, where
returning a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> is often idiomatic. Unfortunately we have no heap to work
with, so if you want to take your bytes home you'll have to bring your own bag.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's hard to write the universal interface. This one made sense for the
problems we're solving, but make sure to keep in mind the requirements of your
project!</p>
<h3 id="why-not-simply-write-a-concrete-type">Why not simply write a concrete type?<a href="#why-not-simply-write-a-concrete-type" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-not-simply-write-a-concrete-type">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Ah, the word "simply" is tricky. Datasheet in hand, it may have been easier to
write. It might even save us a few bytes down the line. But altogether I think
the benefits of starting here are well worth the drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes it easy to write test doubles and leverage static dispatch for unit
testing. This kind of approach is what I miss the most when writing C, where
I'm forced to resort to link time substitution or to do things with the
preprocessor too vile to even mention here.</li>
<li>Decouples your design from the get go and makes collaboration easy. Another
developer can immediately start working against this interface, and it's
abstract enough to give you confidence it won't need to be changed as more
knowledge of the hardware emerges.</li>
<li>Going abstract first forces you to think long and hard about what behaviour is
common to each implementation and what behaviour isn't, which helps to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">not
repeat yourself</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the biggest reason, and one where C++ and Rust diverge, is the fact that
<em>you can reason about this interface locally</em>. This stems from a non-obvious
difference between the C++ template system and Rust traits. Where C++ templates
type check at the point of instantiation, Rust traits type check at the point of
definition.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means that the inscrutable, seven-feet-deep-in-a-library
C++ template errors are impossible in Rust, because the compiler doesn't need to
go beyond the interface to prove it is used correctly.</p>
<p>A similar interface using C++ …</p></div></div>

        <h2>1950's Graphic Studies from a Gujarati Designer</h2>
        <p>I was visiting my family in Anand, Gujarat (India) in 2018 and got to meet our neighbor, Bharatbhai Patel, who is a painter and a professor of Arts at a local college. These graphic design studies are from his archives and he was eager to give us a tour of his studio and allowed us to document them. No one knows who U.M. Patel, the student who made these drawings and there is nothing on the internet that I could find. That makes it even more interesting - how many unknown artists, and their uncountable works have been lost in the ether of time, never to be seen by another human, ever?</p><p>The following qualities are particularly striking:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>1950's in a small town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand,_Gujarat">Anand, Gujarat</a> was extremely impoverished, under developed and had no real connection to the western world - and the concept of professional Graphics Design was unheard of.</li>
<li>U.M. Patel studied at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Kenya">RTCEA</a> college in Nairobi, Kenya based on the college stamp on the papers. That means, Mr. Patel had most likely sailed across the Arabian Sea from Gujarat to obtain university education.</li>
<li>The immense attention to detail, every character is drawn and painted by hand.</li>
<li>Watercolor quality and lightfastness is exceptional and the archival process used to preserve these works is impressive.</li>
<li>The versatility of his works - graphic design, industrial design, architectural plans, color theory, artistic motifs, perspective studies, etc.</li>
<li>Rigor and discipline that comes across from going through these works.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-9b09b130b6a7578120a8"><div><p>A few months ago, I created a note on my phone where I’d put advice, tips, and general things to keep in mind as I begin college. Some included tips to study, how to get mentors, and books to read.</p><p>I thought I would share it so other people like me would benefit. If you’d like <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/contact" target="_blank">to share your strategies with me</a>, please do so and I’ll add them here. Let’s learn together!</p><h2>How to Read &amp; Use This List</h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The list does not have any specific order as I would just write things down as I discovered them.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This is my plan for what I will do. Therefore, it’s very context-specific (more on this below).</p></li><li><p>Review it weekly (more on this below).</p></li><li><p>After each point, I explain my rationale behind each point.</p></li></ul><p>Class is starting soon, so let’s start walking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Talk to engineering professors</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Stop by and ask questions and be genuinely interested</p></li><li><p>Ask if they know of any projects or if they have projects</p></li></ul><p>I plan to study engineering, read more about why <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/college" target="_blank">here</a>. Talking to professors is an easy decision because they are the experts in their fields and are the ones who know about how to approach engineering and how to find the best opportunities.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Reach out to alumni&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I don’t like to assume what my future career might be like. I get to cheat and ask my future self what my career could be like.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Answer these questions</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>What jobs exist that I would enjoy and have a reasonable shot at getting?</p></li></ul><p>This will clarify my future path and get me focused to achieve that goal. I’m not concerned with this question as I mostly think about the most important problems and what I could do to solve them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Get good advice</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Good advice is context-specific to you</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>“—what you enjoy, what frustrates you, what your background is like, what kind of goals you’re likely to have—that most formal advisers won’t ever have the time to understand.”</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Source: <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/college/" target="_blank">Ben Kuhn</a></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>READ </strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3j8noIM" target="_blank"><strong><em>How To Win at College</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em>by Cal Newport</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>And add it to your weekly review (more on this below)</p></li></ul><p>This is a great book that will help understand what college is like and how to the best you can be. This book answers the following questions:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How to prepare for exams and papers?</p></li><li><p>What extracurricular opportunities should you look into?</p></li><li><p>How to balance a fun social life with an ambitious schedule?</p></li></ul><p>This book contains the answers to these questions and more! Highly recommended! </p><p><strong>Be friends with people in your class&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sure? This one seems dumb, but it’s one of the most powerful because of the psychology. Once you have a friend (a good one) in your class, you get motivated to do your best and of course, you can help each other out. Don’t overlook this one.</p><p><strong>Have Fun</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This is often overlooked but it shouldn’t. College is often too stressful and what’s a better way than to hang out with friends and do something fun. Fun, whatever that means, should be part of your life daily and weekly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Help professors (and university) monetize ideas and research&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Professors and scientists are busy trying to invent and research ideas. That’s really hard and they shouldn’t be the ones trying to find ways to commercialize the ideas and research. Leave that to savvy entrepreneurs like me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Keep your personal burn rate low and minimize your commitments.&nbsp;</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>“I have seen a lot of people miss great opportunities because they couldn’t afford a reduction in salary or because they couldn’t move or didn’t have the time.”</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Source: <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/advice-for-ambitious-19-year-olds#post_body_585588:~:text=No%20matter%20what%20you%20choose%2C%20keep,move%20or%20didn%E2%80%99t%20have%20the%20time." target="_blank">Sam Altman</a></p></li></ul></li></ul><p>I like to get busy, and busy does not always mean productive. Leaving chunks of time aside for the next opportunity or project will be key for me.</p><p><strong>Start a Weekly Reviews</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>I was inspired by <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/" target="_blank">Ben Kunh’s method</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Look <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s689/sh/a56021d0-447d-443a-be6a-c1cef4021669/93484281e518ae8b2ebf7b9ff1c88a16" target="_blank">at mine</a></p></li></ul><p>I have been doing a Weekly Planning Sheet for about three years. Lately, I’ve realized that I would make the same mistakes repeatedly because I didn’t reflect and learn from my mistakes. Think about your weekly review to reflect and learn from your mistakes every week.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Change Framing</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Don’t get caught up trying to get a perfect GPA. <strong>Grades should not be something you pursue, but something that ensues.&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ul><p>Many college students (including me) have the pressure of getting a GPA to get into certain schools. This is a perfect recipe for failure because you’ll always have the pressure in the back of your mind when you’re studying, walking, talking, etc. Instead, if you’re studying something because you enjoy it and want to push yourself. That’s a better strategy and you’ll end up doing well.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Have a Plan B</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>My Plan A is to <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/college" target="_blank">study engineering</a>, but it’s important to have a Plan B to relieve stress and pressure.</p></li></ul><p>I want to study engineering and getting there is challenging. If I overly focus on the GPA and have no Plan B, the pressure is just too much. But if I have a Plan B that I can always pursue, in case Plan A doesn't work out. Then, I’ll counterintuitively have a better chance of pursuing plan A because I focus more on the process, and not on the outcome.<br></p><p><strong>College and my projects should be related, and I should use college to leverage my projects and endeavors.&nbsp;</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>I need to keep asking myself how to create projects related to my classes.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>I get so excited about the possibilities that I almost forget about school. This happened in high school when lots of opportunities showed up and I pursued them. Finding projects related to my classes would also be a way to keep me engaged and to go above and beyond in my classes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Be the most knowledgeable engineering student within 6 months</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmYekD6-PZ8" target="_blank">Bill Gurley’s famous speech</a></p></li></ul><p>I’m reading many books and talking to current and past engineering students so 1) I can learn from their mistakes, and 2) know the ins and outs of the university and engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Find researchers to work with</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How to find scientists to work with?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Avoid being artificial</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Take their classes</p></li><li><p>Office hours</p></li><li><p>DM/Email them</p></li><li><p>Make yourself useful to them</p></li><li><p>Get a job as an assistant or research at somebody's labs</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Keep in mind this question</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Why would someone be a mentor?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>High potential person, and they can help reach that potential</p></li><li><p>If they can see that their advice pays off 10x in you</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>It’s easy to go through college and be mindless about the possibilities and opportunities that are available. This is one that I’m the most excited about.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Create GroupMe Chat in your classes</strong></p><p>Take the lead and become known to others while helping each other mutually. Everyone is nervous, and no one knows anyone. I want to create communities where we all help each other study and to excel in the class.</p><p><strong>85% Rule</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Runners run faster at 85% because they get less tense and have less pressure.</p></li></ul><p>I will study hard and efficiently, but that’s it. I won’t be overly worried and stressed because I know that if I put in the effort and the work, the outcome will happen.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sit in the front row&nbsp;</strong></p><p>People will think I’m weird, but who cares? They probably won’t even remember you. And if they do, they’ll think you’re smart. The real reason I’m doing this is that you become more engaged so you can enjoy the class more. And professors will know you too. If classes are on Zoom, I plan to arrive 10-15 minutes early.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1 hour of class = 2 hours of homework</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>This was recommended to me by a Cornell engineering professor.</p></li></ul><p>I don’t plan to follow this closely, but it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind as I study, especially for harder classes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Go Over This Test Checklist Before Every Test</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Add to weekly review</p></li></ul><p>I plan to use it both to study and review before every test. One of the most useful and practical resources I’ve found so far. Check it out <a href="https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=2747ddd6-b620-4875-9cf2-cc089b56ca9f&amp;s=s689&amp;b=718034f3-4bf3-454b-aced-3e9d5ae86899&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=1&amp;sds=2&amp;" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don’t end a week without understanding a topic</strong></p><p>I plan to email or meet my professor, go to office hours, ask TAs, ask friends, and do anything and everything to understand the basics of what I’m studying. This becomes critical, especially in the first few years when you’re building the foundations.</p><p>A big part of life is making mistakes, but a bigger part is learning from other people’s mistakes. College will be a new experience for me, but not for the people who gave me all the advice I wrote above. I’m both excited and ready to excel, but most importantly to enjoy everything college has to offer.</p><p>I hope you find this guide as useful and as inspiring as I did! Go crush it!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598200123739_7186"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), sign up for my<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">newsletter</a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out.

<p>Our societal narratives are invisible by dint of their ubiquity, but they are far more important in stabilizing the status quo that all the cops and jails and domestic surveillance agencies put together.</p>
<p>Take inequality: when a few have much, and the many have little, the primary means of preventing the many from seizing the wealth of the few isn't burglar alarms – it's legitimacy.</p>
<p>If you can convince people that wealth is both earned and deserved, you can save a lot on armed guards, vaults and CCTV cameras.</p>
<p>The aristocracy once used the church to effect this legitimacy: as the English crown's motto goes, "Dieu et mon droit" ("God and my right").</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>The aristocratic legitimacy story makes it a literal sin to question inequality.</p>
<p>As the aristocracy gave way to merchant princes, society needed a new stabilizing story: the tale of the market, whose invisible hand allocates capital to the most deserving.</p>
<p>It's a highly circular form of reasoning, of course: "I am deserving because I am rich; I am rich because I am deserving."</p>
<p>Naturally, this self-serving logic attracted ridicule.</p>
<p>Notably, the sociologist Michael Young wrote a satirical, dystopian novel mocking this idea called "The Rise of the Meritocracy."</p>
<p>His coinage, "Meritocracy," was meant to deflate the delusion that wealth was merit and merit was wealth.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy_(1967_cover).jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy_(1967_cover).jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Instead, the term was adopted by the very people it was meant to lampoon: soon, capitalism boosters and defenders of inequality began to proclaim themselves to be "meritocrats" and defended the institutions that had enriched them as "meritocratic." Yeah, it's weird.</p>
<p>At its core, "meritocracy" is eugenics: the belief that some people are just intrinsically better than others (that's why you often hear plutocrats boasting of their "good blood" – think of Trump here).</p>
<p>Sometimes it's dressed up with coded language like "self-control" or "grit," but ultimately, it's about some in-born spark that both demands that the meritocrat lead the rest of us, and that they be rewarded for it. You can tell you deserves to rule because they are ruling.</p>
<p>As with all eugenics stories, meritocracy is trivially disprovable pseudoscientific nonsense.</p>
<p>Stipulate for the sake of argument that there are "meritocratic" traits that some of us are born with.</p>
<p>One thing we know about hereditable traits is that they follow a normal distribution – a bell curve. If merit is a heritable trait, then it should follow that same distribution.</p>
<p>But recall that "merit" is the excuse given for inequality: the market is a system for uncovering and rewarding merit, matching quanta of merit with dollars in a precise ratio (Bill Gates's $114b and Jeff Bezos's $196b tells us that Gates possesses 58% of Bezos's merit).</p>
<p>And unfortunately for meritocracy's coherence, the actual wealth distribution follows a power-law curve, not a bell-curve. The zottarich are an order of magnitude richer than the gigarich, who are an order of magnitude richer than the ultrarich and so on.</p>
<p>Plutocracy is asymptotic to infinity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Long_tail.svg.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Long_tail.svg.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>And while eugenics fails to account for this distribution there's another hypothesis that turns out to be a good fit: the rich are lucky.</p>
<p>Enter "Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure," a paper from a group of U Catatania researchers that proposes a model for explaining deepening inequality.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068">https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068</a></p>
<p>A breakdown in MIT Technology Review explains it well. The model assumes that N people have various talents "around some average level, with some standard deviation."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/01/144958/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich-turns-out-its-just-chance/?itm_source=parsely-api">https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/01/144958/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich-turns-out-its-just-chance/?itm_source=parsely-api</a></p>
<p>"The computer model charts each individual through a working life of 40 years. During this time, the individuals experience lucky events that they can exploit to increase their wealth if they are talented enough.</p>
<p>"However, they also experience unlucky events that reduce their wealth. These events occur at random."</p>
<p>After 40 simulated years, the agents in the simulation have a wealth distribution that looks a hell of a lot like ours.</p>
<p>They run the simulation repeatedly, and get the same distribution every time. In other words, markets allocate capital primarily by luck, not merit.</p>
<p>However, I'd like to see another version of this experiment that adds in immorality: a willingness to cheat and steal. Given the state of the plutocracy, I hypothesize an even stronger correlation.</p>

<p>There's a lot going for AOC: she's a once-in-a-generation gifted orator, she's got a sharp political mind, she's got the humility and self-awareness to surround herself with other smart people and recruit them to advise her.</p>
<p>But even her most ardent admirers tend to overlook the role of graphic design in her work. From the start – her initial primary campaign – she has led the field with striking, beautiful graphic design. I framed one of her posters and hung it my house.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/29687015957_49490e9a62_h.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/29687015957_49490e9a62_h.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>AOC's latest graphic campaign is in support of the Green New Deal, a visionary proposal for a better future that has been sorely lacking in visual materials.</p>
<p>(The major exception being Molly Crabapple's animation in "A Message From the Future," an Intercept video with AOC and Naomi Klein).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ</a></p>
<p>The new posters recall the WPA illustrations for the National Park Service, icons of design that retain remarkable currency nearly a century later.</p>

<p>There are six in all. The first is Gavin Snider's Flushing Meadows poster, celebrating the 1939 New York World's Fair, a high water mark for hope in a moment of crisis.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/flushing_3afa961b-ecde-4170-b232-1490bb2a3817_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/flushing_3afa961b-ecde-4170-b232-1490bb2a3817_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Next is Scott Starrett's Pelham Bay Park poster, celebrating the Bronx's most iconic WPA success story, a beloved beach and golf course.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/pehlam_d017eb83-206e-4f60-aa73-b243f2c90d86_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/pehlam_d017eb83-206e-4f60-aa73-b243f2c90d86_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/griffith_9016ef73-d08f-4d61-a12c-78585269f737_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/griffith_9016ef73-d08f-4d61-a12c-78585269f737_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Fourth is Lazarus Nazario's poster celebrating the Plaza Del Totem in San Juan, Puerto Rico, a symbol of indigenous resilience erected as a rebuttal to the shameful celebration of the great historic monster Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/deltotum_7eac067b-7c5b-4c09-8913-80d62d66e4c1_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/deltotum_7eac067b-7c5b-4c09-8913-80d62d66e4c1_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Fifth is Gavin Snider's poster for Detroit's Hart Plaza, whose monument commemorates the Underground Railroad in one of America's great historically Black cities, a city that has been brutalized by white supremacy and austerity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hartplaza_60af5125-8694-43dc-880e-e0b002fdaafb_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hartplaza_60af5125-8694-43dc-880e-e0b002fdaafb_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Finally, there's Dayi Tofu's commemoration of Boston's Public Garden, part of the city's "Emerald Necklace" of urban parks.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/publicgarden_ea48a057-d355-41b2-8dc0-bb5208f7388f_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/publicgarden_ea48a057-d355-41b2-8dc0-bb5208f7388f_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>The posters are a reminder that we are not the fallen remnants of a lost civilization, no longer capable of visionary collective projects to secure our future. We have done this before and we can do it again.</p>
<p>We are not atomized individuals, incapable of effecting change beyond the scope of what one person can do – or what one billionaire can coerce. We are a society, and we can steer our course.</p>
<p>The posters are union made, 18" x 12", and cost $24 each. You can get all six in a $90 bundle.</p>

Brown PhD</sup></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This month, Dr. Ronald B. Brown had a daring paper published in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/public-health-lessons-learned-from-biases-in-coronavirus-mortality-overestimation/7ACD87D8FD2237285EB667BB28DCC6E9#" target="_blank">Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness</a>, conservatively entitled <em>Public health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation</em>. </p>



<p>“The subject of this article is disruptive, to say the least, although it is not as obvious from the title,” Dr. Brown told me in an email. “The manuscript cites the smoking-gun, documented&nbsp;evidence showing that the public’s overreaction to the coronavirus pandemic was based on the worst miscalculation in the history&nbsp;of humanity,&nbsp;in my opinion. My manuscript underwent an intensive&nbsp;peer-review process. You are the first media guy who has responded to my invitation.”</p>



<p>It’s sadly no surprise the media has not kept Dr. Brown’s phone ringing with interview requests. The abstract, in itself, contains a firecracker where he says: </p>



<p>“Results of this critical appraisal reveal information bias and selection bias in coronavirus mortality overestimation, most likely caused by misclassifying an influenza infection fatality rate (IFR) as a case fatality rate (CFR).”</p>



<p>Is that not what we’ve seen? The number of people they said would be buried in mass COVID-19 graves better reflects how many people simply ended up with a cough and fever.</p>



<p>Dr. Brown added that CDC and WHO documents show that the case fatality rate for influenza was similar to the coronavirus, implying that the lockdowns were pointless. His paper questions why the 2017-2018 influenza season in the United States did not “receive the same intensive media coverage as COVID-19.”</p>



<p>He points out that “the accuracy of coronavirus tests rushed into production during the pandemic were unknown.” And he explores how the  media began focusing on an increase in coronavirus cases while ignoring the decrease in  death rates.</p>



<p>Much of the article looks at how lockdowns and anti-social distancing probably had little or no effect on reducing COVID-19 deaths. He says that “the public’s belief that mitigation measures were responsible for reducing coronavirus mortality may be a post hoc fallacy if lower mortality was actually due to the overestimation of coronavirus deaths.”</p>



<p>Speaking on the damage done by the counter-measures, Brown writes: “The ethics of implementing fear-based public health campaigns needs to be reevaluated for the potential harm these strategies can cause.”</p>



<p>His report includes this mind-map on how we were all mind-warped:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="447" height="447" src="https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png 447w, https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x300.png 300w, https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px"></figure></div>



<p>You can read Brown’s full paper at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7ACD87D8FD2237285EB667BB28DCC6E9/S1935789320002980a.pdf/public_health_lessons_learned_from_biases_in_coronavirus_mortality_overestimation.pdf" target="_blank">Cambridge University Press</a>. It succinctly dismisses the notion that the <a href="https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/resist-the-corona-craze/" data-type="post" data-id="405">corona craze</a> has anything to do with welfare of the people. As Albert Camus warned: “The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of tyranny a good conscience.”</p>

    <p>Using Generators to Modernize a Geriatric Javascript API for <code>$CURRENT_YEAR</code></p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<hr>
<p>How do you find-and-replace text on an HTML page?</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;div&gt;</span><span>Hello, </span><span>&lt;span&gt;</span><span>human</span><span>&lt;/span&gt;</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>If the text is neatly neatly isolated inside an HTML element, it's easy; this will do:</p>
<pre><code><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"span"</span><span>)</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>"evolved ape"</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>But here's a puzzle</strong>: how do you you change text that <em>isn't</em> neatly isolated in an HTML element?</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> use <code>innerHTML</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>elt </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>elt</span><span>.innerHTML </span><span>= </span><span>elt</span><span>.innerHTML.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>...but this will hose any event listeners registered on <code>elt</code>'s children.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> grapple onto the nearest selectable element:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>node </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>)</span><span>.childNodes[</span><span>0</span><span>];
</span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yuck; this sort of child-node indexing feels <em>really</em> brittle.</p>
<p><strong>Why can't we just <em>directly</em> select the text nodes containing <code>Hello</code>?</strong></p>
<h2 id="xpath">XPath</h2>
<p><strong>We can!</strong> Enter: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a>, the <em>excessively</em> powerful language for querying XML documents. It's usable in web-browsers with the, uh, <em>descriptively</em>-named method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate"><code>document.evaluate</code></a>.</p>
<p>It's a <em>bit</em> of a production to use:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>xpath </span><span>= </span><span>"//text()[contains(., 'Hello')]"</span><span>; </span><span>// find text nodes containing 'Hello'
</span><span>let </span><span>context </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.body; </span><span>// look in the body element
</span><span>let </span><span>namespace_resolver </span><span>= </span><span>null</span><span>; </span><span>// some sorta xml voodoo
</span><span>let </span><span>result_type </span><span>= </span><span>XPathResult</span><span>.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE; </span><span>// DEFINITELY MAKE SURE YOU USE THIS

</span><span>let </span><span>results </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>, </span><span>context</span><span>, </span><span>null</span><span>, </span><span>result_type</span><span>)</span><span>;

</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>i </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>i </span><span>&lt; </span><span>results</span><span>.snapshotLength; </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>) {
  </span><span>let </span><span>node </span><span>= </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>snapshotItem</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>;
  </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, you really need to write <em>all</em> of that. The <code>result_type</code> argument is technically optional, but omit it at your own peril: without it, you must instead stream results via <code>iterateNext</code>, and this will crash with an exception if you dare <em>modify</em> the queried elements!</p>
<p>It's no wonder <code>document.evaluate</code> is seldom used. <strong>Can we improve on it?</strong></p>
<h2 id="iterizing-xpath-queries">Iterizing XPath Queries</h2>
<p>Yes, with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators"><strong>generators</strong></a>! We can exploit the implicit iterability of generators to modernize this unwieldy API:</p>
<pre><code><span>Document</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>.xpath </span><span>= </span><span>Element</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>.</span><span>xpath </span><span>=
  </span><span>function* </span><span>xpath</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>) {
    </span><span>let </span><span>context </span><span>= </span><span>this </span><span>instanceof </span><span>Document </span><span>? </span><span>document</span><span>.documentElement </span><span>: </span><span>this</span><span>;
    </span><span>let </span><span>namespace_resolver </span><span>= </span><span>null</span><span>;
    </span><span>let </span><span>result_type </span><span>= </span><span>XPathResult</span><span>.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE;
    </span><span>let </span><span>results </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>, </span><span>context</span><span>, </span><span>null</span><span>, </span><span>result_type</span><span>)</span><span>;

    </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>i </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>i </span><span>&lt; </span><span>results</span><span>.snapshotLength; </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)
      </span><span>yield </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>snapshotItem</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>;
  };
</span></code></pre>
<p>And because the result of this function is iterable, we can use it with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">spread syntax</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>[</span><span>...</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>xpath</span><span>(</span><span>"//text()[contains(., 'Hello')]"</span><span>)</span><span>].
  </span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>node </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>))</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>

    <div>
        

<p>I was nearing the last working days of the job that I recently quit, I thought whether I should leave Bangalore. It was a good idea to start reducing the amount of stuff I owned if I planned to leave. I wasn’t very sure though. It made sense to downsize anyway.</p>

<p>So, I started taking photos of things I wouldn’t need and put them up on OLX. I knew I had a lot of junk, but when I started digging stuff out of boxes lying around I realized it was more than I had thought. I had two football pumps for instance! Badminton and squash rackets I hadn’t used in more than a year. As I had been more focused on outdoor activities like hiking and cycling, I didn’t think twice about letting go of stuff I hadn’t used in a while.</p>

<h2 id="limits">Limits!</h2>

<p>Once a few products sold, I got more confident about selling more, but then came an unexpected revelation. OLX has limits on how many ads one can put up for each category, and one has to wait up to 60 days or pay up to post more ads.</p>

<p>This was a major roadblock because I wanted to get rid of all the unused stuff in one go. That’s because selling used stuff is distracting and time-consuming. It’s like an unpredictable day job. Buyers might message or call you unexpectedly, ask a bunch of questions and eventually never turn up to make the deal. You can’t really focus on other work if you’re selling more than a few items.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-find">A new find!</h2>

<p>So while I was exploring alternatives to Olx, I stumbled upon Facebook Marketplace! I haven’t been actively using Facebook for the last few years and didn’t plan to change that. But Facebook Marketplace is an amazing piece of software, especially for selling used products.</p>

<p>Facebook Marketplace is better because,</p>

<ol>
<li>There are no limits to how many products you can list.</li>
<li>The pool of potential buyers is bigger</li>
<li>Your communications with sellers are better organized, you can see all your conversations grouped by each item.</li>
</ol>

<p>And of course, no product is perfect, Facebook Marketplace has a few downsides too.</p>

<ol>
<li>You might find people making unreasonable requests. People asked me to ship to another city and expected cash on delivery, for an item I was selling for ₹200. The cheapest courier service would cost at least the same amount. This never happened on OLX.</li>
<li>I feel that there are more non-serious buyers on FB because people go to OLX with a clear intent of buying.</li>
<li>Facebook can be very distracting. I don’t particularly enjoy using Facebook, and because it’s all in one place and it’s easy to get distracted on Facebook</li>
<li>People might ridicule you for selling low-value items. I either ignore such people or tell them, “everything sells.” 😊</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have a lot of items to sell, say more than 10, try to list on both Facebook Marketplace as well as OLX. Prefer OLX if you are selling fewer and high-value items.</p>

<p>Great, I had a new place to sell which doesn’t have a limit on listing count. But what I thought would be a few days of work, became a shitty day job. So I tried selling faster.</p>

<h2 id="selling-faster">Selling Faster</h2>

<p>I figured out that people bought a product very quickly if you offered them door delivery. Humans are lazy. Some deliveries were made by me on my bicycle or on a two-wheeler on my way to a friend’s place and some via apps like Dunzo or Porter. All except one delivery went smoothly.</p>

<p>Another strategy that works well is pitting buyers against each other by just letting them know that you have another buyer making an offer. This is especially useful when some buyers become inactive after making an offer.</p>

<p>I am not proud to be mentioning this, but I lied to some inactive buyers by asking them if they were still interested and I was checking with them before I made a deal with another buyer because they were the first ones to reach out. I did this to sell a product that had seen some activity but no buyer actually took the final step.</p>

<p>Things sell faster if you have all the accessories, the original packaging, and the invoice. So don’t throw away the packaging and invoice when you buy a used or a new item. It also helps if your item belongs to a well-known brand. It’s also a good idea to add product details, search the product on Amazon and Google to find out the details of the product. For instance, I sold a Dell laptop adapter and it helped to figure out which laptops that charger was compatible with.</p>

<h2 id="negotiation">Negotiation</h2>

<p>While taking good photos, writing a concise description, and setting an expected price are almost necessary to make a sale, negotiation is what you will spend most of your time on. So I think it’s important to negotiate fast and well.</p>

<p>Here are some tactics I employed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don’t reveal your “last” price, unless you’re in a hurry and you think the buyer is not a haggler. You’ve already mentioned a price in the listing, so if a buyer asks you for a price just repeat that. If they still insist, ask them to make an offer. Once they choose a number they can’t go below that price.</li>
<li>In some cases, if a buyer is in a hurry they will easily agree to your price. Give them a number and don’t respond for some time if they keep low-balling. Some buyers might automatically increase their offers. In one case a buyer agreed to my price within a few minutes of silence from my side.</li>
<li>Some buyers will point out flaws or missing accessories for your item. It’s pretty easy to say that you would have listed at a higher price if your item didn’t have those flaws.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="everything-sells">Everything sells</h2>

<p>Well almost. As I sold more and more stuff I thought of trying to sell stuff that I didn’t even think could even sell. More for the experimentation than the money. USB charging adapters, for instance. I think they are all the same except in terms of wattage. But not everyone thinks like me. An original 5W Apple iPod USB adapter is probably more valuable on the market than a 20W fast charger one from almost any other brand. I sold one for ₹500! One the other hand got laughed at for even thinking of listing a Xiaomi USB adapter.</p>

<h2 id="scams-and-surprises">Scams and Surprises</h2>

<p>Selling online comes with its own risks, especially in India. The most common scam I encountered was people accepting your listed price and agreeing to pay advance. What they do is send you a QR code which is actually a payment request and make it seem like a request which will credit money to your account. And usually, these people respond very quickly and almost never negotiate.</p>

<p>Amidst all of this, I was surprised when a buyer actually paid money in advance. I was so surprised and skeptical that I asked him how he trusted me and sent the money before actually getting the items. I could have refused to send him the products and blocked his number. Of course, I didn’t. And the sale happened smoothly except for a botch-up by the delivery truck driver who extracted money from both of us. I later got the issue resolved by the delivery service provider, namely Porter.</p>

<p>I also managed to sell an item to a buyer in another city. I asked a friend who has an online store if I could use her delivery partner to ship the item. She graciously agreed and it was only ₹155 to ship a 1kg package from Bangalore to Kochi. And the package was picked up from my doorstep. I later found out that one doesn’t need to have a business account to use Delhivery Direct’s service. Neat, eh?</p>

<h2 id="taking-a-step-back">Taking a step back</h2>

<p>In conclusion, selling your old junk on OLX and Facebook Marketplace is a great way to declutter and generate some extra cash. But it can take over your life and become akin to a day job. I have sold 24 items so far and still have 15 unsold items listed, but I have disabled notifications for both OLX and Facebook Marketplace and I check notifications only once a day or so to keep my sanity.</p>

<p>If you are curious about what I sold and for how much, I am attaching a table here for your reference. By the way, I lied! ₹14,000 out of the total ₹30,000 I got by selling old junk went to my friends whose items I sold on their behalf.</p>

				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>I’m just going to keep saying. And saying it. Because it is dangerous not to. The US is at herd immunity levels in many states. Everyone should therefore be MORE careful, wear masks, be a bit happy that the end is in sight but be really careful. Schools should NOT reopen at all, but especially in states like the Dakotas and Michigan and Western PA- you are about to see cases go up like wildfire. </p>



<p>Ok so here I present another analysis pointing towards herd immunity and address the two major criticisms of saying we have herd immunity 1. that the drop in cases is because states are being more careful and 2. that masks do work (spoiler- they do work but that can be included in the model). </p>



<p>First- the states that have the most total infections are now all decreasing while states with less infections are increasing. This means that they are going in the opposite direction you would expect if no herd immunity was happening. See below: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="395" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/two-map-comp-1024x395.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/two-map-comp-1024x395.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/two-map-comp-300x116.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/two-map-comp-768x297.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/two-map-comp-1536x593.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/two-map-comp-1200x463.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/two-map-comp-1400x541.png 1400w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/two-map-comp-960x371.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/two-map-comp.png 1598w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>What’s green in the right map (decreasing daily new cases) is most red in the left map (highest percent of state infected). Also note, those green states are a lot of the states that were most vehemently opposed to masks and lockdown- places like Florida and Louisiana. </p>



<p>I more formally address this below. States with decreasing cases have on average ~6.5% more total infections than states that are increasing. The p-value from a simple two group t-test is p=0.0003. P-values&lt;0.05 are significant- making this highly statistically significant. </p>

First of all, does that sound right to you? With schools opening? In case that’s not convincing, here are some data present by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew2MEF4XX8w">Dr. Trevor Bedford at UCSF hospital grand rounds</a>. This graph appears at minute 44 of that presentation. On the left is Open Table data (people going to restaurants) and Google Retail Mobility (shopping) trends. You can see that with reopening in Early May, Arizona and Florida have 60% more restaurant reservations and 30% more shopping. New York starts reopening in June and the restaurant and shopping trends also go up albeit with a delay from AZ and FL. Then AZ and FL sky rocket in cases but New York remains at exactly the same flat level.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="652" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google--1024x652.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google--1024x652.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google--300x191.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google--768x489.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google--1536x979.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google--1200x764.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google--942x600.png 942w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google--960x612.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google--1884x1200.png 1884w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/open-table-and-google-.png 2028w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>I think this pretty adequately says two things: 1. AZ and FL were not super careful at least in mobility upon reopening and 2. New York has almost gotten to be as mobile as AZ and FL and yet did not spike. Together I can think of no other reason than herd immunity for this.</p>



<p>This does NOT mean that masks and distancing are not helpful- they are! Here is the another slide from Dr. Bedford, showing that RT depends on societal behavior. So as people wear more masks, don’t open schools, and distance the level to reach herd immunity drops- the effective RT.</p>

        <div>
<p>To solve Jigsaw Puzzles using <a href="https://iq.opengenus.org/tag/machine-learning/">Machine Learning</a>, we have explored the paper "<strong>Unsupervised Learning of Visual Representations by Solving Jigsaw Puzzles</strong>". The paper describes a convolutional neural network (CNN) that aims to solve a pretext task, solving Jigsaw puzzles without manual labelling, and then to solve object classification and detection tasks.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.opengenus.org/content/images/2020/07/Jigsaw-puzzles.png" alt="Jigsaw-puzzles"></p>
<p>The research in the paper has been done by Mehdi Noroozi and Paolo Favaro from University of Bern, Switzerland.</p>
<p>This paper introduces a new self-supervised task, the Jigsaw reassembly problem, which performs well when transferred to detection and classification tasks. The goal of training a computer to solve Jigsaw puzzles is to teach it that an object is composed of several parts and for the computer to identify what these parts are. The benefits of this method are the short amount of taken (2.5 days compared to 4 weeks in the task proposed by Doersch et al.). Chromatic aberration  does not have to be handled and there is no need to build robustness to pixelation. The features are highly transferable and is currently the top performer for an unsupervised method.</p>
<p>This work is classified as representation/feature learning, an unsupervised learning problem that tries to build intermediate representations of data so as to solve machine learning tasks. It is also an example of transfer learning, as the skills learned by the system in solving the Jigsaw puzzle can be applied to object classification and detection.</p>
<p>This model includes pre-training and fine-tuning. The feature learning obtained with the Jigsaw puzzle solver is the pre-training and fine-tuning involves updating  weights obtained during pre-training to solve other tasks.</p>

<p>This model highlights the use of a self-supervised training model as an improvement on a typical unsupervised learning method. While historically, labelled data have been used to train a parametric model, unsupervised learning methods are now gaining momentum as they do not require manually labelled data and are hence less costly. Instead, self-supervised learning exploits different labels that are freely available alongside visual data and they are used as intrinsic reward signals for learning general-purpose features.</p>
<p>This led to three different methods of unsupervised learning. Two of them exploit multiple images with a temporal or viewpoint transformation by using object correspondence obtained through tracking in videos (Wang and Gupta), and ego-motion information obtained by a mobile agent such as the Google car (Agrawal et al.) respectively. While biological agents may employ these methods and integrate further additional sensory motion, single snapshots can carry more information. The third uses the relative spatial co-location of patches in images as a label and  only uses single images as the training set (Doersch et al.).</p>
<p>The Jigsaw puzzle method observes all the tiles simultaneously, allowing the trained network to insect all ambiguity sets and hopefully reduce it to a singleton. It ignores low-level similarities between tiles such as colour or texture when they do not help localise parts, but focuses on their differences instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.opengenus.org/content/images/2020/07/Ignoring-low-level-statistics.png" alt="Ignoring-low-level-statistics"></p>
<p>This CFN shows that it is possible for self-supervising learning to match the performance of supervised learning, which can cut costs by abolishing the need for costly human annotation.</p>

<p>The model uses a context-free network, where data flow of each patch is explicitly separated until the fully connected layer, which is the only layer where context is handled. Compared to AlexNet, the CFN is used despite having a 0.3% olower accuracy (The CFN yields 57.1% top-1 accuracy compared with 57.4% for AlexNet), because it is significantly more compact, using 27.5M parameters compared to AlexNet's 61M.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.opengenus.org/content/images/2020/07/CFN.png" alt="CFN"></p>
<p>To solve the task, a set of Jigsaw puzzle permutations are defined and each entry is assigned an index. One permutation is randomly picked, 9 input patches are rearranged according to that permutation, and the CFN aims to return a vector with the probability value for each index. This output can be considered as the conditional probability density function of the spatial arrangement of object parts, which can be represented as follows.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.opengenus.org/content/images/2020/07/conditional-pdf-2.png" alt="conditional-pdf-2"></p>
<p>The CFN was implemented by using stochastic gradient descent without batch normalisation on one Titan X GPU. For transfer learning, learned features were used as pre-trained weights for classification, detection and semantic segmentation tasks. A new benchmark was also developed to evaluate the method for machine learning.</p>

<p>General shortcut issues refer to the development of the learning system to solve the pre-text task, being the Jigsaw puzzle, instead of the target tasks of object classification, detection and segmentation.</p>

<p>For one, the CFN may accidentally learn to associate features with absolute positions if only 1 Jigsaw puzzle is generated per image. The following equation illustrates how the conditional pdf can be factorised into independent terms by writing the configuration S as a list of tile positions.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.opengenus.org/content/images/2020/07/Feature-position-link-1.png" alt="Feature-position-link-1"></p>
<p>This shortcut can be avoided by feeding the CFN multiple Jigsaw puzzles of the same image, making sure that tiles are shuffled as much as possible and have adequately large average Hamming distance, ensuring that the same tile can be assigned to multiple positions within the grid and avoiding the correlation of an absolute position.</p>

<p>These can include the mean and start deviation of the pixel intensities, allowing the model to find the arrangement of the patches. Hence the mean and standard deviation is normalised for every patch.</p>

<p>Another shortcut can be the CFN learns to notice edge continuity and pixel intensity distribution. The CFN does not learn low-level statistics by mitigating this issue. This includes leaving random gaps between tiles between the size of 0 to 22 pixels by resizing input images and cropping a random region. Selecting 64x64 pixel tiles randomly from the 85x85 pixel cells allows for a 21 pixel gap between tiles.</p>

<p>A third shortcut can be due to chromatic aberration, which is a relative spacial shift between colour channels that increases from the center images to the borders, which helps the network estimate the tiles. This is resolved by cropping the central squre of the original image and resizing it, training with both colour and grayscale and jittering colour channels and using greyscale images.</p>
<p>The dataset was kept small by using Caffe (see reference 3 for details) to choose random image patches and permutations, allowing for efficient training. In more tangible figures, each image could generate 69 different puzzles on average.</p>

<p>Ablation studies were performed to examine the impact of each component training under different scenarios.</p>
<p>The permutation set had a signification impact on the ambiguity of the tasks, as closer permutations made the puzzle task more challenging and ambiguous. One criteria is cardinality, where a larger number of permutations causes the training on the Jigsaw task to become increasingly difficult, but leads to an improvement in the performance of the detection task.</p>
<p>The average Hamming distance between permutations positively correlates with the difficulty of the Jigsaw puzzle reassembly task. A higher average Hamming distance leads to less Jigsaw puzzle solving error and lower object detection errors when fine tuning is used for transfer learning. The permutation set is generated iteratively with a greedy algorithm.</p>
<p>The minimum Hamming distance is increased by removing similar permutations in a maximal set with 100 initial entries, as the minimum distance makes the task less ambiguous.</p>
<p>Overall, the best performing permutation set is a trade off between the number of permutations and their dissimilarity from each other, which leads to the conclusion that a good self-supervised task is neither simple nor ambiguous.</p>

<p>The units at each layer of this CFN can be considered object part detectors. By dissecting the CFN into its layers and by evaluating the features qualitatively with a simple image ranking, the top activations of the layers trained in the CFN can be visualised.</p>
<p>The below figure shows how the conv1 and conv2 layers specialise in texture, the conv3 specialises in face and part detectors, conv4 includes a larger number of part detectors and the fifth layer can detect parts and scenes.<br>

    <h3>Finding vulnerable Twitter accounts with expired domains</h3>
    <p>August 23, 2020</p>
    <p>Recently, I discovered a simple yet suprisingly effective attack vector against Twitter accounts (and which likely applies to other platforms as well). This attack vector makes it easy to find and hack vulnerable accounts with login emails that are using expired domains. If a user creates a Twitter account with an email on their own domain, then forgets to renew their domain at some point, that account can be hijacked by registering the domain, forwarding all emails to your email, then submitting a password reset on that account. By itself, this is hardly an attack vector since finding such vulnerable accounts is the more important part, and we already know that owning someone's email is essentially a "game over" situation. This attack becomes more dangerous when you can combine it with an efficient method to find these vulnerable accounts quickly and at scale. As it turns out, this is trivial on Twitter for several reasons attributable to their platform design.</p>
    <p>If you're familiar with Twitter, you know that users are given the option to add a public website url. With a simple script and proxy, an attacker can quickly iterate over millions of accounts and check if the domain in that url is not registered; this usually indicates some likelihood that the Twitter account was created with an email address on a now-expired domain. To verify this, they can submit a password reset which will show them a censored version of the account email address for confirmation; however, even though it's censored, it still provides enough information to check if the email domain matches the expired domain listed on their account profile. If it does, the attacker now knows this is an account that can be hacked. Once this entire process is automated, it makes finding these accounts very easy. This method of account hijacking is very likely being used right now by malicious hackers, and I believe it accounts for a large portion of stolen accounts/handles on the platform.</p>
    <img src="https://zainamro.com/assets/img/twitter-emails.png">
    <p>This attack can potentially be executed on other platforms besides Twitter, assuming one can find a similar discovery method. In Twitter's case, they could make it harder to discover these accounts by not showing any email confirmation upon requesting a password reset. This would make the process more costly for attackers who would no longer be able to verify whether an account can be hacked prior to registering the domain. Or perhaps, Twitter should monitor and unlist domains that are no longer registered and notify users when this happens so that they're aware. As for most users, in addition to turning on 2FA, it's important to be very cautious when using an email on your own domain to create accounts; it makes it much easier to lose access if you forget to renew or can't under certain extreme circumstances like incarceration or death.</p>

          <div><blockquote><span>A refined knowledge of several languages provides a reservoir of meanings and enhances a person's ability to apprehend and express the plurality of the world. 
— </span> <em>David le Breton</em> <span> ﻿</span></blockquote></div>  <p><span>Over the years, I have learned 9 languages. For different reasons. And at various levels of proficiency.</span></p> <p><span>With the increasingly effectiveness of machine translation that gets us answers in real-time, learning a language becomes less about the functional necessity.  </span></p> <p><span>This article explores the ways in which learning languages is valuable, beyond its immediate utility. </span></p>  <p><h2><span>Sensing More Dimensions of Reality</span></h2></p> <p><span>The quote by David le Breton at the beginning of this post puts it more eloquently than I can. </span></p> <p><span>There are so many possible dimensions of reality. Each language is a system of filters that captures the multitude of sensations and meanings in its own way. </span></p> <p><span>Having more of these filters in your tool-kit is advantageous for parsing the world. It helps you better explain and enjoy it. </span></p>  <p><h2><span>Surface Area of Appreciation</span></h2></p> <p><span>Translation attemps to map the experience in one culture to an analogous experience in a different culture.</span></p> <p><span>But emotions and feelings are hard to capture. And some sensations are just uniquely expressed in a specific language. Definitions in a dictionary are not helpful in this case.</span></p> <p><span>You may be able to appreciate the melodic phrases and the percussion of words when listening to poetry / rap music in a foreign language. But you miss out on the cleverness, technical wizardry, and layers of references.</span></p> <p><span>Watching the works of the comedic master </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Chow" target="_blank"><span>Stephen Chow</span></a> <span> without knowing Cantonese is as good as pinching your nose when eating a delicious meal.</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Deeper Connections with People</span></h2></p> <p><span>As you learn a language, you naturally develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for others' cultures.</span></p> <p><span>Ever experienced the moments of delight with a person from another culture when you show understanding of an obscure cultural reference? The surprised look on their face and the engaging conversation that ensues are just priceless. </span></p> <p><span>It immediately draws you closer to each other. It is a genuine way of saying </span> <em>"I hear you."</em> <span> ﻿</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Found in Translation</span></h2></p> <p><span>Learning a language helps you not just understand the target language / culture itself, but more broadly about the human condition. </span></p>  <p><span>Another example would be the </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_Motion" target="_blank"><span>Structure from Motion</span></a> <span> technique in computer vision, where moving the position of a 2D camera helps us estimate 3D structures in the images captured.</span></p> <p><span>Learning languages is a reliable way to acquire these lenses, and a more flexible mind.</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Travelling Becomes More Fun</span></h2></p> <p><span>This is perhaps obvious. But even though Google Translate has become very convenient, it is nice not having to look at my phone the whole time when I travel.</span></p> <p><span>Knowing the local language is helpful for navigating and avoiding tourist traps. But more importantly, it expands what you are capable of noticing. It unlocks layers of experience that are otherwise hidden from you.</span></p> <p><span>It shifts your attention from the the surface-level appreciation of sights and occasional signs you understand, to understanding the messaging of various displays and eavesdropping on the locals in addition to people-watching.</span></p> <p><span>Oh, and you often get special treatment speaking the local language :)  </span></p>  <p><h2><span>Learning Languages Itself Becomes Easier</span></h2></p> <p><span>The more languages you already know, the easier it is for you to pick up a new one. It is perhaps the biggest factor in estimating </span> <a href="https://knowledgeartist.org/articles/1021e2dc-845a-494f-b598-def49c37234e/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-a-language" target="_blank"><span>how long it takes to learn a language</span></a> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>This advantage can be direct: in learning a new language with cognates (words with a shared origin) and similar language structures. For instance, roughly 60% of Korean words have a Chinese origin. Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese are almost mutually intelligible. And the indirect effects include having a more flexible mind and getting better at adapting to new patterns of thoughts.  </span></p>  <p><span>Knowing multiple languages is advantageous. The learning process is in most cases a fun and expansive journey.
 Even as technology advances and real-time machine translation becomes viable, it remains one of the most reliable means to enrich one's life.</span></p> <p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wizard-circle-150x150.png" alt="When it comes to logs and time series, there is no magic" width="150" height="150">If you work in the logging, monitoring — or even <a href="https://docs.honeycomb.io/learning-about-observability/intro-to-observability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observability</a> — space long enough, you eventually end up on team that tries to build a system that handles both logs and time series in a high-performant <strong>and</strong> cost-efficient manner.</p>
<p>Well, it’s a lot harder than it sounds — because l<em>ogs and time-series are not the same</em>.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to many — one is text, and one is numbers. Then why I have been involved with multiple attempts to store the same types of data in a single system? And why has every one of those systems ended with up two distinct storage technologies under the covers?</p>
<p>I think it’s worth taking a step back and looking at why logs and time series are so different.</p>
<h3>Log data</h3>
<p>Log data is often much richer than time series. It can be both structured and unstructured, usually employing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-text search</a> technologies. This means <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inverted-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inverted indexes</a>, rich query languages, and large data storage overheads. And the tolerance for data loss is very low – a single log message could be critical to understanding what has happened to a system:<code></code></p>
<pre><code>May  5 17:01:43 owl sshd[9024]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)</code><code></code></pre>
<p>The kind of queries one runs on a log system are also characteristic. They are usually “needle in a haystack” queries, where one is attempting to find a single event.</p>
<h3>Time series</h3>
<p>Compare this to time series data.</p>
<p>It always has some sort of structure, and that structure is usually pretty simple. It’s tolerant of data loss — lose some data and you’ll probably still understand what is happening with your system. Time series can be down-sampled too, but compelling cases for down sampling log data are not as obvious. Time series data can also compressed really effectively, without any loss of information. Techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run-length encoding</a> and delta compression (and even <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delta-delta compression</a>) work very well.</p>
<p>Finally — and this key — one is almost never interested in a single data point. One almost always runs range-queries over time series data, which are often transformed via aggregations, averages, and other mathematical operations.</p>
<h3>Time series are pointers, but logs tell you what happened</h3>
<p><a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Minkowski/"><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/minkowski-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a>Both types of data are critical to running modern computer infrastructure. I used to wonder, half-jokingly, if logs and time series were like Space and Time — different sides of the same underlying thing known as <a href="https://einstein.stanford.edu/SPACETIME/spacetime2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spacetime</a>.</p>
<p>But I’ve decided they are fundamentally different, and this is reflected clearly in the different technologies, systems, and products used to process each.</p>
<p>Now this doesn’t mean a <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/saas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SaaS</em></a> can’t be built that does a great job working with both types of data. But if someone tells you their <strong>database</strong> supports both cases really well, be sceptical.</p>
<p>Because there is no <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Minkowski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikowski</a> for logs and time series, and when it comes to processing this data, <em>there is no magic</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>3</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>In Germany, an economic experiment has been launched in recent days, which seeks to examine the success or failure of universal basic income, and the consequences to the lives of those who will unconditionally receive about €1,200 per month for three years.</p>
<p>While previous experiments in Finland and Switzerland have focused on basic income as a form to upgrade unemployment benefits, and in Spain, it was is used to provide an additional basic income for the poorest groups in society, the experiment in Germany is, in fact, the first time the pure concept of UBI will be tested.</p>
<p>Funding for the project was achieved through an online crowdfunding campaign that asked the Germans to participate in this economic-scientific research and donate money to the experiment in order to develop a new social-economic system. Behind the campaign is an organization called “Mein Grundeinkommen” (My Basic Income), which is driven by the notion that this is the future of European welfare countries, and is the next step in the evolution of the “redistribution of wealth” already formed in Scandinavian countries. At the time of writing, about 140,000 donors have participated in the project.</p>
<p>The 120 applicants will receive about 1,200 euros a month for three years, and 1,380 people will serve as a control group. The researchers of the study will compare the experiences of 120 applicants during the period of time of three years with another group of 1,380 people who will not receive the payments. The Basic Income amount of about 1,200 euros was set by the researchers as it could theoretically replace an existing job for German citizens.</p>
<p>The only condition for participation in the project is to be a resident of Germany over the age of 18. Of course, those who receive the income will not have to change stop working and will receive the money without any conditions other than the willingness to participate in the study.</p>
<h2><em><strong>Germany’s Basic Income Experiment – Can It Work?</strong></em></h2>
<p>Germany is the perfect playground for testing <strong><a href="https://www.allinallspace.com/universal-basic-income-why-it-would-or-wouldnt-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the debate about basic income</a></strong>. More than half of Germans said they were in favor of a certain type of basic income, according to a preliminary survey conducted by the DIW Institute. Globally and domestically, the support for this view is mostly from the left side of the economic map, and also from Silicon Valley. Elon Musk, for example, has stated several times his belief in the idea of ​​universal basic income. Mark Zuckerberg has also expressed his view saying that universal basic income is a model that should be considered positively in the future when technology will replace much of the work. Even <strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/pope-francis-it-may-be-the-time-to-consider-a-universal-basic-wage.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20may%20be%20the%20time,representing%20global%20grassroots%20organizations%2C%20published" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pope Francis said that ‘This may be the time to consider a universal basic wage’</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Michael&nbsp;Bohmeyer, the head of the “Mein Grundinkommen” project, has explained that the purpose of this experiment is not only to examine the results in terms of the financial condition of the participants but also the state of the applicants’ relationship, health, and their social connections.</p>
<p>The experiment in Germany might be the most crucial one in determining whether Universal Basic Income can actually work in a developed (perhaps even more in undeveloped) country. Additionally, <strong><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-push-for-universal-basic-income-is-gaining-momentum-amid-the-pandemic-11595874035" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UBI also gained huge momentum since the emerge of the Covid-19 pandemic</a></strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Among the critics of this unique model are those who believe that it is not financially viable, and it will ultimately slow down economic growth. Moreover, it may negatively motivate work, and will also be unfair to the wealthy sections of the population who will have to finance basic income taxation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the UBI experiment in Germany will be closely watched to see if it may have a positive impact following the unsuccessful experiments conducted in Finland and Switzerland. One thing is certain, the basic income debate is here to stay.</p>

August 23, 2020 | https://notes.eatonphil.com/writing-a-simple-python-compiler.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://notes.eatonphil.com/writing-a-simple-python-compiler.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll write a Python to C compiler in Python. This is
especially easy to do since Python has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">builtin parser
library</a> and because a
number of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/">CPython internals are exposed for extension
writers</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, in a few hundred lines of Python, we'll be able to
compile and run the following program:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/recursive_fib.py
def fib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)


def main():
    print(fib(40))
$ python3 pyc tests/recursive_fib.py
$ ./bin/a.out
102334155
</code></pre>
<p>This post implements an extremely small subset of Python and
<strong>completely gives up on even trying to manage memory</strong> because I
cannot fathom manual reference counting. Maybe some day I'll find a
way to swap in an easy GC like Boehm.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/pyc">Source code for this project is available on Github.</a></p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3><p>We'll need Python3, GCC, libpython3, and clang-format.</p>
<p>On Fedora-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dnf install gcc python3-devel clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>And on Debian-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install gcc python3-dev clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>
  This program will likely work as well on Windows, Mac, FreeBSD,
  etc. but I haven't gone through the trouble of testing this (or
  providing custom compiler directives). Pull requests welcome!
</p><h3 id="a-hand-written-first-pass">A hand-written first-pass</h3><p>Before we get into the compiler, let's write the fibonacci program by
hand in C using libpython.</p>
<p>As described in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#very-high-level-embedding">Python embedding
guide</a>
we'll need to include libpython and initialize it in
our <code>main.c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To compile against libpython, we'll use
<a href="https://helpmanual.io/man1/python3-config/">python3-config</a> installed
as part of <code>python3-devel</code> to tell us what should be linked
at each step during compilation.</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
0
</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Now as we think about translating the fibonacci implementation,
we want to keep everything as Python objects for as long as
possible. This means passing and receiving
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html">PyObject*</a> to and from
all functions, and converting all C integers to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html">PyLong*</a>, a "subtype" of
<code>PyObject*</code>. You can imagine that everything in Python is
an <code>object</code> until you operate on it.</p>
<p>
  For more information on objects in Python, check out
  the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">Data
  model</a> page in Python docs.
</p><p>To map a C integer to a <code>PyLong*</code> we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_FromLong">PyLong_FromLong</a>. To
map in reverse, we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_AsLong">PyLong_AsLong</a>.</p>
<p>To compare two <code>PyObject*</code>s we can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html#c.PyObject_RichCompareBool">PyObject_RichCompareBool</a>
which will handle the comparison regardless of the type of the two
parameters. Without this helper we'd have to write complex checks to
make sure that the two sides are the same and if they are, unwrap them
into their underlying C value and compare the C value.</p>
<p>We can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Add">PyNumber_Add</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Subtract">PyNumber_Subtract</a>
for basic arithmetic, and there are many similar helpers available to
us for operations down the line.</p>
<p>Now we can write a translation:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

PyObject* fib(PyObject* n) {
  PyObject* zero = PyLong_FromLong(0);
  PyObject* one = PyLong_FromLong(1);
  if (PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, zero, Py_EQ) || PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, one, Py_EQ)) {
    return n;
  }

  PyObject* left = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, one));

  PyObject* two = PyLong_FromLong(2);
  PyObject* right = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, two));

  return PyNumber_Add(left, right);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  PyObject* res = fib(PyLong_FromLong(7)); // Should be 13

  return PyLong_AsLong(res);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
13
</code></pre>
<p>That's great! But we cheated in one place. We assumed that the input
to the <code>fib</code> function was an integer, and we propagated
that assumption everywhere we wrote <code>PyNumber_*</code>
operations. When we write the compiler, we'll need to check that both
arguments are an integer before we call a numeric helper, otherwise we
may need to call a string concatenation helper or something else
entirely.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-architecture">Compiler Architecture</h3><p>We'll break the code into four major parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>libpyc.c</code>: helper functions for generated code</li>
<li><code>pyc/context.py</code>: utilities for scope and writing code in memory</li>
<li><code>pyc/codegen.py</code>: for generating C code from a Python AST</li>
<li><code>pyc/__main__.py</code>: the entrypoint</li>
</ol>
<p>
  When I'm writing a new compiler using an existing parser I almost
  always start with the entrypoint and code generator so I can explore
  the AST. However, it's easiest to explain the code if we start with
  the utilities first.
</p><p>We'll also want an empty <code>pyc/__init__.py</code>.</p>
<h3 id="libpyc.c">libpyc.c</h3><p>This C file will contain three helper functions for safely adding,
subtracting, and printing. It will be concatenated to the top of the
generated C file. We'll only support integers for now but this
structure sets us up for supporting more types later on.</p>
<p>We'll use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_Check">PyLong_Check</a>
before calling number-specific methods.</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

inline PyObject* PYC_Add(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {
  // TODO: allow __add__ override

  // Includes ints and bools

    return PyNumber_Add(l, r);
  }

  // TODO: handle str, etc.

  // TODO: throw exception
  return NULL;
}

inline PyObject* PYC_Sub(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {

<p>That's it! We could generate these as strings in Python but it gets
hairy to do so. By using a dedicated C file, we can take advantage of
syntax highlighting since this file is only C code. And since we've
marked all functions as <code>inline</code>, there's no runtime cost
to using not embedding these as strings in Python.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/context.py">pyc/context.py</h3><p>This file will contain a <code>Context</code> class for managing
identifiers in scope and for proxying to a <code>Writer</code> class
that contains helpers for writing lines of C code.</p>
<p>We'll have two instances of the <code>Writer</code> class in
<code>Context</code> so that we can write to a body (or
current/primary) region and an initialization region.</p>
<p>The initialization region is necessary in case there are any variables
declared at the top-level. We can't initialize these variables in C
outside of a function since every <code>PyObject*</code> must be
created after calling <code>Py_Initialize</code>. This section will be
written into our C <code>main</code> function before we enter a
compiled Python <code>main</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>import copy


class Writer():
    content = ""

    def write(self, exp: str, indent: int = 0):
        self.content += ("  " * indent) + exp

</code></pre>
<p>This is all pretty boring boilerplate. Let's move on.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py">pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py</h3><p>The entrypoint is responsible for reading source code, parsing it,
calling the code generator, writing the source code to a C file, and
compiling it.</p>
<p>First, we read and parse the source code:</p>
<pre><code>import ast
import os
import subprocess
import shutil
import sys

from context import Context
from codegen import generate

BUILTINS = {
    "print": "PYC_Print",
}


def main():
    target = sys.argv[1]
    with open(target) as f:
        source = f.read()
    tree = ast.parse(source, target)
</code></pre>
<p>Then we write <code>libpyc.c</code> into the body, register builtins,
and run code generation:</p>
<pre><code>
...

def main()
    ...

    ctx = Context()
    with open("libpyc.c") as f:
        ctx.body_write(f.read() + "\n")

    for builtin, fn in BUILTINS.items():
        ctx.register_global(builtin, fn)

    generate(ctx, tree)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create a clean output directory and write
<code>main.c</code> with the generated code and a <code>main</code>
function to initialization Python and any global variables:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
   ...

    # Create and move to working directory
    outdir = "bin"
    shutil.rmtree(outdir, ignore_errors=True)
    os.mkdir(outdir)
    os.chdir(outdir)

    with open("main.c", "w") as f:
        f.write(ctx.body.content)

        main = ctx.namings.get("main")["name"]
        f.write(f"""int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {{
  Py_Initialize();

  // Initialize globals, if any.
{ctx.initializations.content}
  PyObject* r = {main}();
  return PyLong_AsLong(r);
}}""")
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we run <code>clang-format</code> and <code>gcc</code> against
the generated C code:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
    ...

    subprocess.run(["clang-format", "-i", "main.c"])

    cflags_raw = …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>Avoid Zoom</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_overview">Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>Even before the Coronavirus pandemic, which has made video conferencing tools all the more
important, Zoom was a rising star in the field. Zoom provided solutions for common collaboration
problems with a lot of useful features, including surprisingly good video and audio despite multiple
attendees having various levels of bandwidth in the conversation. Previously, we were limited to
Google Meet, Slack Video, Webex, GoToMeeting, etc., all of which were various aspects of awful, and
having Zoom on the scene showed promise of a better experience.</p>
<p>By early 2019, though, reports emerged of disturbing conduct by Zoom as a company, casting doubt on
the integrity of their software offering as a whole. By mid-2019, these disturbances were exposed as
shocking displays of neglect and disregard for customer security — to a point where Apple had to
patch macOS due to shady code installed by the Zoom installer. Around this time, I choose to avoid
Zoom and removed it from the <a href="https://www.alchemists.io/projects/mac_os-config">macOS Configuration</a> project. I’ve not
gone back, despite the ubiquity of platform in the time of Coronavirus.</p>
<p>Perhaps the long tail of a company’s trajectory and practices is often forgotten in an age when we
are constantly bombarded with information, but this article is meant to put Zoom’s historic
misconduct back into perspective and explain why I think more people should be avoiding the platform
all together.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_evidence">Evidence</h2>
<div>
<p>The following spans many month’s worth of articles I’ve collected about Zoom’s disturbing track
record. While mostly listed in chronological order, you’ll want to read through each of these to
paint the picture of Zoom’s past behavior and what that’s exposed about their underlying ethics.
<em>Spoiler Alert</em>: Zoom hasn’t substantially improved since these issues arose and I don’t expect
their tactics to change anytime soon.</p>

<p>From numerous security vulnerabilities to complying with the Chinese authoritarian regime, the
severity of these issues should at least tempt you to avoid using Zoom — especially in regards to
aiding China, which is exacting
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_genocide_of_Uyghurs">cultural genocide of the Uyghurs</a>.
I’ve been to Xinjiang, met the Uyghurs, eaten with them, browsed through their bizaars, etc. They
don’t deserve this kind of treatment and we can do our part by not funding companies that diminish
their value.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, I find Zoom’s lack of regard for the people they are helping to
communicate more effectively very disconcerting. Video conferencing is particularly sensitive in
nature and I would think that customer security would be a top priority in Zoom’s software offering.
Instead, Zoom is prioritizing capturing the market as quickly as possible and at any cost. I
understand the need for growth but you can achieve this without sacrificing those you serve.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_tangential_concerns">Tangential Concerns</h2>
<div>
<p>If you, too, want to avoid the ethical mess that is Zoom and happen to be using Keybase, be aware
they have <a href="https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-joins-zoom">joined Zoom</a>. You’ll want to reconsider
your options in this space. I’d recommend using <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>,
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, or others.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<div>
<p>Should you be looking for alternatives to Zoom conferencing, here are a few choices that might be of
interest. I’ve not vetted all of these myself so tread with caution.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/">mmhmm</a> - A recent newcomer in this space innovating upon the standard
experience. Access is by invite only at the moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://makespace.fun/">MakeSpace</a> - Another innovative solution but has no visible product
offering I’m aware of. Worth keeping an eye on, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://tandem.chat/">Tandem</a> - Focuses on providing a quick way in which to collaborate with
others with minimal overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.around.co/">Around</a> - Early days for this company but has an interesting focus on
speakers/attendees which float around your workspace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.remotion.com/">Remotion</a> - Provides a similar experience to Around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://zipcall.io/">Zipcall</a> - Provides a decentralized peer to peer solution that is free to
use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a> - An active and open source alternative to Zoom which has been
around since 2003. Provides dial-in, recording, simulcasting, end-to-end encryption, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://jackfruit.live/">Jackfruit</a> - Similar in nature to Zipcall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://jamm.app/">Jamm</a> - Similar in nature to Around and Remotion but also has aspects of
Screenhero. If you remember Screenhero before Slack killed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://team.video/">Team Video</a> - Provides an experience focused around meetings within the
confines of their app which may or may not be what you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://screen.so/">Screen</a> - A new product/service brought to you by the same people who made
Screenhero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://tuple.app/">Tuple</a> - As the name suggests, meant for two people only. Worth pointing
out due to mentioning Screen above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_parting_thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h2>
<div>
<p>As an individual, switching to an alternative solution is fairly trivial. As a company, I realize
introducing this kind of change in the midst of a busy work schedule is not as swift an option. Even
more so with large teams. If nothing else, initiating a discussion around Zoom’s reckless disregard
for security might be enough to get the ball rolling and even lead to insights on how communication
could be improved in general.</p>
<p>I’ve managed to avoid using Zoom since removing their software offering entirely. When scheduling
meetings with others, if they try to send me a Zoom link, I’ll suggest alternatives. Unfortunately,
I have encountered some fiery pushback from some in various social channels and haven’t been able to
convince my local meetups — yet — to switch to different software. Therefore, I am no longer able
to attend these meetups until more people take a stand against Zoom’s behavior.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary with that kind of zero-tolerance approach. Still, I’d rather fight for a
future that encourages ethical behavior and prioritizes people ahead of any capitalistic gain. I
hope you agree and vote by not spending money on companies or software that promote these practices.
We <em>can</em> make a difference, little by little!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This tutorial is going to cover how to set up a temperature/humidity sensor with
a raspberry pi. You will learn how to setup the sensor, a MYSQL server, and
connect to the databse remotely in R. I will also do exploratory
data analysis in R with the stored readings. A little bit of familiarity with linux, mysql servers,
soldering skills, and R is helpful but not mandatory. The materials required
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi with standard setup (SD card, case, etc.)</li>
<li>Adafruit AM2302 (wired DHT22) temperature-humidity sensor</li>
<li>Soldering Iron</li>
<li>Female Pin Headers</li>
<li>Small piece of wood</li>

</div>
<p><em>Final Product</em></p>
<p>I mostly followed the tutorial found <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Temperature-Humidity-Network-Monitor/">here</a>.
The majority of the work in this post is not using R. Instead of rebuilding
everything, I wanted to build off of content that has made and sensor readings
are handled a bit better by a low level language (C is used here).</p>
<div id="install-wiringpi">

<p>We are going to start with the assumption that you have already set up the
raspberry pi and soldered the sensor to the GPIO. An excellent repository already
exists at <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">http://wiringpi.com/</a>. It provides a C interface
to the GPIO that will prevent us from having to write any of the low level code.
I’m going to SSH into my headless pi and install the wiringPi program with the
following commands. In the examples, you can build and run a program to check
if you are getting good readings.</p>
<pre><code>git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
cd wiringPi
./build
cd examples
make rht03
./rht03</code></pre>
<p>You should see readings from the sensor now. Type <code>CTRL+c</code> to quit the
program.</p>
</div>
<div id="set-up-a-mysql-server">

<p>In this step we are going to install MYSQL server and create some security
around it. When you see ‘username’ or ‘password’ those are meant for you to
replace with your own credentials. Instead of only using root to access
the server with elevated priviliges, I am going to grant all privileges to
a different user, but only when on the ‘localhost’, Essentially, you need to
remote in currently to access the server with your ‘user’ credentials. Last,
log back into the server with your new user identity for the next step.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo apt-get install default-libmysqlclient-dev
sudo mysql_secure_installation
sudo mysql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
\q
mysql -u 'username' -p</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="set-up-a-database">

<p>Now, let’s create a database and a table with the time in UNIX integer time and
two other columns for the sensor readings that we want to record.</p>
<pre><code>create database Monitoring;
use Monitoring;
create table Climate (ComputerTime INTEGER UNSIGNED,Temperature DECIMAL(5,1), Humidity DECIMAL(5,1));</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="run-the-program-to-read-and-write-data">

<p>You will need to download this file:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.instructables.com/ORIG/FV1/SE8A/HOSLXFJA/FV1SE8AHOSLXFJA.c">th.c</a></p>
<p>Change the <code>'root'</code> and <code>'password'</code>
credentials to match the user that you set up earlier. You will need to copy
over the Makefile and change some flags so that the program knows where to
find some of the drivers that it needs.</p>
<pre><code>cp wiringPi/examples/Makefile ~/raspberrypi/monitor/Makefile
sudo nano ~/raspberrypi/monitor/Makefile</code></pre>
<p>Add the following lines to the file:</p>
<pre><code>INCLUDE = -I/usr/local/include,/usr/include/mysql
LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib,/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf -lmysqlclient -lpthread -lz -lm -lrt -ldl</code></pre>
<p>Compile the program:</p>
<pre><code>make ~/raspberrypi/monintor/th</code></pre>
<p>You will now run the program that you altered and compiled. Use the <code>&amp;</code> to
run the program continuously in the background. The program will write the
temperature and humidity every 60 seconds to the database.</p>
<pre><code>./raspberrypi/monitor/th &amp;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="set-up-r">

<p>This step is optional but good to have for troubleshooting. Later, I will be
connecting remotely on my laptop instead of working in R on the raspberry pi.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install r-base
sudo su - -e 'install.packages("DBI", "RMariaDB")'</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="check-database-connection-and-query">

<p>After a couple hours, you should have a good amount of data. I’m going to be
connecting from my laptop so I’ll need to set up my user credentials with
privileges to access over my LAN which to cover all ip addresses that get
assigned use the <code>%</code> (wildcard) at the end of <code>192.168.1</code> (your LAN is
already set to use this ip address numbering system).</p>
<pre><code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* TO 'user'@'192.168.1.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
\q</code></pre>
<p>Let’s make sure that the server has a port that we can access. If it’s not
already in the <code>my.conf</code> file, open up the file with a text editor.</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf</code></pre>
<p>Add the following lines to the file which opens up the default port 3306 for
the mysql server and then bind to current IP address.</p>
<pre><code>[msqld]
port=3306
bind-address=0.0.0.0</code></pre>
<p>Restart the service for the changes to take effect.</p>
<pre><code>sudo service mysql restart</code></pre>
<p>You can log off the machine now. We don’t need to do anything else on the
raspberry pi for now.</p>
</div>
<div id="access-the-data-remotely">

<p>From RStudio on my laptop (while connected to my LAN), we’re going to open
a connection to the database. You can specify the host as a DNS name that
can be set up on your router’s administration portal or you can specify the
IP address. I would recommend making the IP address static if you plan on
using that method going forward. Since we stored the timestamp in UNIX
integer form, we can convert it to POSIXct knowing that the origin of UNIX
time is the start of the year 1970.</p>
<pre><code>library(DBI)
library(ggplot2)
library(trstyles) # optional package for my styling of ggplot2 plots

con &lt;- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), host = 'sensorpi', 
                 user = 'pi', password = 'password',
                 dbname = 'Monitoring')
query &lt;- 'SELECT ComputerTime, Temperature, Humidity FROM Climate'
readings &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, query)
readings[['ComputerTime']] &lt;- as.POSIXct(readings[['ComputerTime']], 
                                         origin = '1970-01-01 00:00:00')</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="plot-the-data">

<p>Now that we have the data, let’s plot temperature against time to see what has
been going on.</p>
<pre><code>ggplot(readings) +
  geom_line(aes(ComputerTime, Temperature)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = expression('Temperature ('*degree*'C)'),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*9/5+32, 
                                         name = 
                                           expression('Temperature ('*degree*'F)'))) +
  scale_x_datetime(name = '', date_breaks = '2 days') +
  theme_tr(base_size = 18) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5))</code></pre>
<p>It looks good for the most part, but we definitely have some outlier readings.
I can see probably outliers at 30 degrees Celsius. I’m going to cut those off
and take a second look.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VXXtKQS.png"></p>
<pre><code>readings[['Temperature']][readings[['Temperature']] &gt; 30] &lt;- NA
ggplot(readings) +
  geom_line(aes(ComputerTime, Temperature)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = expression('Temperature ('*degree*'C)'),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*9/5+32, 
                                         name = 
                                           expression('Temperature ('*degree*'F)'))) +
  scale_x_datetime(name = '', date_breaks = '2 days') +
  theme_tr(base_size = 18) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5))</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OrfoUUG.png"></p>
<p>You can see some patterns already existing within the data. Given how the
weather patterns have been, adding in some outside temperature readings would
provide some more insight into what is going on. I’ll dive into some more
analysis in another post.</p>
<p>We can do the same for the relative humidity.</p>
<pre><code>ggplot(readings) +
  geom_line(aes(ComputerTime, Humidity), color = '#9D5863') +
  scale_y_continuous(name = 'Relative Humidity (Rh)') +
  scale_x_datetime(name = '', date_breaks = '2 days') +
  theme_tr(base_size = 18) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5))</code></pre>

<p><b>Skip to the end if you just want a template for a "Right to object"
letter.</b></p>

<p>The .NET Core software development kit (SDK) is a set of command line tools
that allow development against Microsoft's .NET. When the command line tool is
run it sends some telemetry back to Microsoft.</p>

<p>This telemetry is <a href="https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry">documented</a>, however the way it is implemented appears
against the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> in multiple ways.</p>

<h3>Collection by default</h3>

<p>Running <code>dotnet help</code> on a clean install, will print a message about telemetry,
but will send the details on that run.</p>

<p><a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-help.png"><img src="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-help.png"></a></p>

<p>Therefore the GDPR requriements under <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-42/">"Burden of proof and requirements for
consent"</a> cannot be met -- even if we
give Microsoft the benefit of doubt and consider a command line application
somewhat special, it does not give us a chance to opt-out, yet alone opt-in.</p>

<p><a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-installer.png"><img src="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-installer.png"></a></p>

<p>During the installation process, there is a link to Microsoft's <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement">Privacy
statement</a>, however this
does not mention the environment variable needed to opt-out, so there is no way
to opt out before the first piece of data is sent.</p>

<h3>Collecting personal data</h3>

<p>The linked information page, as well as the text printed  in the CLI both say "The data is
anonymous.", it clearly isn't. They collect MAC addresses and the current
working directory, which are sent to their servers hashed.</p>

<p>A key thing to understand: <b>Hashing without a salt does not make the data
anonymous or even pseudonymous.</b></p>

<p>See for example <a href="https://medium.com/@alexewerlof/gdpr-pseudonymization-techniques-62f7b3b46a56">GDPR pseudonymisation
techniques</a>.
Given this, it is a clear violation as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">Article
6</a> requires specific purposes for processing,
but the data was claimed to be anonymous, which it isn't.</p>

<p>A common place to run "dotnet help" might be a home directory, which can often
include a username, e.g. <code>/home/dgl</code>. So while it's hashed it is easily
possible to find the hash that relates to a particular user:</p>

<pre><code>$ pwd
/home/dgl
$ echo -n $PWD | sha256sum
67acfe0ddd44867e1e5da5ddaf25a5b90e928f523cecf614e201c683b7533cf6  -
</code>
</pre>

<p>This matches the relevant part of the JSON sent:</p>

<pre><code>  "Current Path Hash": "67acfe0ddd44867e1e5da5ddaf25a5b90e928f523cecf614e201c683b7533cf6",
</code></pre>

<p>There are some discussions about the collection of MAC addresses in
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/6145">issue #6145</a> but no
particular reply from Microsoft; people suspect it's a GDPR violation. Note
that under the GDPR there are time limits for replying, so that's another
potential GDPR issue.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/ms-report.txt">report</a> I sent to Microsoft detailed how a
MAC address is likely not even 48-bits of search space, as we know what ones
are assigned, so brute-forcing is quite possible, particularly when combined
with the fact the search space can be reduced by filtering on the path
hash.</p>

<p>One principle of the GDPR is you need to explain why you're collecting
information, Microsoft do in a round about way, rather than on the link
printed by the command (<a href="https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry">https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry</a>) which explains what they are collecting, the "why" is hidden on a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/what-weve-learned-from-net-core-sdk-telemetry/">blog post</a>.</p><p>

It says:
</p><blockquote>
Hashed MAC address â€” Determine a cryptographically (SHA256) anonymous and unique ID for a machine. Useful to determine the aggregate number of machines that use .NET Core. This data will not be shared in the public data releases.
<p>

Hashed current working directory â€” Determine build machines from dev machines using the heuristic of a large number of working directories. This distinction helps explain large #s of builds from a machine.
</p></blockquote>


<p>This shows a clear intention to join the data, for some purposes. The "Hashed
MAC address" is obviously understood to be somewhat sensitive as it mentions
they won't share it. Interestingly the same is not said for the current working
directory, which is also sensitive.</p>

<h3>Privacy policy</h3>

<p>As mentioned Microsoft has a <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement">general privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p>This could allow some collection, however:</p>

<blockquote>
You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you
share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline.
</blockquote>

<p>This behaviour would be GDPR compliant, but the key point is due to the first
collection behaviour of e.g. running <code>dotnet help</code> there is no chance to
decline. So the behaviour of the dotnet tool is inconsistent with their own
privacy policy.</p>

<h3>How to respond?</h3>

<p>I sent a report to Microsoft's security team, because arguably incorrect use of
a cryptographic hashing function (SHA256 of the items, without a salt) is a
"Security Design Flaw" which qualifies under the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core">dotnet 
bug bounty</a>. This was
obviously fishing a bit, and Microsoft denied me. More surpsingly they don't
seem to consider this a problem at all, their final reply was:</p>

<blockquote>
We have updates scheduled for the first run experience and related documentation to make it more accurate. Personal data is handled consistently with GDPR requirements.
</blockquote>

<p>You'll notice that they don't talk about any actual collection changes. Also
interestingly if the data is anonymous as they claim, what "Personal data" are
they referring to in this reply?</p>

<h4>What's the route the GDPR gives us here?</h4>

<p>This is an interesting one, partly <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/">Article 11 Processing which does not
  require identification</a> could apply, in that they can exclude themselves
from right of access, etc. With the exception of "Right to object".</p>

<p>There are two routes, either we give enough information for Microsoft to be
happy we identify ourselves (and use the right to erasure), or we use the right
to object, which while it doesn't require Microsoft to delete the data
entirely does require them to limit their use of it.</p>

<p>So I can object to any processing of my data, and as I've proved we can use
the MAC address to find my machine in their data. I believe given this has gone
on for several years that even if they make the data collection GDPR compliant,
there is a huge historical collection of data that may need clearing as it has
been collected unlawfully.</p>

<p>In my original <a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/ms-report.txt">report</a> to Microsoft I made some recommendations:</p>

<pre><code>
Recommendations:
<ul><li>Remove the telemetry, it avoids any potential GDPR issues;</li>
<li>Delete the historical data (I am not a lawyer, but I suspect this has GDPR
implications);
</li></ul></code></pre>

<p>It appears they do not intend to follow these so I suggest that any user of
.NET Core SDK in the European Union takes matters into their own hands and use
their right to object:</p>

<div>
<p>
[Your full address]
[The date]</p>

<p>To Data Controller, Microsoft Corporation</p>

<p>I am exercising my right to object under the General Data Protection
Regulation (Article 21).</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that Microsoft .NET Core SDK collects telemetry,
and the opt-out process for this data is flawed.</p>

<p>In particular setting the <code>DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT</code> variable
is only suggested the first time the tool is run, so some data may have been
collected against my will.</p>

<p>In light of Microsoft not deleting this telemetry data for everyone (per the
report of David Leadbeater on 3 August 2020). I wish that my telemetry data is
restricted from further processing, as I have set the opt-out environment
variable, but I cannot be sure that some data has not reached Microsoft
already.</p>

<p>The MAC addresses of my machine(s) is/are:</p>

<p>XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX</p>

<p>I believe this is enough to identify my records, as they are stored as a
SHA256 hash of this MAC address.</p>

<p>Please send a full response within one calendar month confirming if you will
comply with my request. If you cannot respond within that timescale, please
tell me when you will be able to respond.</p>

<p>If there is anything you would like to discuss, please contact me.</p>

<p>Thank you,
</p></div>

<p>Obviously the somewhat strange thing about this is you reveal your MAC
address to Microsoft in the process, but I'm fairly sure the data protection
around GDPR requests is something that is well scrutinized.</p>

<p>If you do want to send this to Microsoft go to
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/concern/privacy">https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/concern/privacy</a> and select "I want to contact
Microsoftâ€™s Data Protection Officer".</p>

<p>It's strange this is still an issue as this was previously discussed over
two years ago (see this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17177241">Hacker News
thread</a>). Let's use our right to object!</p>

    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">August 19, 2020</time>
    </p>
    

<p>I quit my job in January 2020 to build a privacy friendly photo organizer.</p>

<p>As a 30 year old whose friends are either getting married or planning
off-springs, what I had underestimated was the difficulty involved in finding a co-founder and how that would compound the difficulty involved in
finding an investor.</p>

<p>Once I accepted the loneliness and the lack of a financial cushion I had to figure out a way to keep building without burning myself out.</p>

<p>It took me a while, but I have found a rhythm that works, and with it, a steady
source of endorphins. Here are some changes that helped me to keep things
moving.</p>

<h2 id="being-patient">Being patient</h2>

<p>Life is no longer as comfortable as it used to be and things are not always
going the way I want them to. Preseverance has been key and indirectly patience
too. Naval’s <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481752448524289" target="_blank">take on
meditation</a> (60 minutes x
60 days), was an eye opener. I’ve stuck with it since, and I now have an easier
time identifying negative thought patterns and sitting out situations that would
otherwise overwhelm me.</p>

<p>On some level, spending the last few months locked indoors with my parents, who
are not the most rational people in the world has also helped. But I wouldn’t
recommend it.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-procrastination">Reducing procrastination</h2>

<p>Over time I’ve realized that action precedes motivation and procrastination precedes guilt.</p>

<p>Breaking down tasks into chunks that seem trivial to accomplish has helped reduce the friction in getting started on unexciting grunt work.</p>

<p>Then there are tasks which I loathe from my core, like writing out applications
to VCs explaining why what I’m doing will matter. To those I attach reinforcing
personal reasons, like, “I need the $50k to hire that college junior who I love
working with, and that will give me spare bandwidth to focus on traction channels”.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-clearer">Thinking clearer</h2>

<p>It is sub-optimal to not have a coworker to bounce ideas off and rant about problems to. A lot of times it’s these conversations that help you gain clarity.</p>

<p>It’s a luxury I do not have so every time I feel stuck, I type/scribble my thoughts out, and then question everything that was written, and then document my realizations.</p>

<p>Task tracking has also helped in clearing the path. I write down unstructured
thoughts into a diary, and once I’ve clarity, I promote them to a Notion board
(that’s divided into <em>Thinking</em>, <em>Building</em>, <em>Reading</em>, <em>Writing</em> and
<em>Adulting</em>) and every Monday within an Excel sheet I track what was done, and
what is left to be done.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-distractions">Reducing distractions</h2>

<p>I’ve reduced my information consumption to free up brain cycles. I’ve disabled all notifications on my phone barring a few contacts, and I’ve more or less stopped browsing on it. As an added bonus, this has reduced the negativity with which I perceived the world.</p>

<p>To minimize the overhead of context switches, I split tasks into a tree of checkpoints. Before taking a break I note down the next simplest checkpoint so that when I get back to work there’s little friction to resume.</p>

<p>To help me zone out I keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A" target="_blank">lofi
beats</a> or
<a href="http://github.audio/" target="_blank">github.audio</a> playing in the background. Listening to the
latter gives me a strange sense of motivation and makes me feel less alone.</p>

<h2 id="staying-grounded">Staying grounded</h2>

<p>I’m lucky to have some friends who call/text every other week. I look at them as my accountability partners and I talk to them about what I’m doing on a high level. While not all of them genuinely care, some do, and these conversations force me to reflect on how well I’m doing what I’m doing.</p>

<p>While Silicon Valley wisdom suggests that if I’m not sleeping I should be
working, failing because of a burn out would be stupid. An advantage of not
having a VC onboard so far has been the freedom to dictate my pace. So I spend
days thinking, reading, fiddling with my violin or just doing nothing when I
feel like writing code is not what I want to do.</p>

<hr>

<p>It’s been 7 months of building alone, and while this is not how I pictured things to be on my last day at work, this is the happiest I have ever been. There’s a long way to go, and the grind seems inviting.</p>

<p>This list is by no means exhaustive, for I’m still learning. If you’ve
anything to share, please join <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24251403" target="_blank">the discussion on HackerNews</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have noticed the incredible misinformation being spread in the lay news. From the New York Times, to CNN, to Fox News, to Donald Trump himself- GIANT, OBVIOUS, LIES and ERRORS have been spread to the public. From Masks don’t work, to Hydroxychloroquine is an effective drug, to COVID-19 is a hoax, to antibodies won’t last, to the latest set of lies- herd immunity isn’t happening– all giant lies– on both sides of the aisle. Many of these have been attributed to scientists or academics with one line out-of-context quotes, throwing us under the bus, saying things we didn’t say, blatantly misconstruing or outright not understanding the <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about a branch of knowledge. For other uses, see&nbsp;Science (disambiguation). Science&nbsp;(from the&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;word&nbsp;scientia, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;)[1]&nbsp;is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;testable&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;and&nbsp;predictions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;universe.[2][3][4] The earliest roots of science can be traced to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6]&nbsp;Their contributions to&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;astronomy, and&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;entered and shaped Greek&nbsp;natural philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;classical…">science</a> behind basic concepts. The lies always fall along party lines and are aimed at manipulating the public for a political agenda. Scientists have become both pawns and scapegoats to the media and politicians. I am really, really, tired of it. And it is <strong>literally KILLING Americans.</strong></p>



<p>Without facts, we can’t have rationale policy and people can’t make informed, consenting, decisions about their health. The media lies have created mass public confusion and engendered incredible mistrust of the media, politicians, and scientists and doctors (the people the public can and should trust). All the while the scientific community has had a clear eyed unchanging picture of this pandemic the whole time. The virus is not so complicated. The modeling of the virus is actually not so complicated. But if you are listening to the press, it’s a huge messy complicated whiplash of completely untrustworthy information. </p>



<p>So here are the <span><strong>Five Biggest Lies </strong></span>about COVID-19 spread by the press and politicians:</p>



<p>1.<strong>Masks don’t work. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> Everyone. </p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong> To manipulate the public into not buying N95 masks so health care workers would have them. </p>



<p><strong>What was the harm?</strong> It made millions of Americans not believe masks work when the media about faced on this later, killing 10s of thousands. 30% less people would die if everyone wore masks. </p>



<p><strong>2. Hydroxychloroquine works.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> Trump and the right. </p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong> I really can’t fucking figure it out for the life of me. Trump has some financial interest in the drug? You tell me.</p>



<p><strong>What was the harm?</strong> People around the world took a bogus drug with real <a href="https://realscience.community/2020/08/09/elementor-1270/">harmful side effects to their hearts and livers</a>. They also had a false sense of security that there is a treatment for COVID.</p>



<p>Some politicians (below for Ted Cruz statement), have finally admitted the harm in Hydroxycholorquine saying it directly is killing people but still cling to promoting the drug for earlier treatment despite the rigorous clinical trials showing no benefit and indeed harm with the drug. <a href="https://thetexan.news/ted-cruz-letter-to-fda-says-hydroxychloroquine-restrictions-may-be-directly-costing-lives/">https://thetexan.news/ted-cruz-letter-to-fda-says-hydroxychloroquine-restrictions-may-be-directly-costing-lives/</a>.</p>



<p><strong>3. COVID-19 is a hoax.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> Trump and the right.</p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong> My suspicion is that they care more about keeping businesses (and their own finances) intact than saving human lives. So they want people to think COVID-19 is not dangerous so people will continue to spend money.</p>



<p><strong>What was the harm?</strong> People went about their lives in many states like the virus wasn’t harmful. This killed 100,000 more people than necessary. COVID-19 has already killed 6X the number of people this year than the flu has on average in any given year. It also very well might encourage people not to get a COVID vaccine when it becomes available- which we very much need to do.</p>



<p><strong>4. Antibodies won’t last so herd immunity might not be possible.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> The left using scientists as pawns. Here is a quote from a review in the journal, Nature, the number one <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about a branch of knowledge. For other uses, see&nbsp;Science (disambiguation). Science&nbsp;(from the&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;word&nbsp;scientia, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;)[1]&nbsp;is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;testable&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;and&nbsp;predictions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;universe.[2][3][4] The earliest roots of science can be traced to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6]&nbsp;Their contributions to&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;astronomy, and&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;entered and shaped Greek&nbsp;natural philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;classical…">science</a> journal in the world. Please note the use of “predictable” in the tagline- “Viral Immunologists say that results so far have been predictable- Here’s why that’s good news”. <strong>This pandemic has not been mysterious to scientists.</strong></p>







<figure><blockquote><p>“Several major media outlets reported this as a loss of immunity, saying that it would complicate vaccine efforts.Many immunologists found that declaration a bit premature, however. The data showed a perfectly normal response to a viral infection, says Luis Barreiro at the University of Chicago in Illinois, who studies the evolution of immune responses to pathogens. When a virus attacks, it spurs the proliferation of B cells that produce antibodies capable of recognizing pieces of the virus. But once the infection is gone, antibody levels typically wane. “There is a lot of fear out there,” says Miles Carroll, an infectious-disease specialist with Public Health England in Porton Down, UK. “But I think, on the whole, that it’s a fairly robust immune response.””</p><cite>~Nature NEWS&nbsp;&nbsp;17 AUGUST 2020<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02400-7">What the immune response to the coronavirus says about the prospects for a vaccine<br>Viral immunologists say that results so far have been predictable — here’s why that’s good news.</a></p></cite></blockquote></figure><p><strong>5. Herd immunity isn’t happening because there are still cases. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Who is spreading this?</strong> The left and Cuomo and crew. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/21/health/coronavirus-immunity-frieden-opinion/index.html">CNN</a> and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-11/san-quentin-coronavirus-herd-immunity-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR3hDfD6XqUIv7vydOLl5cga3mlKV_TOgh0eqrgZVpMNDeBGocpC6tI8UKI">LA Times</a> have blatant lies in papers in the last two days. Here is a quote from CNN showing that they are lying about what herd immunity is. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“But can herd immunity result from 20-30% infection, as some misguided academics suggested recently—far lower than the usual estimate of 60-80% infection? Don’t count on it. Some communities already have a 50% infection rate or higher — this would be impossible if herd immunity kicked in at a 20-30% infection rate!”</p></blockquote></figure><p>Herd immunity means cases go down, RT&lt;1, not that they disappear or that more immunity isn’t possible. This definition is literally in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">Wikipedia</a>.</p>



<p>Herd immunity <a href="https://realscience.community/2020/08/17/why-i-believe-the-us-has-herd-immunity-in-some-states-and-is-barreling-towards-it-as-a-country/">is almost certainly happening</a>. <a href="https://realscience.community/2020/08/19/all-signs-point-to-herd-immunity-happening-in-parts-of-the-us-what-are-the-practical-implications/">And that is a good reason to wear a mask and not open schools. </a>Things aren’t safe yet but could be soon- we need to be careful for one more semester and ride this out- but also have hope that things will be better soon.</p>



<p><strong>Why? </strong>Because they want to protect Andrew Cuomo from the wrath of the public finding out that NYC has had herd immunity all along. They also want to point fingers at the right that their cases are going up because they are holier than thou and are using that politically. </p>



<p><strong>What is the harm?</strong> It gives the public the exact opposite impression of what is happening. New York is amongst the safer states now and Michigan is amongst the least safe. States with schools opening that do not yet have immunity should 100% not open. University of Michigan, with your 60k plus students, do not open! Take a clue from UNC Chapel Hill shutting down after one week of classes. </p>



<p>This reckless, abhorrent, blatantly false, characterization of COVID-19 and public health messaging is incredibly harmful. It has killed ~100,000 Americans. The press and politicians on both sides of the aisle need to be held accountable for this. #fakesciencenews</p>

<p><strong>23/08/2020</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://shusson.info/assets/potato.png" alt="potato"></p>

<p>Currently, github runners are hosted on azure <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners">Standard_DS2_v2 VMs</a>. They have 2vCPU 7GB RAM and 14GB SSD.</p>

<p>You can self-host a runner by installing the runner service on your own infrastructure. Self-hosted runners incur no costs on github and allow you to leverage the actions api. Of course you’ll be paying for your own infrastructure, but often this will be cheaper than burning through github minutes. If you’ve got a couple idle ubuntu boxes lying around the office it’s an easy win.</p>

<p>I would recommend using a ramdisk for the workers <code>_work</code> dir as it will dramatically increase IO. Since our tests are ephemeral anyway, we don’t care if there is data loss in the <code>_work</code> directory. Any important files can be persisted using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts">github artifacts</a>.</p>

<p>If your workflow is a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/about-service-containers#running-jobs-in-a-container">container-job</a>, then the only dependencies are ubuntu and docker. Assuming you’ve got stock ubuntu 18.04 installed:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
# requires reboot
sudo usermod -a -G docker fred


# create a ramdisk for the runners work dir
mkdir /home/fred/ramdisk
sudo chown -R fred /home/fred/ramdisk

# requires reboot
echo "tmpfs /home/fred/ramdisk tmpfs   defaults,size=3000M,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000   0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# set up the github runner
# in this example we are installing a runner to a repository, you can also install it for a org
# more info https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners
mkdir actions-runner
cd actions-runner
# note the version will most likely change in the future
curl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.272.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.272.0.tar.gz
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.272.0.tar.gz
# you can find the token here: https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/settings/actions/add-new-runner
./config.sh --url https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt; --token "${GITHUB_TOKEN}" --name "${RUNNER_NAME}" --work /home/fred/ramdisk  --unattended  --replace
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
sudo ./svc.sh status
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s it. You should now see the runner in your repo: e.g <code>https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/settings/actions</code></p>

<p>To tie your workflow to a self-hosted runner, use a label e.g</p>

<pre><code>jobs:
    server_tests:
        runs-on: [self-hosted, enabled]
</code></pre>

<p>You might be wondering if you can host the github runner in a docker container. Unfortunately not all features are supported yet, so depending on your workflow you might have <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/406">issues</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Startomatic perspective:</strong></p>

<p>Stripe Atlas is a startup formation product aimed at venture capital-backed companies. These companies typically need somewhat complex legal documents allowing for outside investment, multiple types of equity, and equity compensation. Stripe Atlas only allows formation of Delaware C-corporations. They also offer to set up a US bank account for users.</p>

<p>For companies not planning to immediately raise outside investment, Stripe Atlas is somewhat expensive and offers limited choices - you cannot form an S-corporations, LLC, or entity in any state other than Delaware.</p>

<p>Stripe Atlas does not offer logo, website, trademark searches, domain name registration, company email, SEO help, or any of the numerous other features included in Startomatic’s flat fee.</p>

<p>If you are not planning to immediately raise money from professional investors, you’re not operating in Delaware, and/or you need services other than legal formation documents and a bank account, Stripe Atlas may not be a good choice. Startomatic is both less expensive and provides significantly more features, including the ability to incorporate in all 50 states.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A common strategy to make any system super-performant is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">Caching</a>.</em> Almost all software products, operating at scale, have multiple layers of caches in their architectures. Caching, when done right, does wonder to the response time and is one of the main reasons why products work so well at a massive scale. Cache engines are limited by the amount of memory available and hence once it gets full the engine has to decide which item should be evicted and that is where an eviction algorithm, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used">LFU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a>. kicks in.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a> (Least Recently Used) cache eviction strategy is one of the most popular strategies out there. LFU (Least Frequently Used) strategy fares well in some use cases but a concern with its most popular implementation, where it uses a min-heap, is that it provides a running time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code> for all the three operations - insert, update and delete; because of which, more often than not, it is replaced with a sub-optimal yet extremely fast <code>O(1)</code> LRU eviction scheme.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a look at Constant Time LFU implementation based on the paper <a href="http://dhruvbird.com/lfu.pdf">An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme</a> by Prof. Ketan Shah, Anirban Mitra and Dhruv Matani, where instead of using a min-heap, it uses a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">doubly-linked lists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> to gain a running time complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for all the three core operations.</p>

<p>LFU, very commonly, is implemented using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_heap">min-heap</a> which is organized as per the frequency of access of each element. Each element of this heap holds a pair - cached value and the access frequency; and is structured in order of this frequency such that the cached value with the minimum access frequency sits at the top, making it quick to identify the element to be evicted.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/89717235-0fd1f900-d9d2-11ea-968d-9ed67f52a2db.png" alt="min-heap LFU"></p>
<p>Although the identification of the element to be evicted is quick, but in order for the heap to maintain its property - element with lowest access frequency be at the top - it demands a rebalance, and this rebalancing process has a running complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>. To make things worse, rebalancing is required every single time the frequency of an item is changed; which means that in the cache that implements LFU, every time an item is either inserted, accessed or evicted, a rebalance is required - making all the three core operations to have the time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>.</p>

<p>The LFU cache can be implemented with <code>O(1)</code> complexity for all the three operations by using one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> and a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked Lists</a>. As stated by the <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/rum">RUM Conjecture</a>, in order to get a constant time reads and updates operations, we have to make a compromise with memory utilization. This is exactly what we observe in this implementation.</p>
<h2>The Hash Table</h2>
<p>The Hash Table stores the mapping of the cached key to the Value Node holding the cached value. The value against the key is usually a pointer to the actual Value Node. Given that the lookup complexity of the hash table is <code>O(1)</code>, the operation to access the value given the key from this Hash Table could be accomplished in constant time.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469594-e2561f80-e136-11ea-9ff4-8369a7ea3df3.png" alt="LFU hash table"></p>
<p>The illustration above depicts that the Hash Table holding cache keys <code>k1</code>, <code>k2</code>, etc are mapped to the nodes holding the values <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> through direct pointers. The nodes are allocated on the heap using dynamic allocation, hence are a little disorganized. The Value Node to which the key maps to, not only hold the cached value, but it also holds a few pointers pointing to different entities in the system, enabling constant-time operations.</p>
<h2>Doubly Linked Lists</h2>
<p>This implementation of LFU requires us to maintain one Doubly Linked List of frequencies, called <code>freq_list</code>, holding one node for each unique frequency spanning all the caches values. This list is kept sorted on the frequency the node represents such that, the node representing the lowest frequency is on the one end while the node representing the highest frequency is at the other.</p>
<p>Every Frequency Node holds the frequency that it represents in the member <code>freq</code> and the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Frequency Nodes; it also keeps a <code>values_ptr</code> which points to another doubly-linked list holding Value Nodes (referred in the hash table) having the same access frequency <code>freq</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469593-e08c5c00-e136-11ea-995b-e4590981dd89.png" alt="lists LFU"></p>
<p>The overall schematic representation of doubly-linked lists and its arrangement is as shown in the illustration above. The doubly-linked list holding Frequency Nodes is arranged horizontally while the list holding the Value Nodes is arranged vertically, for clearer view and understanding.</p>
<p>Since the cached values <code>v1</code> and <code>v7</code> both have been accessed <code>7</code> times, they both are chained in a doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>7</code>. Similarly, the Value Nodes holding values <code>v5</code>, <code>v3</code>, and <code>v9</code> are chained in another doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>18</code>.</p>
<p>The Value Node contains the cached value in member <code>data</code>, along with the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Value Nodes in the list. It also holds a <code>freq_pointer</code> pointing back to the Frequency Node to which the list if hooked at. Having all of these pointers helps us ensure all the three operations happen in constant time.</p>
<p>Now that we have put all the necessary structures in place, we take a look at the 3 core operations along with their pseudo implementation.</p>
<h2>Adding value to the cache</h2>
<p>Adding a new value to the cache is a relatively simpler operation that requires a bunch of pointer manipulations and does the job with a constant time running complexity. While inserting the value in the cache, we first check the existence of the key in the table, if the key is already present and we try to put it again the function raises an error. Then we ensure the presence of the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>1</code>, and in the process, we might also need to create a new frequency node also. Then we wrap the value in a Value Node and adds it to the <code>values_list</code> of this Frequency Node; and at last, we make an entry in the table acknowledging the completion of the caching process.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(key: str, value: object)</span>:</span>
    
    
    <span>if</span> key <span>in</span> table:
        <span>raise</span> KeyAlreadyExistsError

    
    
    value_node = make_value_node(value)

    first_frequency_node = freq_list.head
    <span>if</span> first_frequency_node.freq != <span>1</span>:
        
        
        first_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(<span>1</span>)

        
        
        
        first_frequency_node.next = freq_list.head
        freq_list.head.prev = first_frequency_node
        freq_list.head = first_frequency_node

    
    value_node.freq_pointer = first_frequency_node

    
    first_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)

    
    table[key] = value_node
</code></pre>
<p>As seen in the pseudocode above the entire procedure to add a new value in the cache is a bunch of memory allocation along with some pointer manipulations, hence we observe that the running complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for this operation.</p>
<h2>Evicting an item from the cache</h2>
<p>Eviction, similar to insertion, is a trivial operation where we simply pick the frequency node with lowest access frequency (the first node in the <code>freq_list</code>) and remove the first Value Node present in its <code>values_list</code>. Since the entire eviction also requires pointer manipulations, it also exhibits a running complexity of <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>evict</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> freq_list.head.values:
        first_value_node = freq_list.head.values.first
        second_value_node = first_value_node.next

        
        freq_list.head = second_value_node

        
        second_value_node.prev = <span>None</span>

        
        delete_value_node(first_value_node)

    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> <span>not</span> freq_list.head.values:
        
        
        delete_frequency_node(freq_list.head)
</code></pre>
<h2>Getting a value from the cache</h2>
<p>Accessing an item from the cache has to be the most common operation of any cache. In the LFU scheme, before returning the cached value, the engine also has to update its access frequency. Ensuring the change in access frequency of one cached value does not require some sort of rebalancing or restructuring to maintain the integrity, is what makes this implementation special.</p>
<p>The engine first makes a get call to the Hash Table to check that the key exists in the cache. Before returning the cached value from the retrieved Value Node, the engine performs the following operations - it accesses the Frequency Node and its sibling corresponding to the retrieved Value Node. It ensures that the frequency of the sibling is 1 more than that of the Frequency Node; if not it creates the necessary Frequency Node and place it as the new sibling. The Value Node then changes its affinity to this sibling Frequency Node so that it correctly matches the access frequency. In the end, the back pointer from the Value Node to the new Frequency Node is set and the value is returned.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(key: str)</span> -&gt; object:</span>
    
    value_node = table.get(key, <span>None</span>)

    
    
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> value_node:
        <span>raise</span> KeyNotFoundError

    
    
    frequency_node = value_node.freq_pointer

    
    
    
    next_frequency_node = frequency_node.next

    <span>if</span> next_frequency_node.freq != frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>:
        
        new_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>)
        
        
        frequency_node.next = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.prev = frequency_node

        next_frequency_node.prev = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.next = frequency_node

        
        
        next_frequency_node = new_frequency_node

    
    next_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)
    
    
    value_node.freq_pointer = next_frequency_node
    value_node.next = <span>None</span>
    value_node.prev = next_frequency_node.values.last
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> len(frequency_node.values) == <span>0</span>:
        delete_frequency_node(frequency_node)

    
    <span>return</span> value_node.value
</code></pre>
<p>Again, since this operation also only deals with pointer manipulations through direct pointers, the running time complexity of this operation is also constant …</p></div></div></div>

				<div>
					<p>I love reading. But retaining what I read tends to be a challenge. I usually walk away from a book feeling good but with only a faint idea of what was in there. Heck, if I spend a couple hours online I’ll barely remember what articles I read! And it’s not just me, studies show that <a href="https://learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1379/brain-science-the-forgetting-curvethe-dirty-secret-of-corporate-training">you only retain a tiny percentage of what you read</a>.</p><p>I hated the idea of wasting all that time I spent reading, so a year ago I started looking into ways to retain what I learned.</p><p>My first attempt led me to Farnam Street’s tips on <a href="https://fs.blog/2014/05/remembering-what-you-read/">remembering what you read</a>. Their concept of writing your notes on the book itself was liberating (it’s okay to WRITE in my book?!?). Actively writing down notes helped me get more insights out of the text, but those thoughts would then be trapped in the analogue world, locked away until I happened to peruse the book some time in the future.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-1--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-1--1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-1--1-.png 769w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>FS also suggested writing down the book’s core ideas from memory right after you finish the book, but this is a process that requires discipline (unless you like testing yourself?) and things requiring discipline have a distressing tendency to not happen.</p><p>Those tips were exciting, but I couldn’t stick with it. I needed something different.</p><p>Next I came across the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125">Zettelkasten note taking method</a>. Its core idea is to create atomic notes, where each note is about exactly one topic (not more than a few paragraphs tops) and nothing more. Then you file the away in your system by linking that note to other notes which seem most relevant to it. All the notes are written in your own words, so you’re really writing down your own thoughts here.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png 616w"></figure><p>The key here is that the linking process <strong><strong>groups relevant notes together</strong></strong>. Now when you’re interested in browsing your notes on a given topic, you’ll easily find them. You get to see how your ideas relate to each other as well as discover interesting ways they may play off against or even contradict one another.</p><p>But this technique is time intensive. You have to:</p><ul><li>Save the initial note, paraphrasing what you learned</li><li>Search for relevant notes to link it to</li><li>Potentially update your table of contents to find that note more easily later on</li></ul><p>If you take a lot of notes, the stream of incoming notes can quickly leave you overwhelmed. This technique requires time and dedication.</p><p>I couldn’t stick with it.</p><p>Finally I discovered Building a Second Brain and it’s <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">P.A.R.A</a> technique. It offers an easier option for busy people.</p><p>With P.A.R.A. you organize all your notes by purpose, not by category. Let’s say you’re trying to build an app. You’ll have a folder called ‘app’ for all notes about it. Now if you study databases in order to build it, you’ll file any notes you take inside the ‘app’ folder, not in a separate ‘databases’ folder.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What does this do? By creating purpose-based folders and putting all notes related to that <em>purpose</em> inside it, we’ve created a new way to group relevant notes together. All your notes related to that purpose are available front and center when you open the folder. This lets you avoid the time consuming process of sorting, organizing, and linking your notes in order to make them useful. Just drop the note in the right folder and BAM, that’s it.</p><p>How do you reference old notes? When you start working on a new project (like a writing assignment) you search the relevant folders and pull out notes that seem relevant to your task. All those notes will go into the new project’s folder. You’re effectively discovering related notes on the fly. You’ve avoided the work of double linking and cross referencing your notes. This solution gets you 80% of the way there with 20% of the effort. Just in Time linking.</p><p>When you finish a project, you file away the notes from that project in which ever folder you think they’ll be most useful in, and then archive the project folder. Now you’ve reset the notes to be discoverable the next time you need them.</p><p>And it’s not just good for retention. I’m finding that this purpose-based organization is helping me work much more productively on all my projects!</p><p>Even the step of summarizing what you read is optimized for efficiency. It’s called <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/">Progressive Summarization</a></p><p>With progressive summarization you don’t bother summarizing what you’re learning, at least not at first. Instead you take the passages you found most interesting and copy them into your notes. If you ever reread those notes in the future then you can start highlighting the phrases that really spoke to you and if you reread them again, only then will you do the work to summarize the ideas in your own words.</p><p>It’s not that summarizing your notes from the beginning is bad, but if you procrastinate on it while still expecting yourself to do it then you’re setting yourself up for failure. Progressive summarization offers you a way to delay summarization while still retaining value.</p><p>Note what’s happened here: Instead of forcing myself to be disciplined about organizing my notes, P.A.R.A. + Progressive Summarization takes advantage of the times when I’m <strong><strong>already excited to work on them</strong></strong>. Each time I touch the notes, I have to take a small amount of effort which is proportionate to my level of interest in the task. <strong><strong>We’ve replaced forced discipline with leveraged excitement.</strong></strong></p><p>There is one other critical aspect of PARA that’s required to keep the system from being overwhelming. Successful followers of the Zettelkasten method seem to follow this instinctively, but <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/">it’s rarely mentioned</a>:</p><p>You’re highly encouraged to <strong><strong>limit</strong></strong> the kind of things you save in your second brain to the following:</p><ul><li>Things related to projects you’re <em>actively</em> working on. Don’t store trivia</li><li>Store things that surprise you: Don’t store stuff you already know</li><li>A 12 select problems that you love to think about</li></ul><p>Tiago recommends thinking about <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-use-evernote-for-your-creative-workflow/">the 12 problems you care most about</a> and <em>only</em> store things related to those problems in your notebook (so skip the articles about ancient mummies…unless you’re an archaeologist).</p><p>By limiting which topics you put in your second brain you free up more cognitive space to notice what you do store. By storing less you’ll remember more 🤯</p><p>Not making your second brain cognitively overwhelming is an under-emphasized part of the PARA system. There shouldn’t be anything in your project’s section unless you are actively working on it. Even the other sections are also meant to be pruned on a regular basis so that they only represent your primary interests. A good rule of thumb: if any folder gains more notes than you can easily skim (~50-100 notes), it might be time to split that folder into two or maybe even delete some notes.</p><p>This is by no means a complete comparison of Zettlekasten and P.A.R.A. (that would be a much longer essay) but it captures the major points.</p><p>Zettelkasten has its benefits: If you want to be able to casually browse through your notes, looking for ideas to spark your imagination, Zettelkasten will most likely have superior results since the ideas are already summarized right there for you. Zettelkasten makes it easy to compose essays and put together speeches, but that’s because you’ve already done the hard work of writing down your thoughts ahead of time.</p><p>It’s requirement to link all notes ahead of time is a HUGE barrier to entry, so Zettlekasten may be best suited to people with a strong research oriented disposition who’re already used to similar practices. The fact that there’s no good software available to help with this makes the process even harder. (Check out <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUw5PuD8op9oq8kHvni6sug6eRTNtR9Wqma">Andy Matuschak’s notes</a> for a gorgeous Zettlekasten example)</p><p>P.A.R.A. is great for those who don’t have the time (or willpower) to force themselves to write down notes they may never use. Instead it’s Just-in-Time philosophy saves many hours and lets you be more productive. Tiago has designed P.A.R.A. to work with most productivity apps, but the process is optimized for his app of choice: Evernote.</p><p>All in all, I’m finding P.A.R.A. pretty useful so far. It has yet to pass the ultimate test of any knowledge management system: Will I still be using it three months from now? (ask me after July). I’m already noticing productivity boosts by using the PARA method to store notes for all my projects, so prospects are looking good 😁</p>

			<p><span>Infrastructure, ops, devops, systems engineering, sysadmin, infraops, SRE, platform engineering. As long as I’ve been doing computers, these terms have been effectively synonymous. If I wanted to tell someone what my job was, I could throw out any one of them and expect to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span>Every tech company had a software engineering team that built software and an operations team that built infrastructure for running that software. At some point in the past decade they would have renamed this operations team to “devops” or “SRE”, but whatever the name, that was my team and those were my people.</span></p>
<p><span>But unless you’re an infrastructure company, infrastructure is not your mission. Which means that every second you devote to infrastructure work — and every engineer you devote to infrastructure problems — is a distraction from your core goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, it’s a distraction that builds on itself. The more time and energy you spend on infrastructure, the more your focus gets scattered, and the more you deprive yourself of the time and energy that ought to be devoted to the problems your business exists to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t exactly new. Infrastructure and operations have always been a distraction from your core business problems. It used to be the case that every company had to grow internal expertise in hardware, datacenters, networking, operating systems, config management, and so on up the tech stack until reaching their core business problems. Infrastructure and ops have always been a distraction, but until recently, a necessary one. A means to an end.</span></p>
<p><span>So what’s changed? These days, you increasingly have a choice. Sure, you </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> build all that internal expertise, but every day more and more of it is being served up via API on a silver platter.</span></p>
<p><span>Does this mean that operations is no longer important, no longer necessary? Far from it. Operations and operability are more important than ever. Let’s take a look at what’s happening to the ops profession at a high level, the emerging challenges we face, and the impact this’ll all have on our careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Changes afoot</b></h3>
<p><span>Beyond the broader move into to cloud services, here are some of the major shifts on our horizon.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monolith to microservices</b></h5>
<p><span>Much has been written about the operational demands of a microservices architecture. Now that functions calling other functions involves a network hop, operational concerns are an unavoidable part of debugging even the most trivial problems. Microservices change the game from “building code” to “building systems”, which pushes more and more code writing into the realm of operations.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monitoring to observability</b></h5>
<p><span>Metric-based tools like Prometheus and DataDog are infrastructure monitoring tools, and quite good ones at that. When you’re responsible for infrastructure, the questions you care about are of aggregates and trends, thresholds and capacity. Monitoring tools are the right tool for the job, because that’s how you understand whether your infrastructure is healthy, and what actions to take to make it or keep it healthy.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Observability tools*, on the other hand, are for the people writing and shipping code to users every day, and trying to inspect and understand behavior at the nexus of users, production, and code. Observability tools preserve the full context of the request. This allows you to slice and dice and tease out new correlations, as well as view events in a waterfall by time (“tracing”). Observability is how you connect the dots between software and real business impact, and between your engineers’ experience and your users’ experience. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><i><span>*Caution: many monitoring tools are trying to rebrand themselves as observability tools without first building the necessary functionality. To tell the difference, </span></i><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/so-you-want-to-build-an-observability-tool/"><i><span>see here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>
<h5><b>From magic autoinstrumentation to instrumenting with intent</b></h5>
<p><span>Instrumentation is just another form of commenting and documenting your code. There are tools that promise to do it automatically for you, but they aren’t great at capturing intent.. Auto-instrumentation can tell you loads of ancillary details, but they will </span><i><span>never</span></i><span> let you divine the business value intended by the engineer who built it. So suck it up and instrument your code.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ops is dead. Long live ops.</b></h3>
<p><span>Ops teams are going the way of the dodo bird, yet operability, resiliency, and reliability have never been more important. The role of operations engineers is changing fast, and the role is bifurcating along the question of infrastructure. In the future, people who would formerly have called themselves “operations engineers” (or devops engineers) will get to choose between a role that emphasizes </span><i><span>building infrastructure software as a service </span></i><span>and a role that uses their infrastructure expertise to help teams of engineers ship software more effectively and efficiently…generally by building as little infrastructure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>If your heart truly beats for working on infrastructure problems, you’re in luck! — there are more of those than ever. Go join an infrastructure company. Try one of the many companies — AWS, Azure, all the many developer tooling companies — whose mission consists of building infrastructure software, of being the best in the world at infrastructure, and selling that expertise to other companies. There are roles for software engineers who enjoy building infrastructure solutions as a service, and there are even specialist ops roles for running and operating that infrastructure at scale, or administering those data services at scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise, embrace the fact that your job consists of </span><i><span>building systems to enable teams of engineers to ship software that creates core business value</span></i><span>, which means home brewing as little infrastructure as possible. And what’s left?</span></p>
<h5><b>Vendor engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>Effectively outsourcing components of your infrastructure and weaving them together into a seamless whole involves a great deal of architectural skill and domain expertise. This skill set is both rare and incredibly undervalued, especially considering how pervasive the need for it is. Think about it. If you work at a large company, dealing with other internal teams should feel like dealing with vendors. And if you work at a small company, dealing with other vendors should feel like dealing with other teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who wants a long and vibrant career in SRE leadership would do well to invest some energy into areas like these:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Learn to evaluate vendors and their products effectively. Ask piercing, probing questions to gauge compatibility and fit. Determine which areas of friction you can live with and which are dealbreakers.</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to calculate and quantify the cost of your and your team’s time and labor. Be ruthless about shedding as much labor as possible in order to focus on your core business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to manage the true cost of ownership, and to advocate and educate internally for the right solution, particularly by managing up to execs and finance folks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Product engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>One of the great tragedies of infrastructure is how thoroughly most of us managed to evade the past 20+ years of lessons in managing products and learning how to work with designers. It’s no wonder most infrastructure tools require endless laborious trainings and certifications. They simply weren’t built like modern products for humans.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I recommend a crash course. Embed yourself within a B2B or B2C feature delivery team for a spell. Learn their rhythms, learn their language, soak up some of their instincts. You’ll need them to balance and blend your instincts for architectural correctness, scaling patterns, and firefighting.</span></li>
<li><span>You don’t have to become an expert in shipping features. But you should learn the elements of relationship-building the way a good product manager does. And you must learn enough about the product lifecycle that you can help debug and divert teams whose roadmaps are hopelessly intertwined and whose roadmaps are grinding to a halt.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Sociotechnical systems engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>The irreducible core of the SRE/devops skill set increasingly revolves around crafting and curating efficient, effective sociotechnical feedback loops that enable and empower engineers to ship code — to move swiftly, with confidence. Your job is not to say “no” or throw up roadblocks, it’s to figure out how to help them get to yes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Start with embracing releases. Lean hard into the deploy pipeline. The safest diff is the smallest diff, and you should ship automatically and compulsively. Optimize tests, CI/CD, etc so that deploys happen automatically upon merge to main, so that a single mergeset gets deployed at a time, there are no human gates, and everything goes live automatically within a few minutes of a developer committing their code. This is your holy grail, and most teams are nowhere near there.</span></li>
<li><span>Design and optimize on-call rotations that load balance the effort fairly and sustainably, and won’t burn people out. Apply the appropriate amount of pressure on management to devote enough time to reliability and fixing things versus just shipping new features. Hook up the feedback loops so that the people who are getting alerted are the ones empowered and motivated to fix the problems that are paging them. Ideally, you should page the person who made the change, every time.</span></li>
<li><span>Foster a culture of ownership and accountability while promulgating blamelessness throughout the org. Welcome engineers into production, and help them navigate production waters happily and successfully.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Managing the portfolio of technical investments.</b></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Operability is the longest term investment / primary source of technical debt, so no one is better positioned to help evaluate and amortize those risks than ops engineers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>When we write thoughts and ideas down with words for future recollection and synthesis, we take the stuff of abstract concepts, and collapse them down into a one-dimensional string of characters. For even the best, most careful writers, I think our ideas lose a lot of fidelity in this dramatic reduction in expressiveness of thoughts and their relationships to each other.</p>
<p>Our thoughts <em>in vivo</em> take on all kinds of shapes, and are connected in a myriad of relationships – by analogy, by example, by superset/subset relations, and so on. When we taxidermy them out onto paper or through the keyboard, we’re forced to flatten these relationships out onto a single dimension, usually nested bulleted links with verbal references  that leap across the page arbitrarily to connect related ideas to each other. Just think of the last time you jot down an idea in your note-taking method of choice – how much freedom did the medium afford you? At best, you’re writing freeform, pen-on-paper, and you draw arrows between related ideas and underline the important parts; typing on a keyboard into a text box is even more restrictive.</p>
<p>The internal structure of individual ideas vary even more greatly. Some thoughts contain lists of things, others are about comparisons between categories of things, and there are probably many more that can’t be named or enumerated or denoted with just a few lines going across the page between sentences. The state of the art in high-fidelity recording of our thoughts, in my opinion, is still handwriting on paper (or your digital handwriting app of choice). But here, we effectively lose our ability to search through information quickly, when we need it, because unlike bulleted lists, the information we hand-write isn’t <em>structured</em>.</p>
<p>This yields the question, <strong>how should we store and retrieve ideas in written form, so our workflows better preserve the living structure of thoughts?</strong></p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/structured-thought.jpg" alt="Structured thought">
</p>
<p>I’ve previously noted <a href="https://linus.coffee/note/abstraction/">the parallelism and contrast between programming and written languages</a>. I think the more precise, multi-dimensional language of computers may be better suited for articulating relationships between our ideas in the written form.</p>
<h2 id="structured-thought">Structured thought</h2>
<p>Why might programming languages be better suited for recording relationships between ideas than the written word?</p>
<p>One reason is that programming languages are purpose-designed for building up living data structures. Programs, in their normal course of life, build up precise lists and trees and other complex structures of values. If there were a programming language as such, whose primitive values were units of thought or ideas instead of integers and strings and arrays, would we be able to record and retrieve our past ideas more effectively? In other words, what if there was some sort of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language</a> for better note-taking? Can we view the macro-structure of our thoughts as a highly specialized, highly complex data structure that we can encode into programs? Probably not entirely, but for the more analytical ideas, I think it’s a thought experiment we can entertain using new and interesting tools.</p>
<p>The most promising tool I’ve found exploring this direction is <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. It stores ideas in a fluid, cross-linkable and searchable database of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>. But Roam is still pretty restricted to nested relationships and bidirectional links between ideas (though I admittedly haven’t tried it in depth). I think there’s lots of headroom here in the market for exploring more general data structures for ideas, and for allowing note-takers to create their own structures and layouts.</p>
<h2 id="a-runtime-for-human-abstractions">A runtime for human abstractions</h2>
<p>I think an ideal future extension of this idea isn’t just a written format that can be queried like Roam or some kind of a programming language, but an omnipresent, ambient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system"><em>runtime</em></a> for our thoughts and ideas – one that can interact fluidly with our environment and context, and maybe even preempt our recollections and augment our ability to sift through our ideas from the past and present.</p>
<p>Sci-fi literature has imagined an endless taxonomy of ways for humans to externalize our minds onto offboard computers and networks of mechanical brains, most of which yield the control of our memory storage and recollection to some artificial and autonomous system. But I think there are ways to extend our minds using more primitive tools like better notes, and a more carefully crafted runtime for structured thought. One where we continue to drive interactions with our memory, albeit with more powerful tools in hand to record what we think, and remember them at the right times, when we need them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to the second article of the series, <a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/series/jamstack-for-all-cke19xxge004uvls1auha9inv">JAMstack for All</a>. I would like to thank you for your likes, comments and feedback on the <em><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.greenroots.info/jamstack-for-all-an-introduction-cke2fxc5800jvabs15lhn4a9x">JAMstack Introduction</a></em> article. </p>
<p>In this article, we will be diving into the JAMstack workflow with a side-by-side comparison of the traditional, monolithic workflow. We will also understand that, JAMstack and SPA(single page application) are not same. </p>
<p>I have introduced the phrase <code>prebuilt markup</code> to you in the introductory article. It is a very powerful concept and promises lots to perform. We will see how the pre-building is going to help us achieve an important pillar or user experience, i.e., <code>speed</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you haven't read the previous article of the series yet, you can find it here, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.greenroots.info/jamstack-for-all-an-introduction-cke2fxc5800jvabs15lhn4a9x">JAMstack for All: An Introduction</a>. I would recommend you to read this for a better clarity on the history, what, why part of the JAMstack story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As per the report from <a target="_blank" href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2020/01/digital-2020-3-8-billion-people-use-social-media">wearesocial.com</a>, roughly 53% of all web page requests come from mobile phones, computers account for 44% of the total. This report was published in January 2020 and it shows that, the mobile usage share is increasing steadily over the years.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598151207392/QBCjPko_Z.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="we_are_social.png"></p>
<p>Just like myself, many of the mobile users are impatient. They do not like to wait longer for a page load, hate initial white screen or a loading indicator for long. Depending on the economy, place of living and earning, the types of mobile and the computation power differ. </p>
<p>There are still many users out there with single core mobile devices. There are users with high end mobiles with great hardware support. However speed is one of the  common needs for both the user classes. Do you know what? The users with high end mobile devices are more impatient than others, as they are used to the <code>fast</code> environment so much.</p>
<p>As an application developer, we need to count this important user expectation and design the experience accordingly. We need to make sure, the page loads faster. We must get users the required initial bytes of page information as soon as possible to reduce a <code>cold start</code>.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of JAMstack is the markup should be <code>prebuilt</code>. It means, we as developers can spend a few extra seconds in the build phase of an application than, expecting a customer to get frustrated by burning those extra seconds at the run time. Our customers wouldn't care at all, if we spend the extra time in building the application.</p>
<p>A typical user mindset for an application load where lots are happening in the browser (screen-shot from <em>Matt Biilmann's JAMstack at Scale: why pre-built markup is critical</em> presentation):</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598152532147/lthwdAoKm.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>A great amount of time goes in the initial load itself and it leads your users to bounce off the application or website easily. There is also a problem of not meeting user's expectation about the design. What if the users are not finding it useful and we have to rollback to the old state? Some production nightmares, isn't it?</p>
<p>With the <code>prebuilt</code> approach of JAMstack, we solve this to a great extent. All the required JavaScript along with the markup and styles are already built and served from a content delivery network(CDN). There is no waiting at the browser's runtime about what script and, which page to load.</p>
<p>The heavy lifting is done at once at the build time, which takes the processing time out of the request and eventually uses less computation at the run time.</p>
<p>The sections below show the difference in the build vs load time between the server rendered, SPA and JAMstack applications.</p>
<h3 id="server-rendered">Server Rendered</h3>
<p>In a server rendered application, all the heavy lifting is done by the server. The browser needs to request for a page and the server computes, generates the page. Once done, it sends the page to the browser as part of the response. The browser downloads the page and renders. This cycle repeats for each of the page loads and all happen over the wires all the times.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598153515145/fBxG_mmmm.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<h3 id="single-page-applicationspa">Single Page Application(SPA)</h3>
<p>A single page application solves the above problem greatly. The server doesn't handle the page computations, routing and request based serving. But the problem is, lots are happening on the client side. We are relying on the browser and the device power here for all the computations at the run time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598153551324/KWbNo82Xv.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<h3 id="jamstack">JAMstack</h3>
<p>With JAMstack's <code>prebuilt</code> mechanism, the content is already built. As the content was already built, there is no need for an origin server at all. The content can be served from a CDN. It solves both the problems we have seen with the <code>server rendered</code> apps and <code>SPA</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598153586296/GxJuCLbu3.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>There are several advantages of pre-building the content,</p>
<ul>
<li>Transpile JavaScript and build with markup and style.</li>
<li>Pull data from remote services.</li>
<li>Build C into WebAssembly.</li>
<li>Lint your code for accessibility (<code>Netlify</code> has introduced the build time plug-in system, will see it in the future article of the series).</li>
<li>Shaping up the data that are required by the UI component at the build time.</li>
</ul>
<p>How about the rollback issue we spoke above? We will learn about it shortly.</p>

<p>As we know about the benefit of pre-building the app now, we need to talk a bit about CDN, i.e, content delivery network. There is actually not much advantage, if a prebuilt mark up is served from an origin server. It will be almost similar to the server rendered applications.</p>
<p>Let us take an example. Assume that, an application content is being served from the origin server, <code>abcd.com</code> which is located in some part of the USA. A user like me who is from India wants to access a page from <code>abcd.com</code>. It may be a poor experience for me to render this page on my browser depending on my network speed, hardware capabilities, distance between my browser and the origin server etc. </p>
<p>How about, I have the page(or the content) hosted in my proximity in a secured manner? This where the CDN comes in. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598174766656/DnE3Lu5IT.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="CDN.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>CDN reduces the distance between the users and the website resources.</li>
<li>CDN reduces the amount of data to be transferred using minification techniques.</li>
<li>Helps in cache invalidation so that, users do not see the stale data.</li>
<li>It is secured.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am sure, we have a good ground on the <code>prebuilt</code> content and <code>CDN</code> by now. With that, let us understand some critical differences between a traditional workflow and JAMstack workflow.</p>
<h3 id="traditional-workflow">Traditional workflow</h3>
<p>In a traditional client-server workflow,</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers write code, test, build the <code>application</code>.</li>
<li>Ships the <code>application</code> to a server(<code>origin server</code>).</li>
<li>Users request a resource from the <code>origin sever</code> specifying a URL.</li>
<li>The origin server does the computations, produces the <code>required HTML</code> and send to the user. When the user requests a new resource, the process continues.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598175113805/9Mo0SqrFv.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Traditional.png"></p>
<h3 id="jamstack-workflow">JAMstack workflow</h3>
<p>In JAMstack workflow,</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers write code and push to a <code>source repository</code> like git.</li>
<li>A <code>workflow</code> kicks off which start the build to create <code>prebuilt content</code>.</li>
<li>The prebuilt content then gets deployed to a <code>CDN</code>.</li>
<li>Users request for the resources from the <code>CDN</code>(available in proximity) and the prebuilt content is served. No need to reach out to the origin server.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598175378452/lZL0CT9px.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="JAMstackflow.png"></p>
<p>It is also easy to manage customer expectations with JAMstack. The process of reverting a fix or rolling back to a specific state of the application with the traditional approach is difficult. It requires the process to plan a release, on board developers, tester, devops. Build the entire application again and then finally ship it to the server.</p>
<p>With JAMstack, the workflow is managed very easily. Here is an example from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> where all my branch deploys are available for me to make an easy switch and serve the application from it with a single click. We will learn about this workflow in details later in the series.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598175471575/qtBQcZxhl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>

<p>Great, so we know all about JAMstck and the fundamentals of it. Hope it was useful to you. In the next article, we will see the usage of Static Site Generators(SSG) and Headless CMS together. </p>
<p>We will go through the step-by-step way to build a JAMstack application using gatsbyjs, tie it with the git workflow and then deploy it with netlify. We will also learn to manage the content of our app using a CMS. It is going to be a fun learning with all the concepts we have got so far. Stay tuned!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>The new buzz word in town is the term CTO. As all industries start to embrace technology as part of the core business, the person incharge of this technology will then start to grow in its important. Do you then know what does the role of a CTO entails? Beyond the glamorous term comes with a ton of responsibilities that is paramount for the development of the company across its stages. If you ever inspires to be a CTO yourself someday, this article is for you.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>You jump off a cliff and you assemble an airplane on the way down. - Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will be going through these sections:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key learnings/ opportunities</p>

<br>
<h2>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Pre-seed stage</h3>

<p>Here you have 0 - 1 developer to basically kick start your entire idea. From git repo initilisation to actually be able to see a UI. Here is where your pre-seed stage will be.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Building the MVP</li>
</ul>

<p>Startup CTOs should be well versed in the tools and technologies available for building MVPs, whether those be web apps, mobile apps, desktop software. They cannot be afraid to get their hands dirty because even if there is a budget to hire a team, the CTO plays backup for any roles that cannot be immediately filled.</p>

<p>You need to create this MVP that can be able to gain real-time user feedback as fast as possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Early startup</h3>

<p>You actually have some intermittent market feedback of a market fit and now you are looking to ramp up your development work. Here, you will look to have 1 - 10 engineers to kick start your development process. I’ve come to believe that different companies sits in this stage for various durations. The size of the engineering team should only appropriately grow in proportion with the performance and traction of the product or service. You do not want to find yourself to be in a situation where you are mass-hiring but each engineers are actually relatively unproductive. You should only ramp up the size of the engineering when you have processes in place to better manage these additional manpower. Truly, many cooks spoil the broth. Listed below are some of the scope of a CTO in the early start phase:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Hiring engineers, IT professionals, and data scientists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding and bringing on engineering talent is one of the hardest things for tech startups to do. Hiring for cultural fit at a small startup is challenging. Many developers want to specialize while startups demand generalists.</p>

<p>CTO at a startup has to be good at hiring, onboarding, training, and eventually replacing the company’s technical staffs. Having a proven hiring process and strong network will help.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out company-wide security</li>
</ul>

<p>When no security policy was done before, it falls onto the lap of CTOs to own the security component, run audits, document security procedures, and train everyone on the basis of it.</p>

<p>Simple security includes a VPN to protect your servers &amp; database from public access.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Product management</li>
</ul>

<p>While the CTOs primary goal is to make the vision of the non-technical product manager a reality, it also means that they have to manage the flow of work into the engineering team. Often times, CTOs take an active role in laying out the product planning process. It is common for startup CTOs to learn both product and technology. Its challenging but learning new things is the norm at startups.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Clear technical debts<br>
A good startup CTO will recognize when poor architecture is slowing down the team, and will step in to settle these technical debts when needed. Eventually these architecture clean ups may be delegated to senior engineers, but it will be likely to fall onto the CTO once in a while.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Bug triage</li>
</ul>

<p>First without a Quality Assurance team, it falls onto the CTO to triage bugs, replicate and document down the behavior of the feature, then distribute these bugs to the team for a fix. Deciding how to debug an issue requires detailed understanding of the implementation.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>QA and testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a proper initial team of quality assurance engineers, the testing layer falls onto the responsibility of the engineering team, headed by the CTO. Planning out the testing layers requires hands-on, hands dirty experiments.</p>
<p>Attached is an article on how to create your testing layer in your company. Check it out <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ul>

<p>Your servers are your digital assets, and until a DevOps engineer is hired to manage these assets, it will too fall onto the CTO to manage them during the interim period.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Growth</h3>

<p>Here the company has been gaining traction and is now looking to grow the team from 10 - 100 engineers. The company’s product is starting to mature and people are looking to settle into your company as a possible career-long alternative. In here, then you have to focus on ensuring employee retention and a healthy career progression for each of your employees.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Vendor and customer relationship</li>
</ul>

<p>The CTO has to be clear to figure out what is needed to be done to streamline the company’s technical cost. It could be for the developers processes, or the company’s process through technology.<br>
This is essential if the product is starting to integrate with other softwares or has its own API. The external technical relationships will be the responsibility of the CTO. This is essential if we have power users whom are integrating with us, requesting for some ‘must-have’ features.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Team growth management</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing a team of 5 is different from managing a team of 100. Once the company expands and grow, you will start to hire more specialised engineers which isn’t looking for exciting and challenging tasks. Their focus will just be the traditional benefits, vacation days, and a structured career ladder. The ability to develop the skillset to manage the startup across different life stages will also be the challenge the CTO has to undergo.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Employee retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The early employees whom joined for the challenges may consider other options as the startup phases into a mid-sized startup. As tech workers has plenty of options, its rare to keep one for more than 2, 3 years. The CTO that moves the company across phases has to learn how to retain their employees with strong alignment to the worker’s personal goals.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Expansion</h3>

<p>Generally, once you are in the phase of expansion, you have to be laser focused to get your technology vision and mission in your company. This does not imply that your company has to utilize the latest technology all the time. Fundamentally, what is your company’s vision and problem statement? Focus on that, and ensure that we are using the best technology available out there to achieve this goal.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>The challenges a CTO face will be endless. Even as a developer, the amount of challenges you face are endless and everyday you have a ton of todos and blockers to clear. More specifically for CTOs, just as I was reading up on the this aspect, the key challenges faced by all CTOs are primarily hiring and alignment with business people.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Hiring</h3>

<p>Good engineers that can help you to marry business and technology are hard to find. It will be all the more in demand in times when the world is embracing digital transformation. Even investors are willing to put their millions into savings plans through video calls. It is key to hire not just gifted engineers but those whom will also help shape the culture of the business.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Focusing on customer engagement</h3>

<p>If you want to create a good technology, it is only just as good as whom the technology is created for. You may create the world’s first robotic arm for minimally invasive surgery but if i’m only washing dishes, why would that be of value to me? You have to benchmark the quality of your product to the utility of your target audience. They have the valuable feedback. In a world where there is a imperfect information, one can only move in the most informed decision; but always with a certain level of uncertainty and risk. Continuously engage with your ‘customers’ and find out what will empower them and set them up to do more with less using your product.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>5 Key learning opportunities</h2>

<p>Not everyone is born ready for such a big role. It will stretch you, ‘forces’ you to rise up to the occasion and you may even be surprised by what you are able to achieve when you’re placed under the pressurized cooker of your business demands. Generally, CTO is a leadership role. As glamorous as it may sound, it is still in essence just a role. What is most important is the being that is placed in that role. Are you developing yourself to face the bigger problems that are before you?</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Technical knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical leadership and strategy planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication and Mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management and Operational excellence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense of entrepreneurship and anticipation of the future</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>What better way to find out your key areas of learning opportunities than to hear from founders themselves. Here’s a video that To sum this part up</p>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>The end goal, the article gives a in-depth glimpse into the scope of a CTO’s day to day. How then can one possibly keep up with this pace of work? Only if you have a clear vision of the possible future. Technology is no longer just a tool for your Business-as-usual. It could possibly shape your future and redesign how life could be, should be, and will be.</p>

<p>From here on, I wish to share with you all a really cool podcast called <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://moderncto.io/">Modern CTO</a>. It is a podcast whom CTOs of all different companies will share some of their thoughts, journey, and learnings as CTOs. One thing is common: their level of curiosity for the world around them. Whatever role you are to play, stay curious and be a future explorer!</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>JDs and scope of CTOs across all stages of startup</h2>

<p>Vision &amp; Strategy</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting a vision for how technology will be used in the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>R&amp;D</p>
<ul>
<li>Outline the goals for research and development.</li>
<li>Research any new technologies that may potentially increase our company’s …</li></ul></span></p></div></div>

With over 20 years experience in Engineering management and VP R&amp;D roles in various startups and enterprise size organizations I can fully appreciate Wix’s unique investment in engineering and want to share some of the recipe for our secret sauce with you.</span></p><p id="viewer-12mhu"><span>I will not cover all of our engineering practices, since there are too many to fit in a blog post and since they are continually changing and evolving to adapt to our growth and needs.</span></p><p id="viewer-6dr1b">
<span>Instead, I want to focus on our unique formula for investing 20% of our engineering time in professional and community growth.</span></p><p id="viewer-27pfs"><span>Wix is an engineering-focused company: our founders are engineers and about 50% of Wix’s staff is R&amp;D. Since engineering is the heart and soul of Wix (as well as most of our muscle and brain power), we significantly invest in keeping our engineering in best shape by allocating 20% of every developer’s time to enhance their software engineering skills and build a strong, innovative and collaborative engineering community both within and outside of Wix.</span></p><p id="viewer-46gmb"><span>Can you imagine having 1 day a week, every week, allocated to growing your engineering skills? We do so since we genuinely believe (and that’s proven on a daily basis), that investing this time makes us better engineers and significantly increases our velocity, productivity and daily joy of creation.</span></p><p id="viewer-7njmm"><span><strong>So how does it work? How do we invest this valuable time?</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-ff74u"><span>Every Thursday, all engineers per site and profession (e.g. Server, Front End, Mobile, Data science, and QA) meet for half a day of training, knowledge sharing and community building activities.</span></p><p id="viewer-sfo"><span>If we zoom into the server guild, for example (which happens to be the guild I head), every guild day is different, but will typically include:</span></p><p id="viewer-70un7"><span>Project spotlights, where developers share their recent projects, product, architecture and/or technologies they worked with, and challenges they faced, and talk about the lessons they learned.</span></p><p id="viewer-6patl"><span>Themed training: every 3–6 months we select engineering topics we’d like to focus on. For example, in 2019 we picked Performance, API first, JVM Internals, and TDD. Every topic then evolves into a full syllabus which includes talks, workshops, live coding sessions and related use-cases demonstrations. Speaking about that Performance training example, it featured:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-eo71i"><p>Talks about Performance-oriented design </p></li><li id="viewer-50ub9"><p>Performance pitfalls demos </p></li><li id="viewer-fodaa"><p>Discussions about eventual consistency, product tradeoffs, and scale issues to consider for high Performance </p></li><li id="viewer-d3mf2"><p>Sharing of tools for monitoring and Performance tuning </p></li><li id="viewer-2f9q8"><p>Sharing “war stories” on Performance related issues and lessons from our day-to-day operations.</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-ct429"><span>After that everyone was more of a Performance expert.</span></p><div id="viewer-4jgs7"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/continually-growing-your-engineering-skills-while-scaling-the-organization-wix-engineering-culture" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_db738fb504a44936b124ae043f93f125~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1621,h_801,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_db738fb504a44936b124ae043f93f125~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-8vtgq"><span>All guild activities are created by our engineers, for our engineers, hence every developer gets to contribute content to our guild days. You do not necessarily need to be an expert in a specific subject, you just need to be passionate about learning and sharing the knowledge you gained.</span></p><p id="viewer-f3m6v"><span>This is where <strong>Tracks come in</strong>: these are typically an hour and a half long events where we have dozens of different activities you can choose from. Typically, in every guild day you get to select one of 4 different track options. A few examples of the variety of our tracks:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-a3f9k"><p>Mob programming (pair programming on steroids) — this is when you get to code in a group of fellow devs and get to share and learn coding standards, refactoring practices, Intellij tricks and incremental thinking. And come out with a working program. </p></li><li id="viewer-67g41"><p>Design track — where you share a design dilemma (typically one you’ve faced and solved for one of your products) and do a group design for it, discuss considerations, debate on tradeoffs, provide new perspectives and reach suggested design alternatives. </p></li><li id="viewer-n1h8"><p>Town Halls — these are mini unconferences where you can raise any issue / dilemma on your mind. Examples include talking about Mocks vs Stubs and working through questions like “how do I effectively estimate my tasks?” or  “how should we effectively enforce deprecations?”. We also hold group discussions to hear other people’s experiences and insights. Town halls will often suggest guidelines or areas to be addressed by the guild. </p></li><li id="viewer-44t34"><p>Building your professional brand track — where you get to invest and consult on your brand presence — this is a sounding board for your next idea for a tech talk or a blog post. This is where you get feedback from other engineers to help you shape your idea into reality and get more tips on how to grow your engineering brand presence. </p></li><li id="viewer-3vkln"><p>Learn a new coding language — where you get to learn (group-guided or self-guided) together. We had Node, Python, GO, Haskell, and more to come. </p></li><li id="viewer-3629s"><p>Pairing &amp; sharing — where you pair with a developer who’s not in your team and share a recent dilemma or a recent project and either do mutual code review, design brainstorming, or prepare for post mortems. The point is to both gain and provide fresh perspective on your day-to-day dilemmas.</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5kp3m">And since tracks change on a weekly basis — so much more, any dream you have on something you’d like to learn and practice together — easily becomes a track.</p><p id="viewer-27h86"><span>Every quarter you get to have a guild week. This is a week away from your team — where you get to pair with engineers who are not in your group and work together on tasks and initiatives outside your regular backlog.</span></p><p id="viewer-3mvq4"><span>You can pick a guild week track and here are a few examples for popular tracks:</span></p><p id="viewer-fum50"><span><strong>Infrastructure track</strong> — where you get to contribute and build the next generation of Wix infrastructure, framework &amp; tools, thus both helping to boost overall dev velocity, and give your perspective on usability of the framework</span></p><p id="viewer-al4sb"><span><strong>Join a team track</strong> — where you join a different team and work with them for a week. This allows you to both gain and provide a different perspective on code, developer practices, design, and production challenges. Learn another part of our huge product &amp; gain new friends in the guild.</span></p><p id="viewer-fm2et"><span><strong>OSS track</strong> — Where you help open source our products and infrastructure to contribute to the entire engineering community.</span></p><p id="viewer-34b0b"><span><strong>Academy track </strong>— where you get to work on your next guild talk / workshop or next conference talk (many Guild talks tend to become talks you give in global tech conferences) or work on your blog post. Accompanied by the great minds and mentors from our Wix Academy — helping to boost your talk graphics, stage presence &amp; delivery skills, dry-run and create stunning outcomes.</span></p><p id="viewer-59lcf"><span><strong>Bring your own track</strong> — Have an idea or initiative you’re dying to work on but never have the time to do it? You can bring it to a guild week, pair up with someone, and make it happen.</span></p><p id="viewer-egkvo"><span>So many options to choose from, so many worlds and perspectives to explore, all allowing us to break the routine, grow our engineering skills and experience while innovating, contributing and helping others. A perfect Win-Win-Win.</span></p><p id="viewer-981n8"><span>The Wix Engineering community and guilds exist and evolve beyond the scope of guild days and guild weeks, of course — with active slack channels, newsletters, shared boards and more, we continuously share knowledge and lessons learned. People are always willing to help and consult, which eliminates the fear or uncertainty about who or where to ask.</span></p><p id="viewer-85pl2">Well, initially we canceled all guild activities for a month or two allowing everyone to adjust to the new remote reality. But soon enough we revived all of those activities in a remote format. Guild days are conducted over Zoom, for workshops and tracks we break out to smaller groups via breakout rooms and we try doing something fun on every guild day like bot competitions, ice cream toast sharing, and funny group photos. </p><p id="viewer-5fna8">We also now conduct our guild days &amp; weeks globally allowing everyone to be exposed, contribute, and leverage knowledge across the entire guild and not just on the local site. So indeed, some of the intimacy and the f2f affect are gone, but so is the new reality. Guild days and weeks remain the glue of the guild and allow us all to feel like we are a part of something bigger, like we're closer together - which is even more important now, with the remote reality upon us.</p><p id="viewer-kodj"><span>Having a lively and vibrant engineering community gives each and every member an opportunity to grow and have access to the brilliant minds and experience of our hundreds of talented and passionate engineers.</span></p><p id="viewer-5himf"><span>This post was originally posted on </span><a href="https://medium.com/wix-engineering/continually-growing-your-engineering-skills-while-scaling-the-organization-the-unique-wix-596536b857ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Medium</u></span></a></p><div id="viewer-89qa6"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/continually-growing-your-engineering-skills-while-scaling-the-organization-wix-engineering-culture" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_3bd01b1f6be0412b8e1488a311bac363~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_351,h_351,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_3bd01b1f6be0412b8e1488a311bac363~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-1nd40">This post was written by <strong>Aviva Starovolsky-Peisach</strong>, </p><p id="viewer-e9brg"><span>Server Guild Manager</span></p><p id="viewer-b43n6"><strong>For more engineering updates and insights:</strong></p><ul><li id="viewer-6fijf"><p>Follow us on: <a href="https://twitter.com/WixEng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Twitter</u></a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WixEngineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Facebook</u></a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/wix-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>LinkedIn</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-6mhvr"><p>Visit us on <a href="https://github.com/wix" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>GitHub</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-csdk5"><p><a href="https://www.wix.engineering/subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Subscribe to our monthly newsletter</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-1qgpt"><p>Subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/WixTechTalks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>YouTube channel</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-akkj2"><p><a href="https://medium.com/wix-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Follow our Medium publication</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-b9lr2"><p>Listen to our podcast on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/il/podcast/wix-engineering-podcast/id1503976848" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Apple</u></a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5CmjtjpdcKkHDnr0601uYS?si=PcOf7Rx_RUmGojFj5n7CEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Spotify</u></a> or <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9yYW5sZXZpLmNvbS9mZWVkL3dpeF9wb2Qv&amp;ved=0CAAQ4aUDahcKEwjY3bLcy7_oAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Google</u></a></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<h4>Citizens of Strasbourg danced to death during the summer of 1518 and on one knew the reason behind&nbsp;it</h4>



<div><figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/4260b-0vvttv-mc7mqbqq5w.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>The Dancing plague. Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>People danced non stop in joy under the hot sun in the summer of 1518 in Strasbourg. Many believed that the city had sinned, and God had decided to punish them for their sins. The mystery of the dance party is still not known clearly, but it might contain traces of the troubled society of the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>



<h3><strong>The Start</strong>:</h3>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/e76cb-0fbsr4ey9waql_imj.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>The Dance.Source-Museumhack</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 1518 a woman by the name Frau Troffea was the first to start the dance mania. A group of people from the city soon joined her. The dance party took to new heights as the dancers fell in exhaustion, and many even died. The city administration pressed the service of medical personnel, and they were equally astonished by the strange phenomenon. The city administration employed musicians to cool down the situation with some light music, but it made things far worse. Some men argued that Frau Toffea started the dance as an excuse to escape from household chores, and other women joined her for the same.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tMlKb3iNsxXEIGQj" alt=""><figcaption>St Vitus.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As people after people fell, the city resorted to an act of holiness as any European city would do at this time. The city prayed for help to St Vitus, the patron of dance. There were talks that the town has sinned and God had punished them for the act. The city administration banned prostitution, alcohol, and even dance to cleanse themselves from sin. The dancers were taken to the church of St Vitus and were worn red shoes as a healing process. The dance phenomenon slowly watered down, and the city was back to normal.</p>



<h3><strong>Aftermath</strong>:</h3>

<p>Similar incidents popped up in the city of Aachen and some towns in Swiss. Modern psychologists attribute the strange phenomenon to the pandemic that swept across Europe during this time. The great plague consumed one-third of the European population. The faith of people on the religion had fainted during this period. The paranoia caused by the pandemic created psychological stress on the people, and they vented it out by their dance to death. The truth is no one knows yet why people in Strasbourg danced to death. With humanity now facing a pandemic at the scale of the great plague, we should be careful about the psychological effects of it in humans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The web is in need of some reinvention right now.</p><p>The web’s evolution over the last decade has mirrored the American economy. All of the essential indicators are going “up and to the right,” a steady stream of fundamental advances reassure use that there “is progress,” but the actual experience and effects for individuals stagnates or regresses.</p><p>The crisis affects platforms, creators, and consumers alike.</p><p><em>I’m going to try and dissect and diagnose this situation, a bit. You can skip forward if you just want to read my casual, unprofessional pitch for a reboot of the web. The idea is that we could choose a new lightweight markdown format to replace HTML &amp; CSS, split the web into documents and applications, and find performance, accessibility, and fun again.</em></p><details><summary>This post uses the pedantic definition of "the web"</summary>I've discussed attempts to reinvent the "Internet" a few times. Things like dat, IPFS, and arweave are all projects to reinvent an Internet, or a transport and data-sharing layer. The web is what lies on top of that, the HTML, CSS, URLs, JavaScript, browsing experience.</details><h3 id="the-platform-collapse">The platform collapse</h3><p>The platform side is what changed last week, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/">Mozilla laid off 250 employees</a> and indicated that it would affect Firefox development. Firefox wasn’t the #2 browser - that’s Safari, mainly because of the captive audience of iPhone and iPad users. But it was the most popular browser that people <em>chose</em> to use.</p><p><img alt="Chart of browser market share, with Chrome becoming the monopoly" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-chart-of-browser-market-share-with-chrome-becoming-the-monopoly.png"></p><p><em>Chart from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-202007">statcounter</a></em></p><p>The real winner is not just Chrome, but Chrome’s engine. One codebase, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML">KHTML</a>, split into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a> (Safari), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)">Blink</a> (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, etc.)</p><p>This a textbook monoculture. In one sense, it’s a victory for collaboration because nobody’s ‘wasting time’ on competing implementations and web developers can expect the same features and bugs across different browsers. But in a deeper way, it threatens one of the basic principles of how the web has evolved.</p><h3 id="specs--implementations">Specs &amp; implementations</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Decline" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.jpg"></picture></p><p>The web has evolved through a combination of <em>specifications</em> and <em>implementations</em>. Organizations like the <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> have been collaboration spaces for independent developers, corporations, and academics to discuss potential new features of the web. Then, browsers would test those ideas out in a variety of implementations.</p><p>This was an interesting structural piece: it reassured us all that it was <em>possible</em> to follow along, and that a multi-participant web was one of our goals. It was frustrating to pull up <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a> and see blank spots, but the idea was that different browsers may take the lead in some areas, but everyone catches up eventually. Chrome was not always the first to jump on features, or the first to optimize.</p><p>It’s slower to collaborate than to work alone, but it was beneficial in some ways that we’ve lost now. Chrome has been moving extremely fast, adding new specifications and ideas at a startling rate, and it’s becoming one of the hardest pieces of software to replicate.</p><p>Mike Healy I think <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_hasarms/status/1296575224599556097">said it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Do you think the web has almost ‘priced itself out of the market’ in terms of complexity if only 1-2 organisations are capable of building rendering engines for it?</p></blockquote><p>Not only is it nearly impossible to build a new browser from scratch, once you have one the ongoing cost of keeping up with standards requires a full team of experts. Read Drew DeVault’s <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html">Web browsers need to stop</a> for that point, and keep reading all of Drew’s stuff.</p><details><summary>What about Flow?</summary>Yep, there’s a <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/">browser called Flow</a>, which may exist and may support a full range of web standards. If it does exist, I’ll be very excited about it, but it has been teased for almost a year now without any concrete evidence, so it could equally be vaporware.</details><h3 id="the-problem-for-creators">The problem for creators</h3><p>The web has gotten much harder to develop for.</p><p>The web has had about 25 years to grow, few opportunities to shrink, and is now surrounded by an extremely short-sighted culture that is an outgrowth of economic and career short-termism. There are lots of <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/">ways to do anything</a>, and some of the most popular ways of building applications on the web are - in my opinion - <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">usually ghoulish overkill</a>.</p><p>The best way for folks to enter <em>web development</em> in 2020 is to choose a niche, like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> or <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, and hope that there’s a CSS and accessibility expert on their team.</p><p>For folks who just want to create a web page, who don’t want to enter an industry, there’s a baffling array of techniques, but all the simplest, probably-best ones are stigmatized. It’s easier to stumble into building your resume in React with GraphQL than it is to type some HTML in Notepad.</p><h3 id="the-problem-for-consumers">The problem for consumers</h3><p>We hope that all this innovation is <em>for the user</em>, but often it isn’t. Modern websites seem to be as large, slow, and buggy as they’ve ever been. Our computers are <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/11/15/something-is-wrong-with-computers.html">barely getting faster</a> and our internet connection speeds are stagnating (don’t even <em>try</em> to mention 5G). Webpage <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/webpages-are-getting-larger-every-year-and-heres-why-it-matters/">size growth</a> is outpacing it all.</p><p>The end result is that I no longer expect pages to be fast, even with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock</a> installed in Firefox and a good local <a href="https://sonic.net/">fiber internet provider</a>.</p><p>I don’t want to lay all of the blame at <em>those web developers</em>, though. Here’s a story from an old job that I find kind of funny. We were collecting some data from user interactions to answer simple questions like “do people click to upload or do they drag &amp; drop?” So we enabled <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>, a tool that lets you add data-collection pipelines by including a single script. The problem, though, is that Segment offered a big page of on/off switches with hundreds of data providers &amp; ad-tech companies on it. And, sure, enough, some folks closer to the business side started <em>clicking all those buttons</em>.</p><p>See, the problem with ads and data tracking is that <em>you can</em>, and who is going to say no? (In that instance, I said no, and added a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a> that would block new advertiser access at the page level.)</p><h2 id="recreating-simplicity">Recreating simplicity</h2><blockquote><p>You cannot get a simple system by adding simplicity to a complex system. - <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2012-March/065087.html">Richard O’Keefe</a></p></blockquote><p>Where do we go from here? Some of the smartest folks out there have been <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1296628134406692865">advocating for a major version revision</a> of the web.</p><p><em>I am in no way qualified to speculate on a whole new web from scratch, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/us/california-wildfires.html">air quality</a> is scary so I’m skipping my run and it’s Saturday morning so here we are.</em></p><p>How do we make the web fun, participatory, and good?</p><p>My first thought is that there are two webs:</p><h3 id="the-document-web">The document web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of web pages" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.jpg"></picture></p><p>There is the “document web”, like blogs, news, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook. This is basically the original vision of the web, as far as I can understand it (I was 2). Basically CSS, which we now think of as a way for designers to add brand identity and tweak pixel-perfect details, was instead mostly a way of making plain documents readable and letting the <em>readers</em> of those documents customize how they looked. This attribute actually <a href="https://twitter.com/autiomaa/status/1296755641164468224">survived for a while in Chrome, in the form of user stylesheets</a>, and <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/firefox-user-stylesheet">still works in Firefox</a>. Though it’s going to be a rough ride in the current web which has basically thrown away <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">semantic HTML</a> as an idea.</p><h3 id="the-application-web">The “application” web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of machines" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.jpg"></picture></p><p>Then there’s the “application web”. This started as <em>server</em> applications, built with things like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and before them a variety of technologies that will live forever in corporations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet">Java Servlets</a>.</p><p><a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> demonstrated that a lot of these applications could be moved into the browser, and then <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and its many SPA-style competitors established a new order for the web – highly-interactive, quite complex, client-side applications.</p><h3 id="the-war-between-the-parts-of-the-web">The war between the parts of the web</h3><p>I posit that this dual-nature is part of what gives the web its magic. But it’s also a destructive force.</p><p>The magic is that a simple blog can be creative expression, can be beautifully interactive. This one isn’t, but I’m just saying - <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day">it’s possible</a>.</p><p>The problem is that the “document web” is often plagued by application characteristics - it’s the JavaScript and animations and complexity that makes your average newspaper website an unmitigated disaster. Where document websites adopt application patterns they often accidentally sacrifice <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">accessibility</a>, performance, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">machine readability</a>.</p><p>And the “application web” is plagued by the document characteristics - interactive applications are going to great lengths to avoid most of the essential characteristics of HTML &amp; CSS and just use them as raw materials - avoiding writing any HTML directly at all, avoiding <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js">writing any CSS directly at all</a>, avoiding <a href="https://www.react-spring.io/">default animation features</a>, replacing <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">page-based navigation with something that looks like it but works completely differently</a>. The application web uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, not HTML, and would like that in the browser itself, or <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, instead of JavaScript, and would like that too.</p><p>When I read blog posts from ‘traditional web developers’ who are mad that HTML &amp; CSS aren’t enough anymore and that everything is complicated –&nbsp;I think this is largely that the application stack for building websites has replaced the document stack in a lot of places. Where we would use Jekyll or server-side rendering, we now use React or Vue.js. There are advantages to that, but for a lot of minimally-interactive websites, it’s throwing away decades worth of knowledge in exchange for certain performance perks that might not even matter.</p><p>The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create <em>documents</em> without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time. You don’t have to think about whether your last Facebook post will load quickly on your friend’s phone or whether your Instagram post will be correctly cropped and resized in the timeline - those things are taken care of.</p><p>To some extent, this doesn’t <em>need</em> to be something that only social networks provide, though: standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> and services like <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> show that pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the <em>platform level</em> and be provided on top of existing vanilla websites.</p><details><summary>These are not absolutes.</summary>Yeah, I can hear it now: but these categories are not …</details></div></div>

<div component="category-math">
<p>Ask.Moe's calculator is powered by Rob Pike's Ivy, an interpreter for an APL-like language. Input values may be integers (3, -1), rationals (1/3, -45/67) or floating point values (1e3, -1.5 (representing 1000 and -3/2)).</p>
<p>Please be aware that operators always have the same precedence and expressions are evaluated in right-associative order. That is, unary operators apply to everything to the right, and binary operators apply to the operand immediately to the left and to everything to the right. Thus, 3*4+5 is 27 (it groups as 3*(4+5)) and iota 3+2 is 1 2 3 4 5 while 3+iota 2 is 4 5. A vector is a single operand, so 1 2 3 + 3 + 3 4 5 is (1 2 3) + 3 + (3 4 5), or 7 9 11. Arithmetic has the obvious operations: + - * etc. ** is exponentiation. mod is modulo.</p>
<p>Try the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=2*3%2B4">2*3+4</a>. Parsed as 2*(3+4), not the usual (2*3)+4.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=2**2%2B3">2**2+3</a>. Parsed as 2**5, not (2**2) + 3.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=(2**2)%2B3">(2**2)+3</a>. Use parentheses if you need to group differently.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=3%2F1e10">3/1e10</a>. Not an integer, but an exact rational.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=2**6400">2**6400</a>. A really big integer.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=(2**1e3)%2F(3**1e2)">(2**1e3)/(3**1e2)</a>. Rationals can be very big too.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=char+0x1f4a9">char 0x1f4a9</a>. Char is an operator: character with given value.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=1+2+3+%2B+4+5+6">1 2 3 + 4 5 6</a>. Arithmetic works elementwise on vectors.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=(1+%3C%3C+1+2+3+4+5)+%3D%3D+(2+**+1+2+3+4+5)">(1 &lt;&lt; 1 2 3 4 5) == (2 ** 1 2 3 4 5)</a>. Note: true is 1, false is 0.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=pi%3B+e">pi; e</a>. pi and e are built-in, high-precision constants.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=sqrt+2">sqrt 2</a>. Ivy stores irrational results in high-precision (default 256-bit) floating point numbers.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=a%3D5%3B+a%3B+a*10">a=5; a; a*10</a>. Assign variables with the = operator, use semicolons to perform multiple operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=op+primes+N+%3D+(not+T+in+T+o.*+T)+sel+T+%3D+1+drop+iota+N%3B+primes+50">op primes N = (not T in T o.* T) sel T = 1 drop iota N; primes 50</a>. primes less than N (unary).</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=3+20+rho+1">3 20 rho 1</a>. Ivy allows multidimensional arrays. The binary shape operator, rho, builds them.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=5+5+rho+iota+25">5 5 rho iota 25</a>. Dimension (which may be a vector) on the left, data on the right.</li>
</ul>

<p>A flexible password manager for dealing with stateful and stateless password profiles.</p>
<p>voidpass has two main features:</p>
<ol>
<li>New passwords generated are stateless meaning that the password is never saved, encrypted or otherwise. Passwords can be generated on any machine running voidpass only requiring a website, username, and a master password.</li>
<li>Existing passwords are encrypted (AES SIC) and the ciphertext is saved. This allows existing passwords to be migrated over if desired.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Dart 2.7.1</li>
<li><a href="https://pub.dev/packages/encrypt" rel="nofollow">encrypt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pub.dev/packages/crypto" rel="nofollow">crypto</a></li>
</ul>

<p><code>make build-cli</code></p>

<p><code>make test</code></p>

<pre><code>Usage: ./voidpass &lt;command&gt;

voidpass commands

generate - Generates a new password profile (does not save password)
add - Adds an existing password (encrypts password and saves to file)
delete - Remove a password profile
list - Lists metadata for all passwords
search - Searches through password profile file and returns relevent profile entries
retrieve - Retrieves profile entry and reveals password
help - Shows this menu

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>2020: an isolation odyssey</em> is a reenactment of the iconic finale of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (Stanley Kubrick, 1968). Restaged in the context of home quarantine, the journey through time adapts to the mundane dramas of self-isolation–poking fun at the navel-gazing saga of life alone and indoors.</p>

<p>This project began in late March and was completed in late May, spanning the height of the pandemic in New York City. Staged in a one bedroom Brooklyn apartment, <em>2020</em> presents an obvious similarity to the domestic setting of <em>2001</em>. The stacked videos and synced movements also reveal parallels in emotion. The narrowness of daily life in a single space, transitioning from confusion to acceptance, a distorted sense of time, and ‘returning’ after a transformational event–all experiences analogous to quarantine. </p>

<p>The adapted version delineates the passing of time through wardrobe rather than age, identifying each phase of the character’s journey with a product of self care or PPE. Tools of private entertainment or self betterment are also used as props, questioning our confidence in products and productivity as anchors during times of uncertainty. Multitasking while #wfh, conjuring guilt or longing with unused exercise equipment, your entire being reduced to a measure of time–these scenes all illustrate the absurd comedy of trying to maintain control during this unprecedented and unpredictable time.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are a wide range of reactjs tutorials available online but not many of them are optimised for a bootstrapper wanting to hack together a product as soon as possible while not compromising too much on quality. This was the exact problem we faced while building our <a href="https://www.superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank">product</a>.</p><p>As many web developers will tell you, the core business logic is never the bottleneck. What consumes the most amount of time is styling the UI and polishing it to adhere to the UI/UX expectations of 2020 while also being responsive on devices of all shapes and sizes.</p><p>So what if there was a library that takes care of all of these things and allows you to focus solely on your business logic? This is exactly what <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris</a> does.&nbsp; It is a library of react components built by Shopify and they use it for their own UI as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Using Polaris is as simple of piecing a bunch of lego blocks together to build something. Each of these lego blocks are react components which can be customised by simply changing the properties provided to that component. To use Polaris you would need to know the basic concepts of <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">reactjs</a>.</p><p>Once this is done, the app is automatically responsive on devices of all shapes and sizes. So what lego blocks do we need to build a web application? Lets go over all the lego blocks that worked really well for us.</p><h4><strong>Building blocks of an application</strong></h4><p><strong>Top bar</strong><br></p><p>A great place to display your product logo on the left and account information on the right.

You can find all of them <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/components/get-started" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>They also have a bunch of design guidelines around the usage of these components. One does not have to adhere to these guidelines but they definitely help because they are something that Shopify uses and it works great for them.</p><h4><strong>What is the catch?</strong><br></h4><p>Polaris was primarily designed for solving various UI/UX problems that occur in the Shopify systems. This does not mean that they are not useful for things that are built outside of Shopify, it just means that there needs to be an overlap between the product you are trying to build and every use case that Shopify encounters.</p><p>It is a great way to bootstrap a product at lightning speed, but the catch is that the components are not very customisable. They are meant to be picked up and used as is with tweaks made only to the properties passed as arguments to the component.</p><p>You might find yourself in a tricky position if you have to implement a component with custom CSS alongside polaris components. But for the most part polaris has default components to cover most cases and there are workarounds for achieving custom CSS.</p><p>An example of the work around is that we wanted to change the default colour of a Polaris primary button to our own brand colour and we did this by overriding that particular css property globally and changing the colour with a&nbsp; <strong>!important</strong> at the end.</p><figure id="w-node-e058c95d6fdf-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f41ed90ac0649063966176b_kDEWmUJlN21aXLtWJH8Eb0vXc8-SlkKBgyNe9c78FSgbFRJfDPSCTDAtQIqttLNMTDuJ2wYyuYMl_P_n9kzekP2YkpTDzoPwjMbNmCXG_DTI-Jo1aTDHOar3J3R1L1dE8-AgQ3lc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CSS&nbsp;override for Polaris</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Closing note</strong><br></h4><p>For someone that is just getting started with reactjs, using a library like this is a great way to focus on core business logic while at the same time learning the concepts of react without spending time on styling your components.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Serverless computing is not a new concept anymore. It is already quite known and nowadays getting more and more traction as all major cloud providers offer some serverless compute runtime, sometimes also referred to as a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run and Azure Functions are some popular implementations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">
    <img src="https://johansiebens.dev/uploads/OpenFaaS_10_31_2.5_png.png" width="200"> </a>
</figure>


<p>Also in the Open Source community are some very popular implementations available, like <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/" target="_blank">OpenFaas</a>. It allows you to build your Function-as-a-Service platform on top of Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, avoiding vendor lock-in. One of the unique selling points of OpenFaas is maybe its <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/architecture/faas-provider/" target="_blank"><code>faas-provider</code></a> interface. It makes the platform open for extension by allowing to add other runtimes like HashiCorp Nomad, AWS Fargate, …</p>

<p>The official providers are targeted towards Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, but there is a little sibling in the family of implementations, named <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd" target="_blank">faasd</a>. “Little” in a sense that it is more lightweight, not because it has less features or is less powerful.</p>

<p>faasd is a single binary, but uses the same core components and ecosystem of OpenFaaS. Under the hood it uses <a href="https://containerd.io/" target="_blank">containerd</a>, which makes it ideal for a building a serverless home lab that doesn’t require much computing resources. Like a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h2 id="installing-faasd-on-a-raspberry-pi">Installing faasd on a Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>To go from zero to a working faasd on a Raspberry Pi, it does takes some steps to follow. The installation of this lightweight serverless platform is already explained thoroughly by many others, like <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/faasd-for-lightweight-serverless/" target="_blank">Alex Ellis</a> and <a href="https://myedes.io/serverless-on-raspberrypi/" target="_blank">Mehdi Yedes</a>, so I’m not going into detail here. In a nutshell, it comes down to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>download a Raspios (previously known as Raspbian) image and</li>
<li>flash to an SD card</li>
<li>boot a Raspberry Pi with the SD card</li>
<li>ssh into the Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>install dependencies

<ul>
<li>containerd (not available for arm out-of-the-box)</li>
<li>CNI plugins</li>
</ul></li>
<li>setup container networking</li>
<li>install faasd</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, those steps are not that hard to follow, and with some bash scripts or tools like Ansible, you can execute them in an automated way. But even with some automation, you still have to flash the image, boot the Raspberry Pi, find it’s IP address, … before you can start with the installation, automated or not.</p>

<p>In a virtual environment, like a public cloud provider, this is sometimes solved by baking an image with all required software pre-installed. When administrators create a new instance with such an image instead of a base OS image, the time between starting the machine and a working service ready to process request will be less, because no additional software will be installed during boot. This technique is known as <em>Immutable Infrastructure</em>, which allows you to scale up to meet demand in a fast and provable manner as possible.</p>

<p>What if we could build an image for a Raspberry Pi with faasd and all its dependencies already installed?</p>

<h2 id="building-an-appliance-with-packer">Building an appliance with Packer</h2>

<p>One of the most popular tools for creating machine images is <a href="https://packer.io/" target="_blank">Packer</a> from HashiCorp:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Packer is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant, creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most obvious use case of Packer is building images for a virtual environment, such as AWS, GCP, VMware, Virtualbox, … and comes with many builders for various platforms by default. But luckily for us, one could easily extend Packer by adding custom builders. One of those custom builders is the <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/packer-builder-arm-image" target="_blank">packer-builder-arm-image</a> created by solo.io, and guess what, it is for building custom arm images, especially for the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Perfect! Exactly what I needed.</p>

<p>I grabbed all the bash scripts I was using before, put them in a Packer template, and started baking the new image with faasd and the dependencies.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">{
  <span>"variables"</span>: {
    <span>"faasd_version"</span>: <span>"0.8.2"</span>
  },
  <span>"builders"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"type"</span>: <span>"arm-image"</span>,
      <span>"iso_url"</span>: <span>"https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2020-02-07/2020-02-05-raspbian-buster-lite.zip"</span>,

      <span>"iso_checksum_type"</span>: <span>"sha256"</span>
    }
  ],
  <span>"provisioners"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"type"</span>: <span>"shell"</span>,
      <span>"environment_vars"</span>: [
        <span>"FAASD_VERSION={{user `faasd_version`}}"</span>
      ],
      <span>"scripts"</span>: [
        <span>"scripts/install-cloud-init.sh"</span>,
        <span>"scripts/install-faasd.sh"</span>
      ]
    }
  ]
}</code></pre></div>
<p>The Packer build will take some time, but as soon as it was finished, I flashed my custom image to an SD card and booted a Raspberry Pi. As expected, a few moments later, faasd was available and ready to deploy some functions.</p>

<p>Great, now I have an image I can reuse every time I want to create a new Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>But wait… What about the OpenFaas credentials that get created when installing faasd? Aren’t they part of the image as well? It seems like the image isn’t that reusable after all.</p>

<p>Not only the OpenFaas credentials should be customizable, but maybe other users would also like to configure authorized ssh keys, or a unique hostname (because Raspbian has by default raspberry as hostname) or a static IP address, or maybe wifi configuration, etc. It was clear to me: to make the image reusable for anyone; I needed to find a way to easily customize the image after flashing it to an SD card.</p>

<p><strong>Configure the SD card with cloud-init</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://johansiebens.dev/posts/2020/08/building-a-nomad-cluster-on-raspberry-pi-running-ubuntu-server/" target="_blank">previous blog post</a>, I already mentioned the use of cloud-init to configure a Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately, cloud-init is not installed by default on Raspbian, but is available as a package in the apt repository. After adding the installation in the Packer template and running the Packer build, this is the new workflow to go from zero to faasd:</p>

<ul>
<li>get the image</li>
<li>flash to SD card</li>
<li>edit user-data</li>
<li>boot Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>

<p>Eureka! An image with faasd that anyone can use without a hassle!</p>

<h2 id="exposing-the-private-faasd-with-tls">Exposing the private faasd with TLS</h2>

<p>Ok, so now that we have that image, it is quite easy to start a new private faasd instance. Having a private faasd installation is great, but what if you have some functions that you want to expose to the outside world, like a webhook receiver?</p>

<p>Let’s add <a href="https://inlets.dev/" target="_blank">inlets</a>, a cloud native tunnel that allows you to expose private endpoints to the Internet, to our little stack. inlets PRO will use TLS to provide link-level encryption to prevent snooping on tunnel traffic. Besides inlets, we also add <a href="https://caddyserver.com/" target="_blank">Caddy</a> to obtain a certificate, via Let’s Encrypt, for OpenFaas by tunneling out port 80 and 443 instead of the plaintext HTTP port 8080.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash

systemctl enable inlets</code></pre></div>
<p>In the end, we have an image with:</p>

<ul>
<li>cloud-init</li>
<li>faasd</li>
<li>Caddy</li>
<li>inlets PRO</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to use the image</strong></p>

<p>To expose the faasd gateway running on a Raspberry Pi with inlets, you need to create an exit-node with a public IP. I find the use of <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl" target="_blank">inletsctl</a> the easiest way to achieve this. Download the latest release or install it by running <code>curl -sSLf "https://inletsctl.inlets.dev" | sudo sh</code></p>

<p>Next, create an exit-node on your favourite cloud provider, e.g. on DigitalOcean:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">inletsctl create <span>\
</span><span></span>  --provider digitalocean <span>\
</span><span></span>  --access-token-file <span>\~</span>/access-token.txt <span>\
</span><span></span>  --region lon1 <span>\
</span><span></span>  --remote-tcp <span>127</span>.0.0.1</code></pre></div>
<p>The last flag, <code>--remote-tcp</code>, tells the inlets pro client where to send traffic, which in this case will be the loopback-interface. The inlets pro client is configured to punch out ports 80 and 443 out of the tunnel.</p>

<p>One thing left to do: get a domain ready for your faasd installation. Once you have a domain, required for Caddy to generate some TLS certificates with Let’s Encrypt, add a DNS A record with the public IP of the exit-node.</p>

<p>The final steps are, in fact, the same as before:</p>

<ul>
<li>get the custom image (cloud-init + faasd + caddy + inlets pro)</li>
<li>flash to SD card</li>
<li>edit user-data (OpenFaas credentials, inlets token, …)</li>
<li>boot Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span>

<span># Set your hostname here, the manage_etc_hosts will update the hosts file entries as well</span>
hostname: faasd
manage_etc_hosts: <span>true</span>

<span># Add an authorized ssh key</span>

<p>A lot of people don’t realize that there are general purpose problem solving techniques that cut across domains. They can help you deal with thorny challenges in work, your personal life, startups, or even if you’re trying to prove a new theorem in math.</p>



<p>Below are the 26 general purpose problem solving techniques that I like best, along with a one-word name I picked for each, and hypothetical examples to illustrate what sort of strategy I’m referring to.</p>



<p>Consider opening up this list whenever you’re stuck solving a challenging problem. It’s likely that one or more of these techniques can help!</p>



<h4>General Purpose Techniques for Solving Challenging Problems of All Kinds</h4>



<p>1. <strong>Clarifying</strong> – try to define the problem you are facing as precisely as you can, maybe by writing down a detailed description of exactly what the problem is and what constraints exist for a solution, or by describing it in detail to another person, which may lead to you realizing the problem is not quite what you had thought, or that it has a more obvious solution than you thought.</p>



<p>Life Example: <em>“I thought that I needed to find a new job, but when I thought really carefully about what I don’t like about my current job, I realized that I could likely fix those things by talking to my boss or even, potentially, just by thinking about them differently.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“we thought we had a problem with users not wanting to sign up for the product, but when we carefully investigated what the problem really was, we discovered it was actually more of a problem of users wanting the product but then growing frustrated because of bad interface design.”</em></p>



<p>2. <strong>Subdividing</strong> – break the problem down into smaller problems in such a way that if you solve each of the small problems, you will have solved the entire problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example:<em> “My goal is to get company Z to become a partner with my company, and that seems hard, so let me break that goal into the steps of (a) listing the ways that company Z would benefit from becoming a partner with us, (b) finding an employee at company Z who would be responsive to hearing about these benefits, and (c) tracking down someone who can introduce me to that employee.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example:<em> “I want to prove that a certain property applies to all functions of a specific type, so I start by (a) showing that every function of that type can be written as a sum of a more specific type of function, then I show that (b) the property applies to each function of the more specific type, and finally I show that (c) if the property applies to each function in a set of functions then it applies to arbitrary sums of those functions as well.”</em></p>



<p>3. <strong>Simplifying </strong>– think of the simplest variation of the problem that you expect you can solve that shares important features in common with your problem, and see if solving this simpler problem gives you ideas for how to solve the more difficult version.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I don’t know how to hire a CTO, but I do know how to hire a software engineer because I’ve done it many times, and good CTOs will often themselves be good software engineers, so how can I tweak my software engineer hiring to make it appropriate for hiring a CTO?”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I don’t know how to calculate this integral as it is, but if I remove one of the free parameters, I actually do know how to calculate it, and maybe doing that calculation will give me insight into the solution of the more complex integral.”</em></p>



<p>4. <strong>Crowd-sourcing</strong> – use suggestions from multiple people to gain insight into how to solve the problem, for instance by posting on Facebook or Twitter requesting people’s help, or by posting to a Q&amp;A site like Quora, or by sending emails to 10 people you know explaining the problem and requesting assistance.</p>



<p>Business Example: <em>“Do you have experience outsourcing manufacturing to China? If so, I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts about how to approach choosing a vendor.”</em></p>



<p>Health Example: <em>“I have trouble getting myself to stick to doing exercise daily. If you also used to have trouble getting yourself to exercise but don’t anymore, I’d love to know what worked to make it easier for you.”</em></p>



<p>5. <strong>Splintering</strong> – if the problem you are trying to solve has special cases that a solution to the general problem would also apply to, consider just one or two of these special cases as examples and solve the problem just for those cases first. Then see if a solution to one of those special cases helps you solve the problem in general.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to improve employee retention in general, let me examine how I could have improved retention in the case of the last three people that quit.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to convince a large number of people to become customers, let me first figure out how to convince just Bill and John to become customers since they seem like the sort of customer I want to attract, and see what general lessons I learn from doing that.”</em></p>



<p>6. <strong>Reading</strong> – read the books or textbooks that seems most related to the topic, and see whether they provide a solution to the problem, or teach you enough related information that you can now solve it yourself. </p>



<p>Economics Example: <em>“Economists probably have already figured out reasonable ways to estimate demand elasticity, let’s see what an econometrics textbook says rather than trying to invent a technique from scratch.”</em></p>



<p>Mental Health Example: <em>“I’ve been feeling depressed for a long time, maybe I should read some well-liked books about depression, such as ‘Feeling Good.'”</em></p>



<p>7. <strong>Searching </strong>– think of a similar problem that you think practitioners, bloggers or academics might have already solved and search online (e.g., via google, Q&amp;A sites, or google scholar academic paper search) to see if anyone has done a write-up about how they solved it.</p>



<p>Advertising Example: <em>“I’m having trouble figuring out the right advertising keywords to bid on for my specific product, I bet someone has a blog post describing how to approach choosing keywords for other related products.”</em></p>



<p>Machine Learning Example:<em> “I can’t get this neural network to train properly in my specific case, I wonder if someone has written a tutorial about how to apply neural networks to related problems.”</em></p>



<p>8. <strong>Unconstraining</strong> – list all the constraints of the problem, then temporarily ignore one or more of the constraints that make the problem especially hard, and try to solve it without those constraints. If you can, then see if you can modify that unconstrained solution until it becomes a solution for the fully constrained problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I need to hire someone who can do work at the intersection of machine learning and cryptography, let me drop the constraint of having cryptography experience and recruit machine learning people, then pick from among them a person that seems both generally capable and well positioned to learn the necessary cryptography.”</em></p>



<p>Computer Science Example: <em>“I need to implement a certain algorithm, and it needs to be efficient, but that seems very difficult, so let me first figure out how to implement an inefficient version of the algorithm (i.e., drop the efficiency constraint), then at the end I will try to figure out how to optimize that algorithm for efficiency.”</em></p>



<p>9. <strong>Distracting</strong> – fill your mind with everything you know about the problem, including facts, constraints, challenges, considerations, etc. and then stop thinking about the problem, and go and do a relaxing activity that requires little focus, such as walking, swimming, cooking, napping or taking a bath to see if new ideas or potential solutions pop into your mind unexpectedly as your subconscious continues to work on the problem without your attention.</p>



<p>Example: <em>“For three days, I’ve been trying to solve this problem at work, but the solution only came to me when I was strolling in the woods and not even thinking about it.”</em></p>



<p>Example from mathematician Henri Poincaré: <em>“The incidents of the travel made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Coutances, we entered an omnibus to go someplace or other. At the moment when I put my foot on the step, the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it, that the transformations I had used to define the Fuchsian functions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry.”</em></p>



<p>10. <strong>Reexamining</strong> – write down all the assumptions you’ve been making about the problem or about what a solution should look like (yes – make an actual list). Then start challenging them one by one to see if they are actually needed or whether some may be unnecessary or mistaken.</p>



<p>Psychology Example: <em>“We were assuming in our lab experiments that when people get angry they have some underlying reason behind it, but there may be some anger that is better modeled as a chemical fluctuation that is only loosely related to what happens in the lab, such as when people are quick to anger because they are hungry.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I need to construct a function that has this strange property, and so far I’ve assumed that the function must be smooth, but if it doesn’t actually need to be then perhaps I can construct just such a function out of simple linear pieces that are glued together.”</em></p>

<p>Google has published a document on <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety/rust-and-c-interoperability">Rust and C++ interoperability</a> in the context of Chromium. It describes their criteria for the experience of calling C++ from Rust — minimal use of <code><span>unsafe</span></code>, no boilerplate beyond existing C++ declarations, and broad support for existing Chromium types.</p>

<p>The response to this document has included a lot of confusion and misinformation. Really, this is a continuation of a larger ongoing discussion of how to use <code><span>unsafe</span></code> properly. Rust FFI and <code><span>unsafe</span></code> are complicated and often subtle topics, so here I am going to attempt to summarize the issues and suggest how we might address them.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-unsafe-exactly">What is <code><span>unsafe</span></code>, exactly?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>’s core value proposition is to “guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile time,” without sacrificing the ability to target the same use cases as C++ (namely: performance-critical, embedded, and/or integrated with other languages).</p>

<p>This memory and thread-safety (henceforth just “safety”) is normally enforced automatically by the compiler. However, Rust includes several features that are <em>not</em> checked in this way, including raw pointers, global mutable state, untagged unions, and (notably) the ability to call functions written in other languages. These features can only be used within an <code><span>unsafe</span></code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// This function accepts a raw pointer, which may be null, misaligned, dangling, etc.</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// The compiler rejects this:</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span><span>address</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// The compiler accepts this:</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>let</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span><span>address</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rust provides these operations with the intent that they will be used <em>only</em> as building blocks for safe APIs. In other words, while the compiler does not enforce them, there <em>are</em> a set of rules governing the safe use of these operations.</p>

<p>Thus, an <code><span>unsafe</span></code> block is more than a mere warning that “this program might crash or corrupt the heap.” It is a marker that the program author has checked that they are following those rules! This is why <code><span>unsafe</span></code> is not “viral,” and we can still have safe Rust programs even with <code><span>unsafe</span></code> in the standard library:</p>

<p><strong>The most important part of an <code><span>unsafe</span></code> block is the surrounding context that ensures its contents will never break those rules, no matter how it is used.</strong> (The question of <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2016/01/09/the-scope-of-unsafe.html">“how much context?”</a> is an interesting one. It’s a bit of a tangent to this post, but the answer is generally based on module privacy.)</p>

<h3 id="how-can-calling-c-ever-be-safe">How can calling C++ ever be safe?</h3>

<p>When a Rust program calls a foreign function (that is, one written in another language like C++), there are several ways things can go wrong, breaking Rust’s memory and thread-safety promise. We can split them into two failure modes, which the surrounding context will need to prevent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each foreign function’s type signature must be declared in the calling Rust program, because the compiler doesn’t read any external formats like C++ header files.</p>

    <p>This means the signature may not match the actual function, in which case the compiler produces garbage, and the call will probably corrupt the stack or similar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each foreign function must be called following certain rules (e.g. “only call this once,” “only call this from one thread at a time,” “don’t pass a null pointer,” “this array argument must have at least N elements”).</p>

    <p>This means arguments or program state may not be valid, in which case the foreign function itself will probably do something to violate memory or thread-safety.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Writing matching type signatures by hand can be quite mechanical, tedious, and error-prone. When those signatures are simple enough, tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen"><code><span>bindgen</span></code></a> can instead automatically generate them from C or C++ headers. This eliminates a whole class of bugs!</p>

<p>However, C++ type signatures encode more information than <code><span>bindgen</span></code> understands, including <em>ownership</em> information — who is responsible for freeing the object, and when and how should they do so? The <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/"><code><span>cxx</span></code></a> binding generator understands several standard C++ “vocabulary” types like <code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span></code> and <code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>unique_ptr</span></code>, expanding the class of bugs we can eliminate.</p>

<p>The caller of a foreign function may not need to worry about the first failure mode, if they can use a tool like <code><span>bindgen</span></code> or <code><span>cxx</span></code>, but the second failure mode is more fundamental. They must inspect the foreign function and its documentation, and then add static or dynamic checks that ensure safe Rust programs can’t violate that function’s safety rules.</p>

<p>At this point, <strong>we can be sure that the Rust program is safe by inspecting these three things:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The foreign function: it must actually be safe to call when following the rules enforced on the Rust side.</li>
  <li>The Rust call site: it must actually enforce the rules required by the foreign function.</li>
  <li>The binding generator tool: it must correctly translate the foreign language’s type signatures to Rust.</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole <em>rest</em> of the Rust program no longer matters at all, because it’s already checked by the Rust compiler.</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-the-problem">So what’s the problem?</h3>

<p>After <code><span>cxx</span></code>’s announcement, it immediately received an issue titled <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/issues/1">“Calling from Rust to C++ is not safe”</a>, which cut directly to the core of this discussion: <code><span>cxx</span></code> generates wrapper functions that make the <code><span>unsafe</span></code> foreign function calls for you, so a Rust program can call C++ without the literal text <code><span>unsafe</span></code> anywhere in its source code.</p>

<p>It’s important to approach this with the realization that this particular aspect of <code><span>cxx</span></code> was <em>not</em> a new development. From the start, the Rust ecosystem has relied on macros and build scripts that generate <code><span>unsafe</span></code> blocks. Some of these macros are always safe to use, containing the blocks’ entire “safety context,” while others expect their users to do some extra safety checking on their own.</p>

<p>When a Rust function requires its callers to do some extra safety checking, you can add the <code><span>unsafe</span></code> keyword to its declaration, which makes it into a new unsafe operation that can only be invoked from another <code><span>unsafe</span></code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// This function can only be called from an `unsafe` block:</span>
<span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>..</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// This is only okay if `&amp;x` is valid for whatever `read` does with `address`:</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In a sense, <code><span>unsafe</span></code> functions like this are the <em>exact opposite</em> of <code><span>unsafe</span></code> blocks. An <code><span>unsafe</span></code> <em>block</em> says “I’ve ensured that these operations are always safe.” An <code><span>unsafe</span></code> <em>function</em> says “The caller is responsible for ensuring this operation is always safe.” Ideally, both should carry comments justifying their correctness — on blocks, pointing out the safety checks; on functions, describing the rules the caller must follow.</p>

<p>However, code generation happens before and outside of this whole system! There’s no way to mark a macro or build script as an <code><span>unsafe</span></code> operation. This is the real question here: <strong>Where do we put the comments justifying that generated, safe wrapper functions enforce the foreign functions’ safety rules, and how would an audit know to look for them?</strong></p>

<h3 id="what-are-our-options">What are our options?</h3>

<p>I begin with a couple of obligatory non-options:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why don’t you want <code><span>unsafe</span></code> blocks at all your FFI call sites? Isn’t the whole point of Rust to be safe by default, and mark all the exceptions to make debugging easier?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is deeply unsatisfying, and flies in the face of Rust’s usual approach to language design: “eat your cake and have it too!” We should be able to isolate most FFI-related unsafety to the FFI layer. To quote Google’s first requirement: “[<code><span>unsafe</span></code>] should be restricted to patches of genuinely unsafe Rust code, and for C++ interoperability code where there’s shared ownership or other complexities.”</p>

<p>There’s also the inverse, though I see it as a straw man more than a real argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our APIs are already pretty easy to use correctly, let’s just mark them safe and move on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also deeply unsatsifying. Even in C++, we should be aware of our APIs’ rules and the ways people might accidentally break them. Preventing those mistakes is the <em>true</em> point of Rust’s safety, so if you would rather debug recurring memory corruption than translate those rules to Rust, either the API needs improvement or Rust is failing.</p>

<p>A couple of more realistic options:</p>

<h4 id="hand-written-wrappers">Hand-written wrappers</h4>

<p>You might take the time-honored approach of a typical “idiomatic Rust FFI wrapper” crate: use a binding generator however you like, but don’t make its output public. Instead, hand-write the crate’s public API from scratch.</p>

<p>This often works well! Plenty of libraries are small enough, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages"><code><span>-</span><span>sys</span></code> crate convention</a> lets people work around the idiomatic wrapper if necessary, and there is an obvious place to deal with extra rules from foreign code. However, this duplication of API design is not always scalable.</p>

<p>It may also be the case that the foreign API is not conducive to being safely wrapped. Here it may be better to leave the bindings as <code><span>unsafe</span></code>, and build a safe API at a higher, and more application-specific, level.</p>

<h4 id="at-last-generated-wrappers">At last, generated wrappers</h4>

<p>You might instead come up with a convention for “<code><span>unsafe</span></code> macros.” Put “unsafe” in their name, or require users to pass the <code><span>unsafe</span></code> at an appropriate position in the macro’s input. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24244121">This is likely to show up in <code><span>cxx</span></code></a> at some point.</p>

<p>This way you can still “grep for <code><span>unsafe</span></code>” and find the binding generator invocation, like we wanted. It amounts to asserting that all the foreign functions you’re binding to have no extra safety rules, which (believe it or not) <em>is</em> sometimes the case.</p>

<p>You might further tweak the binding generator to let you mark individual wrappers as <code><span>unsafe</span></code>, as an opt-out for those cases “where,” as Google puts it, “there’s shared ownership or other complexities.”</p>

<p>Another approach comes from Microsoft, in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winrt-rs"><code><span>winrt</span><span>-</span><span>rs</span></code></a> crate. WinRT defines a whole new type system, designed to be easy to “project” into various languages, including C#, Javascript, C++, and now Rust. It also defines a file format to describe APIs in this type system. So long as it fits into the WinRT type system, a library written in one language can be used from any …</p></article></div>

<p>We live in a noisy world.</p>



<p>To cut through this noise and create clarity for those around us, we all need to communicate effectively every day. Our work doesn’t speak for itself; we need to collaborate, inspire, and build relationships. To do this, we need to be able to communicate clearly.</p>



<p>As a shy child and introverted adult, externalizing my perspective never came naturally to me. It still doesn’t. In high school, I had the dubious honor of being cast in the only non-speaking role in drama class. Despite this, today, I spend the majority of my day, every day, communicating with people. In some ways, my day job&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;communication.</p>



<p>Communication is a learned skill. I’m certainly no Obama, but over time, I’ve collected a set of tools that have helped me communicate more effectively.</p>



<h3>Contents</h3>



<ol><li><a href="#rule-of-three">Rule of Three</a></li><li><a href="#answer-explain-example">Answer, Explain, Example</a></li><li><a href="#structure-say-summarize">Structure, Say, Summarize</a></li><li><a href="#feelings-last">Feelings Last Longer Than Words</a></li><li><a href="#pause-context">Pause and Give Context</a></li><li><a href="#so-what">“So What” Is Your One Key Takeaway</a></li></ol>



<h3 id="rule-of-three">Rule of Three</h3>



<p>Three is a magic number in communication. From stories, like The Three Musketeers, Three Blind Mice, and Three Little Pigs, to colloquialisms like “blood, sweat, and tears,” <em>three</em> is everywhere. There’s even a Latin phrase, omne trium perfectum, or <em>everything that comes in threes is perfect</em>.</p>



<p>Why is this? Humans beings seek both patterns and simplicity. We’re pattern-recognition machines, always looking for signals among the noise. Simultaneously, we have limited working memory. We can’t remember a list of fifteen things or even a list of five. But we can remember three, which is the minimum number of objects needed to make a pattern. Three is concise, persuasive, and memorable.</p>



<p>When you say, “there are three reasons we should do this,” people pay attention. They know that three is easy to digest and remember. And you, the speaker, are forced to structure your argument succinctly and compellingly. When you put seven bullet-points in a document or slide, people’s eyes glaze over. When you put a concise list of three, they digest it. Within reason, in verbal or written communication, distill what you have to say down to three.</p>



<h3 id="answer-explain-example">Answer, Explain, Example</h3>



<p>I heard this from a former LinkedIn executive. The premise is simple but powerful. When answering a question, give the answer, then elaborate, then provide an example. That’s it.</p>



<p>By answering the question immediately, you’re getting to the point and giving the person who asked a concise answer. Then you’re supporting it with your rationale. Finally, you’re backing it up with a real example.</p>



<h3 id="structure-say-summarize">Structure, Say, Summarize</h3>



<p>“Structure, Say, Summarize” is a tool I use when communicating something nuanced. The basis is this: First, structure how you’re going to make the statement. Second, make the statement. Third, summarize your position and the “<a href="#so-what">so what</a>.”</p>



<ul><li>Structure: It’s a risk, but there are three reasons we should do this.</li><li>Say: The first reason is X, the second is Y, the third reason is Z.</li><li>Summarize: I know nothing is guaranteed. But, given these reasons, we’re missing an opportunity to grow by not doing this.</li></ul>



<p>This structure is akin to a Dale Carnegie quote: “Tell the audience what you’re going to say, say it; then tell them what you’ve said.”</p>



<p>Verbal communication is messy, and it’s difficult for people to follow spoken paragraphs. Even when you don’t have a tidy list of three, starting with “there are a few reasons,” making stating a few points, then summarizing your view is a powerful way to communicate more clearly.</p>



<p>But don’t use this all the time, or you’ll seem like a robot.</p>



<h3 id="feelings-last">Feelings Last Longer Than Words</h3>



<p>People will often forget what you said, but they’ll never forget how you made them feel. You might have made a logically sound argument, but if the recipient didn’t feel enthused, inspired, or understood, it probably won’t stick.</p>



<p>Feelings are why the world’s most iconic brands are so effective. We don’t remember every detail, every line of copy, or every number. But they make us feel a certain way, and feelings are sticky.</p>



<p>If you want to inspire action or lead a team, logic is important, but so is ensuring people are inspired when they walk away from an interaction. People won’t remember everything you said, but they’ll remember how you made them feel.</p>



<h3 id="pause-context">Pause and Give Context</h3>



<p>Never assume that everyone has the same context that you do. There’s a magical and straightforward sequence of words for this: “Let me give some context to make sure we’re on the same page.”</p>



<p>In any given conversation, everyone has a perspective formulated from a different set of inputs. The more closely aligned you can get these inputs, the more effective your communication will be. Shared context helps avoid “talking past each other” situations.</p>



<p>One of the tenets of effective communication is <em>over-communication</em>. Most people associate this with being annoying or spam. In my experience, that isn’t true. Over-communication is about never assuming that people have the same context that you do.</p>



<h3 id="so-what">“So What” Is Your One Key Takeaway</h3>



<p>For every piece of communication that you create, find the “so what.” Whether a presentation, document, or slide,&nbsp;if someone asked, “so what?”, what would you say? </p>



<p>Whatever the answer to that question is, make sure it comes across clearly. The answer to “so what?” usually involves articulates the implication for the audience.</p>



<p>An easily applicable tip here is to title your slides or headers with the “so what” for that particular slide or section. Hone in on the most important takeaway and the implication for the audience — why should they care?</p>

August 22, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently we signed up for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> program, which provides startups / small internet businesses like us with a variety of benefits - from AWS credits to free business-tier support.</p>
<p>We signed up for AWS Activate as part of our application to the Stripe Atlas program, which we're <a href="https://formcake.com/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">big fans</a> of, but you don't need to be a part of Stripe Atlas to sign up for Activate.</p>
<p>When signing up for Activate though you <em>do</em> need to know you'll be faced with a question that can drastically shape the number of credits you ultimately receive.</p>
<h2 id="the-mistake">The Mistake</h2>
<p>When we first went through the process we very simply answered that question wrong. We encountered the following screen, outlining the different sign up paths for bootstrapped vs funded startups.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/aws-activate-screen.png" alt="AWS Activate bootstrapped vs funded startups"></p>
<p>When we first signed up, we did so as a bootstrapped startup: We're not accepting any funding, or even incorporating as a C Corp so we can have shares and an officer structure. We're incorporated as an LLC because we want to slowly build our way to profitability, so "bootstrapped" as a term seemed to described us.</p>
<p>We received $1,000 in AWS credits and were happy, but <a href="https://formcake.com/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">raised the issue with Stripe</a> that we were curious if there was a chance at getting the $5,000 that the Stripe copy seemed to suggest.</p>
<p>Stripe not only got back to us but fought for us to <a href="https://formcake.com/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits">receive the full $5,000 in credits from AWS</a>.</p>
<p>But in their email it became clear what the issue was: <strong>We signed up under the wrong option</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though we're not accepting proper funding rounds, we are "sponsored" by Stripe in a sense through the Atlas program. That means we have an organization code/ID we can plug into the AWS Activate signup process signifying that we're a "funded" startup.</p>
<p>Doing so appears to net you a cool $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>Luckily we pestered Stripe to the point where we were able to receive not just the extra money ($5,000) but also keep the original, $1,000 amount. Since we're a small startup that's on an all-AWS infrastructure, this money was pretty critical to us, and provides a nice runway.</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h2>
<p>If you're signing up for the AWS Activate program, consider looking for a program like Stripe Atlas to sign up with. If you're able to find this kind of sponsorship and sign up with your corresponding organization ID, you can probably expect more credits. Don't be like us and potentially leave this much money (well, credits) on the table.</p>
<p>If you're anything like us, that difference between $1,000 and $5,000 is something you can feel!</p>

Silica aerogels are light, porous foams that provide excellent thermal insulation.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, they are also known for their brittle behaviour, which is why they are usually reinforced with fibres or with organic or biopolymers for large-scale applications. Due to their brittle fracture behaviour, it is also not possible to saw or mill small pieces out of a larger aerogel block. Directly solidifying the gel in miniaturised moulds is also not reliably - which results in high scrap rates. This is why aerogels have hardly been usable for small-scale applications.</p><h2><b>Stable, well-formed microstructures</b></h2><p>The Empa team led by Shanyu Zhao, Gilberto Siqueira, Wim Malfait and Matthias Koebel have now succeeded in producing stable, well-shaped microstructures from silica aerogel by using a 3D printer. The printed structures can be as thin as a tenth of a millimeter. The thermal conductivity of the silica aerogel is just under 16 mW/(m*K) - only half that of polystyrene and even significantly less than that of a non-moving layer of air, 26 mW/(m*K). At the same time, the novel printed silica aerogel has even better mechanical properties and can even be drilled and milled. This opens up completely new possibilities for the post-processing of 3D printed aerogel mouldings.</p><p>With the method, for which a patent application has now been filed, it is possible to precisely adjust the flow and solidification properties of the silica ink from which the aerogel is later produced, so that both self-supporting structures and wafer-thin membranes can be printed. As an example of overhanging structures, the researchers printed leaves and blossoms of a lotus flower. The test object floats on the water surface due to the hydrophobic properties and low density of the silica aerogel - just like its natural model. The new technology also makes it possible for the first time to print complex 3D multi-material microstructures.</p><h2><b>Insulation materials for microtechnology and medicine</b></h2><p>With such structures it is now comparatively trivial to thermally insulate even the smallest electronic components from each other. The researchers were able to demonstrate the thermal shielding of a temperature-sensitive component and the thermal management of a local “hot spot” in an impressive way. Another possible application is the shielding of heat sources inside medical implants, which should not exceed a surface temperature of 37 degrees in order to protect body tissue.</p><h2><b>A functional aerogel membrane</b></h2><p>3D printing allows multilayer/multi-material combinations to be produced much more reliably and reproducibly. Novel aerogel fine structures become feasible and open up new technical solutions, as a second application example shows: Using a printed aerogel membrane, the researchers constructed a “thermos-molecular” gas pump. This permeation pump manages without any moving parts at all and is also known to the technical community as a Knudsen pump, named after the Danish physicist Martin Knudsen. The principle of operation is based on the restricted gas transport in a network of nanoscale pores or one-dimensional channels of which the walls are hot at one end and cold at the other. The team built such a pump from aerogel, which was doped on one side with black manganese oxide nanoparticles. When this pump is placed under a light source, it becomes warm on the dark side and starts to pump gases or solvent vapours.</p><h2><b>Air purification without moving parts</b></h2><p>These applications show the possibilities of 3D printing in an impressive way: 3D printing turns the high-performance material aerogel into a construction material for functional membranes that can be quickly modified to suit a wide range of applications. The Knudsen pump, which is driven solely by sunlight, can do more than just pump: If the air is contaminated with a pollutant or an environmental toxin such as the solvent toluene, the air can circulate through the membrane several times and the pollutant is chemically broken down by a reaction catalyzed by the manganese oxide nanoparticles. Such sun-powered, autocatalytic solutions are particularly appealing in the field of air analysis and purification on a very small scale because of their simplicity and durability.</p><p>Empa researchers are now looking for industrial partners who want to integrate 3D-printed aerogel structures into new high-tech applications.</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;To demonstrate that fine aerogel structures can be produced in 3D printing, the researchers printed a lotus flower made of aerogel.
