		<section>

	<div>
		<p>I proposed what would become Lacework in the Summer of 2019. In my proposal, I describe a cycle of videos curated from MIT's '<a href="http://moments.csail.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moments In Time</a>' dataset, each then slowed down, interpolated, and upscaled immensely into imagined detail, one flowing into another like a river.</p>
<p>In many ways, Moments In Time is unremarkable. Like so many datasets with similar goals, Moments In Time is intended to train AI systems to recognize actions. It contains one million, 3-second videos scraped from websites like YouTube and Flickr, each tagged with a single verb like asking, resting, snowing or praying.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>There are a few things that are particular about Moments In Time. It tries to break down <em>most possible actions</em> into just 339 'doing' verbs. It also doesn't clarify about the subjects of its videos- for instance, it is more interested that something is flying than if that thing is a bee, flower, person, plane, satellite, or bird. Moments In Time decenters human actions in favour of how words might apply to broader swaths of doing.</p>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Because these decisions require a particular type of logic, the language of this research is oddly poetic. <a href="https://moments.csail.mit.edu/TPAMI.2019.2901464.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The associated whitepaper</a> reads: "three seconds is a temporal envelope which holds meaningful actions between people, objects and phenomena"; and "visual and auditory events can be symmetrical in time ("opening" is "closing" in reverse), and either transient or sustained."</p>
<p>One million videos is not a particularly large archive in the world of big data, but it is still a number meant for machine comprehension, not human. The first time I opened the dataset I got dizzy. One million moments, placed in folders named simply- sleeping, slicing, sliding, smelling, smiling. I felt like I’d been placed down somewhere on the surface of the earth, and told to walk home.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Without a methodology, I began haphazardly moving through the folders, dipping into specific verbs, pulling up a few dozen random videos until I found one that I liked. This was enough to test the aesthetic process through which I would approach the work but did little to teach me about the structure of the dataset itself. It was not until I entered quarantine in March, months after I’d begun, that this process moved from a random selection to a deliberate and focused one. </p>
<p>When the pandemic moved the project online, I considered focusing on videos about touch, this subject that had been transmuted from a casual action to a precious and dangerous one. I pulled roughly 20 folders from the archive by verb- cuddling, hugging, punching, reaching. These folders still contained 60,000 videos between them, but this was a scale that I felt was possible to approach, as one person stuck in a room.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>As the world entombed, I spent my time watching these short, tiny moments of intimacy- two lovebirds beak to beak, a tiger putting paws around a keeper, the contact of a fist to a face, a kiss, a crowd, a touch. </p>
<p>I was looking for videos with a lot of texture to them, with subjects at a distance, in shapes or colours that were already confusing. I wanted compositions that the AI upscaling could catch onto and drag against, pulling a cloud into a mountain or a face into a coastline.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>Somehow, I had expected the act of watching Moments in Time to be calming or exploratory, like seeing the world out of a window. But the archive is not entertaining, poetic, beautiful, or joyful- even though many videos that evoke those feelings are contained within it. It is an archive with purpose, an archive of actions for an inhuman eye. Here is the world, here are things that are done there. It feels raw.</p>

		<p>Eventually, I built myself a Tinder-like interface for screening the videos. Each video would pop up and I would then tap the left or right arrow key to sort it into place- <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em>, keep or throw away. </p>
<p>Out of these 60,000 videos I selected roughly 400. I slowed each one down dramatically, drawing the video out to 15 seconds from its original three. I interpolated the frames, attempting to make a new flowing motion to replace the smoothness lost in the time conversion. I wanted to be able to study these moments intended to teach machines what it is to touch. I wanted to see each small choice in each body taking action, removed from human time.</p>	</div>

	<div>
		<p>It was now early April. I had watched 6% of the dataset, about 50 hours of videos, and from them had made a little over an hour of material.</p>
<p>I could have stopped there. But I kept thinking about the rest of the archive- all those other verbs, all this other life. I felt that the videos around touch were not enough of the story. They didn’t say enough about what the dataset was trying to do, what it contained.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>I decided I needed to watch the rest of the dataset. This time I started at the top, alphabetically.</p>
<p>Aiming, applauding, arresting, ascending, asking.</p>	</div>

	<p>Last fall, when we could still gather in rooms together, I taught a class called 'Data Gardens'. One of the units was around performance as AI. We talked about 'Wizard of Oz prototyping' and human labour in machine-learning systems. We watched movies of actors pretending to be androids, replicants, and machines. We looked at histories of automata, including the miraculous 18th-century chess-playing Mechanical Turk, which in reality hid a petite human chess master among its clockwork.</p>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>When I first started watching the dataset I assumed that the team of researchers who had put it together at MIT had seen the bulk of it, but I’m now convinced that assumption was wrong. This is because so much of the archive is so, so hard to watch. </p>
<p>This is partly to do with time. The videos in Moments in Time have a severe, automated cut (3 seconds, sharp) that severs these moments, sometimes chopping them in the middle of the action which they are meant to describe. I eventually found that I had to mute the videos to keep watching at all- that the images could dissolve into colours and shapes but the jarring severance of the sound remained distinct and pointed no matter how much I watched.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>The difficulty of watching is also partly to do with consent. Moments in Time severs the relationship between recorded action and original maker. The researchers did not ask for permission to use these videos, and all ownership of- and control over- the image is pulled away from the person who held the camera, and from what that camera depicts.</p>
<p>In the archive, there are moments of extreme emotion and personal vulnerability- tears, screaming, and pain. Moments of questionable consent, including pornography. Racist and fascist imagery. Animal cruelty and torture. And worse; I saw horrible images. I saw dead bodies. I saw human lives end.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Even though I’m probably the first person to watch <em>all</em> of Moments in Time, every part of the dataset has had human eyes on it before. This is because after being gathered and cut, the videos of Moments in Time were automatically uploaded to Amazon Mechanical Turk for annotation. Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing service that connects 'requesters' to 'workers' who generally perform small, computer-like tasks for pennies. It is owned by Amazon and takes its name from the fake chess-playing machine. </p>
<p>The Moments in Time whitepaper describes the process of annotating the videos: “Each AMT worker is presented with a video-verb pair and asked to press a Yes or No key signifying if the action is happening in the scene. Positive responses from the first round are sent to subsequent rounds of annotation. Each HIT (a single worker assignment) contains 64 different 3-second videos that are related to a single verb”.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>I’m reminded of my own years spent as an AMT worker, which kept me employed at well under minimum wage during and after my undergraduate education. I think about all those thousands of tasks which involved the repetition of my labour. Hitting buttons with my hands, matching emotions with my face, recording words with my voice. How many datasets my body must be contained in. What those datasets are used for. How much violence my body does to others, through them.</p>

	<p>The example interface described by the Moments in Time whitepaper has an unsettling resemblance to my own handmade video-screening method, with the right and left arrow keys standing in for Yes and No. Both contain only two options- include, discard. No ability to report a video, reclassify it or clarify its inclusion, no middle ground.</p>

</section>

		<p>It comes to explain the brutality within. When you ask:</p>
<p>Does a dog fight match ‘barking’?</p>
<p>Does a sexual assault match ‘kissing’?</p>
<p>Does a police murder match ‘arresting’?</p>
<p>Sometimes the answer is Yes.</p>	</div>

		<p>Around hour 250 of the dataset, sometime in late April, I started having The Dream. In The Dream, I am living on- or perhaps <em>am</em>- a research satellite, orbiting a planet and monitoring planetary broadcasts. For each brief moment I am floating over a place, I can see just a flash of what is happening under me. Just a fleeting, tiny vision of <em>something happening</em> then <em>something happening</em> then <em>something happening</em>. The dream goes on this way for years. </p>
<p>Even awake, I’ve come to see patterns in camera quality, in shadows, in the colour of paint and the types of trees, in movement, in texture that could unfold into ever more detail. I see patterns in everything, patterns that unify all of the videos which have nothing to do with their subjects and everything to do with the way the lens sweeps up to capture a running dog, or pivots to see the sunset or the way the light flares and the compression pushes against the edges of the frame.</p>	</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                        <p><span>Sometimes it’s a good idea to let your brain cool off from the day-to-day work (which in my case is building the best translation management software in the world). What could be better than building and playing an arcade machine? </span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/long.gif" alt="" width="708" height="398"></span></p>
<p><span>I’ve been enjoying arcades in 90s that’s why I’ve decided to put one together at home. There is quite a number of tutorials on the Internet on how to do that. However, the common problem is building the wooden cabinet – well, not a problem if you have a circular saw and some other professional tools available. </span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately (or luckily?), I don’t have a circular saw at home. So, here is my take on how to do it just using a pencil, a ruler, and a knife.</span></p>


<h2><span id="Preparations">Preparations</span></h2>
<p><span>I’m going to use the box that came with the monitor as a cabinet, which means the final arcade machine will be a portable bar top version. No soldering required.</span></p>
<p><span>The software part will run on <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a>, an excellent image for Raspberry Pi micro computer. I will also explain how to add a nice cardboard-compatible theme, and fetch game video previews and info.</span></p>

<p>While RetroPie can <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/about/systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emulate 50 different gaming platforms</a> (including PlayStation, PSP, Dreamcast, Nintendo, MSX, and others), I will focus on setting up controllers and games for an emulator called <a href="https://www.fbalpha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Burn Alpha</a> (FBA) – basically a multiple retro arcade machine emulator. The FBA games typically use 2 to 4 controller buttons, sometimes 6 (works for us!). Otherwise, you can easily drop any other platform ROMs to the according folders, and they will just work (probably 😉 ).</p>

<p>The total budget in my case was about €270, but it could be about €140 if you find a used monitor with a box (I just bought a brand new one).</p>

<p>At this point, it’s a <strong>good idea to boot it up, install software and check if everything is working</strong> (see next section). Once all done, just use the stapler to secure the cardboard together.</p>

<h3><span id="Step_5_Flashing_RetroPie">Step 5 – Flashing RetroPie</span></h3>



<p><a href="https://retropie.org.uk/download/">Download</a> the pre-built RetroPie image for the Raspberry Pi model you are using. You will also need a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/">Raspberry Pi Imager tool</a> to flash the image onto the SD card. Please note that not all card readers/writers are the same. Therefore, I advise reading tips and tricks on the Raspberry blog post if you run into issues writing the card.&nbsp; You need to burn a <strong>Custom</strong> <code>.img</code> from your computer:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-1024x662.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-300x194.jpg 300w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-768x497.jpg 768w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0.jpg 1280w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-300x194@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Insert the SD card into the slot on Raspberry Pi and power it up! It will reboot itself after the initial preparations.</p>



<p>You will need to connect a USB keyboard at this point to do some initial set up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once booted, you will see the following screen:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-14-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-14-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-14-300x169.jpg 300w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-14-768x432.jpg 768w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-14.jpg 1280w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0-14-300x169@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Press <strong>F4</strong> on the keyboard to exit EmulationStation for now.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_6_System_configuration">Step 6 –&nbsp;System configuration</span></h3>



<h4><span id="61_Setting_the_country">6.1. Setting the country</span></h4>



<p>In order to connect to WiFi we need to set the country you are in. To launch the configuration (assuming you exited to console by pressing <code>F4</code>), type:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell">sudo raspi-config</pre>
<p><span>Select </span><b>Network options, </b><span>then </span><b>Wi-fi</b>,<span> and then choose your country (wait for the confirmation that the country has been set). You don’t need to enter SSID at this point, so press </span><b>Tab </b><span>and then </span><b>Cancel.</b></p>

July 23, 2020 | https://jibranelbazi.com/notes/product-roadmap-checklist/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jibranelbazi.com/notes/product-roadmap-checklist/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Say you're building a product, be it software or hardware (or <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">innovative alien technology</a>), you may need a product roadmap. Why? It helps you set out the vision, strategy, and goals for what you're creating.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you're working on your startup as a solo founder or work in an enterprise as a product manager, business analyst, or project manager. Yes, the detail and format may change somewhat depending on where and how you work. I mean, it could be that you work in an Agile environment or are the decision-maker, or maybe you need stakeholder 'buy-in' from lots of people. No matter, a good product roadmap helps a ton.</p><p>In the list I made below, you can review if you took into account some crucial points.</p><p>So without further ado, I present to you the 'Epic Product Roadmap Checklist!'</p><h2>The Checklist</h2><ol role="list"><li>Do you really know what the audience of your product needs?</li><li>Make sure the strategy for your product is correct before spending time defining features and metrics.</li><li>Don't fear to say no (in a kind way) if stakeholders want to push in irrelevant features.</li><li>Don't try to put everything in the roadmap. Remember, you still have a product backlog for detailed user stories.</li><li>Did you get buy-in from everyone involved? Development team, marketing, sales, sponsors, etc.? Involve them in the creation. It is not a one-man-show.</li><li>Is the timeframe for the milestones realistic? Not too long, not too short.</li><li>Make sure it is clear what you prioritize on. Time, Budget, or Goal.</li><li>Are your users ready for the release schedules? Is the cadence steady and right for them?</li><li>Remember, goals &gt; features.</li><li>How does the product(roadmap) fit in with other products and their release schedules?</li><li>Do ask others for input. You did that, right.</li><li>Determine and update the metrics you track for measuring your goals.</li><li>Tell a story through the roadmap that is both convincing and achievable.</li><li>Is the roadmap laid out contextually? I.e., communicate every important decision that you made in creating the roadmap.</li><li>To get better buy-in, did you address doubts of influential stakeholders beforehand?</li><li>Did you gather all requirements?</li><li>Are all requirements cut up into manageable and logic parts?</li><li>Don't tell others HOW to do the work of what they need to do (in the roadmap). Only show WHY and WHAT.</li><li>Have you made a good business case for everything on the roadmap? Is the value clear? Is it measurable?</li><li>Don't go overboard with the details when the roadmap is for a (small) startup. On the other hand, a place to do this is in enterprise-grade businesses.</li><li>Don't hide unknown-unknowns. Keep researching until you at least have the potential scope failure of a (sub)product.</li><li>Take into account what your teammates can achieve. Don't provide unrealistic milestones.</li><li>Document the process of how you came to creating the roadmap.</li><li>ABU. Always Be Updating (your team members and stakeholders). Don't let people work with old info.</li><li>Don't surprise stakeholders during a presentation. They should have been up to speed before you present your roadmap.</li><li>Talk about details with (for example) the engineering team, so that you can better schedule feature releases.</li><li>Do you know what is essential for the stakeholders? I.e., what you need to prioritize?</li><li>Watch out for big clients swaying feature priorities!</li><li>Don't write too much. Only the minimum needed to transfer the message.</li><li>Don't try to predict the details of everything in the product roadmap. Only go into super detail for the first 10% - 20% of the roadmap.</li><li>Be honest. Don't say things that you're unsure of.</li><li>Use good tools for both creating and presenting your roadmap.</li><li>Do your best storytelling in all communication.</li><li>Add both short-term and long-term goals in the roadmap. It keeps a steady cadence of wins.</li><li>Technical (and security) debt is real. Do make time for it in the roadmap.</li><li>When presenting your roadmap, make clear what the intention and goal of the presentation are.</li><li>When creating your roadmap, take into account who is consuming the document(s). Executives likely need a different view than a Scrum team.</li><li>Build your roadmap based on objective findings, not your gut feeling.</li><li>Present your roadmap with confidence, verbally, non-verbally, written. Any way you can.</li><li>Make sure you talked to all relevant stakeholders before finalizing your roadmap.</li></ol><h2>Bonus - Product Roadmap Software list</h2><p>As an added bonus I'd thought of listing some product roadmap tools. Some specifically meant for roadmaps, others that you can bend to the use-case somewhat (which are mostly free).</p><p>(Oh, and no, these are not affiliate links.)</p><p><strong>In no particular order:</strong></p><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://www.productplan.com/">Product plan</a></li><li><a href="https://airfocus.com/">Airfocus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wrike.com/">Wrike</a></li><li><a href="https://www.aha.io/">AHA</a></li><li><a href="https://roadmunk.com/">Roadmunk</a></li><li><a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/">Smartsheet</a></li><li><a href="#">Zenhub</a></li><li><a href="https://www.productboard.com/">ProductBoard</a></li><li><a href="https://www.airtable.com/">Airtable</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/">Google Sheets</a></li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/excel">Excel</a></li><li><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/">LucidChart</a></li><li><a href="https://monday.com/">Monday</a></li><li><a href="https://www.prodpad.com/">Prodpad</a></li><li><a href="https://casual.pm/">Casual</a></li><li><a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a></li><li><a href="https://www.favro.com/product">Favro</a></li><li><a href="https://craft.io/">Craft</a></li><li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/templates/product-roadmap">Confluence</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ganttpro.com/product-roadmap/">GanttPRO</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/teams/management.html">YouTrack</a></li><li><a href="https://www.targetprocess.com/features/roadmaps/">Targetprocess</a></li></ol><h2>Concluding</h2><p>I hope you found this helpful in your product management work, your startup, or your content business.

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <div>
        
        <div>
          <p><h4>Assignable</h4></p>
          <p>
            Connect your favorite MIDI controller to assign its knobs with
            SEQers'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once assigned, all mappings are saved on disk - no need to
            re-assign after relaunch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't have a controller with 64 knobs? No worries. You can shift
            midi mappings vertically and horizontally to access all knobs
            even by 8 physical knobs.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <p><img src="https://studio-rubik.dev/imgs/seqer/track-controls.png" alt="track-controls">
        </p>
        <div>
          <p><h4>Connectable</h4></p>
          <p>
            SEQer can talk with any internal/external software/hardware with
            virtual/actual MIDI ports.
          </p>
          <p>Each track has dedicated output.</p>
          <p>
            MIDI clock sync in/out is supported. SEQer can become the
            master/client of another device with MIDI clock capability.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        
        <div>
          <p><h4>Hot Repeat</h4></p>
          <p>
            Extend your pattern by repeating specific steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assign MIDI buttons/keys to gray dots above the knobs. 
            Then, pressing &amp; holding MIDI buttons will loop the dedicated steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every tracks has its own loop so complicated polyrhythm can be easily made with SEQer.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <p><img src="https://studio-rubik.dev/imgs/seqer/scales.png" alt="track-controls">
        </p>
        <div>
          <p><h4>14 Scales</h4></p>
          <p>Choose one from 14 popular scales to easily sounds nice. 
          (Traditional chromatic mode is of course available.)</p>

<p>It kills me not to own shares in Tesla. I have been and remain bullish on the company’s future success since 2014. It was the first stock I ever bought. Last year I once held more than half my net worth in Tesla at $212. But I strongly believe it will come down before it goes up.</p>



<p>Forget comparing it to other car companies (of which it is now the most valuable). With a market cap of $257B, Tesla is currently trading as one of the top 25 most valuable companies in the world. I believe it can and will deserve that valuation in time. I believe it can grow to be in the top 10 and even the top 5 eventually, but I do not see how anyone can argue that it is there yet.</p>



<p>Tesla today is worth more than either Amazon or Facebook was 5 years ago. One can argue about inflation or how those companies are nothing alike and it is a useless comparison if they like but I think it is helpful to context. Blind bulls may get angry and say whatever will make them feel better but they would fail to realize that I am actually on their side. I love Tesla and I am still rooting for the company and its ambitious leader as I have been all along. That does not stop me from being able to believe that it is heavily overvalued right now.</p>



<p>For what it is worth, I do not think Elon Musk was joking when he tweeted “<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184">Tesla stock price is too high imo</a>” just a couple of months ago. As of today, the price has nearly doubled since then.</p>



<p>The reason I think it is important for bulls to stop overinflating the price is that for any amount it rises over its fair value, it will likely have to fall at some point, and there are hundreds of billions of dollars on the line for industries, companies, and wealthy individuals that want to see that happen.</p>



<p>In the beginning, Tesla threatened big oil, car makers, and car dealers. If and when they roll out full autonomous driving and trucking, Tesla will be threatening insurance (because autonomous cars are much safer), truckers, unions, Uber, Lyft, and other autonomous competitors like Google. I believe it is conservative to say that hundreds of billions of dollars are praying for Tesla to fail. This massive opposition will not “go softly into that goodnight”, as they say.</p>



<p>To be clear, I am rooting for Tesla all the way. Anyone who knows me knows that. Tesla is an awesome company. But today it is overvalued.</p>

									<p><em>This story is a part of a documentary series produced in collaboration with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/china-illegal-fishing-fleet/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>NBC News</strong></a> by </em><a href="http://www.theoutlawocean.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.theoutlawocean.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Outlaw Ocean Project</strong></a><em><u><strong>,</strong></u> a </em><em>non-profit journalism organization based in Washington, D.C., that focuses on human rights, labour and environmental crimes at sea.</em>
</p>
<p>For years, no one knew why dozens of battered wooden "ghost boats" were <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-japan-ghost-boats-1.3344976" target="_blank"><strong>routinely washing ashore</strong></a> along the coast of Japan, often with the bodies of starved North Korean fishermen reduced to skeletons. 
</p>
<p>An investigation by the journalism organization <strong><a href="https://www.theoutlawocean.com/" target="_blank">The Outlaw Ocean Project</a> </strong>based on satellite data collected over the last two years has revealed, however, what marine researchers now say is the most likely explanation: China is sending an armada of industrial boats to illegally fish in North Korean waters, displacing smaller North Korean boats, forcing them farther out to rougher seas, and spearheading a decline in once-abundant squid stocks of more than 70 per cent. 
</p>
<p>The Chinese vessels — close to 800 last year — appear to be in violation of UN sanctions that forbid foreign fishing in North Korean waters in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. The sanctions, imposed in 2017 in response to the country's nuclear tests, were intended to punish North Korea by not allowing it to sell fishing rights in exchange for valuable foreign currency. (Canada is one of the countries <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-un-north-korea-1.5159988" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-un-north-korea-1.5159988" target="_blank"><strong>helping to enforce</strong></a> those sanctions.)

									<p>The number of ships newly revealed in the investigation comprises roughly a third the size of the entire Chinese distant-water fishing fleet.

									<p>Presented with the findings, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, "China has consistently and conscientiously enforced the resolutions of the Security Council relating to North Korea." The ministry said China has "consistently punished" illegal fishing.
</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the North Korean government has authorized the Chinese ships. However, when South Korean Coast Guard authorities have boarded and inspected some of the ships as they traversed South Korean waters on their way to North Korean fishing grounds, the Chinese captains have presented fishing permits signed by North Korean authorities.</p>

																<h2>An elusive but expanding fleet</h2>
								
																					
							
									<p>In March, two countries anonymously complained in <strong><a href="https://undocs.org/S/2020/151" data-cke-saved-href="https://undocs.org/S/2020/151" target="_blank">a report</a></strong> to the United Nations about China's violations of the sanctions and provided satellite imagery of Chinese ships fishing in North Korean waters and testimony from Chinese fishing crew who said they had alerted their government of their plans to fish in North Korean waters.
</p>
<p>Chinese officials dismissed this report, claiming the allegations were unfounded and involved scant few boats. 
</p>
<p>The recent revelations raise thorny questions about the consequences of China's ever-expanding role at sea and the lack of governance of the world's oceans. 
</p>
<p>Estimates of the total size of China's global fishing fleet vary widely. By some calculations, China has anywhere from 200,000 to 800,000 fishing boats, accounting for nearly half of the world's fishing activity. The Chinese government says its distant-water fishing fleet, or those vessels that travel far from China's coast, is roughly 2,600 vessels, but other research, such as <strong><a href="https://www.odi.org/publications/16958-china-s-distant-water-fishing-fleet-scale-impact-and-governance" target="_blank">this study</a> </strong>by the U.K. think-tank ODI, puts the number closer to 17,000, with many of these ships operating undetected, in part by turning off the transponders that allow satellites to track them. 
</p>
<p>By comparison, the United States distant-water fishing fleet has fewer than 300 vessels.

									<p>China is not only the world's biggest seafood exporter. The country's population also accounts for more than a third of all fish consumption worldwide. Having depleted the seas close to home, the Chinese fishing fleet has been sailing farther afield in recent years to exploit the waters of other countries, including those in West Africa and Latin America, where enforcement tends to be weaker as local governments lack resources or inclination to police their waters. Most Chinese distant-water ships are so large that they scoop up as many fish in one week as local boats from Senegal or Mexico might catch in a year. </p>
<p>Many of the Chinese ships combing Latin American waters target forage fish, which is ground into fishmeal, a protein-rich pelletized supplement fed to aquaculture fish. The Chinese fleet has also focused on shrimp and the now endangered totoaba fish, which is much prized in Asia for the alleged medicinal properties of its bladder and can sell for between $1,400 and $4,000 per fish. 
</p>
<p>Nowhere at sea is China more dominant than in squid fishing, as the country's fleet accounts for 50 to 70 per cent of the squid caught in international waters, effectively controlling the global supply of the popular seafood. Half of the squid pulled from the high seas by Chinese fishermen is exported to Europe, north Asia and the U.S. 
</p>
<p>To catch squid, the Chinese typically use trawling nets stretched between two vessels, a practice criticized by marine conservationists because it results in a lot of fish inadvertently and wastefully killed. Critics also accuse China of keeping high-quality squid for domestic consumption, exporting lower-quality products at higher prices, overwhelming vessels from other countries in major squid breeding grounds, and influencing international negotiations about conservation and distribution of global squid resources for its own interest.

																<h2>Subsidizing squid</h2>
								
																					
							
									<p>China's global fishing fleet did not grow into a modern behemoth on its own. The government has robustly subsidized the industry, spending billions of yuan annually. Chinese boats can travel so far partly because of a tenfold increase in diesel fuel subsidies between 2006 and 2011, after which Beijing stopped releasing statistics, according to a Greenpeace study. </p>
<p>For over a decade, the Chinese government has helped pay to construct bigger, more advanced steel-hulled trawlers, even sending medical ships to fishing grounds to enable the fleet to stay at sea longer. The Chinese government supports the squid fleet in particular by providing it with an informational forecast of where to find the most lucrative squid stocks, using data gleaned from satellites and research vessels.
</p>
<p>On its own, distant-water squid fishing is a money-losing business, according to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881780/" data-cke-saved-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881780/" target="_blank"><strong>research</strong></a> by Enric Sala, founder and leader of the U.S. National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project. The sale price of squid typically does not come close to covering the cost of the fuel required to catch the fish, Sala found.
</p>
<p>Still, China is hardly the worst offender when it comes to such subsidies, which ocean conservationists say, through over-capacity and illegal fishing, are a major reason that the oceans are rapidly running out of …</p></div></div></section></article></div></div>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/world-internet-320.jpg" alt="World Internet" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I have always heard that Internet Service Providers in the 
      United States charge more for their services than ISP's in most 
      of the rest of the world.  Since I was curious about the 
      veracity of that claim, I decided to do some research of my own 
      this week.</p>

   <p>The table below gives the results I obtained from a random sampling of 
      Internet service providers around the world.  I simply went onto the 
      Internet and found what I could find with the aid of Google 
      translate.  Getting a more accurate view of things would have taken 
      weeks of research, which was more time than I was prepared to 
      dedicate to this project.  However, I think the data that I have 
      gathered does give a sense of whether US ISP's price their services 
      significantly higher that the norm around the world.</p>

   <p>By the way, I am aware that prices of goods and services in countries 
      tend to track wages, and 
      <a href="https://www.rbth.com/science-and-tech/328998-why-internet-cheap-in-russia">Internet 
      services are no exception</a>.  Were I to do a more "scientific" 
      investigation, I would obtain more data points and normalized the 
      prices I find to the average wages in each country.  One thing I can 
      say is that wages of most developed countries are within about a 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage">factor 
      of three</a> of each other, and the United States is in the middle of 
      that range.  So, even without normalization, if we compare US prices 
      to those of other developed countries, we should have some idea of 
      whether US prices are much less affordable for consumers.</p>

   </tbody></table>
   <p>I should make a few clarifications.  First, the websites of ISP's 
      often leave out important information--like upload speeds, numbers of 
      months of commitment required with Internet service plans, and types 
      of data transmission line technology.  When I could not find 
      information on the websites of ISP's, I did not include it in the 
      table.  My assumption is that IPS's do not advertise poor upload 
      speeds, so if upload speeds are not posted on their websites, we can 
      safely assume they are low.</p>

   <p>Next, the "Price per Month" column in the table contains the price 
      after any initial promotional prices have ended.  So, this is what 
      most customers should be paying for their Internet service.</p>

   <p>The only types of Internet service plans shown in the table are DSL 
      and fiber optic cable plans.  (UPDATE: I assume that cable TV
      transmission lines were used in some of the plans for which the 
      Website advertisements did not specify their transmission line 
      technology.  I did not specifically intend to exclude those plans 
      from consideration.)  Since cheapskatesguide.org is about 
      finding the best deals, I excluded from consideration categories of 
      Internet services that I feel are not good deals.  Plans with large 
      data caps are the best bargains for most customers in terms of bytes 
      received per dollar paid.  As a result, I only looked at Internet 
      service plans with data caps that are similar to the one-terabyte-cap 
      plans that we have in the United States.  For the same reason, I did 
      not include any cell phone Internet service plans in the table.  I did 
      not include satellite Internet providers in the table either, because 
      satellite Internet service is generally more expensive.  Although 
      dial-up Internet service is very cheap and still being offered by a 
      few companies, I did not include any of them in the table.  Dial-up 
      service is just too slow for surfing the Internet these days.  
      However, if you still have a land-line telephone connection and a 
      modem, are heavily into email and text-only websites, and don't do 
      much else, you may want to look into dial-up services.</p>

   <p>Many plans had details associated with them that I did not show in 
      the table.  Some included things like phone service and TV.  I mostly 
      did not mention those details, because customers cannot get Internet 
      services from the listed companies without those extras.  Also, some 
      ISP's have additional constraints that I did not mention.  For 
      example, Maisha Broadband in Tanzania has higher bandwidths at night 
      than during the day.  I reported the daytime speeds and ignored the 
      nighttime speeds.  Another example is that Virgin Connect in Russia 
      charges much higher rates to single family homes than to apartments.  
      Your guess is a good as mine about why that is.  I simply reported 
      the monthly rates for apartment dwellers.  I also ignored installation 
      fees, since I believe most customers keep the same service for many 
      years.  So, the added cost of installation fees is usually 
      negligible.  Many ISP's have four or five tiers of service.  In those 
      cases, I chose to report only the plans from each provider with the 
      the slowest connection speed, the fastest, and an intermediate 
      speed.</p>

   <p>I had great difficulty getting information on African ISP's.  Most of 
      their websites were unreachable.  Most of those that were online did 
      not offer wired internet connections.  Most only offered some kind of 
      wireless or satellite connection.</p>

   <p>I want to remind readers that the prices in the table are the ISP's 
      <i>advertised prices</i> during the middle of July of 2020.  If you 
      have had experiences like mine, you will likely understand that you 
      may not be offered a plan with the advertised speeds and prices.  
      For example, one of the two ISP's that serve my small city in the 
      United States, and the one I happen to use, advertises plans with the 
      following download speeds on their national website: 10, 18, 25, 50, 
      and 100 Mbits/s.  I called my ISP last week to ask about their fastest 
      service in my city and was told that it is 10 Mbits/s.  I was also 
      told that the price was $10 above their advertised price after taking 
      into account taxes and equipment fees.</p>

   <p>How does my ISP get away with providing nothing faster than their 
      slowest advertised connection, and over charging for it at that?  I 
      live in a city that contains a significant population of 
      professionals, including a large percentage of engineers.  So you 
      would think that we would demand better.  Most likely thanks to a deal 
      that our city has made with the local Internet service providers, the 
      only alternative ISP in my city is the cable TV provider.  When I 
      tried to contact them, I found that no phone number was listed 
      anywhere on their website.  I eventually found their phone number 
      through other means and contacted them.  After a 10 minute hold, their 
      representative gave me the information I needed.  They have comparable 
      prices to those advertised by my ISP, and they have plans available 
      in my area with higher speeds.  Unfortunately, many customer reviews 
      say their service is unreliable.  So, given a choice between an 
      organization that has unsatisfactory customer service and reliability 
      and one that in my opinion has good customer service but slow 
      Internet speed, I choose the later.  My guess is that this is what we 
      must live with when our local governments decide to sell us out by 
      allowing monopoly or duopoly ISP's to operate in cities all across 
      the United States.</p>

   <p>Companies that provide Internet Services also engage in some 
      distasteful practices.  Generally, not only do prices of Internet 
      services differ from the advertised prices, but they differ according 
      to who you speak to at a particular company.  Yes, you understood what 
      I meant to say.  You will often find that when you call company X and 
      ask the price of their plan Y, you will be told one price, and when </p></div></div>

		<p>This article is talking about my experience learning how to program. However, most of it is relevant to learning any subject.</p><hr><div><p>Picture this scene in slow-motion. &nbsp;A Half-lit room. Nighttime and light rain. The smell of dark and creamy chocolate milk. And my keyboard mid-air about to smash on the wall into little pieces.</p><p>My first line of code was written before the large Q&amp;A communities were created (Stack Overflow and Reddit). There wasn't so much support, very little technical, and nonexistent emotional. I'm glad that programming in particular, and learning in general, became so communal.</p><p>Many things that bothered me back then, still riddle new programmers. I want to talk about the things that nagged me, in the back of my head, constantly, that now I know are nothing to worry about. Things that are part of the process and progress:</p></div><h3 id="am-i-good-enough">Am I good enough?</h3><p>Programming is not reserved for the elite. The only criteria for being able to learn how to program is if you are able to sit down and spend the needed time.</p><h3 id="it-takes-so-much-time-">It takes so much time:</h3><p>Yes, it does, so invest the time and don't worry about it. Learning how to program combines learning a new language, and learning abstract concepts. Both are time-consuming.</p><h3 id="i-feel-like-there-s-something-i-should-know-that-i-don-t-">I feel like there's something I should know that I don't:</h3><div><p>There must be something that I missed!</p><p>A very common feeling. Like there are missing pieces of the puzzle that prevent you from fully understanding, even when you follow a pre-designed curriculum.</p><p>Just keep pushing forward, there are probably concepts that you still don't understand well, and as the layout of the language becomes clearer, you'll know what you should work on to feel more confident. Confidence comes with time.</p></div><h3 id="i-feel-demotivated-">I feel demotivated:</h3><div><p>Motivation is like inspiration, it's for amateurs. I'm talking about the type that we feel from time to time, that makes us stand up, blood flowing strongly in our veins, wanting to change our lives. Don't give it too much thought when you feel it diminishing.</p><p>What you need is dedication, to persevere even when not feeling like it, and for that, a good schedule works well. Also, remind yourself why you're learning this in the first place.</p><p>Having a project, and building something you care about along the learning, really helps with the "why", and will help you put it the needed hours. It's also more fun.<br>Remember, learning is hard, don't let the world sell you a sugar-coated idea of learning becoming easy and flowing, "if you just follow this method, that costs $995 (regularly $5999!) on sale right now, for fast decision-makers".</p></div><h3 id="feeling-stuck-and-tutorial-purgatory-">Feeling stuck and tutorial purgatory:</h3><div><p>Yes, this happens from time to time. If you feel it, then you probably should either get out of your comfort zone and proceed to more advanced content, or, you weren't persistent, and a month or two after you don't feel that you made any progress.</p><p>There's no advancing without time and persistence, and it's better to learn 1 hour every day than 10 hours every Sunday.</p><p>If you'll persist with one good tutorial, you'll outgrow it quickly enough and feel comfortable taking on more advanced materials.</p><p>Also, practice. After every lesson, try to implement it. Either in a "dry" manner, just as it was shown in the lesson, or even better, on your own project. Try to find uses for what you've learned.</p></div><h3 id="time-management-">Time Management:</h3><div><p>A very important topic. Time management is usually the pitfall of learners. Some helping rules: create a schedule and stick to it! Don't start big, an hour a day is a good start. No need for 10-hour marathons.</p><p>Since learning is costly (mentally and cognitively), place the learning period at a time of the day when you are lively. Don't place it in the dead zones, the times of the day when you know you can't really get anything else done.</p></div><p>I look at code repositories of other developers, and I don't understand anything!<br>Neither do I most of the time. It takes time to understand another developer's code. I usually have to sit down and study the code and play with it to know the ropes. </p><div><p>Sometimes it takes a lot of time. It depends on the project complexity and how organized and well documented was the other developer.</p><p>I'm terrible at documenting, or can you really be terrible at something you don't do at all :)? So it's not really a treat looking at my codebase, plus I have to do a lot of explaining with each collaboration. </p></div><p>Be a better programmer than I am and practice documenting your code. Explain what functions do. Even if it's only for yourself.</p><h3 id="again-with-the-code-of-other-developers-i-ll-never-be-able-to-build-something-so-complex-and-elaborate-">Again with the code of other developers. I'll never be able to build something so complex and elaborate:</h3><p>No one writes 10K lines of code at a time. Even those big projects you see on GitHub started with just a few lines of code. </p><div><p>The code adds up with each day of programming, and a couple of months after, you suddenly find yourself with a respectable project. Provided that you were persistent!</p><p>Even those repositories that have many collaborators and a huge codebase usually start with 1 person writing few lines of code. You've got to start from somewhere.</p></div><h3 id="oh-dear-god-the-stupid-bugs-">Oh dear god, the stupid bugs:</h3><p>Yup. Still happens to me too from time to time.</p><h3 id="i-can-t-remember-the-commands-is-my-brain-weak">I can't remember the commands! Is my brain weak?</h3><div><p>As stated before, it's like learning a language, and you need to practice to get the vocabulary into your head. To be honest, I still look for simple things from on google sometimes. It's mostly things I don't use a lot.</p><p>A guy I follow tweeted: "Hello my name is Joby, I have a PhD in Physics and I work for NASA and I just had to look up the equation for the volume of a sphere". If he is allowed, you and I are allowed as well.</p></div><h3 id="good-programmers-must-write-code-as-fast-as-they-can-type-and-i-m-so-slow-">Good programmers must write code as fast as they can type, and I'm so slow:</h3><p>No, they don't (there are exceptions). and you'll get faster with time.</p><h3 id="i-can-t-build-anything-real-until-i-am-a-professional-">I can't build anything real until I am a professional:</h3><p>Sure you can. Think you've just learned Italian. It's still kind of bad, but you can carry a conversation good enough to get around Italy! Sure it will be better in 3 years, but it is still functional right now!<br>The same thing happens in programming. You can build functional things as a beginner. Sure, the code can probably be significantly improved, but it works! It'll do the job, and that's what code is for. for doing the job!</p><p>Now another language?!?! I'm not good enough in this one!<br>Once you understand the major programming concepts and feel comfortable enough to build things in one language, you'll feel more confident to learn a new one when needed. You don't have to be a professor in one language before you acquire a new one.<br>Make sure you don't just jump around from one language to another, but if you spent enough time with one to the point where you can effectively use it, don't be shy to try a new one.</p><hr><h2 id="conclusion-">Conclusion:</h2><div><p>If there's one thing that repeated itself in this article, is that you have to invest the time, and do it persistently. Time and persistence will solve most of your problems.</p><p>Regarding issues of confidence, they go away with time and persistence as well.<br>Know that many people share these worries. You're not alone. </p></div><p>I'm very pragmatic in my approach to learning. I don't think there's much more to it than time and persistence. I also think that anyone telling you differently is trying to sell you something. A special and costly method or service that will learn for you! "On sale, only today, for early birds and fast thinkers". Time and dedication!!! It's that simple.</p><p><br>Good learning resources are important but those you can find in abundance. Just take the top-rated Udemy courses or any other recommended resources. Follow them without jumping from one to another, and you'll surely get there.</p>

You take the garden hose in one hand and turn the faucet handle with the other, but nothing comes out. You look down at the tangled hose and see that it is full of kinks that are <strong>stopping the flow</strong> of water from passing through.&nbsp;</p><p>So what do you do?&nbsp;</p><p>Simple, you start to unravel the hose, one bottleneck at a time, until the water is able to flow again and you start generating momentum.</p><p>If you’re a solo SaaS founder with tangles in your business, you probably feel <em><strong>stuck </strong></em>and you don’t know how to get<strong> <em>unstuck</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>And, this makes it challenging to stay motivated.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>You’re overwhelmed and struggle to stay focused</strong></h3><p>From keeping customer acquisition costs low to building a robust team with maximum performance𑁋you are <strong>overwhelmed with choices</strong> and unsure what to do next!</p><p>As the founder of a SaaS business, you have hundreds of decisions to make. And every decision has a direct impact on the growth and success of your business.</p><p><em><strong>If you don’t have a plan, you don’t have momentum.&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>You spend hours wasted on tasks that don’t have results. With so many things you have to get done, you barely have the time to prioritize them one by one.</p><p>By the end of each month, you feel exhausted and uncertain about your future. If you continue like this, how will you ever get focused?&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>You’re frustrated and not getting results</strong></h3><p>You are a risk taker. You walk a path very few dare to go down.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when things don’t go your way, you start thinking the whole idea for your SaaS isn’t working out and you start looking for a new idea.</p><p>So, you try a new tactic, and you make changes to your prices, but everything you try doesn’t work. Or, maybe you have some customers, they’re coming in slowly and moving up to the next level feels like pushing a huge rock up a mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>You knew starting a SaaS business had its challenges, but you also didn’t expect that growth would take so damn long. When you can’t figure out why your business isn’t getting results𑁋<em><strong>that’s frustrating</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>You’re alone and unsure who to ask for help</strong></h3><p>You’ve probably spent hours listening to podcasts, buying only courses and following advice from other founders and marketing gurus. Yet, no matter what you hear, nothing seems to help.&nbsp;</p><p>You keep testing tactics, working hard to make it work, and you spend up to 80 hours a week, but nothing comes out.&nbsp;</p><p>Recommendations from other founders earning $10K+ to $100K+ MRR may work for them, in their situation, their specific industry, their ideal customer, and at whatever stage of their SaaS.&nbsp;</p><p>While their numbers and their gains are something you aspire to achieve, the fact that they are 10x to 100x makes it impossible to reach out for support.&nbsp;</p><p>Guess what?</p><p>You’re <em><strong>7 times more likely to achieve your goals</strong></em> if you have <span><em>peer support</em></span>.</p><p>So…</p><p><strong><em>What if you could have the help that you need, when you need it, to scale and grow your SaaS business?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><h2><strong>Welcome to the SaaS Boss Mastermind</strong></h2></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><img src="https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II.jpg 774w, https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II-768x767.jpg 768w, https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II-80x80.jpg 80w, https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II-24x24.jpg 24w, https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II-48x48.jpg 48w, https://www.natalieluneva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Natalie-II-96x96.jpg 96w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px"></figure></div></div><div><div><h3><strong>Hi, I’m Natalie Luneva</strong></h3><p>I’m the founder of the SaaS Boss Accelerator and the host of the SaaS Boss Podcast.

	<div>

		<p>Hi readers, this is the ninth (actually 9a) chapter of “<a href="https://retireinprogress.com/blog/my-story/">my story</a>“. Please take a look at the other chapters for some context.</p>
<p>I started this blog back in June 2016. Inspired by LivingAFI’s <a href="https://livingafi.com/2014/06/13/the-job-experience-tech-support-year-1/">The Job Experience</a>. The first posts I wrote were those about my personal, financial, and professional life up to mid 2016.</p>
<p>At that time I was working at <a href="https://retireinprogress.com/mystory7/">Hooli</a>, my fourth <em>Dream Job</em>, since November 2012. I was just 3.5 years in. The chapter about Hooli was essentially a “<em>wow, I finally landed on a true Dream Job! And look at this graph! My Net Worth is skyrocketing yeaaah!</em>“.</p>
<p>But <strong>something was already not ok</strong> even back then, in mid 2016. I started this blog about FI, and about RE. I set up a target, I announced I didn’t want to work forever – even if Hooli was <strong>The </strong>real dream job.</p>
<p>Before we start: I still don’t want to explicitly name my former company here. I don’t know, it’s not about privacy anymore… it actually would make for an awesome clickbait title: “<strong><em>why I quit Elgoog</em></strong>“, but I kind of got attached to the Hooli name, so let’s keep it this way 🙂</p>

<p>Anyway, my experience at Hooli has been multifaceted, I’m probably writing this post to organize my thoughts about it. If you don’t care, please skip it – it’s of course 5k words long 😉</p>
<p>When people ask me “<em>Why did you quit? What didn’t you like about it?</em>” I have hard time picking a couple of sentences that would satisfy the interlocutor. I’d need to talk for two or three hours to give you enough context. As you might expect this isn’t getting me popular at parties.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="810" height="456" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CSALQn0u9z4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Good thing parties have been banned even before I quit, thanks Corona!</p>
<p>Anyway, during last 3.5 months my “<em>try to not look weird and just reply ‘fine’ when they ask how are you doing</em>“-answer to the question “<em>why did you quit?</em>” has been something along the line “<strong><em>well, it’s not Hooli, it’s me</em></strong>“. You know, burnout, family, priority shifting…</p>
<p><strong>But that’s bullshit</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s a fallacy in our modern culture to think every “failure” is 100% on us, it’s just our responsibility. There are aspects of modern workplaces that make them <em>unhuman</em>. Anyway, I’m grateful for the 7.5 years I’ve spent there. I’m not here just to complain, to not take responsibility for having emptied this bottle (my passion for coding), to shift blame, to claim that the best company I could ever aim for failed me. Well, just a bit… But of course, as always, I had unrealistic high expectations.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back.</p>
<p>I could write a book about all the aspects I don’t like about every level of the hierarchy: about “working” as an employee itself, about the industry, the company, the teams, the actual tasks, and about myself. <strong>So I decided to split this long post in sub-posts</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the first one, and it will be about my <strong>timeline</strong> at Hooli, and the <strong>financial impact of this job</strong> on our Net Worth. I’ll talk about <em>Corporate Bullshit</em> on the next episode of this mini series.</p>
<h2><strong>My Hooli Timeline</strong></h2>
<h3>Initial Confusion (year 0 – 0.5)</h3>
<p><strong>I joined Hooli in November 2012</strong>, extremely excited by the idea of joining one of the supposed best company in the world, famous for its open culture, geeky offices, free food, cutting edge technology, and stellar compensation. To join Hooli, a (perceived) once in a lifetime opportunity, I gave up on my <a href="https://retireinprogress.com/mystory6/">real dream career</a> as a Freelance. I really loved those ~3 years, between 2010 and 2012.</p>
<p>First months have been mostly confusing: zero pressure, free food, many perks, amazing salary, free food, a lot of time to explore and learn, and… did I mention free food?</p>
<p>“<em>Awesome</em>” you’d say, but I got no directions. A starter project that nobody cared about. Zero guidance. I was… ok, that’s cool, but what am I doing? When am I going to prove I deserve this job?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a test! Maybe I need to surprise them! Yes, it must be the case.</p>
<p>So I joined meetings where my attendance wasn’t required, I proactively reached out for senior colleagues and offered my help (that nobody needed), and I started asking questions at weekly/bi-weekly/monthly <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">TLA</a></strong>s-saturated team meetings. Questions that uncovered entire new worlds, that made me realize that one cannot know more than a tiny fraction of what was needed to perform even a simple task in that environment.</p>

<h3><strong>Frustration (year 0.5 – 1)</strong></h3>
<p>Frustration has been a companion for my entire career at Hooli.</p>
<p>My first remarkable frustrating episode happened after 6 months since I started. I remember I was feeling like I still didn’t know a crap about how things worked at Hooli, and the official “novice period” was over. So my own (and my manager’s) expectations started to knock the door.</p>
<p>I was supposed to work on a weird project that we’ll call here <strong>Betelgeuse</strong><strong>, </strong>that was just replicating a processes schedule system, with project dependencies, automatic and scheduled builds and runs and so on. Yes, there are thousands of them already publicly available, and probably twice as much internally available. But we wanted to build our own, just for our team.</p>
<p>It was a crappy product, soon to be deprecated, that the team was using to calculate Hooli Maps metrics and databases. Yep, I was in the <strong>Hooli Maps Analytics</strong> team. Defining the metrics, writing code to extract the metrics from logs data, implementing dashboards to show the metrics to executives (with whom I never got the opportunity to talk).</p>
<p>“<em>Why the hell aren’t we using one of the 100 tools currently used at Hooli?</em>”</p>
<p>Sometimes it works this way at Hooli, and I believe outside as well: you reinvent the wheel for the 100th time, and while you are at it you convince yourself that’s of course the best solution! Then 2 years later the project gets canceled and it’s soon obvious to everyone that “<em>of course the best solution is to use X, which is the industry standard!</em>” Yeah, what about time! Everybody is a genius in hindsight! But that happens all the fucking time…</p>
<p>“<span><em>But RIP, why you complain? Just do the work and cash the paycheck 😉</em> </span>”</p>
<p>That’s exactly what I thought I could be doing, and it worked for a little while. Then my self esteem shows up, and I can’t just keep pretending. It’s a matter of opportunity cost. Why am I wasting my time in this way? Why am I wasting my skills?</p>
<p>Anyway, I did my best to mostly debug existing crappy code and keeping the tool up and running, surviving the hundreds of weekly updates in project dependencies (easily in the order of 100s or 1000s at Hooli), and essentially learning nothing.</p>
<p>The workflow looked like this:</p>
<p>“<em>Hey, we have a huge bug in Betelgeuse. For some reason database X is not being built. Z and Y depends on X so they’re not being built either. Dashboards look like there’s no data for last 5 days. Go figure!</em>”</p>
<p>… 3 days later, 3 days wasted in debugging code that was apparently working…</p>
<p>“<em>It seems team WhyTheHellWeDependOnTheirCode changed – undocumented of course – their APIs and rolled out new binaries, so when calling this RPC we don’t get the right timestamp. Our metric code needs timestamps to be consistent. It seems it was due to the launch of ShinyNewThingSoonToBeDeprecatedThatWillGetSomeonePromoted</em>”</p>
<p>So, bug fixed by asking them to whitelist our binaries to the old deprecated API for a while until we port the code to the new API. Which will never happen, and some poor developer next year will try to figure out why there’s this comment on their source code:</p>
<p>“<span><em>//TODO(mrrip): Delete this line once Betelgeuse will support the new API.</em></span>”</p>
<p>This is not what I dreamed about when thinking about working at Hooli…</p>
<h3><strong>Superboss Era and Promotion (years 1 – 2.5)</strong></h3>
<p>Then <a href="https://retireinprogress.com/midlife-crisis-outsourced-a-chat-with-superboss/">Superboss</a> became the team manager, and he pushed hard to make us engineers the decision makers and driver of innovation, like in Hooli’s good old days!</p>
<p>And it worked!</p>
<p>I worked on a project with some high leveled stakeholders, interacting with <em>Hooli Web Search</em> teams to build a signal for Search Result Ranking from Maps Logs (I kind of became one of the logs expert).</p>
<p>Even though in retrospective it was just another crappy project gluing several systems together (not writing fancy graph traversal recursive algorithms like we ask during interviews), <strong>I got passionate about it</strong>, I delivered regularly, it brought positive results to the business, I kind of became unofficially the teach lead of a couple of colleagues, I worked early in the morning to meet people from Tokyo and late in the evening to meet people from Silicon Valley… but I was working on something <strong>I had enough time to become a master of</strong>, and the positive feedback loop acted like a drug! I reached “<em>Turbo-Giga-Awesome!!!</em>” performance rating and got promoted in April 2015.</p>
<p>Then Superboss announced he was quitting the company. Yes, I cried. And I cried again in September 2015, during his last week at Hooli, when we celebrated him at our yearly Hooli Maps Analytics multi teams Summit in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I knew things weren’t going to be the same.</p>
<p>I was right.</p>
<h3>Acting Fast and Slow (years 2.5 – 3.5)</h3>
<p>I got promoted in April 2015.</p>
<p>I should have done one of the following two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change team, and eventually Product Area the day after promotion and go climb another ladder.</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t relax, and keep pushing to climb the Hooli Maps ladder. Next promotion could be just a year away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, I relaxed a bit. In the end I just got promoted, I worked hard for 1.5 years… let’s chill 😉</p>
<p>And let’s celebrate the time when I rocked, like this magic week when I felt more productive that the rest of the team – including SuperBoss:</p>

<p>It didn’t last. I submitted more changelists in those two weeks than in 2018, 2019 and 2020 combined. Not joking…</p>
<p>In the meantime: Superboss left the company, many amazing colleagues left the company or the team as well, I changed manager three times in one year, Hooli Maps former “CEO” quit the company, and our Maps Analytics team essentially became a service team for some PM in New York. “<em>Can you add this?

<p>All products “feel” the same pain of user idleness. Regardless of how “old” they are or how well they are developed. The sad truth is, your potential customers are more likely to leave things the way they are than try new things. That’s the psychology of a human being. Good news: there are ways to argue them into trying and increase your product visibility.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if this is your first or fiftieth release. We’ll help you prove the product value to your users.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-is-product-adoption">What is product adoption?</h2>



<p>Product adoption is a process when users embrace your product value and make a purchasing decision. It includes four stages:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>awareness;</li><li>interest;</li><li>evaluation;</li><li>conversion.</li></ul>



<p>When it comes to measuring adoption, signup count or daily active users come to mind. If taken individually, these metrics can’t tell if users seamlessly embed your product in their daily routine or business activities. You can’t also see if users can do without your product.</p>



<p>The product is truly adopted when its value gets so high that it overweighs all acquisition and usage costs.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that product adoption isn’t just about new users. Don’t forget to assist your existing customers in appreciating your product value as you release new features and product improvements.</p>




<h2 id="4-forces-influencing-product-adoption">4 forces influencing product adoption</h2>



<p>This concept was proposed by <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://therewiredgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Re-Wired Group</a> (they help business customers embed the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dashly.io/blog/jobs-to-be-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jobs-To-Be-Done</a> framework into product strategy). According to the concept, there are four forces at play influencing product adoption. Two of them typically work in your favor, while the other two play against you.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/customer-switch.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/customer-switch.jpg"><figcaption><em>Current product issues and new product privileges make you switch, while habits and fear of change make you stay.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With the right tactics, you can make all forces work in your favor. Increase product adoption by doing these things:</p>



<ol><li>Highlight the imperfections of your potential customer’s current product.</li><li>Show how well your product solves their issues.</li><li>Decrease the fear of change and explain how they can easily switch to your solution.</li><li>Decrease the potential customer’s attachment to their current product.</li></ol>



<p>Now let’s look closer at each of the four forces.</p>



<h3>1. Highlight imperfections of a current product</h3>



<p>Talking badly about others is not your thing? Try highlighting shortcomings of your customer’s current solution and noting how your product makes up for these imperfections. A user may not instantly decide to switch, but at least they’ll think of a change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is perfectly illustrated on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.getguru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GetGuru</a> main page.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/getguru-1.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="346" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/getguru-1.jpg"><figcaption><em>GetGuru shows how happy their users are after switching</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/solutions.jpg" alt="solutions" width="512" height="213" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/solutions.jpg"><figcaption>They promise to provide users what they need, express their value in full, and encourage them to buy.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>2. Make it clear how you solve user problems</h3>



<p>Let’s be straight : selecting a product, mastering it, handling reviews, and onboarding it is demanding. The goal of this stage is to make your product so appealing that a prospective customer is willing to do everything to experience what you offer.</p>



<p>Testimonials, demos, and cases are great ways to help customers visualize the fruitful outcomes of using your product.</p>



<p>GetGuru demonstrates the digitized value in their testimonial section:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/business-value.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="294" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/business-value.jpg"></figure></div>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Figma</a> uses reviews of large business customers for that purpose:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figma-1.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figma-1.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>This helps eliminate all doubts that the product brings feasible results.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. Decrease the fear of change</h3>



<p>A user may be well aware of their current product’s shortcomings. But will they actually benefit from the change? What if it doesn’t work or even worsens everything?</p>



<p>These concerns are legitimate. Your task is to alleviate them. Changing customer habits often requires more than smart marketing. First, get your user to download a trial, and then show value before it’s too late. Whether or not a user will have an “aha moment” depends on how well you present your product.</p>



<p>An “AHA-moment” is an instant when a user decides to buy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Defining it is tricky, but you’ll know it when you feel it. Here’s a simple example: remember joining your first WhatsApp group chat when it dawned on you that SMS couldn’t do anything like this. This is an “aha moment” when you embraced the value.</p>



<p>Onboarding in your product should be about an “aha moment” rather than a tour of your features. This is the key to embracing the value of your product and worrying less about giving up their old solution.</p>



<h3>4. Decrease attachment to the old</h3>



<p>You’ve surely heard that someone was choosing their current product because someone recommended it or because it was used by “everyone else”. When trying something new, we feel more comfortable if we know there’s always someone out there for us who we can call for help.</p>



<p>But what’s right for most people isn’t right for everyone. Some companies claim, on the contrary, that they’re “not for everyone”. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DuckDuckGo</a> is surely less popular than Google or Yahoo that monetize user search.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/duck-duck-go-1.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/duck-duck-go-1.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>What to do to draw potential customer’s attention to your benefits over a sense of belonging to an old product? Offer them something they desperately miss (online privacy) or mention your support options (so they don’t have to ask friends for help).</p>




<h2 id="3-ways-to-improve-product-adoption">3 ways to improve product adoption</h2>



<p>Working with the above four forces is quite convincing and helps encourage users to try your product. But it’s not an exhaustive list of keys to successful product adoption. We can name at least three more effective ways.</p>



<h3>1. Improve your onboarding experience</h3>



<p>Successful onboarding does not only show how to do things in your product. It also explains the value. Your customers have at least one goal in mind: saving time, making money, connecting with users, etc. Onboarding is how you guide users towards it.</p>



<h3>2. Improve your product</h3>



<p>If you think your product needs improvements, it doesn’t mean you should instantly release new features or change the UI. Here are other effective ways to make your product better:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Add new features to improve adoption among your current users. </strong>Listen and react if users ask you to add a feature. We’re not saying they will definitely use it, so you can ask them to prioritize. Will they prefer a calendar integration over a tab for notes?</li><li><strong>Change to increase usage frequency. </strong>If customers don’t use some product features, clever changes can make it more appealing. In the search engine case, this might mean adding new filters.</li><li><strong>Change to acquire new users. </strong>Do your customers say something like “I’ll use it as soon as I can…” or “I’m not using it yet because I can’t…”? If yes, some changes (to what customers want to use) can speed up product adoption.</li></ul>



<h3>3. Improve customer support</h3>



<p>If customers can’t handle your product even with a manual at hand, they’ll leave. We all lack time and drown in the market of options. So it’s easier for us to stick to an old solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another way to enhance adoption is to make support closer to a customer. In the perfect world, a user should not leave your app when reaching out for help. Because if they leave, they may never get back. These simple tools will help your support become more accessible:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Add videos. </strong>Add short demos in pop-ups, overlays, or in-app tabs. Users will get help when they need it and easily get back to work.</li><li><strong>Set up a live chat. </strong>Chats help quickly get answers. Make a chat accessible in every section of your website.</li><li><strong>Use chatbots if you have a large audience. </strong>Set up auto-replies for non-working hours. Go through user questions because many of them can be resolved by a chatbot.</li></ul>



<p>Your potential customer may act reluctant to your new solution. You can embrace the reasons for their reluctance and overcome them. Show them how your product helps achieve goals, and users will stop focusing on switching inconveniences and will see the true product value!</p>

				<p>Our backend system is built on <strong>AWS</strong>. Today I’m going to tell you how we had cut costs three times for the servers by using spot instances on the production environment. I’ll also walk you through configuring auto scaling. Firstly, you will see the overview of how it works and then we provide the instruction to launch it.</p><h2 id="what-are-spot-instances">What are spot instances?</h2><blockquote>Amazon EC2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot instances</a> are spare compute capacity in the AWS cloud available at steep discounts. &nbsp;Amazon says they can reach 90%, in our experience, it is ~3x, varies depending on the region, AZ or instance type. Their main difference from the regular ones is that they can be shut down at any time.</blockquote><p>That’s why for a long time we thought it was okay to use them for DEV environments, or for calculating tasks with saving the intermediate result to S3 or database but not for PROD. There are third-party solutions that allow using spots for PROD, but we didn’t implement it due to numerous kludges to our case. The approach described in the article fully works within standard AWS capabilities, without additional scripts, crons, etc.</p><p>Next, I’m going to provide some screenshots which show spot instances pricing history.</p><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>eu-west-1</strong> region (Ireland). The price is predominantly stable within three months, cost-savings now are <strong>2.9x</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png" srcset="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-13.png 1600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-13.png 2400w"></figure><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>us-east-1</strong> region (N.

It sends requests to <em>EC2 Target Group</em> (TG). TG is responsible for opening ports on the instances for ALB and connecting them to the container ports of <em>Elastic Container Service</em> (ECS). ECS is an analog of <em>Kubernetes</em> in AWS, which manages <em>Docker</em> containers.</p><p>One instance can have multiple functioning containers with the same ports that’s why we cannot assign them fixed. ECS reports to TG that it launches a new task (in Kubernetes terminology it is called <em>“Pod”</em>). It checks free ports on the instance and assigns one of them for the new launching task. Also, TG regularly checks if the instance and API are functioning with a health check. If it sees any problem, it stops sending requests there.</p><h4 id="ec2-auto-scaling-groups-ecs-capacity-providers-">EC2 Auto Scaling Groups + ECS Capacity Providers.</h4><p>In the diagram above, the <em>EC2 Auto Scaling Groups</em> (ASG) service is not indicated. We can learn from the title that it is in charge of auto scaling. However, AWS didn’t have built-in capability to manage the number of running machines from ECS until recently. ECS allowed scaling the number of tasks, for example, based on CPU or RAM usage or the number of requests. But if the tasks took all the available instances, new machines were not launched automatically.</p><p>This changed with <em>ECS Capacity Providers</em> (ECS CP). Every service in ECS can now be linked with ASG. And, if the tasks don’t have enough running instances, more instances will be started (but within the established limits of ASG). It works the other way around as well. If ECS CP sees standing idle instances, without tasks, it will command ASG to shut them down. ECS CP can indicate the target capacity percent of instancesso that a certain number of machines would always be available for rapid task scaling. We’ll talk about it later.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-templates-">EC2 Launch Templates.</h4><p>Before describing the creation of the infrastructure, the last service I’m going to talk about is <em>EC2 Launch Templates</em>. It allows creating a template to launch all the machines to avoid repeating it every time from scratch. Here you can choose the type of the launching machine, security group, disk image, and lots of other parameters. It’s possible to indicate user data as well that will be uploaded to all the running instances. You can run scripts in the user data, for example, you can edit the content of<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS agent configuration file</a>.</p><p>One of the most important configuration parameters in this article is<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-spot.html"> ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING</a>=true. If this parameter is <em>turned on</em>, then as soon as ECS receives a signal that the spot instance is being taken, it switches all its running tasks into <strong>Draining</strong> status. <em>No new tasks</em> will be assigned for this instance. If there are any tasks that are <strong>Pending</strong> on this instance, ECS cancels them. It no longer receives the requests from the balancer as well. You get the notification about deleting the instance two minutes before it happens. In this regard, if your service doesn’t execute the task for more than two minutes and doesn’t save anything to the disk, you can use spot instances without losing any data.</p><p>Talking about the disk, AWS has recently<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-ecs-aws-fargate-support-amazon-efs-filesystems-generally-available/#:~:text=To%20use%20EFS%20with%20ECS,or%20TLS%20encryption%20in%20transit."> made</a> it possible to use <em>Elastic File System</em> (EFS) with ECS. Even using the disk with this approach is not an obstacle, but we haven’t tested it, because we don’t need the disk to store the status. After receiving <strong>SIGINT</strong> by default (it is sent in the moment of task switch into <strong>Draining</strong> status) all the running tasks will be stopped in 30 sec, even if they haven’t completed. You can change this time with<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT</a> parameter. The main rule is not to set it for more than 2 minutes for spot machines.</p><h2 id="-reating-a-service-">Сreating a service.</h2><p>Let’s proceed directly to create the described service. I’ll describe some useful features that were not mentioned above.</p><p>Generally, it’s a step-by-step instruction, but I won’t mention any basic or more specific cases. All the operations are made in <em>AWS Management Console</em>, but you can achieve the same results with <em>CloudFormation</em> or <em>Terraform</em>. We use Terraform in Adapty.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-template-">EC2 Launch Template.</h4><p>With this service, you can create a configuration of machines. You can manage the templates in <em>EC2</em> → <em>Instances</em> → <em>Launch templates</em>.</p><p>Amazon machine image (AMI). Specify the disk image which will be used by instances. For ECS, in most cases, it’s better to use an optimized image from Amazon. It is regularly updated and contains everything necessary for ECS functioning. To find out the relevant image ID, go to<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html"> Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs</a> page, choose the region, and copy AMI ID for it. For example, for us-east-1 region, relevant image ID at the time of this writing — <em>ami-00c7c1cf5bdc913ed</em>. You need to paste this ID to <strong>Specify a custom value</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Instance type.</strong> Specify an instance type. Choose the one that is best suited for your task.</p><p><strong>Key pair (login).</strong> Specify the certificate for SSH connection.</p><p><strong>Network settings.</strong> Specify network settings. The <strong>networking platform</strong> in most cases should be Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). <strong>Security groups</strong> serve to protect your instances. Since we’re going to use the balancer in front of the instances, I would recommend specifying the group which allows inbound connection only from the balancer. That means you will have two security groups: one for the balancer which allows inbound connections from anywhere via <em>80 (http)</em> and <em>443 (https)</em> ports, and the other one for the machines which allows inbound connections via any port from the balancer group. We have to open outbound connections in both the groups via <em>TCP protocol</em> to all the ports for all the addresses. We can limit the ports and addresses for the outbound connections, but in that case, &nbsp;it is necessary to constantly monitor that you’re not trying to address anywhere via the closed port.</p><p><strong><strong>Storage (volumes). </strong></strong>Specify the disk parameters for the machines. Disk capacity can’t be less than the one specified in AMI, for ECS Optimized, it is 30 GiB.</p><p><strong>Advanced details.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Purchasing option.</strong> </strong>It asks whether we want to buy spot instances. We do but <u>don’t mark</u> the checkbox here. We’ll configure it in <em>Auto Scaling Group</em>, it has more options there.</p><p><strong>IAM instance profile.</strong> Specify the role for the the instances. The instances need access rights to operate within ECS. The access rights are usually defined in <em>ecsInstanceRole</em>. In some cases, the role is existing in your AWS account. If not then here is the<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html"> instruction</a> on how to do it. After its creation, specify it in the template.</p><p>Next, there are a lot of parameters, basically, you can leave the default, but each of them has a comprehensible description. I always turn on <em>EBS-optimized instance</em> and <em>T2/T3 Unlimited</em> parameters, if we use<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html"> burstable</a> instances.</p><p><strong>User data.</strong> Specify user data. We will edit the file <em>/etc/ecs/ecs.config</em> which stores the ECS agent configuration.</p><p>Here is the example of how user data may look like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo "ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA={\"registry.gitlab.com\":{\"username\":\"username\",\"password\":\"password\"}}" &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd</strong> — this parameter indicates that the instance belongs to a cluster with the given name which means this cluster will be able to place their tasks on this server. We still haven’t created a cluster, but we will use this name when creating it.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true</strong> — the parameter points that after receiving a spot instance turn off signal, all the tasks must be switched to Draining status.</p><p><strong>ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m</strong> — the parameter indicates that after receiving the SIGINT signal, all the tasks have one minute before being killed.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker</strong> — the parameter indicates that we use a docker-scheme as an authentication format.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA=...</strong> — these are the parameters of the connection to a private container registry, where all your Docker images are stored. If they are public there is no need to specify anything else.</p><p>In this article I will use a public image from <em>Docker Hub</em>, there is no need to indicate <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE</strong> and <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH…</strong></p></section></div>

<h2>The container revolution</h2>



<p>Information and Communication Technologies have evolved at a really fast pace over the past few years, changing dramatically the way information systems and applications are built. Software development has brought along many changes and revolutions, allowing people to focus now mainly on the business applications. The key drivers of this shift have been (1) to be able to package and run applications anywhere regardless of the underlying computing architecture, and (2) to keep applications isolated from each other to avoid security risks and interference during operations or maintenance processes.</p>



<p>Keeping applications isolated on the same host or cluster can be difficult due to the packages, libraries and other software components that are normally required to run them. <strong>Hardware virtualization</strong> was a solution to this problem, since applications could be kept apart on the same hardware by using Virtual Machines. Packaging an application within a VM allowed also to run it on any infrastructure that supported virtualization, which provided a lot of flexibility to the whole concept.However, Virtual Machines come with some <strong>serious limitations</strong>: moving them around is not that easy, since they are typically quite heavy and there are always difficulties associated with maintaining and upgrading applications running within a VM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, we have all witnessed how <strong>container technologies</strong> have revolutionized the way enterprise and distributed applications are being developed and deployed. Containers clearly offer a more portable and flexible way of packaging, maintaining and running applications. They allow admins to deploy, move and replicate workloads more quickly and easily than using Virtual Machines. While containers as a concept have been around for a while, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> was the technology that introduced several crucial changes to the existing container technology, making containers more portable and flexible to use. This resulted in a turning point towards the adoption of <strong>containerization and microservices</strong> in software development (e.g. cloud-native development).</p>



<p>Docker gave us an easy way to create container-based applications, and to package them in portable images containing the specifications for which software components the container will run. Docker’s technology brought <strong>cloud-like flexibility</strong> to any infrastructure capable of running containers, with their container image tools allowing developers to build libraries of images, compose applications from multiple images, and launch those containers and applications on local or remote infrastructure alike.</p>







<h2>Orchestrating containers</h2>



<p>Nowadays, many companies have embraced a cloud-native paradigm in developing applications and have shifted from a “monolithic” approach to a microservice approach. While deploying a single container can be an easy task, <strong>things get a bit more complicated when deploying multi-container applications</strong> on distributed hosts given that in these cases a Docker engine alone is not enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where <strong>container orchestrators</strong> (like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank">Docker Swarm</a>) play an important role in scheduling containers to run on different servers, moving containers to a new host when the host becomes unhealthy, restarting containers when they fail, managing overlay networks to allow containers on different hosts to communicate, orchestrating storage to provide persistent volumes to stateful applications, and so on.</p>



<p>However, container technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes) also come with some serious limitations, such as for example <strong>security </strong>(application containers share the kernel OS) and<strong> multi-tenant environments. </strong>In order to provide a multi-tenant and secure environment to deploy containerized applications one has to provision different “virtual environments” to each user or group of users, typically by deploying several isolated Kubernetes clusters on top of a Cloud Management Platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CMP is then responsible to manage and orchestrate the underlying virtual resources (i.e. virtual machines, virtual networks and storage) that are used by the different Kubernetes deployments that are in charge of scheduling application containers within those isolated environments. This approach <strong>adds an extra control layer</strong> that ends up<strong> increasing management complexity, resource consumption and operational costs.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/logos_5-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/logos_5-12.png 600w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/logos_5-12-300x53.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure></div>



<h2>OpenNebula’s combined approach</h2>



<p><strong>But what if we could remove one of those layers?</strong> Cloud Management Platforms such as <strong>OpenNebula</strong> have been implemented with multi-tenancy and security by design, providing already powerful orchestration features but for VM-based applications (e.g. networking, storage blocks, high availability with live/cold migrations, etc.). And with the release of version <a href="https://opennebula.io/firework/">5.12 “Firework”</a>, OpenNebula has gone a step further to offer a <strong>pioneering approach</strong> that merges the strengths of a Cloud Management Platform with the many benefits of container technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>OpenNebula</strong> announced a few months ago that <a href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/">Firecracker</a> would be incorporated as a new supported virtualization technology. This microVM technology, developed by <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> and widely used as part of its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">Fargate</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a> services, has been especially designed for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based services. OpenNebula has managed to <strong>bridge the gap between two technological worlds</strong>, leaving behind the old dilemma between using containers—lighter but with weaker security—or Virtual Machines—with strong security but high overhead.</p>



<p>By adopting the increasingly popular approach of running microservices based on containerized applications, and thanks to its<strong> native integration with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a></strong>, OpenNebula has now become a powerful alternative to deploy and orchestrate containers as secure and fast micro-VMs. This solution combines all the features of a solid CMP but<strong> without adding extra layers</strong> of orchestration, thus reducing the complexity, resource consumption and operational costs.</p>



<p>We have just embarked ourselves in this <strong>amazing journey</strong> towards creating a truly innovative model for deploying and running containerized applications, based on combining <strong>two fascinating technologies</strong>: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/" target="_blank">OpenNebula and Firecracker</a>. In the next months we’ll be working hard to improve and get the most out of this new integration, and to make it as easy as possible for admins and developers to use OpenNebula as a solution for their needs. Fasten your seat belts and enjoy the flight! 🚀</p>







<p>PS – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-kubernetes-comparing-two-container-orchestration-models/" target="_blank">Here</a> you can see a full comparison between <strong>OpenNebula and Kubernetes</strong>. And if you are interested in trying by yourself OpenNebula’s new integration with Firecracker and Docker Hub, here you have a screencast (part of this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360045029871-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-a-Firecracker-Cloud-Integrated-with-Docker-Hub-on-AWS" target="_blank">step-by-step tutorial</a>) on how to deploy a one-node Firecracker cloud on an <strong>AWS bare-metal server</strong>:</p>

July 23, 2020 | https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/MainKernelAndUserAPI | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/MainKernelAndUserAPI">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>C's <code>main()</code> is one of the places where Unix's user and kernel APIs differ</h2>

	<p><small>July 23, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Modern Unixes often like to draw a legalistic distinction between
the API provided to user space by the kernel and the Unix API
provided to programs by the 'standard library', by which they mean
the standard C library. Some people, me included, don't entirely
like this (I've written about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnixAPIAndCRuntime">whether the C runtime and library
is a legitimate part of the Unix API</a>). However,
regardless of what I might think about it, Unix has long had at
least one place where there was a real difference between the normal
API that everyone used and the API that the kernel actually
implemented. I'm talking about the traditional C style <code>main()</code>
entry point that starts your program.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the basic form of <code>main()</code>, with <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code>;
you're called with a count of the arguments and an array of strings.
In slightly more advanced usage there is a third argument, <code>envp</code>,
an array of environment variables. This format is very old in Unix.
The two argument version of <code>main()</code> goes back to at least Research
Unix <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V4/man/man2/exec.2">V4's <code>exec(2)</code></a>, while
the three argument form with environment variables seems to appear
in <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/man/man2/exec.2">V7's <code>exec(2)</code></a>.</p>

<p>However, this is not the actual <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/ProgramStartTwoApproaches">program entry point</a> that the V7 Unix kernel used when
starting your program, and the actual entry point had a somewhat
different API than <code>main()</code>. Conventionally, V7 C programs actually
started at an assembly symbol called <code>start</code>; the simplest version
of the assembly code involved is in <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/src/libc/csu/crt0.s"><code>crt0.s</code></a>
and it clearly does a certain amount of setup work. There are other
versions of this startup in <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/src/libc/csu">/usr/src/libc/csu</a> that
do various amounts of more work, such as arranging to profile your
program.</p>

<p>(Research Unix V6 also had a <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/source/s4/crt0.s"><code>crt0.s</code></a>,
but it's rather different; I think there are no loops, for example.
If I understood PDP-11 assembly language I might have a better idea of
what it was actually doing.)</p>

<p>In V7, the differences between the user API for <code>main()</code> and the
kernel API are not huge. In current Unixes, there's often rather
more going on, especially once you include dynamic loaders and
things like the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/519085/">'auxiliary vector'</a>
present in some Unixes. I suspect that the simplest version of a
modern one to look at is <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl libc</a> for
Linux, where <a href="https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/crt/crt1.c">crt1.c</a>
and <a href="https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/env/__libc_start_main.c">the main libc bootstrap functions</a> are
relatively straightforward.</p>

<p>(Some of the code is because the C runtime environment needs to be
set up (and yes, modern C has a runtime), but a certain amount of
it is converting between how the kernel involves programs and how
<code>main()</code> wants to be invoked.  For example, notice how musl libc's
main start function isn't called with <code>argc</code> as an explicit argument;
instead it retrieves <code>argc</code> from memory.)</p>

<h3>Sidebar: The interesting V7 trick with data address 0</h3>

<p>At the end of every version of V7's crt0.s is a little bit that
initially puzzled me:</p>


<blockquote><pre>.data
   .=.+2   / loc 0 for I/D; null ptr points here.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>What this is doing is that it's reserving two bytes of space at the
start of the data section. V7 Unix ran on PDP-11's that supported
<a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/PDP-11_Memory_Management">split instruction and data address space</a>, so the data
section starts at (data) address 0. Reserving two bytes at the start
insures that no variable or other thing in the data section can be
located at address 0 and so C NULL is always distinct from valid
pointers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

              <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Data augmentation is a technique to increase the variation in a dataset by applying transformations to the original data. It is often used when the training data is limited and as a way of preventing overfitting.<br>
Data augmentation is usually done on the fly when training a model. While it can be done, it is usually not practical to store the augmented data on disk. After all, we want to vary the augmented data every time it is shown to the model!</p>
<p>In Keras, there's an easy way to do data augmentation with the class <code>tensorflow.keras.image.preprocessing.ImageDataGenerator</code>. It allows you to specify the augmentation parameters, which we will go over in the next steps. For more details, have a look at the <a href="https://keras.io/api/preprocessing/image/#imagedatagenerator-class">Keras documentation for the ImageDataGenerator class</a>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>This would be a good point to look at the Colab notebook. You can follow the tutorial by running the code in an ipython notebook on Colab for free, with zero setup! This allows you to play around with the parameters and explore what we discuss here in more detail.<br>
Click the link on the top of the post to either open the notebook in Google Colab or download it to run on your machine.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First we will need some setup code. We start by importing <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> and util functions to load the data.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import requests
</code></pre><p>Next we download a sample image from the Github repository, save it locally and load it into memory. And we display the image as a reference of what our input is before data augmentation.</p><pre><code>url = 'https://github.com/dufourpascal/stepupai/raw/master/tutorials/data_augmentation/image.jpg'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('image.jpg', 'wb').write(r.content)

image = load_img('image.jpg')
image = img_to_array(image).astype(int)
data = np.expand_dims(image, 0)
plt.axis('off')
plt.imshow(data[0])</code></pre><figure><img src="https://stepup.ai/content/images/2020/07/sample_original-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Our original input image, the lovely Caracara from Patagonia!</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>For ease of use, we define a function that initializes and returns an <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> object that we will then use to set the specific parameters when we visualize the augmentation.<br>
The <code>fil_mode</code> is set to 'nearest' by default, but for the visualizations in this tutorial we set them to a constant black value. You can set different behaviour by specifying <code>fill_mode</code> to one of <code>{'constant', 'nearest', 'reflect', 'wrap'}</code></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>def default_datagen():
  datagen = ImageDataGenerator( fill_mode='constant', dtype=int)
  datagen.fit(data)
  return datagen</code></pre><p>Next we define a plot function that will take an <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> object and a dataset as input. This function will display a number of augmented images in a grid. Here we see the basic use of the data augmentation pipeline. Calling <code>datagen.flow(data)</code> returns a python generator that returns augmented images. Here we use that generator to get a new augmented image by using <code>next()</code>. We then plot the augmented image and move on to the next one. By default a single row and of five images is plotted, but this can be changed to see more augmented images.</p><pre><code>def plot_augmentation(datagen, data, n_rows=1, n_cols=5):
  n_images = n_rows * n_cols
  gen_flow = datagen.flow(data)

  plt.figure(figsize=(n_cols*4, n_rows*3))
  for image_index in range(n_images):
    image = next(gen_flow)
    plt.subplot(n_rows, n_cols, image_index+1)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.imshow(image[0], vmin=0, vmax=255)</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Now let's visualize the different transformations available in Keras! In each step, we will initialize a default <code>ImageDataGenerator</code> object, then set the augmentation parameters we are interested in, and finally visualize the result.</p>

plot_augmentation(datagen, data)</code></pre><p><code>zoom_range</code> allows the specification of the random zoom range as a tuple/list of two values <code>[lower, upper]</code>. The value specifies how much the image gets larger or smaller, e.g. a value of 1.0 means no zoom, a value of 0.5 would mean zoomed out so the image is only 50% as large as the input, and a value of 2.0 would mean zoomed in at 200%.

<p>As you can see, we can create an impressive set of variation from just a single sample image. And data augmentation in Keras can be done in a just few lines of code. For standard image classification tasks, this is often sufficent to start and can be used right out of the box.</p>
<h3 id="next">Next</h3>
<p>What I personally would like to see is an option to vary the colors, but this cannot be done out of the box with Keras. For that we have to implement it ourselves: Check out the next tutorial in the seris where we implement our own augmentation transformation!</p>

      OS.css is a fork and extension of <a href="https://github.com/botoxparty/XP.css">XP.css</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/jdan/98.css">98.css</a>. It extends these two libraries by
      adding in missing widgets, adding improved tab functionality, and adding the ability to make
      windows draggable. It also adds a <a href="https://chowderman.github.io/os/scoped/index.html">scoped version</a> of the library adding scoping to all of
      the widgets so that they don't override the default CSS styles, since many widgets in the
      original libraries are unscoped (for example &lt;button&gt;'s default styles are overridden
      in the unscoped version, but won't be overriden in the scoped version unless you add the
      appropriate attributes to the buttons).
    </p>

    

    <p>
      This library relies on the usage of <strong>semantic HTML</strong>. To make a button, you'll need
      to use a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. Input elements require labels. Icon buttons rely on
      <code>aria-label</code>. This page will guide you through that process, but accessibility is a primary
      goal of this project.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can override many of the styles of your elements while maintaining the appearance provided by
      this library. Need more padding on your buttons? Go for it. Need to add some color to your input labels?
      Be our guest.
    </p>

    <p>
      This library also supports a <a href="https://chowderman.github.io/os/scoped/index.html">scoped version of the library</a>, where none of the default styles
      are overriden. To apply styles in the scoped version, you add a <code>gui</code> attribute. See
      the scoped version for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
      This library includes both a version with and without JavaScript. The JavaScript is used to
      add functionality to switch tabs and to make windows draggable. If neither of these features
      are needed, you can omit the inclusion of the JavaScript portion of this library.
    </p> 

    <p>
      You can use OS.css by simply downloading a copy of the one of the libraries and using the 
      link tag like you would with any other stylesheet.

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          A standard button measures 75px wide and 23px tall, with a raised outer and inner border.
          They are given 12px of horizontal padding by default.

        <p>
          When buttons are clicked, the raised borders become sunken.

          Disabled buttons maintain the same raised border, but have a "washed out"

        </p>

        <p>
          Note: You <strong>must</strong> include a corresponding label <strong>after</strong>
          your checkbox, using the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element with a <code>for</code> attribute
          pointed at the <code>id</code> of your input. This ensures the checkbox is easy to use with
          assistive technologies, on top of ensuring a good user experience for all (navigating with the tab key,
          being able to click the entire label to select the box).

<p>After playing around with the new tool from OpenAI, named GPT-3, it’s clear that we’ve probably reached an inflection point in the progress of artificial intelligence.&nbsp; To think of it in more commonplace terms, parents will often have the interesting experience of watching their children suddenly gain competency in a skill, seemingly overnight.&nbsp; There will be lots of struggle and failed starts and then as if all in one moment, boom, suddenly the kid can do something new.&nbsp; GPT-3 hails a moment when machine learning got turned on and suddenly it could do an amazing new trick, and it does this new trick with astonishing coherence and ability.&nbsp; The hope of this episode is to present a description of what GPT-3 is in layman’s terms and then explore some possible ways that this could be used, and how it might impact society.</p>


<p>But first, what is GPT?&nbsp; The acronym stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer.&nbsp; Ok sure, but what exactly is it?&nbsp; How do we interact with it?&nbsp; In simple terms <em>it’s a program that accepts some text and then generates a continuation of this text.</em>&nbsp; What exactly does this look like?&nbsp; For those with access to the GPT-3 playground through OpenAI, it just looks like an empty textbox with a submit button.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now enters a principle that has emerged during the last week as developers have played around with it:</p>

<p><em>Garbage in, Garbage out.</em></p>

<p>GPT-3 mimics the style, tone and character of whatever text you feed it.&nbsp; (For those curious, you can hit the submit button with an empty textbox and GPT-3 will generate something.&nbsp; The first time I did this it started talking in French about libraries.&nbsp; The second time it started talking about heatwaves being in the headlines.)&nbsp; There is a bit of an art to the prompt you give GPT-3.&nbsp; Again, garbage in, garbage out.</p>


<p>Here are two examples:</p>


<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation: <em>A confused voice came from inside. When I opened the door, the person that looked back at me was Hayama Hayato. Why was Hayama, who I only shared memories of me playing soccer with, in my room at this hour of the night? That question immediately flew out from my mouth.</em></p>


<p>Second example, same exact input:</p>

<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation:&nbsp; <em>they respond 'Super' – at least they were back in the days of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. I love the little sixties touches too, the poodle skirts, the VWs, the hippydom.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>The input of “what’s up?” doesn’t provide any context, so GPT-3 generates text in a random direction each time. But notice how coherent it was…</p>

<p>But if you provide GPT-3 with context, say, the first couple paragraphs of an episode from Tinkered Thinking and it will generate a continuation of that episode which is shockingly on point and very believable.&nbsp; Episode <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=836">823</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">824</a> are non-fiction episodes that explore just this idea.&nbsp; About half of each episode was <em>generated</em> by GPT-3.&nbsp; This collaboration was also done for <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">Episode 826</a> which is a fictional short story.&nbsp; GPT-3’s contribution to that episode is not explicitly indicated but there too it wrote approximately half of the text, and that episode in particular demonstrates an aspect of context in relationship to GPT-3.&nbsp; The program’s initial contributions to the fictional short story are a bit clunky.&nbsp; But as the story goes on, GPT-3’s contributions get <em>better and better </em>as the entire context of the story grows. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be obvious at this point that if you were to do something nefarious like input some dangerous ideas into GPT-3, then it would continue in the same vein.&nbsp; This is an important point that lends to obvious criticism and it’s a topic of which OpenAI is extremely conscious.&nbsp; The use of GPT-3 in the wild requires a security application among other safeguards to limit GPT-3’s use in obviously negative ways.&nbsp; Again, the principle holds: <em>garbage in, garbage out.&nbsp; </em>That holds not just for level of composition but of course, also subject matter.</p>

<p>Now how exactly does this magic work?&nbsp; To answer this, it’s necessary to wrap one’s mind around machine learning.&nbsp; How exactly does a machine learn?&nbsp; To be honest, nobody really knows.&nbsp; In a way, we’ve created a black box that can learn to figure things out.&nbsp; To really answer the question: how exactly does a machine learn is similar to asking: how does a person arise from all the chatter between neurons in a person’s brain?&nbsp; No one can answer that question.&nbsp; And likewise, no one can really answer the question about what’s really going on when a neural net is being trained in a machine learning context.&nbsp; That being said, we can describe some aspects of the process that help us grasp a sense of what’s going on.</p>

<p>Turns out, Machine Learning doesn’t seem too much different than human learning, though the differences are enormous and enormously important.&nbsp; Our brains are vast networks of neurons and they all talk to each other and somehow from all that chatter, we as individuals, emerge.&nbsp; To be sure, our understanding of the brain is still rudimentary, but it’s clear that neurons ‘listen’ to the chatter around them via a web of arms or dendrites that reach out to other neurons, and based on the signals they hear, they fire their own signal to be heard by another neuron or set of neurons.&nbsp; Multiply that process roughly 86 billion times, give it the right shape, and some configuration and boom, you have a human brain that will try to figure things out.&nbsp; (To dive a little deeper it’s useful to know that an infant actually has around 100 billion neurons, and as we learn how to exist in the world, we pare down this number significantly.)</p>

<p>GPT-3 was trained to generate text using a computational model that bares a lot of similarity to our jumble of neurons we call a brain.&nbsp; The analogy is so close in fact that this computational model is referred to as a ‘neural net’.&nbsp; Now here’s an interesting fact about GPT-3:&nbsp; the neural net upon which it was trained contains 175 billion parameters, or what you might think of as neurons.&nbsp; But there’s a distinction here we need to be very careful about.&nbsp; The node, or neuron, or what’s often referred to as a ‘parameter’ within this neural net is not a neuron in the same way that our neurons are.&nbsp; There is a similarity, but our neurons are vastly more complex than the nodes that exist within a neural net.&nbsp; Within the context of machine learning, a neuron is a fairly simple weighted value.&nbsp; These values dictate how one node talks to another.&nbsp; An actual human neuron is far more complex regarding how it listens and signals it’s neighbors.&nbsp; We must also take into account that there are many different types of neurons in the human brain specializing in different ways with different functions.&nbsp; Human neurons also have varying numbers of dendrites which are used to listen to other neurons.&nbsp; A single neuron can have over 100 dendrites and each dendrite has characteristics that determine how and what the core neuron hears and ultimately what sort of signal it sends.&nbsp; This presents a level of complexity that far exceeds what is going on with the nodes or neurons in a machine learning context.&nbsp; And this difference in complexity should make it intuitive why GPT-3 was trained using so many ‘neurons’.&nbsp; It’s construction and organization of these ‘neurons’ is far simpler and more straightforward than what we have going on between our ears, so where the neural net lacks in terms of shape and initial configuration, it attempts to make up for in size and the brute force achieved by speed and computational iteration.</p>

<p>So how does a neural net learn in order for something like GPT-3 to work?&nbsp; First you need a gargantuan amount of data.&nbsp; GPT-3 was trained using text from the internet - an amount of text that is just inconceivable for a single human being to think about reading.&nbsp; Think of every comment, every post, every description, every pdf book freely available, all the tweets and blogs, manuals, dissertations, threads, rantings - all of it.&nbsp; That was the block of text that was given to the neural net for it’s training. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So how does that training work?&nbsp; Imagine I gave you a paragraph to read, but I left off the last word, and asked you to guess what that word is.&nbsp; As a human, you’d probably do really well at this.&nbsp; You’d certainly do a perfect job guessing a <em>sensible</em> word that fits the context and which works, regardless of whether you guess the actual word. Here’s a tiny example:&nbsp; Please provide the last word that should be added to the end of this ___________ . &nbsp;</p>

<p>The above example is easy.&nbsp; The word is ‘sentence’.&nbsp; But.&nbsp; Since I’ve started a new paragraph, you could also plop the word ‘paragraph’ into the slot and it still works.&nbsp; This is the task that GPT-3 has become remarkably good at:&nbsp; <em>what word would make sense to come next?&nbsp; </em>The training of the neural net essentially asked this question of itself over and over.&nbsp; We can imagine the neural net reading 99 words and guessing what the 100th word would be.&nbsp; It would then check the answer and see how far ‘off’ the answer was, and based on the difference it would backtrack through the neural net to find all of the nodes that were most responsible for the choice of the wrong word, and then it would adjust the weights of those nodes, which in turn effects how those nodes will talk to one another in the next round.&nbsp; Run this game an astronomical number of times with an inconceivably large amount of text and after a while the neural net gets pretty good at the game it’s playing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What’s important to note is that the computer is not actually ‘reading’ the text that’s given to it.&nbsp; The computer first creates embeddings for this block of text.&nbsp; What is an embedding?&nbsp; It’s arbitrary, but it’s a form that the computer can actually work with.&nbsp; Computers function using binary code.&nbsp; Each letter that you read on a website is actually derived from a binary code.&nbsp; So embeddings are bits of binary code that are associated with the words and word-snippets that the computer ‘reads’.&nbsp; These embeddings …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was browsing <a href="https://whitepages.com/">Whitepages</a> when I noticed a request to <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/dstl-wp.js">https://www.whitepages.com/dstl-wp.js</a>[1].  After beautifying the code, I found the string “Distil” in the code many times.  “Distil” refers to Distil Networks, one of the leading bot detection vendors until its acquisition by Imperva in 2019.  Whitepages seems to use them for their anti-scraping abilities.</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>
<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>The first part of the code is the fingerprinting module.  This code is not really obfuscated, just minified (unlike the headless detection code later).  It collects a bunch of information from the browser using (mostly) standard techniques.  <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/the-evolution-of-hi-def-fingerprinting-in-bot-mitigation/">According to Imperva</a>, their “Hi-def” fingerprints encompass over 200 device attributes and have a 0% false positive rate.  The fingerprinting code appears to be based off Valve’s <a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs2/blob/master/fingerprint2.js">fingerprintjs2</a> (identical function names and contents in many cases), albeit with some additions.</p>

<p>This code collects (via JavaScript):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>* Browser User-Agent - navigator.userAgent
* Browser language - navigator.language
* System language (IE only) - navigator.systemLanguage
* User language (IE only) - navigator.userLanguage
* Screen resolution - screen.width/screen.height
* Timezone offset in hours - (new Date).getTimezoneOffset() / -60
* IndexedDB support - !!window.indexedDB
* HTMLElement addBehavior support (IE only) - !!document.body.addBehavior
* WebSQL support - !!window.openDatabase
* CPU Class (IE and Firefox only) - navigator.cpuClass || navigator.oscpu
* Browser platform - navigator.platform
* Do Not Track support - navigator.doNotTrack
* Browser plugins (non IE) - navigator.plugins enumeration
* ActiveX plugins (IE only) - trying/catching creating ActiveXObjects with names from a list of popular plugins
* Canvas fingerprinting - standard method.  Creating a Canvas element, drawing some rectangles and arcs on it, along with the string "Cwm fjordbank glyphs vext quiz,", then getting the base64 PNG representation via toDataURL and hashing it
* Font detection - using a method popularized by [Lalit Patel](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/szepeviktor/d28dfcfc889fe61763f3/raw/6bbcda9766e65fd81e951400e0ceca03c14b6fad/fontdetect.js).  Essentially, they measure the dimensions of the browsers default (fallback) monospace, sans-serif, and serif fonts.  They then measure the dimensions of a large list of fonts.  If there is a difference in dimensions between a font in the list and the fallback font, the font is installed.
* Video codec detection - creating a new video element and checking whether video.canPlayType() returns true for various codecs, including video/ogg; codecs="theora" (Theora with OGG), video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E (H264 MP4), video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis" (WEBM).
* Audio codec detection - creating an audio element and checking whether audio.canPlayType returns true for audio/ogg; codecs="vorbis" (OGG Vorbis), audio/mpeg; (MP3), audio/wav; codecs="1" (WAV), audio/x-m4a; (M4A), audio/aac; (AAC)
* WebGL fingerprinting - Creates a Canvas element with a WebGL context.  Then draws a gradient object with shaders and gets the base64 string with toDataURL.  They then check for the system's max texture anisotropy.  After that, they gather GPU vendor and renderer information with the WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension.
* Touch support - navigator.maxTouchPoints || navigator.msMaxTouchPoints and attempting to create a TouchEvent handler (if it's successful then touch is supported)
* Browser vendor - navigator.vendor
* Browser product (should always be equal to "Gecko", even on Chrome based browsers) - navigator.product
* Browser build number - navigator.productSub
* Internet explorer detection through parsing navigator.appName
* Chrome detection (worth noting that this tends to be defined on most Chromium derivatives, including Microsoft Edge) - presence of window.chrome
* Webdriver support (the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#example-1) declares that tools implementing the Webdriver browser automation standard should declare navigator.webdriver as true) - presence of navigator.webdriver
* Current URL protocol - document.location.protocol
* Session history length - window.history.length
* CPU core count - navigator.hardwareConcurrency
* Battery interface support - presence of navigator.getBattery
* Media device (webcams, microphones, speakers) enumeration - navigator.mediaDevices
* Cookie support - navigator.cookieEnabled
* Browser appName (always "Netscape" on modern browsers) - navigator.appName
* Screen Color Depth - screen.colorDepth
* String representation of setTimeout function (used to detect tampering, it should return function setTimeout() { [native code] } but if a wrapper is being used it will return something different) - setTimeout.toString()
* String representation of setInterval function (same reasoning as above) - setInterval.toString()
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="proof-of-work">Proof of Work</h3>

<p>After collecting all of this information, Distil then runs its “proof of work.”  Similar to the Cloudflare Under Attack mode, your browser basically generates some sort of token using JavaScript that the server then checks and (hopefully) ensures it was generated with the JavaScript.  Distil’s “proof of work” seems to just be generating random alphanumeric characters and doing some basic math calculations with them.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function t(e) {
  for (var t = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", r = "", n = 0; e &gt; n; ++n) r += t.substr(Math.floor(Math.random() * t.length), 1);
  return r;
}
h("DistilProofOfWorkStart");
var r = new o, n = (new Date).getTime() + ":" + t(20);
r.mine(n, 8, function (t) {
  h("DistilProofOfWorkStop"), e({proof: t});
});

...

mine: function(e, t, r) {
    for (var i = 0, a = Math.pow(2, 32 - t);;) {
        var o = i.toString(16) + ":" + e;
        i++;
        var s = n(o);
        if (parseInt(s.substr(0, 8), 16) &lt; a) return void r(o)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="browser-automation-testing">Browser Automation Testing</h3>
<p>Following the proof of work, the automated/headless browser detection code is run.  This code is obfuscated.  The first thing I noticed was that there was a large array of strings represented with hexadecimal escaping.  This is a technique most commonly used by <a href="https://obfuscator.io/">obfuscator.io</a>.  This makes it very hard to read – <code>_0x159[54]</code> is much harder to read than “document.”  To undo this obfuscation, I used Jarrod Overson’s great <a href="https://github.com/jsoverson/shift-refactor">shift-refactor</a> library.  It uses Shape Security’s Shift AST to allow you to parse and manipulate JavaScript.  To replace all member expressions (i.e. arr[1]) with their string values, I used the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const { RefactorSession } = require('shift-refactor');
const { parseScript } = require('shift-parser');
const Shift = require('shift-ast');

const fileContents = require('fs').readFileSync('./distillnetworks.js', 'utf8');

const tree = parseScript(fileContents);

const refactor = new RefactorSession(tree);

refactor.replace(
  `ComputedMemberExpression[expression.type="LiteralNumericExpression"][object.type="IdentifierExpression"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    var referencedArrayName = node.object.name;
    var arrayQuery = `VariableDeclarator[binding.name="` + referencedArrayName + `"][init.type="ArrayExpression"]`;
    var referencedArrayDeclaration = refactor.query(arrayQuery)[0];
    if (!referencedArrayDeclaration) {
      return node;
    }
    if (referencedArrayDeclaration.init.elements[node.expression.value].type !== "LiteralStringExpression") { // if we're working with a non string, return
      return node;
    }
    var newValue = referencedArrayDeclaration.init.elements[node.expression.value].value;
    if (!newValue) {
      return node;
    }
    else {
      return new Shift.LiteralStringExpression({
        value: newValue,
      });      
    }
  }
);
console.log("/* Replaced all array references with real value */")

console.log(refactor.print());
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Essentially, we find all of the member expressions (<code>ComputedMemberExpression</code>) that index the array (the <code>IdentifierExpression</code> – though this can refer to any variable) using an integer (<code>LiteralNumericExpression</code>).  We then find the array that is being indexed (searching for the <code>VariableDeclarator</code> of type <code>ArrayExpression</code> with the same name as the referenced variable), get the actual value, make sure it is a string, and then return it if so.  Otherwise, we return the original <code>node</code>.  After running this (<code>node distillnetworks_deobfuscator.js &gt; distillnetworks_deobfuscated.js</code>), readability has massively increased, but there is still much to be desired.</p>

<p>I then noticed one more annoyance.  There was a function, <code>_0x9e50x4</code>, that, if passed “O” as an argument, would return <code>["Snow Leopard", "Lion/Mountain Lion", "Yosemite", "Mavericks"]</code>.  Otherwise, it would return <code>[]</code>.  These strings themselves are not actually used in the code, but their substrings are actually used to assemble other strings.  To replace the <code>_0x9e50x4</code> calls with their real values, I added the following code above the <code>refactor.print</code> call.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var _0x9e50x4List = ["Snow Leopard", "Lion/Mountain Lion", "Yosemite", "Mavericks"];
refactor.replaceRecursive(
  `CallExpression[callee.name="_0x9e50x4"][callee.type="IdentifierExpression"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    if (node.arguments.value="O") {
      var newArray = new Shift.ArrayExpression({elements: []});
      for (var i = 0; i &lt; _0x9e50x4List.length; ++i) {
        newArray.elements.push(new Shift.LiteralStringExpression({value: _0x9e50x4List[i]}));
      }
      return newArray;
    }
    else {
      return new Shift.ArrayExpression({
        elements: [],
      })
    }
    return node;
  }
);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, there was another thing that was hurting my eyes.  <code>_0x9e50x1</code> was being referenced instead of <code>window</code>.  To increase readability, I added another <code>refactor.replace</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var windowObjectName = "_0x9e50x1";
refactor.replace(
  `IdentifierExpression[name="` + windowObjectName + `"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    return new Shift.IdentifierExpression({
      name: "window",
    })
  }
);
console.log("/* Done renaming " + windowObjectName + " …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

I plan on following up with a more in-depth piece in a few months, but hopefully my first impression can help you decide if you want to give HEY a try.</p><p>Let’s address the elephant in the room first. In 2020, the majority of paid email services have one feature in common – custom domain support. For many, being able to use their domain of choice is something worth paying for. Take a look at Gmail, ProtonMail, and Outlook.</p><p>All three of these services have a free tier that uses their respective domains, and a paid tier that supports custom domains.

You’re not paying for custom domain support. You’re paying for a revolutionary new take on email, and the associated joy it brings you.</p><p>At this stage, HEY is definitely not perfect, but if you’re only using the lack of custom domain support to judge HEY’s pricing model, you just don’t get it. Saying “Hey isn’t for me because it doesn’t support custom domains” is fine. However, only saying “Hey isn’t worth $99/year because it doesn’t support custom domains” without discussing the value of its features seems a little biased and doesn’t make much sense to me.</p><p>I’m sure I’ll have more to say over time. For now, I think HEY is worth the $99/year price tag for three reasons.</p><h2 id="1-hey-is-inherently-valuable">1. HEY is Inherently Valuable</h2><p>Custom domains are important to some people, but definitely not to the majority of people. This means using custom domain support as a primary value quantifier is flawed in the context of mainstream adoption.</p><p>Instead of defaulting to the “only services that support custom domains should be paid” mindset, people should open their eyes and realize that a complete rebuild of email, with or without custom domain support, is also valuable.</p><h2 id="2-hey-saves-time-time-is-money">2. HEY Saves Time, Time is Money</h2><p>HEY’s core features (which I’ll get into more detail) later are useful and well executed for a V1 product. As I use it more and more, I can see how HEY will save me a lot of “email time” in the long term.</p><h2 id="3-an-investment-of-sorts-in-basecamp">3. An Investment of Sorts in Basecamp</h2><p>Basecamp is an incredible project management software. I personally don’t use it at the moment because I’m not a freelancer anymore, but I’ve used it in the past. I’m a huge fan of the company and its ethos.</p><p>Basecamp’s track record is actually the main reason I bought into HEY in the first place. I have faith that they’ll turn a decent V1 product into an incredible V2 product in the future. They can’t do that without financial support, so that’s why I’ve paid for not one, but two, HEY email accounts.</p><p>Now that we’ve estabished HEY is not a ripoff, let’s go over its four key features. I won’t go into too much details in this initial review because I’m still exploring HEY and forming new opinions day by day.</p><h2 id="the-screener">The Screener</h2><p>One of HEY’s key selling points is the Screener. When you receive an email from a new address, HEY politely asks if you want to receive email from from said address. If you like having a door on your house, you’ll love the Screener.</p><h2 id="the-imbox">The Imbox</h2><p>The “imbox”, short for “important-box” (I assume), is HEY’s take on “inbox”. Unlike a typical email inbox which contains both read and unread items in a single unorganized stream that resembles zebra stripes (read and unread), HEY’s imbox takes a more organized approach by only displaying two kinds of emails –&nbsp;important and “previously seen”.</p><figure><picture>

Practically speaking, after training the Screener over time, the only emails that end up in your imbox will be the important conversations that matter to you.</p><h2 id="the-feed">The Feed</h2><p>The Feed is where newsletters go. I don’t have enough emails in my Feed yet, but the idea here is that HEY will display emails in the Feed in a Twitter-esque fashions. This allows you to endlessly scroll through your newsletters without having to open and close individual emails. I love the idea.</p><figure><picture>

This is one of my favorite features of HEY because I really hate seeing receipts in my inbox –&nbsp;mostly because they serve as a constant reminder of money being spent. At the same time, I don’t want to delete them because they’re very useful for tax season. With this in mind, being able to lock them away in HEY’s Paper Trail is pretty great.</p><figure><picture>

When I receive a non-urgent email, I typically read it, mark it unread, and move on with my day. Ever since I started using HEY, the concept of reading an email and then immediately marking it unread feels antiquated and dumb.</p><p>HEY handles non-urgent emails with its “Reply Later” and “Focus &amp; Reply” features. If you don’t want to respond to an email immediately after reading it, just click Reply Later. When you’re ready to respond to the emails, go into <a href="https://hey.com/features/reply-mode/">Focus &amp; Reply mode</a> and knock out responses one by one. Focus &amp; Reply is a great user experience, and feels very productive.</p><h2 id="native-apps">Native Apps</h2><p>In addition to the HEY web app, there are also apps for iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Entire industries and billion-dollar businesses have been built on the concept of simplifying complex things, and HEY is no different.</p><p>One of the most common arguments against HEY (a paid product), is the idea that it’s possible to replicate some of its features to a certain extent with Gmail (a free product) filters. There are a few things wrong with this criticism.</p><h2 id="qualifier-paradise">Qualifier Paradise</h2><p>This comparison involves qualifiers like “some” and “certain extent”. The inclusion of these qualifiers in HEY-Gmail comparisons only demonstrates one thing –&nbsp;it’s not possible to replicate HEY with Gmail.</p><h2 id="the-value-of-abstraction">The Value of Abstraction</h2><p>The vast majority of email users are not going to sit around and fiddle with filters and workflows in Gmail. Everyone can make a cup of coffee, but people still go to Starbucks and pay through the nose for coffee. Everyone can learn how to fix their kitchen sink, but there is still demand for plumbers.</p><p>There is immense value in <a href="https://stackify.com/oop-concept-abstraction/">abstraction</a>, and HEY has done a good job of distilling complex logic into a few simple features that are easy to understand. If you want to spend time tinkering with filters in Gmail to avoid paying $8.25/month, then Gmail is for you. For people who want to use a neatly packaged and intuitive product without self-induced mental ovehead, there’s HEY.</p><p>I’m a happy user of HEY, but I can honestly say it’s not perfect –&nbsp;not even close. Here are a few additional thoughts about the current state of HEY, and how I think it can improve in the future.</p><h2 id="i-love-the-user-interface">I Love the User Interface</h2><p>HEY’s user interface is controversial. Some people think it’s too cute, others think the fonts are too big. I personally love it. It’s very functional and Basecamp-esque. I hope they don’t change the look.</p><h2 id="screener-needs-to-be-improved">Screener Needs to Be Improved</h2><p>The Screener needs some improvement in terms of granularization. Right now, it can only make decisions based on email address, and completely ignores the contents of the email. In other words, there is currently no way to tell HEY to put some emails from a specific email address in the Imbox and another email from the same address in the Feed.</p><p>I haven’t thought about it too much, but I’d like to see some see a customizable second layer to the Screener for these edge cases.</p><div><p><span>"There is immense value in abstraction, and HEY has done a good job of distilling complex logic into a few simple features that are easy to understand."&nbsp;#hey&nbsp;#heyemail<br></span></p></div><h2 id="i-got-two-hey-email-addresses">I Got Two HEY Email Addresses</h2><p>Earlier, I mentioned I paid for two HEY email address. I did this for two reasons. First, and most importantly, I wanted to support Basecamp and HEY’s privacy-centric quest to redefine email in an extremely crowded space occupied by the likes of Google, Microsoft, and other tech giants.</p><p>I think what HEY is attempting to do is worthy of praise, and I’m more than happy to put my money where my mouth is.</p><p>Secondly, I really do enjoy using HEY and wanted one address for personal correspondence and another one for business-related emails.</p><h2 id="a-smart-pricing-model">A Smart Pricing Model</h2><p>HEY’s pricing model for premium two and three letter email address is very smart. Normal addresses cost $99/year, three-letter addresses are $349/year and two-letter addresses go for $999/year.</p><figure><picture>

<h2>Authors</h2>




<h2>Abstract</h2><p>RISC-V has many attractions, ranging from the openness of the architecture, its clean-slate design based on simplicity and scalability, as well as the RISC-V Foundation's strong commitment to security from the ground up.

As such, RISC-V is an extremely attractive platform for the open-source seL4 microkernel with its unrivalled verification and security story. This has led industry players, especially Germany-based HENSOLDT Cyber, making a major bet on the combination of RISC-V and seL4, resulting in them funding the formal verification (implementation correctness proof) of seL4 on RISC-V.

I will discuss our experience with implementing and verifying seL4 on the RISC-V architecture, and related open-source technologies we are employing to allow us to build secure systems. This includes the CAmkES component framework that supports a security-by-architecture approach, and the Cogent systems language that is designed to reduce the cost of verified system components such as file systems and device drivers. 

One interesting aspect are timing channels. We have been working for a number of years on *time protection*, the temporal equivalent of memory protection, as a systematic timing-channel prevention. Our experience on x86 and ARM processors is that they lack the mechanisms to do this completely. RISC-V presents an opportunity to get this right, and I will report on my experience working with the RISC-V Foundation's Security Standing Committee to get the required mechanisms into the processor specification.

<p>
When I was 14-years old, I used to snatch my father's Topcon Auto 100 camera out of a living room drawer and smuggle it to school every day and though my parents knew about it, they never said anything. Dad eventually gifted me the camera when I graduated from junior high school and it led me on a lifetime journey as a photographer. My fascination with cameras grew by leaps and bounds and while visiting the library one day, I checked out a photography book which highlighted several iconic images like John Filo's Kent State shootings, Nick Ut's Napalm girl, the 1937 Hindenburg disaster, Eddie Adams famous Vietnam War image, Joe Rosenthal's flag raising at Iwo Jima and a picture of Buzz Aldrin standing on the moon. Then something weird happened. A strange feeling of urgency overcame me as if my blood pressure increased or something. It was almost as if the photographs I was viewing would have something to do with my life. Call it a sixth sense or premonition, I never forgot the moment. 
 </p>
<p>
In 1989 I was having lunch at a girly bar in Bangkok's Pat Pong district near The Associated Press office where I worked as the Southeast Asia Picture Editor. Though the strippers were dangerous, the food was delicious and as I watched the small TV screen behind the darkened counter, the news channel flashed images of thousands of pro-democracy protesters marching near Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Though China was outside my territory, the story had been building over several days and I knew it was only a matter of time before New York headquarters would fly me in.

<p>
One of the things I learned while working at United Press International in the 1980's was to always have a visa in your passport for surrounding hot-spots. With this philosophy I headed to the Chinese consulate and applied for a journalist visa. Returning the following day, I was annoyed having to wait in a long line, but the unpleasantness was short lived when an official in a black suit motioned me to the front counter. “Mr. Widener—it would not be convenient for you to visit the Peoples Republic right now”. Miffed, I took back my passport and headed to a nearby travel agency.
<br></p>
<p>
The consulate's rejection came as no surprise, but I wanted a piece of the story, so I got the approval from my local bureau chief to fly to Hong Kong and apply for a Chinese tourist visa. Because my passport had previous journalist stamps in it, I had to get a clean one and the only way to do that was to report it lost.
</p>
<p>
The US consulate woman in Hong Kong was not amused. Apparently there had been a rash of lost passports from journalists and after an uncomfortable silence, she cocked her head and abruptly handed over the document. I took the new passport to a small travel agency run by a Malaysian family and purchased a short tour package tour to China. This allowed me to avoid the Chinese consulate directly, since the agency handled the formalities for their customers. The owner asked if I was sure I wanted to holiday in Beijing at such an unpleasant time and I answered enthusiastically “Sure—love it—can't wait”. I had no idea if the ploy would work. Though I was happy that the tourist visa was approved, I felt a little concerned at side-stepping the Beijing government's earlier rejection and worried it could get me in trouble.
</p>
<p>
As expected the order came down from New York to help with the Tiananmen story. It was good news, except for one small problem. They wanted me to take a complete portable darkroom, boxes of photographic supplies and chemicals and this included my massive Nikon 600mm f4.0 telephoto lens. If that did not sound alarm bells at customs … nothing would.
</p>
<p>
I had an unsettled feeling, as my plane approached the Beijing airport. How was I supposed to make it past customs with a rolling camera store? I loaded my baggage, supplies and camera gear into two trolleys and slowly pushed my way through the long line of passengers. My heart started pounding and I began to wonder how many situations like this shortened one's life. Just when it was my turn, a loud noise and scuffle rang out several counters down to my left. In disbelief, I saw an explosion of feathers everywhere. My steely-eyed customs agent sprinted towards an old lady, who was in a tug of war with several other agents while desperately clutching a live chicken. I quickly pushed my cart through the sliding doors and to a waiting taxi.
</p>
<p>
It turned out that the unsettled feeling on the plane was the start of a bad case of the flu, which would dog me for the remainder of the story and I soon began coughing incessantly. The city's heavy air pollution did not help. When I arrived at the AP Beijing office, Mark Avery was acting photo bureau chief and Chinese American photographer Liu Heung Shing had arrived from New Delhi a few days earlier.

My morning routine was to arrive at the Tiananmen Square at sunrise and photograph the protesters and hand full of hunger strikers. There was almost a carnival atmosphere as thousands of people freely wandered the massive square and pretty much did whatever they wanted. There was a security ring that encircled one of the main statues with the most heavily guarded section being at the top where the anti-government printing presses worked overtime. Looking back, I am not even sure if most of the people understood what democracy was but they liked whatever was happening and wanted more of it.

One of the most memorable things I witnessed was the sun rising behind a 33-ft tall replica of the Statue of Liberty which protesters called the “Goddess Democracy”. It faced off directly against the giant portrait of Mao Tse-Tung at the Forbidden City which was across the Chang-an Boulevard. The symbolic clash between Democracy and Communism was striking and a huge embarrassment to the government.

After a week of coverage, the crowds began to swell to over 100,000 people and the jostling between People's Liberation Army soldiers and the protesters had become heated. Our Asia photo editor had been in Beijing since the arrival of Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev and he decided to return to Tokyo … the day before the government crackdown. Since the Beijing photo operation was left with only three photographers, straws were drawn to decide who would work the first night shift. I was the lucky draw and headed towards the Square with AP reporter Dan Biers.
</p>
<p>
The night was calm as Dan and I peddled our bicycles down the Chang'an Boulevard. I decided to travel light and stay inconspicuous so I only carried a single Nikon F3 titanium camera, two wide-angle lenses and a Vivitar 283 flash which was all stashed in my Levi jacket. Though the nights had been relatively peaceful, I told Dan that I had a bad feeling about that night. As we neared the Square, people started pulling large steel barricades from the middle and sides of the street to block the advance of any potential military vehicles. I got off the bicycle and started photographing as the protesters moved silently in the night. A toothless old man with a long beard and heavy coat approached me with a crazy laugh. He eagerly opened his jacket and stashed in his belt was a large hatchet dripping with blood as if it was a proud trophy fish. This was not a positive experience and I nodded to the man with a weak smile and quickly left the area.

Biers and I reached a side street off the Great Hall of The People and we soon spotted bright white flashes in the distance. Suddenly, we heard the sound of crashing metal on the main boulevard and people started screaming and running towards us. An armored personnel carrier with a large caliber machine gun pointing from the front came tearing around the corner so fast that orange sparks flew off the treads. Dan and I dropped our bicycles and I dived into some ivy on the side of the road. As it passed by with the rock throwing protesters in hot pursuit, I reluctantly picked myself up and followed suit at a distance. I was terrified like never before and all I wanted was to run in the opposite direction as fast as possible. The mob had cornered the APC at the locked gates of the Great Hall and they climbed on top shouting and raising hell. After I managed several pictures, I noticed my flash was running low on battery power and my film suply was almost exhausted. I was faced with a big dilemma. Should I head back to the AP office for film and batteries or should I stay with what little film and flash power I had? Since I saw no other press photographers, I decided to race back to the office and make the US deadlines with what I had.

My coughing got worse and my head was throbbing from a severe headache. I needed antibiotics, but there was no time to see a doctor. As I turned onto the Chang'an Boulevard, another APC that was completely engulfed in flames lurched and sputtered towards me. Protesters had shoved steel objects in the treads to slow it down and the soldiers were roasting alive inside. I fumbled for my 35-70mm zoom lens, but it was missing and probably lost in the ivy. All that was remaining was a very wide 24mm lens which meant I had to get very close to everything. To capture the unfolding event, I had no choice but to stand directly in front of the armed APC. I was fully aware that some protesters had overtaken military buses and displayed captured AK-47 assault rifles a few days earlier so I had no idea whether the soldiers inside would think I was shooting at them and return gunfire. Though I was scared to death, my adrenaline took control of my body …</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve tried so many different things I’ve found online</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy crap it works now, such a small problem I’ve lost hours to :(</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All I want to do is a simple thing, this is all so unnecessarily complex</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try using <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/">react-hook-form</a>.</p>
<p>React-hook-form is different, because it (mostly) keeps its state in the DOM (like classic HTML form elements).</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a single field form in react-hook form (taken from their docs):</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useForm <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react-hook-form'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>Example</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> handleSubmit<span>,</span> register<span>,</span> errors <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useForm</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>handleSubmit</span><span>(</span>onSubmit<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>input
        name<span>=</span><span>"email"</span>
        ref<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
          required<span>:</span> <span>'Required'</span><span>,</span>
          pattern<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            value<span>:</span> <span>/^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$/i</span><span>,</span>
            message<span>:</span> <span>'invalid email address'</span><span>,</span>
          <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
      <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>{</span>errors<span>.</span>email <span>&amp;&amp;</span> errors<span>.</span>email<span>.</span>message<span>}</span>

      <span>&lt;</span>input
        name<span>=</span><span>"username"</span>
        ref<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
          <span>validate</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> value <span>!==</span> <span>'admin'</span> <span>||</span> <span>'Nice try!'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
      <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>{</span>errors<span>.</span>username <span>&amp;&amp;</span> errors<span>.</span>username<span>.</span>message<span>}</span>

      <span>&lt;</span>button type<span>=</span><span>"submit"</span><span>&gt;</span>Submit<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Compare that to your existing form code. I don’t know about you, but my React forms with Formik would have twice as many lines of code to achieve the same thing.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that it’s using <code>ref</code>, rather than tracking state within the library. Since moving to react-hook-form, I no longer have to worry about state not syncing correctly in huge forms.</p>
<p>Everything just works as expected, and my code is much simpler too.</p></div></div>]]>

			<p>The relationship between Technology (or Science) and Philosophy used to be indistinguishable. Historically, the philosophers of the past were also the mathematicians, scientists and inventors of the day. How much impact this had we don’t know, but we can be sure that many breakthrough discoveries came from the scientist philosopher.</p>
<h4>Things are different now – we tend to keep technology separate from subjects like Philosophy.</h4>
<p>As a technologist, any philosophy knowledge I gained was through my own instigation. Partly this was curiosity but also because of a need to better understand issues like bias and ethics that have surfaced in Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>At first glance, Philosophy seems to be unrelated to the business of developing new technology. Yet the subject had enormous impact on the way our systems were designed, the rules we follow and actions we take every day. For example, the politics of our governments, the laws around property and land ownership, our justice systems, scientific methods, so much stems from philosophy. It’s for those reasons that it can seem odd that it’s only studied by a small population today.</p>
<p>One option you could start with is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/243685.A_History_of_Western_Philosophy">‘History of western philosophy’ by Bertrand Russell</a> to get a comprehensive history and analysis that makes this book a classic. It’s a long read but worth adding to your book shelf as a reference. I continued reading at every opportunity (check out <a href="https://www.newphilosopher.com/">New Philosopher</a>) but up until now I’d never taken a course or any formal study.</p>
<p>As someone from a techie and product development background, I wanted to find out more.</p>
<h4>1. Think like a Philosopher</h4>
<p>For reference I signed up to the <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UQx+META101x+1T2020/course/">Philosophy and Critical Thinking online course on EdX.</a></p>
<p>The modules cover terms and concepts like arguments, premises, truth, cogency, skepticism, conditionals, and identity. The general approach involves dissecting statements and claims into parts which will appeal to a coder or scientist e.g. If x and y are true then that means z. The hard bit is where you can’t rely on x and y because you can’t be sure that any knowledge is really true. It quickly gets exhausting having to question everything and you might find yourself getting frustrated. But this is one of the key areas that had philosophers debating throughout history i.e. how do we really know what is true? For scientists we apply this thinking in our experiments and in technology we look to the hard data asking ‘what does the data tell us?’. The processes identified in philosophy are similar to the ones we use in science. e.g. using inductive reasoning to work something out.</p>
<p>The payoff in discovering truth in science and tech is that you find a solution or build a product in the end. However philosophy doesn’t lead you to a neat solution. The best you can hope for is that when faced with a&nbsp; choice, you have some justification in the decision you made. And this is where the real connections between technology and philosophy start becoming apparent in a practical way.</p>
<h5>The Trolley problem and The Allegory of the Cave</h5>
<p>The famous ‘trolley problem’ is used to demonstrate some ethical considerations we could be faced to deal with. A runaway trolley is on a train line headed for disaster and you have a choice to direct it one way or the other. The first way would save one person and the second way would save 4 people (there are variations on this example but the overall dilemma is the same). What do you do – take the option to save more people by sacrificing the one? This is the same choice an autonomous car may have to make if faced with an impending accident. There isn’t one correct answer, but there are ways to think about options to take.</p>
<p>Another important analogy is <a href="https://www.philosophyzer.com/the-allegory-of-the-cave-by-plato-summary-and-meaning/">Plato’s ‘Allegory of the cave’</a> which addresses human perception. It puts forward the claim that our senses alone are not enough to fully understand reality. We need philosophical reasoning in addition. The analogy describes a situation where prisoners have been tied up in cave for their entire lives and are only able to see shadows of people outside. The shadows are perceived as reality to them but if they stepped outside, they would see there were real people. In Plato’s much longer story, one of the prisoners escapes to tell the other what he saw but they don’t believe him because they can’t comprehend it and think he’s lying.</p>
<p>This story can represent a number of things but it be could applied to human perception today. Could it be compared to the perception we are creating in social media and the risk it poses to understanding the truth? Perhaps the shadows are like fake news or trending tweets. There is no time to reason and explore what could really be happening, so we’re reduced to the predicament of the cave prisoners, trying to make sense of the little we can see. The answer for Plato as he sets out in The Republic, was more education, specifically more philosophers in charge who could reason and educate. Whether that’s the answer here, we don’t know but further discussion could be merited.</p>
<h4>2. Be mindful of techniques we apply – Can we really rely on Prediction in AI?</h4>
<p>The other interesting concept in the topic of knowledge is the idea that nature is not uniform and therefore we cannot safely guarantee that what happens after will be the same as what has happened before. In this case, knowing when doubt is acceptable is an important element in analyzing knowledge. We can relate this to our tendency in AI to use algorithms that make predictions for information or actions. These are all based on past behavior of ourselves and our world (nature). Whilst it proves right some of the time, if we were to take a philosophical approach maybe we would be hesitant to be so reliant on prediction. Prediction leads to bias and the notion we shouldn’t assume things will always behave as we expect just because they happened before. There is a lot more of this topic which could question our reliance on predictive algorithms as a form of intelligence.</p>
<h4>3. Question the big things – Do computers really know anything?</h4>
<p>Finally, onto another intersection between technology and philosophy that is worth mentioning – do computers really have knowledge? Having knowledge before experience or sensing is referred to as ‘a priori’ in Philosophy. As humans we sometimes acquire knowledge independently without having actually experienced it. When it comes to computers though, if they don’t have experience of it can we say with confidence that they really know it? We could ask if it even matters for our purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/">The Chinese room thought experiment by Searle</a> questions the idea of computers having real knowledge. In the imaginary experiment there is a room with a person inside whose job it is take Chinese symbols and respond to them. The person in the room knows nothing of Chinese but they with can look them up and give an appropriate response back. The person outside assumes there is a Chinese speaker inside the room. The ‘argument’ is that the person in the room, much like a computer, does not really understand and therefore the infamous Turing test is not adequate.</p>
<p>Without really knowing, should we put computers in charge and trust them to do the right thing in every situation? We can’t be sure humans would always do what’s right but with computers, maybe we need to tell them about morals and ethics. One of the lessons in the course was about the social contract made between members of a society that set out agreements like the freedom and benefits of the state. Could that include intelligent AI controlled computers?</p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, AI will be making decisions on our behalf. If we can influence how it should respond (e.g. the trolley problem) based on the philosophy we choose, we could at least be aware of what might happen. So does a computer need to know things like a logical fallacies or moral codes? Possibly not but feeding computers information on how humans think might be both useful.</p>
<h4>Everyone should study Philosophy, especially if you’re in AI</h4>
<p>There’s much more in the course that I haven’t mentioned but my aim was to pick out some things relevant for technology today.&nbsp; Everyone should study philosophy if they can. It’s become easier to access than ever before. Even if you skip the history and only focus on the skill of critical reasoning. This is especially true if you’re in science and tech but it’s absolutely essential for AI. In fact there’s an argument to say you probably shouldn’t be allowed near it without some training. You can read more about the intersection of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/10/3948">Science and Philosophy here</a> and specifically some reasons for <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/what-software-engineers-can-learn-from-studying-philosophy-b746cf7126d1">software engineers to dive deeper.</a></p>

  <time datetime="2019-03-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Mar 2019</time>
  
<p>Welcome back! In the <a href="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/2019/02/25/eigenvectors/">last post</a> we derived Eigenvectors. In particular, we saw how useful they are in analyzing matrices we need to apply again and again.</p>

<p>In this post, we’re going to dive into one of the most famous applications of Eigenvectors - the original PageRank algorithm that allowed Google to create the world’s best search engine. PageRank was Larry Page’s phD thesis while at Stanford. He spun out this amazing algorithm to redefine search and create one of the most iconic companies in the modern era. We’re going to re-derive it here and see that it’s just a simple application of Eigenvectors!</p>

<p>By the end of this post, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Feel like you could have come up with PageRank yourself.</li>
  <li>Understand how eigenvectors are central to PageRank.</li>
  <li>See how central eigenvectors are to dynamic processes in general.</li>

<h3 id="making-friends">Making Friends</h3>

<p>Ok let’s build out our understanding of pagerank using a hypothetical scenario.</p>

<p>Let’s say you just moved to a new city and you’re trying to make some new friends. You need to figure out which of your new friends to hang out with in your free time. But unfortunately you’re super busy and have very little free time!</p>

<p>So you need to rank all these potential friends to prioritize which ones to chill with.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2012/04/anchorman_a.jpg">

This could be you! Just need to find the friends...
</p>

<p>In a moment of clarity you realize the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Friends you’re close with are probably going to hang out with people you’d like.</li>
  <li>Someone everyone is friends with is probably someone you are going to be friends with.</li>
</ol>

<p>You decide to use these two insights to create a scheme you call <strong>FriendRank</strong>.</p>

<div><p>
FriendRank gives a potential friend a score (FriendScore) based on:

</p><ol>
    <li>
        How many people are friends with this person weighted by,
    </li>
    <li>
        How close you are to the people who are friends with them.
    </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/pagerank/abstract_friends.jpg">
    In the above picture, how close you are to a person is shown by the size of the circle. To find your friend score for potential friend <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, you just add up how close you are to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">D</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
</p>

<p>Let’s write this down as a formula. Let’s say the strength of the friendship between you and some person <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS(p)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>
The FS (FriendScore) for a potential friend Fred is:

<span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><munder><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></munder><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> FS(Fred) = \sum_{p \in Friends(Fred)} FS(p) </annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>

</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="calculating-our-first-friend-score">Calculating Our First Friend Score</h4>

<p>Let’s work through an example. Say you have 4 potential friends:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Jimmy (closeness score - 5)</li>
  <li>Maya (closeness score - 9)</li>
  <li>Lisa (closeness score - 8)</li>
  <li>Fred (?)</li>
</ol>

<p>In this world, you’re really close to Maya (with a score of 9) and Lisa (8) but only kinda close to Jimmy (5).</p>

<p>Only Jimmy and Maya are friends with Fred.</p>

<p>Graphically, this is:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/pagerank/fred_friends.jpg">
    Only Jimmy and Maya claim to be friends with Fred. Lisa seems to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptmM-m7Cl8U">tearing him apart</a>.
</p>

<p>So:

<h4 id="accounting-for-people-who-are-friends-with-everyone">Accounting For People who are Friends With Everyone</h4>

<p>Not such a crazy idea right? You start this process and you realize one thing. Your really close friend Maya claims to  be friends with EVERYONE. You start wondering, “Hmm maybe I need to downweight Maya’s opinion because she doesn’t really seem to be that picky”.</p>

<p>This is easy - we just divide Maya’s weighting score by how many people she claims to be friends with. That way if Maya claims 100 friends, his weighting for each friend is divided by 100. So our formula is now:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><munder><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></munder><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> FS(Fred) = \sum_{p \in Friends(Fred)} FS(p) \cdot \frac{1}{NumFriends(p)} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
</p>

<p>Going back to our example, our score becomes:
<span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>J</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>y</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>M</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>a</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS(Fred) = \frac{FS(Jimmy)}{2} + \frac{FS(Maya)}{4}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>9</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mn>7</mn><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS(Fred) = \frac{5}{2} + \frac{9}{4} = 4.75</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Awesome!</p>

<p>Let’s now simplify this formula a little.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Let’s call the set of all friends <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Let <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>I</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">{</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mtext>if</mtext><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mtext>p&nbsp;calls&nbsp;Fred&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mtext>otherwise</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">IsFriends(p, Fred) = \begin{cases}
   1 &amp; \text{if}\ \textrm{p calls Fred a friend} \\
   0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
 \end{cases}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

    <p>Then we can simplify our earlier formula as shown below:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><munder><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></munder><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS(Fred) = \sum_{p \in Friends(Fred)} FS(p) \cdot \frac{1}{NumFriends(p)} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<h4 id="so-whos-friends-with-whom">So Who’s Friends With Whom?</h4>

<p>Ok this is looking great! You decide to go ahead and implement this scheme with your friends Bobby, Lauren, Daniel, Rony, and Saba. You start by asking all your friends to write down who they’re friends with! So you send them all the following email:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        From: parry.lage@boogle.com
    </p>
    <p>
        To: Bobby, Lauren, Daniel, Rony, Saba
    </p>
    <p>
        Subject: Who are your friends?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My dearest "friends",
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I’m trying to rank you and all my other potential friends and need your help to do so. Below is a list of people. Please put a 1 next to their name if you call them your friend.
    </p>
    <div>
        <br>
        <table>
            <tbody><tr>
                <th>Person</th>
                <th>Friends?</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bobby</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lauren</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Daniel</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rony</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Saba</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody></table>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
        Parry Lage
    </p>
    
    <p>
        P.S. Just because I'm sending you this email doesn't mean we're friends.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Saba sends you something like this:</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th>Person</th>
        <th>IsFriends</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Bobby</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Lauren</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Daniel</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Looking good so far! You then remember you need to downweight Saba’s score by how many friends she claims to have. She’s claiming 2 friends here so we divide by 2 giving us:</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th>Person</th>
        <th>IsFriends</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Bobby</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Lauren</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Daniel</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rony</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Saba</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>You now decide to organize all your friends responses into a little table so that it’s easy to see. Each column of the table is a different friend. It looks like this (notice Saba’s answers above are the last column in the table below):</p>

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Bobby</th>

            <th>Rony</th>
            <th>Saba</th>

    Omg this is a lot more work than I expected.

<p>Ok we now have the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> - a Matrix who’s elements are <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>[</mo><mi>i</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>j</mi><mo>]</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>I</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>j</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>j</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A[i,j] = \frac{IsFriends(j, i)}{NumFriends(j)}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS_0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> - An initial guess of everyone’s FriendScore.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that we know who’s friends with who, we can figure out who’s really likely to be our friend.</p>

<p>We’d like to come up with a new FriendScore <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS_{1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> based on this information.</p>

<p>How do we do that?</p>

<p>Recall from earlier our formula for Fred’s FriendScore:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><munder><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow></munder><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>I</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS(Fred) = \sum_{p \in F} FS(p) \cdot \frac{IsFriends(p, Fred)}{NumFriends(p)}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So similarly, we want to update our rankings, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS_{1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, for our friends to be:</p>

<p>When do we stop this process? We stop when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> stops changing:</p>

Yes!

<h4 id="from-friends-to-pages">From Friends to Pages</h4>

<p>You’ve probably guessed at this point that you can switch the word friends to pages in the above and get PageRank! In the world of webpages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>One webpage claims to be “friends” with another if it links out to the webpage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google finds out who’s friends with who (our initial survey) by just crawling the web and finding out who links to who.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of “friends” a webpage claims to have is just the number of links present on the webpage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We create the matrix <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> by crawling the web. Once we have it, we find its eigenvector to get an estimate of the PageRanks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/page_graph.png">
    To get PageRank, just replace people with pages.

He also said that U.S. diplomats in China engage in infiltration activities.</p>  <p>"If we compare the two, it is only too evident which is engaged in interference, infiltration and confrontation," Wang said.</p>  <p>He also said that the Chinese Embassy in Washington has received bomb and death threats, and accused the U.S. government of fanning hatred against China.</p>  <p>President Donald Trump, whose re-election prospects have been damaged by the coronavirus outbreak, has blamed China repeatedly for the pandemic. Almost every day brings a fresh U.S. action against China, which Trump has repeatedly said is exploiting the United States.</p>    <p>On Tuesday, the Justice Department indicted two hackers based in China it accused of working on behalf of the government in Beijing. The men were accused of targeting firms that are developing vaccines for the coronavirus and of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world.</p>  <p>At a press conference, U.S. officials said the men did not obtain coronavirus research.</p>  <p>As well, the Commerce Department sanctioned 11 Chinese companies over alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region this week.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.13.2"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><strong>Restaurant staff across the country like myself are being asked to risk their lives for you to feel normal.</strong></p><p id="viewer-79vbk">My serving job at an expensive restaurant in Manhattan ended abruptly in mid-March. The last evening I worked, I had the distinct feeling of being a violinist in the quartet on the <em>Titanic</em>, doggedly serenading despite certain death as my sonatas/wine key attempted to assuage the panicked first-class passengers trying to flee.</p><p id="viewer-fnugu">
My restaurant had been taking precautions since February. Extra hand-wash and hand-sanitizer stations were installed and cleaning guidelines in English and Spanish posted in the kitchen. We gave all the pens nightly bleach baths, among other intensified cleaning protocols. Our managers told us to stay home if we were feeling literally the slightest bit sick, “unless you’re hungover,” they clarified lovingly.</p><p id="viewer-74a2l">
I washed my hands before and after I interacted with a guest in any way whatsoever : before I picked up silverware to mark the next course, before and after I touched clean or dirty dishes or had to squeeze through a crowd to reach the service bar. I tried not to count how many hundreds of people I interacted with in the course of my job, beyond the guests I was officially responsible for in my forty-person capacity section that I turned at least twice a shift. </p><p id="viewer-95ie2">
Guests would still sneeze and cough into our faces while we interacted with them, merrily tipping a wad of snot-soaked tissues into the olive oil ramekin for us to dispose of — a behavior that long predates and unfortunately I doubt will cease post-pandemic. It happened so often in those last weeks despite the increasing threat of infection that our general manager permitted us to wear gloves disposing of their used tissues in front of them: a desperate attempt to genteelly shame them into caring about our health too. </p><div id="viewer-cs09k"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.noraeberman.com/post/i-m-an-unemployed-waitress-don-t-dine-out-at-all" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbc3b8_7ffddcf5f7c649a5a95b9de8e38e937a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1056,h_702,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbc3b8_7ffddcf5f7c649a5a95b9de8e38e937a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-vtrm">
The majority of guests are not this thoughtless, and I promise I will keep the server rants to a minimum. However, the <em>Titanic</em>’s quartet is singing loudly again in my ear as I see folks not batting an eyelash at their waiter in hazmat gear, or when I read about officials debating the limits of indoor vs. outdoor seating capacities. In real-time I’m seeing <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/05/07/progressives-worry-open-streets-will-become-commercialized-and-not-serve-communities-in-need/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privatization of public space</a> all so we can make sure people can eat and drink outdoors during a <em>pandemic? </em>Rather than far more crucial matters like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/coronavirus-schools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reopening schools</a>? </p><p id="viewer-aaerm">
I have worked as a waitress on and off for fourteen years, and I do not think dining in or out of doors is safe to resume at all. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over 140,000</a> Americans have died of a lethal, highly communicable virus, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/06/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cases continue to climb</a>. Eating out places the burden of risk on restaurant staff, many of whom do not share the privileges of my white skin, citizenship, and modest generational wealth and are therefore <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/opinion/coronavirus-race-class.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately</a> dying of COVID-19. </p><p id="viewer-f2mse">
The risk factors of restaurants, bars and nightclubs as potential super-spreader events are well documented by health and epidemiological experts. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/study-finds-spikes-coronavirus-cases-161559634.html?soc_src=community&amp;soc_trk=fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study by JPMorgan</a> found that an increase in restaurant spending habits was the “strongest predictor” to a rise in infection rates. While it is significantly more likely to contract coronavirus <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-risk-higher-tight-indoor-spaces-with-little-air-flow-2020-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indoors</a>, even outdoor dining presents a context filled with possibilities for transmission. Alcohol inhibits social distancing and mask wearing, as does the consumption of food. Shouting specials and orders over a crowded table projects a spray of particles from the waitstaff and guests’ mouths, as does laughing, singing, and <a href="https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/can-you-get-coronavirus-from-talking-to-someone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking loudly</a> — all things common to any restaurant or bar. Even to-go service poses risks, with over-intoxication leading customers to congregate or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/dining/restaurant-risks-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harass the staff</a> when they’re asked to wear a mask and keep socially distant.</p><p id="viewer-ag6f7">
When a <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/06/01/asymptomatic-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly asymptomatic</a> customer decides to indulge that craving for frosé or enchiladas during a pandemic, they are asking largely uninsured restaurant staff to depend on two things to protect themselves. The first is their employer(s), who are in an existential fight for their survival, in an <a href="https://time.com/5658442/tipped-restaurant-workers-american-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry</a> where “normal” involves razor-thin margins and working without benefits or paid sick leave. The second is the customer. A tipped employee’s financial well-being is directly tied to their ability to connect with and serve strangers. Right now those strangers are our fellow Americans, who to say the absolute <em>least</em> are currently a mixed bag in their observance of mask, isolation, and social-distancing etiquette.</p><p id="viewer-5bsq0">
In talking to former coworkers and friends who have returned to work in restaurants across New York City and the country in recent weeks, nothing I have heard inspires confidence. It’s hard to not feel like our lives are valued less than that perfect martini our guests have been missing as they work safely from home. </p><p id="viewer-3lgf7">
We’re all scared. Many of us are artists or freelancers whose other sources of income from creative fields like the performing arts and film have also vanished. My husband and I calculate almost daily how long we can afford to stay in our home. Until September? October? At night I lie awake consumed with worry about all of my undocumented and otherwise marginalized coworkers. Latinx people alone make up 26.8% of the food &amp; beverage industry according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 figures</a> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and they are more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as likely to die of COVID-19</a> than white Americans like myself. </p><p id="viewer-8jenh">
Those of us that make a living in this industry do not deserve to be <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-economic-advisor-hassett-human-capital-stock-1004909/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“human capital stock”</a> sacrificed on the altar of denial, when the inherent nature of what we do is a proven driver of transmission, infection, and ultimately prolonged economic devastation. From Beejhy Barhany, owner of <a href="https://tsioncafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tsion</a> (a delicious Ethiopian-Mediterranean spot in Harlem) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9pjaXes1LQ&amp;fbclid=IwAR2n6XJdvcZyJ1gTbjTtf9q0MSUVjM0PFg-eFBJDvRmLssvimHm3ERGVFvA&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleading</a> for assistance to the GoFundMe for my dear lesbian dive bar, restaurant owners across the city and the country are desperate for sustained, long-term federal aid.</p><p id="viewer-90v6v">
Support from our former patrons is crucial. We need you to order take-out or delivery directly from the restaurants if you are privileged enough to do so. If you can afford this, you can also afford to tip that essential worker who delivers your food 35%. I guarantee they need it.</p><p id="viewer-cjvgg">
Call your representatives to continue Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) through the end of 2020. Pressure them to bail out the restaurant industry made up largely of small businesses the way they <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/19/business/small-businesses-ppp-loans-chain-restaurants/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bailed out massive chains like Shake Shack</a> in 2020 and big banks in 2009. Demand federal legislation that protects tipped employees who largely work for below minimum wage with no benefits. </p><p id="viewer-ci0vm">
Potential quarantine-fatigued or asymptomatic guests are not the solution to our survival but rather will unintentionally ensure the continued exploitation of the most vulnerable amongst us. Restaurants and bars are the quintessential small business. They exist to nourish their community both physically and socially, and when done well, the result is magic. I know, because I miss it too.</p><p id="viewer-dac6j">
Please don’t dine out right now. Your server is begging you. </p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p>Regardless of the merits of either side, the film v. digital debate, this post is an attempt to put into words the reasons I enjoy the use of film and go over the history and my experiences with the hobby!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A331383-R1-21-22.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/A331383-R1-21-22.jpg 600w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/A331383-R1-21-22.jpg 1000w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A331383-R1-21-22.jpg 1599w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>CineStill 50</figcaption></figure><p>(As an FYI, I am not an expert by any means in photography, nor did I go to school for this…. This is just my opinion based on my experiences with film)</p><h2 id="in-the-beginning-">In the Beginning:</h2><p>When I was a kid, film was in its final days or at the peak of its performance, depending on who you ask. My first camera was a disposable film camera, and it was my go-to anytime I wanted to take some pictures. There was a multitude of reasons for this, but it basically boiled down to price and ease of purchase. This was when buying things online made most people uncomfortable, and amazon was only selling books online, and AOL was still the go too for ISPs. (As a little side note I remember talking with my friends at the time and one of them learned about T1 lines and how they were a blazing 1.5+ Mb/s…. that was insane compared to the 56k I was used too, and I remember thinking to myself when I got older I would get a T1 to my house!) Interestingly, I also remember around the early 2000s, my father (the occasional early adopter) bought an HP camera that was just above 1mp and had a tiny screen on the back ( it looked like a point-and-shoot with a fixed lens) with a CF card slot. The CF card he bought was around 16MB, and I remember it took just over 32 photos, so it was “equivalent” to film. I did not get to use it much as it was expensive at the time, and he did not want me to break it. The novelty of having a camera you could take out, change the ISO for each picture (although I think it went from 100-400 and it really struggled at anything above 200) and then bring it home later, plug it into your Windows 98 (or ME if you upgraded) &nbsp;gateway machine and view the photos in color was immense! The downsides to digital were pretty obvious when you compared a 2mp camera vs. a 35mm SLR (which was about the same price) at that time. However, with email and sharing photos on the rise, digital was taking off. One of the interesting transitional technologies was when Walgreens and other development labs started offering CDs with your images on them, it was a little expensive, but if you wanted a digital copy it was potentially worth it (and getting digital copies of your negatives is much the same way today!).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A331383-R1-07-8.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/A331383-R1-07-8.jpg 600w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/A331383-R1-07-8.jpg 1000w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A331383-R1-07-8.jpg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>CineStill 50</figcaption></figure><p>My first digital camera was a point-and-shoot 5mp camera with an auto mode from Olympus with a fancy “mini” SD card slot that I could buy a 512MB card (I eventually bought a 1GB card), and it could take hundreds of jpegs. Naturally, I started taking pictures of absolutely everything and never really moved the settings off auto mode, and all of them were pretty terrible as I had absolutely no understanding. I eventually bought a dive case so I could take it SCUBA diving and took plenty of terrible photos. Eventually, I slightly flooded the case and found out cameras don’t really like saltwater. After that, I left cameras and photography alone for probably the better part of 6-8 years as I was busy with school and had a camera built into my phone I rarely used.</p><h2 id="re-interest-">Re-Interest:</h2><p>At the beginning of my 4<sup>th</sup> year in college, I became interested in cameras again primarily because I wanted to document some of the travels I was about to go on. Secondarily, because it supplied a release from the technical world of computer science (kind-of) and opened the world of art and creativity. This is where the “kind-of” part comes in; I researched the kind of camera to get and all of the different lens options on DSLRs and settled on a D5300 just after they were released and picked up a Tamron 28-270mm. Thinking that the 28-270mm was by far the best lens as it would cover everything from telephoto to wide-angle, it did... just sacrificing image quality along with everything else (to be honest, it was a reasonable travel lens).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A202720-R1-19-20-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/A202720-R1-19-20-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/A202720-R1-19-20-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/A202720-R1-19-20-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A202720-R1-19-20-1.jpg 1614w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>CineStill BWXX</figcaption></figure><p>Long story short (and probably another blog post) I started learning about the technical side of photography and the ISO/f-stop/shutter triangle. This caused me to start buying higher quality lenses, initially prime (fixed focal lengths like 35mm, 50mm, etc.), which brought the fun back into photography for me. It was at this point film was brought back into my life, this time as a tool for improvement.</p><p>I had picked up a few bad habits with digital photography… as mentioned earlier, it has the tendency to encourage multiple shots of the same thing and shots that aren’t thought out. Furthermore, digital allows so much leeway on exposure, and you can easily recover blown-out highlights, or severely underexposed areas can be brought back in to view. With the advent of photoshop and lightroom, digital photos are unbelievably easy to manipulate, and on many occasions, I have turned a terrible image into a very passable image (while some of these techniques started in the darkroom they took significantly more time and skill). All of these “features” are not inherent to digital photography, just exacerbated by the improvements and features of digital photography.</p><p>If you look at a standard roll of 135 film has about 36 exposures (if your good at loading!), and depending on your camera, you may have to manually wind the film after each shot. For me, this slowed down my trigger-happy finger, and I made sure I was getting a shot I wanted, not just a shot. (this is probably why photography schools love film as a teaching tool)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A013513-R1-20-21-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/A013513-R1-20-21-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/A013513-R1-20-21-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A013513-R1-20-21-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Kodak Tri-X 400</figcaption></figure><p>Another benefit is dependent on the camera, but I picked up a camera and lens combo that required mostly manual operation. I picked up an early 1980s Nikon FG with a 50mm f/1.8 series E lens. The Nikon FG does, however, have an aperture/program mode with a center-weighted light meter, which takes a ton of mental guesswork out of the equation and provides sane recommendations for shutter speeds. This combo requires you to control the f-stop and the shutter while the ISO/ASA is fixed (dependent on your choice of film) as Kodak’s Portra 400 has an ISO of 400… for all 36 exposures/images.</p><p>Working with these limitations provided a bit of a challenge to getting good images (I can hear everyone that forced to use film as it was the only option groan/laugh). This is especially difficult if your environment changes from inside to direct sun to late night; getting a proper exposure can be difficult without changing film speed (Now my favorite ISO for general photography is about 250 because it provides a lot of latitude). Another way to deal with this is ND filters, which allow you to reduce the amount of light coming through the lens so you can keep the f-stop where you want it (and, therefore, the depth of field). The benefit of fixed ISO is that it made me think critically about my exposure and the available light and my f-stop and shutter speed. If you get it wrong well, you don’t really know until a week later when you get it developed… so if you want that shot, you better make sure you are paying attention to detail. And when you get the negatives back, you get what you get (and don’t through a fit).</p><h2 id="today-">Today:</h2><p>Now today, I get mine scanned and sent to me as it allows me to view them easily and keep them in a digital format. Additionally, scans allow you to do some minor editing and dust removal, but I like the raw photographs as it allows the grain, textures, and colors of the film to show through. Part of the fun of film is waiting to see what you got and the interesting colors and tones that result from the different types of film stock.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A202720-R1-25-26-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/A202720-R1-25-26-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/A202720-R1-25-26-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A202720-R1-25-26-2.jpg 1512w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>This is why I love film! It requires me to work a little harder for that shot, and sure I miss some shots, but when I get a good image, it feels great. It has also really helped my digital photography…. Wait wHAT?!</p><p>While I love film, I’m not getting rid of my digital kit any time soon. I love my Sony A7RIII and the optically superior lenses (Okay, that’s a little cocky… they are good though, especially the GM series). While I would love to have a Leica film camera someday or even a medium/large format film camera, I want to remind you this is a hobby for me…. For the professional digital photography is the only game in town. The benefits are pretty tangible, it has caused me to slow down and make sure the shot I’m taking is worth it. Before picking up film I had about 1 image in 100+ that I thought was a keeper; after film I typically find at least 1 image in 30 that I like enough to post. It has improved my understanding of the ISO/f-stop/shutter triangle.</p><p>I’ve found some slick presets online that can get me that “film look” &nbsp;from <a href="https://reallyniceimages.com/">Really Nice Images</a> &nbsp;(they have some science behind matching it to real film stocks it as well as the creative touches) for my digital cameras (this is not an ad, it’s my opinion). Even Hollywood is doing it….many of the movies today use some form of film simulation (or real film as there is still some resolution benefits) to give you that “film look”. Its even baked in to the firmware of some cameras (check out <a href="https://fujifilm-x.com/global/stories/tales-of-the-x-t4-tale-3-eterna-bleach-bypass">Eterna from Fujifilm</a>).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A013281-R1-12-12A.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/A013281-R1-12-12A.jpg 600w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/A013281-R1-12-12A.jpg 1000w, https://blog.ohelabs.com/content/images/2020/07/A013281-R1-12-12A.jpg 1035w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Kodak Color 400</figcaption></figure><p>I do want to point out, maybe in another post, about how there are some serous technical differences in film and digital such as ETTR, push/pull processing, and the effects on contrast. Long exposures are a whole different world &nbsp;in film vs digital as reactivity to light changes with film over the exposure.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Not the end of the world, not the end of programming, but the end of the web development industry as we know it. Let me explain.</p>&nbsp;<h2>First glimpse of GPT-3</h2><p>Somebody posted this tweet during last week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PevpUBgwpbM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TWIW</a>. I just brushed it off because I thought it's a project of someone who's messing around with machine learning. It took me a while to realize that the technology underneath is built by <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a>. </p>&nbsp;<p>I realized that I was already describing GPT-3 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2WtILkz0fI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my talk</a>, but I thought that it's going to arrive at some distant point in the future.</p>&nbsp;<p>During the TWIW stream, we discussed a couple of things that GPT-3 can do (for now), but I still didn't take it that seriously... until I started reading a bit about it before going to bed. Did you read that correctly? </p>&nbsp;<p>Researching about an AI that's gonna absolutely change web development as we know it - <em>before</em> going to sleep. </p>&nbsp;<p>Worst. Idea. Ever. </p>&nbsp;<p>Of course, I didn't fall asleep easily because THIS MOTHERFUCKER CAN TRANSLATE PLAIN ENGLISH TO SQL.</p>&nbsp;<p>What?!  Why is everybody not losing their frickin' minds over this?!?! I might know why.</p>&nbsp;<h2>The spoiled web industry</h2><p>When the COVID situation escalated and everyone had to start working remotely, there was a tweet (that I couldn't find, obviously) from an engineer at Google who complained that now they would have to make coffee at home. I'm sorry, <em>what</em>? </p>&nbsp;<p>Are we talking about the same old coffee that everyone drinks? The coffee that literally takes a few minutes to make? Or do you have a special Unicorn-Tears-Infused-Double-Googleccino-With-The-G-Logo-Drawn-With-Foam coffee? Wait, who the fuck are you, Madonna? The lead singer of Queen? The goddamn Queen herself?! </p>&nbsp;<p>It's amazing that this industry full of rockstars and ninjas got so spoiled that we cannot even make coffee at home, so of course we got so comfortable in our positions, that we're not even scared of a goddamn AI. </p>&nbsp;<p>But, it is inevitable. The rockstar web developer dream is starting to crack a little bit, and it will be absolutely shattered one day, of course, with the help of no-code tools and AI.</p>&nbsp;<p>I hate when people say this, but... </p>&nbsp;<p>"I'm <em>soooo</em> here for it".</p>&nbsp;<h2>We're code plumbers</h2><p>Web developers get offended when someone takes a jab at their 2 favorite "languages": HTML and CSS. Noticed the quotes? I was trolling, but someone just stopped reading this article and started a tweet because they are offended by it and I'm <em>sooooo</em> here for it. </p>&nbsp;<p>I could give a fuck if you call them languages or not, the funny thing here is the entitlement and pride people take in their webdev work. The most hilarious thing in the world is people putting "senior craftsman of wonderful web experiences" or "web engineer and ninja architect of structural and delightful web adventures" </p>&nbsp;<p>HEY. You. Yeah, I'm talking to you, the person googling "splice vs slice" and "align-content vs justify-content" for the goddamn 3104813th time. AI is not gonna replace <em>your</em> job? </p>&nbsp;<p>YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO COMBINE 4 API CALLS TO MAKE A PERFORMANT LIST OF 15 RECTANGLES EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE SWITCHED 7 FRAMEWORKS IN YOUR CAREER SO FAR. </p>&nbsp;<p>If you browse the entire internet you will literally find only 7 animations in total. Everything else is static, janky, and mostly ugly. You know why? Because the web platform sucks.</p>&nbsp;<p>Our job is to glue together a bunch of random libraries that don't work together and slap them on top of a framework to achieve the same damn layout that we're building for the past 30 years. You're a code plumber, just like me, and just like everybody else that works on the web. Deal with it. </p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, but instead of Bootstrap columns, you're using CSS Grid and instead of FileZilla, you're using a CI. So it's <em>totally</em> different now. Congrats, that makes you a senior ninja superstar developer.</p>&nbsp;<p><em>sigh</em></p>&nbsp;<p><em>another sigh</em></p>&nbsp;<p><em>an audible sigh that made my dog close his eyes a little bit because he felt an incoming breeze</em> </p>&nbsp;<h2>History is repeating itself</h2><p>The problem is that most people don't want to let go of the way things <em>are</em> until it's too late. This is not a web developer problem, it's a human problem. </p>&nbsp;<p>I'll ride my horse forever so get the hell out of here with those machines on 4 wheels brought here by the devil.</p><p><img alt="a" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nU8UVOLK4oE/V5hCL4caEYI/AAAAAAAAKpE/7YLXw6924Yw6wX-m6EeyQCKb__bXsvwewCLcB/s1600/Tobacco%2BFactory%2BReaders%2B2.jpg"></p>&nbsp;<p>How about the factory lector who was super confident that he has a stable job and he was reading the newspaper every day until one sunny day the radio was invented and slapped that silly hat out of their head? </p>&nbsp;<p>Anything that could be automated <em>will</em> be automated (unless you know how to fix a printer, that job will exist forever)</p><p>There are tons of similar automation examples throughout history, so it's so <em>obvious</em> that most of the webdev things will be automated. That's why it's so mindblowing how many web devs are ignorant of that fact:</p>&nbsp;<p>AI will take my job? Naaaah, I'll probably keep getting paid an insane amount of money for increasing the amount of <code>9</code>s in <code>z-index</code> <em>forever</em>. AI can't touch this.</p><p>(Actually, when you think about it, it's a goddamn miracle that we convinced a frickin' AI to write CSS instead of burning the entire web platform and starting from scratch, so that's a win for humans)</p>&nbsp;<h2>Moving on and letting go</h2><p>Everyone is scared of the unfamiliar, so they're defending the way things <em>are</em> and they're praying they're going to <em>stay</em> that way. I mean who wouldn't want to continue making a shit ton of money by telling clients they are working on "internal fixes for optimizing performance" while tweaking their precious Vim setup most of the day? </p>&nbsp;<p>I'm noticing this pattern in the webdev world over and over again:   </p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>The first time I introduced Angular 1 to the company I worked for, everyone who mastered jQuery <em>hated</em> it and "didn't see" the benefits of a framework.  </li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>The Angular 1 developers (including me) didn't like JSX at a first glance.

But sometimes solutions to problems are painfully obvious. Most web devs are so scared to move on to <em>libraries</em> that can obviously solve their problems, let alone letting an AI do part of their work.</p>&nbsp;<p>You don't believe me? Here:</p>&nbsp;<p>Badly worded? Absolutely. I wish I could rewrite it differently. But no matter how I write it, most people won't even try to understand what I'm trying to say, and they'll start bashing it because I'm "offending" the technology that they're currently using. I was trying to say that <strong>if we would start webdev from scratch</strong> we would end up with solutions and techniques that are way more automated, and allow the user to do more by caring less.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I personally realized that technologies like Prisma, MobX, GraphQL, css-in-js, and JSX are automating most of the manual work I'd have to do while allowing me to care about real issues and solve real problems. </p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>I don't need to learn how to write "optimized and performant CSS" (whatever that means, according to that one author that's milking the shit out of the CSS book he wrote in 2002) because stuff like Tailwind and css-in-js is automating all of that. </li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>I'm don't need to learn how to manage and combine 1034813 different REST API calls, because GraphQL exists.

Pessimistically: 5 to 10 years, maybe sooner. Again, another reminder that I'm talking about <em>the future</em>.</p>&nbsp;<p>Currently, the entry bar for a junior developer is super low. Take this as you will, but what I'm saying is that the bar will be waaaaaay higher in the future. Now you can learn a bit of HTML &amp; CSS and next thing you know is you are sipping Starbucks on your way to your first internship at a big company, where you're gonna spend most of your time on tweeting CSS memes.</p>&nbsp;<p>Welp, there goes that dream. And the AI won't say shit like "please don't talk to me because I still haven't had my first coffee today".</p>&nbsp;<p>When all the basic things will be automated and some poor Alexa bot is gonna move things left and right by 1px, you can bet your ass that you will have to know machine learning and AI before even thinking about an internship. Managers and CEOS will be able to quickly execute on any idea without hiring a team of 15 people who need at least 3 weeks to agree on how to implement dark mode. </p>&nbsp;<h2>Launching a startup</h2><p>Not so long ago you'd have to pay $10K for a landing page because there were only 3 people in your town that knew WordPress. Now my grandma can launch a landing page with a drag and drop tool.</p>&nbsp;<p>Currently, you can watch an online course on Vue and in 3 months you can launch a "Tinder for Cats" startup that will make you millions. That's crazy. </p>&nbsp;<p>However, not everyone can program, and many people are scared by the entire process. The shift is already happening with no-code tools, and in the near feature "coding" will be even more accessible and the gate will be finally lifted. No more gatekeeping. Everyone would be able to "code", and everyone's ideas will easily come to life, which will automatically reduce the value of </p>&nbsp;<h2>Getting paid for <em>bullshit</em></h2><p>Let's be real. Most developers are spending most of their day on bullshit. I know it, you know it, we all know it. You're probably reading …</p></div></div></div></div>

<h4>The Justice Department has approved billionaire John Malone’s takeover of iHeartMedia. He now controls the music industry from the root to the fruit.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>By David Icke Turner</p>



<p>The Justice Department has green-lit a proposal by Liberty Media to increase its holdings in iHeartMedia. iHeartMedia is the owner of the nation’s largest collection of broadcast radio stations. This deal would expand a stranglehold on the radio market by a company that already owns and operates Sirius XM and Pandora. Liberty Media has controlling stakes in concert behemoths <a href="https://testset.io/2020/05/27/the-pros-and-cons-of-live-nation-going-bust/">Live Nation</a> and Ticketmaster. The decision has granted owner John Malone and Liberty Media a virtual 360 degree domination of the music industry via radio, streaming, concerts, festivals, and ticketing.</p>



<p>The expansion was authorized by federal antitrust prosecutors Wednesday. The deal allows Liberty Media to expand its shares of iHeartMedia by up to 50 percent. The company currently holds a 5 percent stake in iHeartMedia — the company that controls more than 850 AM and FM radio stations as well as&nbsp; the streaming service iHeartRadio. The company is currently the planet’s biggest commercial publisher of podcasts.</p>



<p>Liberty media is owned by billionaire John Malone who was famously referred to by Al Gore as ‘Darth Vader.’ Known for his expansionist and aggressive business tactics, Malone drew scrutiny in recent years for his support of Donald Trump’s presidency. Malone donated 250,000 dollars to the Trump inauguration.</p>



<p>Malone owns a controlling position at the U.S.’s biggest satellite radio service, SiriusXM. Last year Sirius purchased streaming platform Pandora. Liberty Media controls a 33 percent stake in Live Nation Entertainment which effectively gives it a seat at the head of the table. No other organization controls as much of what is the largest concert promotion firm in the world. This includes control of Ticketmaster, the largest ticketing platform on the planet. It is yet to be seen how this moves aids the solvency of an already ailing Live Nation. As said in the space previously, Live Nation has always maintained their position through ‘domination rather than innovation.’</p>



<p>Several consumer advocacy and anti-monopoly groups such as Artists Rights Alliance, the Open Markets Institute, Public Citizen and the Center for Digital Democracy, and others <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2020/04/16/jedi-war-continues-for-amazon-microsoft-786910">opposed the deal</a>.&nbsp; These groups warn the effects will be&nbsp; “likely catastrophic” on a radio industry already stifled by consolidation.</p>



<p>What is perhaps most dangerous, is the sudden ability for one man and one company to control ‘soup to nuts’ the trajectory of the music industry. This right-wing billionaire holds the strings to a series of companies that control touring, concerts, festivals, ticketing, radio, and podcasts. The potential for monopoly, exclusion, and even social engineering are suddenly tangible. Live Nation alone controls the landscape of touring and has expanded into artists management in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A ‘Justice’ Department spokesperson declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Hello, I am just starting to learn c# and i am about to start with a course on Udemy by Mosh Hamedani called "C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding".
       I can see that he is using .NET Framework but i have read that .NET Core is newer and is the future? I am really not sure where to start and would appreicate if anyone could help me. I would like to learn C# to have a better understanding with OOP and to learn a programming language to help with my Univeristy course. Thank you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all congratulations to the author for learning C# which is a great choice of programming language and for putting in the extra effort into better understanding the concepts of OOP (object oriented programming)! I genuinely hope that they'll have a great experience learning .NET and most importantly that they'll enjoy picking up some new skills and have fun along the way! I remember when I started to code (more than 20 years ago) and how much fun it was for me! It is also great to see how many people have replied with really helpful answers and provided some useful guidance to the original thread! It is a true testament to how supportive and welcoming the .NET community is! However, despite these positive observations I'm still a little bit gutted that such a question had to be even asked in the first place. I don't imply any fault on the author themselves - quite contrary - I actually really sympathise with them and can understand the sort of struggles which a new C# or F# developer may face. Questions like these really demonstrate how complex .NET has become over the years. It is a good time to take a step back and reflect!</p>
<h2 id="high-cognitive-entry-barrier">High cognitive entry barrier</h2>
<p>.NET has a high cognitive entry barrier. What I mean by this is that a new developer has to quickly familiarise themselves with rather boring and complex topics way too early in their educational journey. In particular questions around the differences between .NET, .NET Core, Mono, Xamarin, and the relation between C#, F#, VB.NET and what a target framework or a runtime is add very little to almost no benefit to one's initial learning experience. Most newcomers just want to read a tutorial, watch a video or attend a class and then be able to apply their newly learned skills in an easy and uncomplicated way. Ideally educational material such as purchased online courses or books from more than a few months ago should still be relevant today. Unfortunately neither of these are true for .NET. As a matter of fact it's almost given that any content which has been written more than a year ago is largely outdated today. Just think about the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/">upcoming release of .NET 5</a> and how it will invalidate most of the lessons taught just a few months ago. Another prominent example is the very short lived <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard">.NET Standard</a>. Once hugely evangelised and now de-facto dead. I personally think Microsoft, the .NET team and to some extent the wider .NET community has failed in making .NET a more beginner friendly language. I say this from a good place in my heart. Programming is an extremely powerful skill which can allow people to uplift themselves from all sorts of backgrounds and the harder we make it for beginners, the more exclusive we make the entry to our profession. I think the success of the next ten years will be defined by how accessible we make .NET to a whole new population of developers and I think there's some real work to be done in order to improve the current situation!</p>
<h2 id="what-about-others">What about others?</h2>
<p>Before you think that the current complexity is normal in programming and nothing endemic to .NET itself then I'm afraid to prove you wrong. <a href="https://www.php.net/">Take a look at PHP</a>. PHP has evolved a lot over the years and while it has introduced more complicated object oriented concepts and improved on its performance, it hasn't lost the beauty of its original simplicity at all. PHP is a great programming language to learn. Beginner content exist like sand on a beach. The online community, forums, Reddits and conferences are second to none. Most importantly, a student could pass on a several years old PHP book to another person and they would still get a lot of value from it. The language might have moved on, but many things which were taught on a beginner level are still 100% accurate today. This is a huge advantage which gets easily forgotten by more advanced developers like myself. Furthermore the distinction between language and the interpreter is not something which a new PHP developer has to understand. A new beginner doesn't have to wrap their head around such relatively unimportant topics to get started. They just know that they've installed PHP and it works.</p>
<p>Another great example (and there are many great examples) is <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. Go is not a new language at all. It's <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html">been around for more than 10 years</a> and despite huge improvements to the language, the compiler and the standard library it has remained faithful to its original simple design. Similar to PHP a new developer doesn't have to think about complicated nuances between "target frameworks", weird gotchas if they write Go in one IDE or another and they certainly don't have to look up a complicated version matrix to understand the intricate relations between an SDK, the runtime and newly available language features. There is just one version which maps to a well defined list of features, bug fixes and improvements in Go. It's documentation is simple and easy to comprehend. It is a very beginner friendly language.</p>
<h2 id="improving-net">Improving .NET</h2>
<p>Why is .NET so complicated? Well, the answer is perhaps not that easy itself. It's mostly history, legacy baggage, some bad decisions in the past and what I believe an overly eager desire (almost urgency) to change things for changes' sake. I will try to name a few selected issues from my personal observation, describe the problems which I have perceived and try to provide some constructive suggestions which I think could be a good improvement for the future.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to the <strong>6 Sins of .NET</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#language-spaghetti">Language Spaghetti</a></li>
<li><a href="#version-overflow">Version Overflow</a></li>
<li><a href="#net-everywhere">.NET Everywhere</a></li>
<li><a href="#all-eyez-on-me">All Eyez on Me</a></li>

<li><a href="#name-overload">Name Overload</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="language-spaghetti">Language Spaghetti</h3>
<p>If a person sets out to learn C# (like the author from the question above), what do they learn? Is it C# or .NET? The answer is both. C# doesn't exist without .NET and you cannot program .NET without C# (or F# or VB.NET for that matter). This is not a problem in itself, but certainly where some of the issues begin. A new beginner doesn't just learn C# but also has to learn the inner workings of .NET. Things get even more confusing when C# isn't the initial .NET language to learn. Supposedly the loose relationship between .NET languages shouldn't really matter because they compile into IL and become cross compatible. <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/vblang/issues/300">Except when they don't</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/csharp-unmanaged-constraint-leak.png"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/csharp-unmanaged-constraint-leak.png" alt="C# unmanaged constraint language leak"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/framework-libraries#base-class-libraries">BCL (Base Class Libraries)</a> provide the foundation for all three languages, yet they are only written in C#. That's not really an issue unless entire features were written with only one language in mind and are extremely cumbersome to use from another. For example, F# still doesn't have <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/581">native support for <code>Task</code> and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, converting between <code>System.Collection.*</code> classes and F# types is a painful undertaking and F# functions and .NET <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> objects don't map very well.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing though is when <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references">changes to one language</a> force <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/577">additional complexity on another</a>.</p>
<p>Interop issues between those three languages are a big burden on new developers, particularly when they start with something else but C#. However, as painful as this might be, interop problems are not the only complexity which a new beginner has to face. Try to explain to a new C# user in a meaningful way when they should use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/inheritance">inheritance with standard classes</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/">interfaces</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/abstract-and-sealed-classes-and-class-members">abstract classes</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/default-interface-methods-versions">interfaces with default method implementations</a>. The differences between those options have been so watered down that one cannot explain the distinctions in a single coherent answer anymore.</p>
<p>Take this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570814/when-to-use-abstract-classes">StackOverflow question</a> for an example. Nothing which has been described in the accepted (and most upvoted) answer below isn't also true for interfaces with default method implementations today:</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/abstract-class-question-stack-overflow.png"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/abstract-class-question-stack-overflow.png" alt="Abstract class question on StackOverflow"></a></p>
<p>Another great example is the growing variety of C# data types. When is it appropriate to create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/data/using-web-api-with-entity-framework/part-5">data class</a>, an <a href="https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/all-about-c-sharp-immutable-classes2/">immutable data class</a>, a <a href="http://mustoverride.com/tuples_structs/">mutable struct</a>, an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct">immutable struct</a>, a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.tuple?view=netcore-3.1">tuple class</a>, the new concept of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples">named tuples</a> or the upcoming <a href="https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/2020/05/csharp-9-record-types/">record type</a>?</p>
<p>Seasoned .NET developers are very opinionated about when to use each of these types and depending on who a new beginner will ask, or which StackOverflow thread they'll read, they will most likely get very different and often contradicting advice. Anyone who doesn't think that this is a massive problem must be in serious denial. Learning a programming language is hard enough on its own. Learning a programming language where two mentors (who you might look up to) give you contradicting advice is even harder.</p>
<p>The irony is that many of the newly added language and framework features are supposed to make .NET easier to learn:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1281856685657616384"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/tweet-dotnet-easier.png" alt="Make .NET easier"></a></p>
<p><em>(BTW, I have been a huge proponent of dropping the <code>.csproj</code> and <code>.sln</code> files for a very long time but previously Microsoft employees defended them as if someone offended their family, so it's nice to finally see some support for that idea too! :))</em></p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I agree with Scott that *this particular feature* will make writing a first hello world app a lot easier than before, however, our friend Joseph Woodward makes a good point that nothing comes for free:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joe_mighty/status/1281899362281566208"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/tweet-dotnet-reboot-3.png" alt="With great power comes great responsibility"></a></p>
<p>And he's not alone with this idea:</p>

<p>It's not just about learning how to write C#. A huge part of learning .NET is reading other people's code, which is also getting inherently more difficult as a result:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/1amjau/status/1281908190167347200"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/tweet-dotnet-hard-4.png" alt=".NET is hard"></a></p>
<p>Whilst I do like and support the idea of adding more features to C#, I cannot ignore the fact that it also takes its toll.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Rust and Go are two huge successes in the realm of modern programming language development. The two languages compete in terms of backend web development… and it’s a <em>fierce</em> competition. For example, the popular communication app Discord just started <a href="https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f">swapping out Go services for Rust</a> to boost performance.</p>



<p>Both languages are new, have growing communities, and are fast and efficient. When it comes to microservice architectures, frameworks, and apps, Rust and Go are household names.</p>



<h2><span id="Similarities">Similarities</span>
</h2>



<p>Rust and Go share many traits, especially when it comes to web engineering. They both have <strong>rich standard libraries</strong>, though Go tends to have more internet-focused protocols such as <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/">HTTP</a> supported of out the box. Both languages are <strong>open-source</strong>, meaning no company will be yanking the source code out from under us anytime soon. Go and Rust are both new which means they don’t come with the legacy and backward-compatibility baggage that you find with languages like Java and Javascript.</p>



<p>Having said that, there are a few key differences as well:</p>



<h2><span id="Performance">Performance</span>
</h2>



<p>Performance metrics generally put Rust squarely ahead of Go, but not by a lot. The Rust compiler and language design allow developers to easily take advantage of optimizations that achieve speeds comparable to the likes of C. On the other hand, Go trades a small amount of speed for simplicity and elegant syntax.</p>



<h2><span id="Memory_Management">Memory Management</span>
</h2>

<p>Both languages claim the title of “memory-safe” but take different approaches to achieve it. Rust catches memory errors at compile-time while Go uses a garbage collector at runtime.</p>



<p>Rust makes use of compile-time ownership strategy through <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/">zero-cost abstractions</a>. If a Rust program is not memory safe, it will fail to compile. To anyone who frequently deals with memory errors in C languages, this is recognized as an amazing feature. Instead of clever compiler optimizations, the Go compiler adds a small runtime to the completed executable that manages the allocation and release of memory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While both approaches have their pros and cons, generally speaking Rust’s compiler optimizations result in more performant programs. Alternatively, Go’s application code is cleaner because memory management is fully handled by the runtime.</p>



<h2><span id="Development_Speed">Development Speed</span>
</h2>



<p>There are times during the development of a web application that development speed is more important than app speed. Python is a great example, it is one of the slowest languages but has some of the cleanest syntax. While Go is generally faster and uses less memory than languages like Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, it makes a performance trade-off to allow for fast and simple development.</p>



<h2><span id="Concurrency">Concurrency</span>
</h2>



<p>Concurrency is a necessity in backend applications. Some languages run in single-threaded environments which means they use some clever tricks to simulate concurrency without achieving true parallelism. Both <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/11/concurrency-in-rust-can-it-stack-up-against-gos-goroutines/">Rust and Go have elegant solutions to build fully parallel</a> applications, but Go takes the cake again in terms of simplicity, with the go keyword being the only syntax necessary to spin up a new thread:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">go someFunc()</code></pre>



<h2><span id="The_Winner">The Winner</span>
</h2>



<p>As usual, there is no outright winner, the results are more nuanced than that.</p>



<p>Rust wins at:</p>



<ul>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Memory usage</li>
<li>Fine-tuning and control over final executable</li>
</ul>
<p>Go wins at:</p>



<ul>
<li>Simple syntax</li>
<li>Developer speed</li>
</ul>

As we traced through the distribution trail of Treck’s TCP/IP library, we discovered that over the past two decades this basic piece of networking software has been spreading around the world, through both direct and indirect use. As a dissemination vector, the complex supply chain provides the perfect channel, making it possible for the original vulnerability to infiltrate and camouflage itself almost endlessly.</span></p><p><span>We even discovered different branches in different geographic areas. Back in the 1990s, Treck collaborated with a Japanese company named Elmic Systems. They later split apart and went their separate ways. This resulted in two separate branches of the TCP/IP stack devices – one managed by Treck and one managed by Elmic Systems – marketed in totally separate areas, with no contact between them.</span></p><p><span>JSOF has been invited to speak about these vulnerabilities at <span><a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-20/briefings/schedule/index.html#hacking-the-supply-chain--vulnerabilities-haunt-tens-of-millions-of-critical-devices-19493">Black Hat USA, August 2020</a>.</span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span><b>More Information</b></span></h2><p><span>For a detailed description of the supply chain effect and impact of </span><b><i>Ripple20</i></b><span> and how JSOF tracked it down, see <span><a href="#ripple-supplychain">Supply chain</a></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;<span>and</span> <a href="#ripple-supplychain">Disclosure</a></span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>For a technical overview, including a full list of affected vendors take a look at the</span> <span><a href="#ripple-technical">Technical Overview section</a></span></span><span>.<br></span><span><span>Advisories by:</span> <span><span><a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-168-01">ICS CERT</a></span>, <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/257161"><span>CERT/CC</span></a>,&nbsp; <span><a href="https://jvn.jp/vu/JVNVU94736763/">JPCERT/CC</a>,</span></span></span><a href="https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/treck_critical_vulnerability"><u>CERT-IL</u></a><span><span><br></span><span>Advisories by: <span><a href="https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=1MRS494936A&amp;LanguageCode=en&amp;DocumentPartId=&amp;Action=Launch"><span>ABB</span></a>,</span></span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2020-006.txt">Aruba Networ</a></span></span><span><span><a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2020-006.txt">ks</a></span></span><span>, <span><span><a href="https://www.bbraunusa.com/content/dam/b-braun/us/website/customer_communications/Skyline%20Response_Outlook_6.9.2020_FINAL1.pdf">B.Braun</a>,</span> </span><span><a href="https://www.baxter.com/sites/g/files/ebysai746/files/2020-06/BulletinSpectrumDigiTreck%20%28003%29.pdf">Baxter</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.carestream.com/en/us/services-and-support/cybersecurity-and-privacy">CareStream</a>,</span> <span><span><a href="https://www.cat.com/en_US/support/technology/connected-solutions-principles/security/caterpillar-cybersecurity-advisory.html">Caterpillar</a>,</span></span> <span><span><a href="https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-treck-ip-stack-JyBQ5GyC">Cisco</a></span></span> <span><span>,</span></span><span><span><a href="https://www.digi.com/resources/security">Di</a></span><span><a href="https://www.digi.com/resources/security">gi</a></span><span><a href="https://www.digi.com/resources/security"> International</a>,</span></span> <span><span><a href="https://support.ghs.com/psirt/PSA-2020-05/">Green Hills</a>,</span></span> <span><span><a href="https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c06640149">HP</a></span></span><span><u>,</u>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://techhub.hpe.com/eginfolib/securityalerts/Ripple20/Ripple20.html">HPE</a></span>,</span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00295.html">Intel</a>,</span> <span><span><a href="https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2020-024">Miele</a></span>,</span> <span><a href="https://www.opto22.com/support/resources-tools/knowledgebase/kb88981"><span>Opto22</span></a></span>, <span><span><a href="https://idp.rockwellautomation.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx?RelayState=RPID%3Drockwellautomation.custhelp.com%26RelayState%3Danswers%2Fanswer_view%2Fa_id%2F1126896">Rockwell Automation</a></span>,</span>&nbsp;</span><span><span><a href="https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SESB-2020-168-01/">Schneider Electric</a>,</span> </span></span><span><span><a href="https://www.smiths-medical.com/company-information/news-and-events/news/2020/july/02/smiths-medical-cybersecurity-bulletin">Smiths Medical</a></span></span><span><span><span>,</span> </span><span><span><a href="https://advisory.teradici.com/security-advisories/56/">Teradici</a></span></span><span>, <span><a href="https://security.business.xerox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cert_Security_Mini_Bulletin_XRX20J_for_B2XX.pdf">Xerox</a></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>For Mitigations and Risk Evaluation, see <a href="#ripple-riskmitigation"><span>Risk &amp; Mitigation section</span></a></span><span>.</span></span></span></p><h2><span><b>Thank you</b></span></h2><p><span>This was a big project.

challenges faced every day while engineering large-scale, service-oriented
architectures. It has been addressing these challenges within Amazon for nearly
a decade, and we believe others will benefit as well.</p>

<h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h3>

<p>All JSON values are valid Ion values, and while any value can be encoded in JSON (e.g., a timestamp value can be converted to a string), such approaches require extra effort, obscure the actual type of the data, and tend to be error-prone.</p>

<p>In contrast, Ion’s rich type system enables unambiguous semantics for data (e.g., a timestamp value can be encoded using the timestamp type).  The following illustrates some of the features of the Ion type system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>timestamp:</strong>  arbitrary precision date / timestamps
    <div><div><pre><code>2003-12-01T
2010-03-22T18:00:00Z
2019-05-01T18:12:53.472-0800
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>int:</strong>  arbitrary size integers
    <div><div><pre><code>0
-1
12345678901234567890...
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>decimal:</strong>  arbitrary precision, base-10 encoded real numbers
    <div><div><pre><code>0.
-1.2
3.141592653589793238...
6.62607015d-34
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>float:</strong>  32-/64-bit IEEE-754 floating-point values
    
  </li>
  <li><strong>symbol:</strong>  provides efficient encoding for frequently occurring strings
    <div><div><pre><code>inches
dollars
'high-priority'    // symbols with special characters ('-' in this example)
                   // are enclosed in single-quotes
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>blob:</strong>  binary data
    
  </li>
  <li><strong>annotation:</strong>  metadata associated with a value
    <div><div><pre><code>dollars::100.0
height::inches::72
lotto_numbers::[7, 9, 19, 40, 42, 44]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/docs/spec.html">Specification</a> provides an overview of the full set of Ion types.</p>

<h3 id="binary-encoding">Binary Encoding</h3>

<p>Ion provides two encodings:  human-readable text (as shown above), and a space- and read-efficient binary encoding.  When binary-encoded, every Ion value is prefixed with the value’s type and length.  The following illustrates a few of the efficiences provided by Ion’s binary encoding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The following timestamp encoded as a JSON string requires 26 bytes:  “2017-07-26T16:30:04.076Z”.  This timestamp requires just 11 bytes when encoded in Ion binary:
    <div><div><pre><code>6a 80 0f e1 87 9a 90 9e 84 c3 4c
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>That first byte <code>6a</code> indicates the value is a timestamp (type <code>6</code>) represented by the subsequent 10 bytes (that’s what the <code>a</code> represents).  If this particular timestamp value is not of interest, a reader can jump over the value by skipping 10 bytes.  This ability to skip over a value enables faster navigation over Ion data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Binary encoding of a symbol replaces the text of a symbol with an integer that can be resolved to the original text via a symbol table.  This can result in substantial space savings for symbols that occur frequently!</p>
  </li>
  <li>While blob data is base-64 encoded in text (which produces 4 bytes for every 3 bytes of the original data), a blob encoded as Ion binary is simply encoded as is—no base-64 expansion required!</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar space efficiencies are found in other aspects of Ion’s binary encoding.</p>

<h3 id="give-ion-a-try">Give Ion a Try!</h3>

<p>
/* Ion supports comments. */
// Here is a struct, which is similar to a JSON object
{
  // Field names don't always have to be quoted
  name: "Fido",

  // This is an integer with a 'years' annotation
  age: years::4,

  // This is a timestamp with day precision
  birthday: 2012-03-01T,

  // Here is a list, which is like a JSON array
  toys: [
    // These are symbol values, which are like strings,
    // but get encoded as integers in binary
    ball,
    rope,
  ],

  // This is a decimal -- a base-10 floating point value
  weight: pounds::41.2,

  // Here is a blob -- binary data, which is
  // base64-encoded in Ion text encoding

"This bloodshed must end — this bloodshed will end," he said.</p>  <p>The program involves deploying federal law enforcement agents to assist local police in combating what the Justice Department has described as a "surge" of violent crime.</p>  <p>Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and New Mexico Gov.&nbsp;Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, welcomed the federal help, so long as it was to assist local law enforcement with community policing and public safety.

        <div>
          <p>Biff</p>
          <p>A web framework + self-hosted deployment solution for Clojure</p>
        </div>
        
<p>Biff is designed to make web development with Clojure fast and easy, especially
for early stage startups and hobby projects. Over time I'd like to make it
suitable for apps that need scale as well.
I use it in production for <a href="https://findka.com/" target="_blank">Findka</a>, my startup. I started writing Biff after 18 months
of experimenting with various web technologies like Firebase, Datomic and
several Clojure web frameworks/libraries. It includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Installation and deployment</strong> on DigitalOcean (or other VPS).</li>
<li><strong>Crux</strong> (an immutable document database with Datalog queries).</li>
<li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>. Specify what data the frontend needs declaratively, and
Biff will keep it up-to-date.</li>
<li><strong>Read/write authorization rules</strong>. No need to set up a bunch of endpoints
for CRUD operations. Queries and transactions can be submitted from the
frontend as long as they pass the rules you define.</li>
<li><strong>Database triggers</strong>. Run code when documents of certain types are created,
updated or deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>. Email link for now; password and SSO coming later.</li>
<li><strong>Websocket communication</strong>.</li>
<li>Serving <strong>static resources</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Multitenancy</strong>. Run multiple apps from the same process.</li>
<li>Less than <strong>2K lines of code</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also: instead of trying to do everything for everyone, Biff is designed to be
easy to take apart (without forking). This should help mitigate the main
drawback of frameworks, which is that it's often less work in the long run to
just stitch the libraries together yourself.</p>

<p>Biff is currently alpha quality. Join <code>#biff</code> on <a href="http://clojurians.net/" target="_blank">Clojurians Slack</a> for
discussion. Feel free to reach out for help, bug reports or anything else. Also
see the issues and source on the <a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff" target="_blank">Github
repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-firebase">Comparison to Firebase</h2>
<p>Basically, if you like Firebase and you like Clojure backend dev, you might
enjoy using Biff for your next side project. Same if you like the idea of
Firebase but in practice you have issues with it. If you want something mature
or you like having a Node/ClojureScript backend, Firebase is a great choice. <a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/mystery-cows" target="_blank">Here's a non-trivial
example</a> of using Firebase with ClojureScript.</p>

<p>Some shared features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Natural modeling of graph data</li>
<li>Basic query subscriptions (no joins)</li>
<li>Client-side transactions</li>
<li>Authorization rules</li>
<li>Triggers</li>
<li>Authentication built-in</li>
</ul>

<p>Some differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biff has a long-running JVM/Clojure backend instead of an ephemeral
Node/ClojureScript backend =&gt; better library ecosystem IMO and lower response
times/no cold start.</li>
<li>Firebase has way more features and is vastly more mature.</li>
<li>Biff is open-source + self-hosted =&gt; you have total control. If there's anything you don't like, you can fix it.</li>
<li><a href="https://opencrux.com/" target="_blank">Crux</a> (the database Biff uses) is immutable and has Datalog queries.</li>
<li>Authorization rules in Firebase are IMO error-prone and hard to debug.</li>
<li>Firebase supports password and SSO authentication.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fastest way to get started with Biff is by cloning the Github repo and running the
official example project (an implementation of Tic Tac Toe):</p>

<ol>
<li>Install dependencies: <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started" target="_blank">Clojure</a>,
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">NPM</a> and
(optionally) <a href="https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind#installation" target="_blank">Overmind</a>.</li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff</code></li>
<li><code>cd biff/example</code></li>
<li><code>./task setup</code></li>
<li><code>./task dev</code></li>
<li>Go to <code>localhost:9630</code> and start the <code>app</code> build.</li>
<li>Go to <code>localhost:8080</code></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you're on Windows/don't have Bash, you'll need to run the
commands inside <code>task</code> individually (translated to whatever shell you're
using). Also, you may need to install
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145" target="_blank">this package</a>
(see <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/2531" target="_blank">facebook/rocksdb#2531</a>).</p>

<p>You can tinker with this app and use it as a template for your own projects. See
<a href="#production">Production</a> when you want to deploy.</p>

<p>The example project uses tools.deps, Shadow CLJS, and Overmind.
<code>task</code> is the main entrypoint:</p>


<div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>set</span> <span>-e</span>

setup <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  which clj npm <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null <span># Assert dependencies</span>
  npm <span>install</span> <span># Or `npm init; npm install --save-dev shadow-cljs; npm install --save react react-dom`</span>
  clj <span>-Sresolve-tags</span>
<span>}</span>

repl <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>BIFF_ENV</span><span>=</span>dev clj <span>-m</span> biff.core
<span>}</span>

cljs <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  npx shadow-cljs server
<span>}</span>

dev <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span># Download dependencies first. This prevents clj and shadow-cljs from trying</span>
  <span># to clone new git dependencies at the same time which causes an error.</span>
  clojure <span>-Spath</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null
  <span>if </span>which overmind <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <span>;</span> <span>then
    </span>overmind start
  <span>else
    </span>cljs &amp;
    repl
  <span>fi</span>
<span>}</span>

...

<span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>repl: ./task repl
cljs: ./task cljs
</code></pre></div>
<p>So <code>./task dev</code> will run <code>./task repl</code> and <code>./task cljs</code> in the same terminal
window. Hit <code>ctrl-c</code> to exit. If you'd like to restart just one process and you
have Overmind installed, run e.g. <code>overmind restart repl</code> in another window.
You can easily add new build tasks by creating new functions in <code>task</code>. Also, I
recommend putting <code>alias t='./task'</code> in your <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

<p>To fetch the latest Biff version, start out with only <code>:git/url</code> and <code>:tag</code> in the dependency:</p>


<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>
 </span><span>:deps</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>github-jacobobryant/biff</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:git/url</span><span> </span><span>"https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff"</span><span>
   </span><span>:tag</span><span> </span><span>"HEAD"</span><span>}}}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then run <code>clj -Sresolve-tags</code>. The latest commit hash will be added to <code>deps.edn</code>.</p>

<p>When you run <code>clj -m biff.core</code>, Biff searches the classpath for plugins and then starts
them in a certain order. To define a plugin, you must set <code>^:biff</code> metadata on a namespace
and then set a <code>components</code> var to a list of plugin objects in that namespace:</p>


<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>ns</span><span> </span><span>^</span><span>:biff</span><span> </span><span>example.core</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>:biff/init</code> and <code>:biff/web-server</code> are plugins defined in the <code>biff.core</code>
namespace. The <code>:requires</code> and <code>:required-by</code> values are used to start plugins
in the right order. You can think of plugins kind of like Ring middleware. They
receive a system map and pass along a modified version of it.</p>

<p><code>biff.system/start-biff</code> starts a Biff app. That includes initializing:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Crux node</li>
<li>a Sente websocket listener and event router</li>
<li>some default event handlers that handle queries, transactions and subscriptions from the frontend</li>
<li>a Crux transaction listener, so clients can be notified of subscription updates</li>
<li>some Reitit HTTP routes for authentication</li>
<li>any static resources you've included with your app</li>
</ul>

<p>If you connect to nrepl port 7888, you can access the system with
<code>@biff.core/system</code>. Biff provides some helper functions for repl-driven
development:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>biff.core/stop</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>biff.core/start</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>biff.core/refresh</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>; stops, reloads namespaces from filesystem, starts.</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>App-specific configuration can go in your plugin, as shown above. For example, we set
<code>:example.biff.auth/on-signin</code> so that clients will be redirected to <code>/app/</code> after they
sign in successfully.</p>

<p>Environment-specific configuration and secrets can go in <code>config.edn</code>. They will be read in
by the <code>:biff/init</code> plugin.</p>


<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>:prod</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>; If you set jdbc credentials, remove this file from source control!</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/dbname</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/user</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/password</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/host</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/port</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span>
        </span><span>:example.biff/host</span><span> </span><span>"example.com"</span><span>
        </span><span>:example.mailgun/api-key</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>}</span><span>
 </span><span>:dev</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:inherit</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>:prod</span><span>]</span><span>
       </span><span>:biff/dev</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
       </span><span>:example.biff/host</span><span> </span><span>"localhost"</span><span>}}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>


<p>The system map is mostly flat, with namespaced keys. For example, Biff
configuration for the example app is stored under the <code>:example.biff</code> namespace.
You could run multiple Biff apps in the same process by using a different
namespace, e.g. <code>(biff.system/start-biff sys 'another-app)</code>. Keys under
the <code>:biff</code> namespace (e.g. <code>:biff/dev</code> from <code>config.edn</code> above) will become
defaults for all Biff apps.</p>

<p>Similarly, the return values from <code>biff.system/start-biff</code> will be namespaced. For example,
you can get the Crux node in our example app with <code>(:example.biff/node @biff.core/system)</code>.</p>

<p>When the <code>:biff/init</code> plugin reads in your <code>config.edn</code> file, it will merge the
nested maps according to the current environment and the value of <code>:inherit</code>.
The default environment is <code>:prod</code>. This can be overridden by setting the
<code>BIFF_ENV</code> environment variable:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>BIFF_ENV</span><span>=</span>dev clj <span>-m</span> biff.core
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here is a complete list of configuration options and their default values. See the following sections
for a deeper explanation.</p>

<p>Note: <code>:foo/*</code> is used to denote all keywords prefixed by <code>:foo/</code> or <code>:foo.</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>; === Config for the :biff/init plugin ===</span><span>

<p>Onboarding new people to the team is a challenge. Making sure they have a good experience and are set up for success can be quite a hurdle.</p>

<p>If you think about it for a second, being a new engineer on a team (any team), is such a challenge. There are so many things to need to learn, systems to read about, culture to fit into, intimidating right?</p>

<p>Over the years, I found a way to deal with this that works for me (and my teams). I thought it’s worth a post.</p>

<h2 id="first-30-days">First 30 days</h2>

<h3 id="no-pressure-30-days">No pressure 30 days</h3>

<p>The first onboarding conversation I have with a new employee, I specifically mention a no-pressure 30 days. There is a lot of pressure to “prove yourself” in the first few weeks, this can lead to rush in learning. There is no need for that.</p>

<p>When we hire, we hire for the long run, we don’t hire for 3-4 months, there’s no need to rush into it.</p>

<p>I find this approach useful. It takes the pressure off and allows the person to focus on learning, focus on the style of coding, focus on reading docs, etc.</p>

<h3 id="no-question-is-stupid-no-question-is-off-limits">No question is stupid, no question is off-limits</h3>

<p>We have an open culture. New people tend to ask a lot of WHY questions. “Why do we do X?”, “Why do we need Y?”.</p>

<p>Internally, in the team, I make sure people don’t feel attacked by these questions, there’s no personal attack, even if we’ve been doing something for a long time or this was your original design, there’s no harm in these questions (If they are asked in a respectful way).</p>

<p>We have an internal channel on Slack, in there you can feel safe to ask any question about any subject. We find that these questions are the ones where we learn the most about the way we do things and fix a lot</p>

<h4 id="offer-alternatives">Offer alternatives</h4>

<p>The person is encouraged to offer alternatives, if the alternative is actionable, they are also encouraged to work on it right away.</p>

<h3 id="low-hanging-fruit">low-hanging-fruit</h3>

<p>In our Jira we have a label called <code>low-hanging-fruit</code>. Those are tickets that are easy to pick up start to finish.</p>

<p>Those tickets only touch a single service or a simple integration between two services. The description is detailed enough to not raise a lot of questions.</p>

<p>We assign a few tickets in the first week, across multiple parts of our stack. This allows you as a new engineer to get familiar and comfortable with parts of the system without the risk of over-reaching.</p>

<h3 id="the-spreadsheet">The spreadsheet</h3>

<p>For your first 30 days, we have a self-tracking onboarding spreadsheet. This is something that was implemented by our HR and it is useful for the new engineer and other people on the team.</p>

<p>The spreadsheet is simple, it tracks goals, actions and responsible parties.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Goal: Familiarize yourself with the deployment pipeline</li>
<li>Action: CI overview</li>
<li>Responsible party: SRE manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sheet is divided into weeks (4 in total), the new engineer is responsible to tracking the goals and reaching out to the parties. Everyone is aware that this is the structure so you’re not surprised when they reach out to you.</p>

<h2 id="30-60-90">30/60/90</h2>

<h3 id="your-career-is-my-job">Your career is my job</h3>

<p>After the first 30 days, we plan 30/60/90.</p>

<p>The reason I chose to do it this way is that in the first 30 days, you find what is the person good at, what they <strong>want</strong> to work on, and so on.</p>

<p>We then plan the next 30,60, and 90 days. With clear goals, improvements, things to work on. We track it in every 1:1.</p>

<p>The sentence in the title here is something I repeat a lot. <strong>Your career is my job</strong>. My goal is to make sure you are always advancing, always developing, making sure you learn what you want to learn and work on your growth.</p>

<h2 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h2>

<p>For teams like mine, I find the method described above works well. Especially if the people next to the new engineer truly care and participate in the process.</p>

That diverges from the strategy of fellow video game publisher Take-Two Interactive and its subsidiary 2K Games, which are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311250/nba-2k21-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-versions-70-dollars-next-gen-price-increase-games">planning to charge an extra $10</a> for next-gen PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the upcoming <em>NBA 2K21</em>.</p><p>“We plan to come with the same price as the previous generation of consoles” were the company’s words, though in reference only to its fall slate of new releases. While this is Ubisoft’s first time saying aloud it will not raise prices for next-gen games released this holiday season, its Xbox preorder pages for games like <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla </em>and <em>Watch Dogs Legion </em>already indicated that prices would stay the same. </p><p>For instance, a <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fwatch-dogs-legion%2F10177068.html%3Frt%3DproductDetailsRedesign%26utm_expid%3D.h77-PyHtRYaskNpc14UbmA.1%26utm_referrer%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.gamestop.com%252Fsearch%252F%253Fq%253Dwatch%252Bdogs%252Blegion%2526lang%253Ddefault" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GameStop preorder for <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em></a><em> </em>for Xbox One, which comes with a free upgrade to the Xbox Series X version thanks to Microsoft’s Smart Delivery initiative, is just $59.99. Sony and its publishing partners have not yet released preorder pages for any PS5 launch games or cross-platform releases. </p><p>What’s not clear right now is whether Ubisoft plans to ever increase prices. It makes sense for the publisher to keep its prices static this fall, when many of its games are designed as cross-generation titles that will release on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. But in the future, after adoption of next-gen consoles becomes stronger, we may see publishers decide to raise prices for games that are designed or at the very least optimized for newer devices, as 2K Games intends to do. </p></article></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I often write design documents even if no one will read them.</p>



<p>There are a lot of resources out there on how to write good design documents. There are also many different ways to define what constitutes a design doc—what it includes, how long it is, how formal it is, etc.</p>



<p>For my purposes, a design doc is any document that you write before you begin the actual implementation. It can be long or short, formal or informal, etc. The point is it’s something you do independently of the implementation.</p>



<p>Most of the known benefits of writing design docs center around organizational alignment. Design docs can help you plan, help you get input from others on your team or in your company, serve as a record for the future. At larger companies, they’re also a great educational channel. While experienced engineers debate pros/cons of different approaches, many other can watch from the stands.</p>



<p>I’m a big fan of design documents on large teams and at large companies, but I still find them tremendously valuable even if no one else reads them.</p>



<p>A good design doc includes, at some level of detail:</p>



<ul><li>What you’re planning to do.</li><li>Why you’re doing it.</li><li>How you’re going to do it (including discussions of alternative implementations).</li></ul>



<p>Being forced to write those things down (even if it’s in a few sentences or paragraphs plus a diagram or two) sets a minimum bar that can help solve a lot of software development problems.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Thinking strategically instead of tactically.</strong> Tactical thinking focuses on the details and on immediate results. Strategic thinking focuses on higher-level concepts (what we’d call “architecture”) as well as on the future. Code lends itself to tactical thinking. Design docs force strategic thinking.</li><li><strong>Creative thinking.</strong> Complementary to strategic thinking, when writing out a plan, you’ll often realize that there are alternative solutions to the problem you’re trying to solve (or in some cases, that the problem you’re trying to solve isn’t worth solving). It’s hard to do this when you’re bogged down in implementation details.</li><li><strong>Avoiding complexity and obscurity.</strong> Being forced to articulate your plan in pain English can often expose complexity. Often, things that are complex tend to be hard to describe, and so, if you think your implementation is simple but are finding that writing out your high-level plan is hard, it’s a good indicator you’re wrong about how simple it is.</li></ol>



<p>It is, of course, entirely possible to sometimes begin with the implementation first, but in this case, you should treat the implementation as a discovery implementation or a prototype to collect some “on the ground details”. But once you have those details, <em>then</em> you write your design doc before beginning the real implementation.</p>

    <p>Have you ever wondered about the value of the options and shares that startups issue to employees? If you ask the startup
    CEO, she tells you they are winning lottery tickets. If you ask your grandmother, she tells you they are worthless. If you use
    this calculator, you will get a better answer.</p>
    <p>This calculator was developed by Will Gornall at UBC and Ilya
    Strebulaev at Stanford University using methodology similar to their paper 
    <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2955455" target="_blank">Squaring Venture Capital Valuations with

    <!-- What else should you consider -->
    <h2>Other considerations</h2>
    <p>This calculator values shares from the perspective of a diversified investor. The value of these shares to YOU may be
    substantially lower.</p>
    <h3>Can you tolerate risk?</h3>
    <!--QUESTION -->
    <p>Startup options are very risky, as illustrated by the dice roll example above. The more money you have and the more secure
    your job is, the better you are able to deal with that risk. Beyond that, some people are more worried about risk than
    others.</p>
    <p>
      <i>The less you are able to deal with risk, the less your shares are worth to you.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Are you impatient?</h3>
    <p>If you have high interest debt or need to buy a house, you may prioritize money today. That reduces the value of payoffs
    that will come years from now.</p>
    <p>
      <i>The more you need money today or in a few years, the less your shares are worth.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Will you quit?</h3>
    <p>If you leave a startup, you lose your unvested ownership. Vested ownership may also lose value as you may have to exercise
    options (creating tax and cash-flow issues) or be forced to sell them to the company.</p>
    <p>
      <i>The more likely you are to leave the company early, the less your shares are worth.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Will you need to sell?</h3>
    <p>Selling shares in startups can be hard. First, startups have a variety of contractual rights that make it hard for employees
    to sell their shares to outsiders. Second, buyers may know less about the startup than employees will be worried the company is
    a 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons">lemon</a> - if the company was great, why would you sell? Third,
    the platforms that facilitate share sales, such as EquityZen and SharesPost charge a sizeable commission.</p>
    <p>
      <i>If you need to sell ownership in startup, you may get less than the fair value.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>What is your tax situation?</h3>
    <!--QUESTION -->
    <p>Receiving, exercising, or selling stock options or shares can create complicated tax situations. You should consult with a
    tax advisor in order to avoid an unwanted tax surprise. Your tax bill may end up being between 15% to 50% of the proceeds.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Plan for taxes and talk to a tax advisor.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Are the model assumptions correct?</h3>
    <!--QUESTION -->
    <p>This model uses parameter assumptions that are appropriate for the average VC-backed company. These assumptions were
    designed to be appropriate for the typical such company. If your company has definite plans to go public in the next year, it
    is likely no longer typical (you may want to reduce the "Avg. time until exit" to 2 years in such a case). Similarly,
    if your company has just had a recap or significant down round, it is not typical. In either case, these special considerations
    prevent our off-the-shelf model from reflecting your company's reality unless you customize the parameter assumptions.</p>
    <p>
      <i>If your company is atypical, the values produced may be incorrect.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Is the preloaded financial data correct?</h3>
    <!--QUESTION -->
    <p>To help startup employees who do not have access to financial data, the calculator allows the easy loading of startup
    financial data gathered from legal filings. Checking these data for accuracy for all startups is extremely labor intensive. In
    addition, some companies enter into very complicated contracts with its investors that require more intricate modeling. Because
    of this some startup financial information may be incorrect.</p>
    <p>
      <i>The financial data we have preloaded is a work in progress and may contain errors.</i>

    <p>
    <b>Step 1</b> The program guesses the value of the company. Based on that value, it projects out many potential exits.</p>
    <p><img width="100%" id="Picture 2" src="https://valuation.vc/img/explanationchart1.png" alt="explanationchart1"></p><p>

    <p><img width="100%" id="Picture 2" src="https://valuation.vc/img/explanationchart2.png" alt="explanationchart1"></p><p>
    <b>Step 3</b> Based on these exits, the program values each security.</p>
    <p>
    <b>Step 4</b> The program sets the value of the company so that the most recent VC round is fairly priced. That company value
    is then divided between options, common shares, and preferred shares.</p>

    </h3>
    <!--QUESTION -->
    <p>We develop a valuation model for venture capital--backed companies and apply it to 135 US unicorns, that is, private
    companies with reported valuations above $1 billion. We value unicorns using financial terms from legal filings and find that
    reported unicorn post--money valuations average 48% above fair value, with 14 being more than 100% above. Reported valuations
    assume that all shares are as valuable as the most recently issued preferred shares. We calculate values for each share class,
    which yields lower valuations because most unicorns gave recent investors major protections such as initial public offering
    (IPO) return guarantees (15%), vetoes over down-IPOs (24%), or seniority to all other investors (30%). Common shares lack all
    such protections and are 56% overvalued. After adjusting for these valuation-inflating terms, almost one-half (65 out of 135)
    of unicorns lose their unicorn status.</p>

    </h3>
    <!--QUESTION -->
    <p>We survey 885 institutional venture capitalists (VCs) at 681 firms to learn how they make decisions across eight areas: deal
    sourcing; investment decisions; valuation; deal structure; post-investment value-added; exits; internal organization of firms;
    and relationships with limited partners. In selecting investments, VCs see the management team as more important than business
    related characteristics such as product or technology. They also attribute more of the likelihood of ultimate investment
    success or failure to the team than to the business. While deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment value-added all
    contribute to value creation, the VCs rate deal selection as the most important of the three. We also explore (and find)
    differences in practices across industry, stage, geography and past success. We compare our results to those for CFOs (Graham
    and Harvey 2001) and private equity investors (Gompers, Kaplan and Mukharlyamov forthcoming).</p>

    </h3>
    <p>We study gender and race in high-impact entrepreneurship using a tightly controlled randomized field experiment. We sent out 80,000 pitch emails introducing promising but fictitious start-ups to 28,000 venture capitalists and angels. Each email was sent by a fictitious entrepreneur with a randomly selected gender (male or female) and race (Asian or White). Female entrepreneurs received a 9% higher rate of interested replies than male entrepreneurs pitching identical projects and Asian entrepreneurs received a 6% higher rate than their White counterparts. Our results suggest that investors do not discriminate against female or Asian entrepreneurs when evaluating unsolicited pitch emails. </p>

			<p>Offsites are a big part of remote teams. They allow everyone to socialize, connect more deeply with coworkers, and help build shared experiences and empathy. Even if video calls are a great tool to share information, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/coronavirus-zoom-fatigue-is-taxing-the-brain-here-is-why-that-happens/">they can be tiring</a>. It's too easy to miss non-verbal cues. Chance encounters over coffee never happen, and we don’t always experience the same personal connections that come from small-talk. That’s the downside of remote work, and that's why meeting a few times a year is a great way to fill the gap!</p><p>Planning an offsite can be challenging, but it also provides the opportunity for your team to explore an exciting place. With many teams looking for ways to mimic the traditional offsite in a limited-travel world, here are a few tips we learned after holding our first <strong>virtual offsite</strong>.</p><h2 id="context">Context</h2><p>The Bearer team is remote-first. Other than a few Bears that live in the same region, most of us only see one another digitally. This is why we put an emphasis on consistent offsite events. Shortly before COVID-19, we held one in France. Before that, the team met up in Portugal. The number of offsite photos used as Zoom backgrounds tells me that the team really enjoys them!</p><p>Because of the COVID-19 crisis, we couldn’t organize the offsite we were planning for Q2. Travel was more difficult, but beyond that, we wouldn’t have taken the risk of putting our coworker’s health in jeopardy. Our first thought was to cancel it, but we decided to experiment with a full-virtual offsite. A remote, remote offsite that we dubbed <strong>Together Week</strong>.</p><h2 id="start-with-a-mix-of-work-and-play">Start with a mix of work and play</h2><p>We came up with a lot of ideas to make this week enjoyable and took inspiration from <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/blog/virtual-team-building-activities/">Hotjar’s article on virtual team building</a>. We also had a nice chat with Bele Schütt from <a href="https://www.candis.io/">Candis</a> who organized a remote offsite day a few weeks before ours.</p><p>The first question that came to mind was: if we miss the human interaction component, what should we focus on? This would be a time to take a step back from our daily work, mix up the normal team dynamics, and work on “something different.” The offsite should allow everyone to take time to experiment, far from the usual roadmap.</p><h3 id="set-a-theme-a-task-and-a-goal">Set a theme, a task, and a goal</h3><p>We put together teams made up of members from each department and set them a task to complete by the end of the week. Our project theme became: <em>How can we attract more top-notch developers to test and adopt Bearer</em>. Aside from the hard-limit on planning and presenting, no constraints or restrictions were set on what or how a team could approach the theme.</p><p>Our teams shared the work, discussed, debated, and built solutions throughout the week. All the teams did a great job. We aren’t just saying that. On Friday, each team had the opportunity to present what they spent the week building. Not only were the presentations amazing, but all the ideas have found their way onto future roadmaps at Bearer. It was great to see how impressed everyone was by each other's work!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/07/presentation.png" alt="Screenshot of a Bearer presentation" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/presentation.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/presentation.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/presentation.png 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/07/presentation.png 1886w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>While we initially planned to offer a prize to the winning team, the quality of work made it impossible to choose.</p><p>Instead of selecting a single winner, we decided that everybody won. Everyone at Bearer will receive a beautiful pair of hand-made slippers as a souvenir. The perfect treat for working from home! </p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/07/slippers.png" alt="Wool slippers" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/slippers.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/slippers.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/07/slippers.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="incorporate-social-activities-and-outside-voices">Incorporate social activities and outside voices</h3><p>Make the week special. On top of a hackathon or special-projects sprint, incorporate time for both structured and unstructured socializing. Find ways for to increase team bonding without making it feel like a chore. Here are a few things that worked well for us.</p><p><strong>Guest Speakers</strong></p><p>To bring in some fresh ideas, we invited external speakers to share their experiences. A huge thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/SylvainKalache">Sylvain Kalache</a> from <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/">Holberton School</a>, Maxime Locqueville from<a href="https://www.algolia.com/"> Algolia</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rdutel">Rodolphe Dutel</a> from <a href="https://remotive.io/">Remotive</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dzello">Josh Dzielak</a> from <a href="https://orbit.love/">Orbit</a>. Each came, virtually, to speak with the team. We learned about great remote routines, tips for working in multicultural teams, and advice on building a nice developer experience and community. </p><p>Make sure to record each session for those that cannot attend live. Spreading these throughout the week is a great way to inspire and keep the team motivated!</p><p><strong>Team meals and coffee breaks</strong></p><p>To help with the missing social aspect of offsites, ask everyone to take virtual coffee breaks during the week. More specifically, we encouraged our team to meet with someone they don't work with often. Some team members made small talk and used the time to catch up. Others got into discussions about quarantine life, and some used the questionnaire answers and guest speaker talks as conversation starters.</p><p>The team also scheduled a few “happy hour” style events across different time zones. We tried to align them so those starting the day could share coffee and breakfast, while those ending the day could share drinks and dinner.</p><p><strong>Virtual Escape Game</strong></p><p>Early on, we decided against many of the “game” style team building activities for fear that they would be stressful for some, and difficult with Zoom. One that we did try was a virtual escape game. The team split into groups of roughly 6-8 people, and an outside facilitator set every person a task. We all had information to share and the goal was to crack our individual codes, then combine our information to save the world! For some of us, the puzzle was quite challenging, and the discussions carried over into the after-work happy hour!</p><h2 id="make-it-work-from-anywhere">Make it work from anywhere</h2><p>Make sure everyone can take part, no matter their location and time zone. This should be obvious for a remote team, but offsites are so often thought of as a way to break the rules, that it can be easy to forget. With team members in Bangkok, South Africa, the United States, and spread across Europe, the challenge for our team was high! This meant enforcing asynchronous communication and documenting everything.</p><p><strong>Set up shared workspaces if you haven’t already</strong>. We use Notion, Miro, and Slack heavily within the teams. Each team set up dedicated channels and documents for the week’s tasks. We also put together a company-wide channel in slack dedicated to the offsite. This keeps the normal work channels clear, but also acts as a nice archive of the events.</p><p><strong>Be as asynchronous as possible, within reason</strong>. Sometimes it really helps to get together. We let each team manage their own meeting times. Teams were assembled so there was at least an hour or two of overlap to allow for daily check-ins as needed.</p><p><strong>Record any “live” chats and alternate the scheduling</strong>. Earlier we talked about inviting speakers. When scheduling these, try to mix up the times to allow everyone to attend some of them live. For those that cannot make them all, record the sessions for later viewing.</p><h2 id="make-support-available-throughout-the-process">Make support available throughout the process</h2><p>For our hackathon-style task, we paired up teams to provide feedback and support. Team A was in charge of feedback for Team B, Team B for Team C, and so on. This gave teams fresh eyes and a sounding board for their ideas. An approach such as this encourages teams to interact more and keeps the feedback loops efficient. </p><p>We also had a handful of people within the company working outside of the hackathon structure. In particular, our founders Guillaume and Cedric. They made themselves available to the teams throughout the week, and offered support and ideas from a higher-view perspective. Some teams took advantage of their insight more than others, but all found the direct input throughout the process useful. Designate managers or others to ensure you have coverage and can support the teams in any way they need.</p><h2 id="use-this-time-to-improve-team-resources">Use this time to improve team resources</h2><p>Improving team dynamics and social experiences within remote teams is one of the largest benefits of a traditional offsite. That doesn’t mean the same ideas can’t help inform your day-to-day processes. For example, we decided to create a page in Notion where people can share more about themselves. To make it easier, we used a mix of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Proust_Questionnaire">Proust questionnaires</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/user-manual-to-me-92c8ce68f960">user manuals,</a> and work-related questions. The team has been very creative in the format. As the last hire in the team, I enjoyed reading each of the descriptions and found some common talking points to discuss with the team soon. I’m sure the new hires will enjoy it as much I have!</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wdXDLJ_4eNItK5NmLCwBZkVyd89aQLUSk-tl5kTozc_q2N4JHQ_kxn8i_hW_Sz7ZVoNCw4OtB_ZyekMfY8GzVDkA0qNOZdUvER24QpzVIDKjwQ37Jf_tV2XEnOA0e93SPLL8vQg" alt="Team questionnaire responses"></figure><p>One way to further make everyone feel connected around the event is to send out a care package. This can be a kind of onboarding box that arrives before the week begins. In this box, each person will receive what they need for the week. Things like: a notebook, an interesting book to read, some snacks, and maybe even some instructions for a treasure hunt. </p><p>While time constraints and logistics prevented us from doing it this time, we feel like it’s a great way to reward the team, and set a tone for the week. Not to mention it is a great excuse to print some new company-branded gear! You don’t even want to know the number of Bear-related puns we came up with during the offsite. Some were <em>unbearably </em>bad.</p><h2 id="look-for-ways-to-improve-future-offsites">Look for ways to improve future offsites</h2><p>No amount of planning will make for the perfect event, so make sure to solicit feedback from your team. What worked for them? What did they enjoy the most? What would they change? Overall, we received very positive feedback from the team, which was our main goal. We wanted people to have a good time and to work differently. </p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7txsa7dDOBRm8HHO4GwHvqU4R8uL5HtYO3j20OExdp1dj1HRnYKfbwX4ezRFhNQIY1AjX0wWNVOSUltxsJyT4r72I63FVFud_I7U0iCChLyk6HAISVR17RosR39jGMS-UZQu3Nk" alt="Feedback quotes from the team"></figure><p>We also received some valuable constructive feedback. One item that stood out was making sure the games were accessible to non-native English speakers. Solving anagrams is hard enough when they are in your native language!</p><h2 id="core-things-to-keep-in-mind">Core things to keep in mind</h2><p>We learned a great deal from our first virtual offsite. While it can’t completely replace the enjoyment of all getting together in an exciting location a few times a year, it gets about as close as you can.</p><p>If you’re planning to organize a virtual offsite week, here are some tips to get you started:</p><ul><li>Break into small groups to make sure the work part is enjoyable.</li><li>Virtual escape games are a really great option!</li><li>Invite people …</li></ul></section></div>

					<p><span>I gave a talk on the topic of civilizational collapse on Friday May 1, hosted by the <a href="http://twitter.com/1517fund">1517 Fund</a> and moderated by <a href="https://twitter.com/zslayback">Zak Slayback</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.1517.org/"><span>1517 Fund</span></a><span> is a very early stage investment fund that prioritizes working with dropouts and those working outside of tracked institutions. The fund was founded in 2015 by <a href="https://twitter.com/DStrachman">Danielle Strachman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/William_Blake">Michael Gibson</a>, both former cofounders of the Thiel Fellowship. They also host two </span><a href="https://www.1517fund.com/podcasts"><span>podcasts</span></a><span>, interviewing thinkers and founders who are disrupting the status quo.</span></p>
<p><span>My talk was followed by a Q&amp;A period with the audience. We discussed how to evaluate the health of a civilization’s core institutions, what a slow collapse looks like from the inside, and how civilizational decline and collapse come about. The following transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read the discussion below, and watch it </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEmFVz4nuxg&amp;feature=youtu.be"><span>here</span></a><span>!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Zak Slayback&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Thank you everyone for your interest in joining us this evening. Thank you for our speaker, Samo Burja, who I will introduce in just a moment. For those of you for whom this is your first time joining us, it’s a pleasure to meet you. For those of you who aren’t familiar with us, 1517 Fund is an early stage venture capital fund that supports companies led by young founders, with a priority on supporting founders working outside of track institutions. We would like to work with dropouts, stop outs, people who are working on deep technology, in addition to the dropout and stop out categories of founders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is the second of our 1517 at-home conversations. We’re pleased this evening to be joined by Samo Burja. Samo is the founder of Bismarck analysis, a consulting firm that investigates the political and institutional landscape of society. He’s a research fellow at the Long Now Foundation where he studies how institutions can endure for centuries and millennia. And he’s also a senior research fellow in political science at the Foresight Institute.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Samo advises how these things can shape the future of technology. He writes and speaks on history, institutions, and strategy, with a focus on exceptional leaders that create new social and political forms. He has systematized this approach as </span><a href="http://samoburja.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Great-Founder-Theory-v-1.43.pdf"><span>Great Founder Theory</span></a><span>. This evening, he’ll be speaking to us on the question: why do civilizations collapse?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We have quite a few people in the conversation this evening, so I’m going to ask you that, any questions you may have for the speaker, please drop them in the chat box. And I will then try to moderate those towards the end of our conversation, the Q&amp;A portion of our conversation. With that all being said, please join me in welcoming Samo Burja for speaking with us on why civilizations collapse.</span></p>
<p><b>Samo Burja</b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for that introduction, Zack. And thank you to the 1517 fund for organizing this talk and this conversation that, hopefully, will develop in a very interesting direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why do civilizations collapse? Well, that’s something that’s on the mind of many people right now, as they look at a closed down economy in a world where people don’t leave their home very much. Yet the physical infrastructure of the internet persists. The idea naturally occurs that perhaps this is a systemic crisis of some kind, that we will have a multiplication of problems building up on each other. I don’t think there is evidence this is that kind of crisis. Civilizational collapse does tend to have some of these features. It is the multiplication of problems, each on their own being something that could be overcome by live players and adaptive institutions. But it proved fatal to dead players and ossified institutions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our society is certainly one that’s dominated by large bureaucratic entities. Large bureaucratic entities break down the tasks needed for delivery of physical goods, or for processing information via a knowledge worker on the stock market, or a factory worker putting on the doors of a car. These tasks are shorn of their meaning and full context and put in a systematized environment where the constraints that the worker has to solve are really narrow: make numbers go up, or put the car door in. It’s not that different.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the holistic perspective on such systems does require design. This is a space where there’s a lot of disagreement as to whether these emergent systems just pop up, or whether they are designed in the first place. I think that, without a doubt, the large bureaucratic structures that dominate our society are designed, because often you can read the original intent of the people who set them up. It’s not that difficult to look through the documents of Hoover setting up the FBI, and making up your mind why the FBI exists. It’s not that difficult to figure out what the IRS is. It’s also not that difficult to figure out why Amazon exists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is harder to figure out the whole assembly. It’s not that society is a single institution. So no matter how large or small some of these institutions are, they always coexist in a symbiotic relationship with others. There is no Amazon without the United States government, and there’s no US government without at least some corners of the US economy. And each of these institutions depends on each other, in a quite intricate mesh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Different people put the foundation of society in different places. It’s a nontrivial and difficult theoretical question. You might choose to be grounded in organized religion. This already presupposes a particular form of human nature, a nature where there’s an orientation towards the divine that expresses and drives all our actions. It’s the source of normativity. It’s the reason why people come together in the first place. In the religious perspective, people come together to worship God. In the nonreligious perspective, people worship God to come together. This is the subtle but important distinction of a view of religion that say, someone might have if they originate with a fallen angel hypothesis rather than the rising ape hypothesis of what human beings are in the first place. So all of these investigations aren’t just objective questions. A Catholic theologian might actually have a significant amount of agreement with a French secular philosopher when describing the workings of a particular institution. But they might have a very different perspective as to what’s the driving force behind institutions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then you might have views that emphasize protocols of exchange, might focus on currency, or might focus on law, rather than any individual institution. Rather than the bones or the muscles of society, it would be the connective tissue of society that defines the space of parameters. You might view companies as secondary effects, primarily formed by the market. Or on the other hand, you might view companies as the primary object and markets as secondary things, with companies creating their own market, and sometimes even creating their own regulatory environment. If you extended this all the way to government, you would end up with a view where the companies themselves are shaping their own regulatory environment and government is primarily a consequence of the large economic structures of society.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These very different schools of thought sound familiar because we invoke them every day in normal conversations. Whenever we make an ethical, moral, scientific, social, political, religious statement, we’re invoking one or another theory of human existence. Even if we’re not making it explicit, we’re operating on one or another theory of what human nature is. Is it an unbounded potentiality, with a drive for exploration. A kind of Nietzschean self-actualization? Is it the sort of striving for God mentioned earlier? Is it the misfiring of evolutionary processes best adapted to our life on the African Savanna plains?</span></p>
<p><span>These thoughts float around. The full conception of what a civilization is, is that it is very diverse. The key focus seems to be on something like that: scale and complexity. Hence the popularity of the book </span><i><span>The Collapse of Complex Societies </span></i><span>by Joseph Tainter, or Jared Diamond’s much later book, also titled </span><i><span>Collapse</span></i><span>. You also have interesting books on the late Bronze Age or the fall of the Roman Empire. These seem appealing, and are usually explored by people who have one or another answer in mind as to what brings on collapse. They might believe that it is primarily environmental fragility, or moral decline, or that primarily it is the overloading of complexity in the system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I think that it’s important to acknowledge that you can’t undertake the investigation of history without picking and choosing facts. Yes, I am presupposing the relevance of history here. For obvious reasons, I don’t think we can really say anything much about it at all, without comparing the present to other societies and civilizations. There are too many variables to control. The best we can hope for is cross-comparison with the natural record of history, the natural set of experiments that occurred already. Much as in geology, we don’t build another planet to figure out plate tectonics, but rather dig for whatever rocks might be found here or there. So we must, in this macrosocial study, rely less on simple, objective ideology-driven theories and more on in-depth exploration of different examples.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do think that exploration is still itself theory-driven. If you’re a good historian, or a good theoretician, or a good social thinker, you explicitly acknowledge the thesis that you’re working on. My thesis is, as Zack mentioned at the very start, Great Founder Theory. I propose that social technologies are not something that’s cooked up by all of us, but by a tiny subset of us. Most of us pick and choose from an admittedly large variety of existing worldviews, ways of being, social groups, economic entities, and political entities. But these are in themselves too complex to really originate as the product of collective action.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, it might seem to you that the best way to design complex things is …</span></p></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[The Merge Request Checklist]]>

July 22, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2017/10/06/the-merge-request-checklist | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2017/10/06/the-merge-request-checklist">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  In order to avoid multiple discussion rounds for a merge request to pass, we've come up with a checklist with best practices in our team:
</p>
<h6>Review your own merge request</h6>
<p>This is really important as it helps catch some obvious missing items. Moreover, it is helpful to add comments to help the reviewer out (especially regarding business knowledge, e.g.
  <i>"client has signed off on this feature"</i>,
  <i>"ceding performance in favour of legibility and maintenance here"</i>).</p>
<p>For maximum impact, try and take a break in between finishing the changes and then doing the review.</p>
<h6>Analyse API and documentation if any</h6>
<p>
  For any changes, check if any documentation needs to be updated, for example,
  <i>"as of version x.x.x, the data model now looks like the following"</i>,
  <i>"updating to node 8 means that we can now use async/await"</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Our project also consists of services that provide REST endpoints and it is always good to analyse changes to the API - as the application grows, it is easy to add endpoints, difficult to change them and almost impossible to remove them.
</p>
<h6>Testing and test implementation</h6>
<p>
  We try to follow TDD so it is important that the tests we write cover all potential use cases. Moreover, we have unit tests, integration tests and end-2-end UI tests. Depending on the feature, some tests need to be prioritized above others. For example, if a feature implement some sort of a deep copy method, the priority would be on integration testing to ensure that an object along with all it's children is copied and saved in the database along with all the rules that need to be satisfied (the name of the copies has been appropriately set, etc.). Having a few unit tests which test services that return generated names for copies and a UI test which tests that the feature works is enough for the other tests.
</p>
<h6>Think about negative tests</h6>
<p>
  A couple of us were lucky enough to attend a really interesting talk on testing where the premise was that as developers we need to take a general requirements and narrow them down to solutions whereas as testers we need to take solutions and expand them into requirements. For example, if we were to test a physical calculator, it is possible that we try to press really hard on the buttons, or test that the numbers are visible under direct sunlight or test that the calculator works every day of the week, etc.
</p>
<p>
  We refer to this paradigm as negative testing and try to incorporate as much of it as possible when writing tests. As an example, if a method returns a list of items, the obvious test would be to return a few items and ensure that they are there given the correct conditions. However, it would also be very instructive to test that there are
  <i>no</i> items returned given other conditions. Such thinking also helps in simplifying our API in general.
</p>
<p>
  This is quite similar to the above point but it bears mentioning as a separate item as one really needs to put on their testing hat to get a broad picture of all the things that could potentially break the application with the changes proposed.
</p>
<h6>Clarify when you start reviewing a MR and when you are finished</h6>
<p>
  Sometimes, it is possible that more than one person ends up reviewing the code. For smoother communication, we propose that whenever someone starts a review they add a comment and another comment to indicate that they are finished. We generally do not assign reviews to anyone in particular as it encourages everyone to take a look at changes. Everyone's code is welcome to critique by anyone on the team and even the organization in general.
</p>

<h6>If a comment was made regarding a concept, check all places where this change might apply as well</h6>
<p>
  Depending on the reviewer, it is possible that a comment made on a particular concept applies to different parts of the code and not just and one specific instance. For example, if the review comment was to check equality in JavaScript using
  <code>===</code> rather than
  <code>==</code>, then it is possible that this error has occured in other places as well.
</p>
<h6>Conclusion</h6>
<p>
  For those with limited time, the bare minimum that one can do is review their own merge request to check for any glaring mistakes. Testing is a close second and taking a few minutes to think about all the potential edge cases can lead to a very stable user experience.
</p>
<p>
  I hope that you found this checklist helpful and do not hesitate to get in touch with your merge request experiences :)

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><code>pot</code> is a great and relatively new jail management tool. It offers DevOps style provisioning and can even be used to provide Docker-like, scalable cloud services together with <code>nomad</code> and <code>consul</code> (more about this in <a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2020/fosdem/pizzamig-orchestrating_jails_with_nomad_and_pot/">Orchestrating jails with nomad and pot</a>).</p>
<p>When using FreeBSD on your desktop, you can also use it simply to easily create “throw away” browser jails. That way, the browser environment is reliably and completely erased and reset each time you re-create it with one single, simple command.</p>
<p>Please note that all the <code>pot</code> commands below should be run as <code>root</code>.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-pot">Setting up <code>pot</code></h2>
<p>Installing and setting up <code>pot</code>is described in detail on <a href="https://pot.pizzamig.dev/Getting/">pot.pizzamig.dev</a> but it is quite straight-forward if you stick to the sensible defaults:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ pkg install pot
...
$ pot init -v
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-the-jail-flavour-template">Creating the Jail Flavour (Template)</h2>
<p>After that, we create a pot flavour that contains all the details about our browser jail in <code>/usr/local/etc/pot/flavours</code>.</p>
<p>The flavour contains of two simple files in this directory.</p>
<p><code>/usr/local/etc/pot/flavours/browser</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
set-attribute -A no-rc-script -V YES
set-attribute -A persistent -V NO

</code></pre></div><p><code>/usr/local/etc/pot/flavours/browser.sh</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span>[</span> -w /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf <span>]</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> sed -i <span>''</span> <span>'s/quarterly/latest/'</span> /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf
<span>ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES</span><span>=</span>yes pkg bootstrap
touch /etc/rc.conf
sysrc <span>sendmail_enable</span><span>=</span><span>"NONE"</span>
sysrc <span>sshd_enable</span><span>=</span><span>"YES"</span>

<span>echo</span> myjailpassword <span>|</span> pw add user ffoxuser -h <span>0</span>
mkdir /home/ffoxuser
chown ffoxuser /home/ffoxuser

pkg install -y xauth firefox 
pkg clean -y
</code></pre></div><p>Make the shell script executable (otherwise it is ignored by <code>pot</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ chmod ugo+x browser.sh
</code></pre><p>Of course you could instead of <code>firefox</code> also install <code>chromium</code> or any other browser or application.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-one-time-jail-and-running-your-browser">Creating a One-Time Jail and Running Your Browser</h2>
<p>Now you can simply create the jail with</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pot create -p onetime-browser -b 12.1 -N public-bridge -t single -f browser
</code></pre><p>and watch the output:</p>
<pre><code>===&gt;  Creating a new pot
===&gt;  pot name : onetime-browser 
===&gt;  type : single
===&gt;  base : 12.1
===&gt;  pot_base :
===&gt;  level : 0
===&gt;  network-type: public-bridge
===&gt;  ip : 10.192.0.3
===&gt;  bridge :
===&gt;  dns : inherit
===&gt;  flavours : browser
===&gt;  Fetching FreeBSD 12.1
...

</code></pre><p>You will note that <code>pot</code> assigns a private IP address to the jail, in the case above <code>10.192.0.3</code>.</p>
<p>Start the browser jail with</p>
<pre><code>$ pot start onetime-browser
</code></pre><p>and then start firefox in the jail with</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -X ffoxuser@10.192.0.3 firefox
</code></pre><p>If necessary, replace the IP address with the IP address from your output.</p>
<p>If you copied the configuration from above, the password you will be asked for is <em>myjailpassword</em>.</p>
<h2 id="clean-up-afterwards">Clean Up Afterwards…</h2>
<p>As soon as you are done browsing and you have closed the browser session, stop the jail with</p>
<pre><code>$ pot stop onetime-browser
</code></pre><p>and delete the jail with</p>
<pre><code>$ pot destroy -p onetime-browser
</code></pre><p>All the data associated with your browsing session will be completely removed.</p>
<h2 id="or-use-snapshots">…Or Use Snapshots</h2>
<p>A lot more efficient than recreating the jail from scratch each time would be taking a snapshot immediately after creating the jail with</p>
<pre><code>$ pot snapshot -p onetime-browser
</code></pre><p>and instead of deleting the jail simply roll back to it after having finished browsing:</p>
<pre><code>$ pot revert -p onetime-browser
</code></pre>

<![CDATA[Consider getting a “DIY” degree online instead of a traditional CS major]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>As universities are switching to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-pandemic-rages-prominent-colleges-announce-online-semesters-11594130062">100% remote teaching in the coming semester</a>, many undergraduate students should strongly consider getting a “DIY” CS degree: take the same courses you would at your own school, but on any one of the online Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platforms, like <a href="https://coursera.org/">Coursera</a> or <a href="https://edx.org/">edX</a>.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: this one is a no-brainer. According to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic">US News</a> one year of college tuition costs $10,116 on average for in-state students at a public school, and $36,801 on average at private schools.</p>
<p>Compare this with just a few hundred dollars for taking the equivalent MOOCs.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the money - you just saved yourself a decade of paying off student debt. If you do have the money - congrats! Put it in an investment account and use it as seed money for your first startup company!</p>
<p><strong>Better teaching</strong>: MOOCs are now freely available from the very best schools and world class professors, even if you didn’t get into Stanford or Harvard.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<p><strong>No face time</strong>: you will be getting little to no live, personal time with the professors and TAs. This is somewhat mitigated by the TAs actively participating in the online forums the most MOOC platforms have, but still - not the same.</p>
<p><strong>No community</strong>: this one is the biggest one IMO. You don’t have the experience of learning together with your peers. MOOC platforms do have forums and group projects and it’s likely those features will continue to evolve and improve.</p>
<p><strong>No college life</strong>: you will be missing on the college experience. This one is a big one. However, with the current uncertainty around COVID19 - there’s no telling how many semesters you’ll be missing out on <em>anyway</em>, so you might end up not missing as much.</p>
<p><strong>No structure</strong>: you will have to be very disciplined. There will be no structure of “being at school”. You’ll need to get your butt out of bed and do the work, by yourself, at home.</p>
<p><strong>Existing investment</strong>: if you’re a junior or senior, you’ve already invested time, effort and money into your degree. Switching to self-directed online learning will nullify that.</p>
<p><strong>No degree</strong>: at the end of it all you’re not getting a degree. Those still matter to many but I believe it matters less over time. If you invest effort into creating a viable curriculum, doing all the work and getting the certificates, and documenting everything - you’ll end up with a very impressive “DIY degree”.</p>
<p>As a hiring manager, if I saw this on a resume (I haven’t yet) - I would be very impressed.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>There is lots of room and value in creating an online learning “community” where students will be able to engage with peers and teachers in a live, face-to-face manner. This functionality will continue to improve on the existing MOOC platforms, but can also exist as a third party product.</p>
<p>Another missing feature that should exist is pre-built degree curriculums for different majors, linking out to all the available (and recommended or “best”) MOOCs for each subject.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most of my week was spent running ads, and here are the main lessons learned.</p><p>One, I've heard very varying testimonials on Reddit ads. I'm not a regular Reddit user, so the community is foreign to me, but because the platform hates self promotion my ad went poorly. It was a simple banner ad on the top of r/entrepreneur and r/sweatystartup, and all it said was "I experiment with entrepreneurship, live. :)" - I got 1 downvote, one nasty comment, one sassy comment, and a very expensive CPC. Maybe my ad was too self promotional? I've heard CPC can go under $0.05, if you do it right, but clearly I didn't. Oh well, lesson learned. We might go back to those ads eventually, and maybe even try to implement some social proof to start the ad off with some upvotes.</p><p>Two, Google Search ads will suck you dry if you're not careful. I haven't been able to find a way to set a CPC spend limit, and that's where it gets scary. Whatever your spend is set to, just like every other ads manager, it will spend it all. However, it won't optimize that, because if your search terms are even remotely niche, you're not going to have a lot of clicks simply because the traffic is low. On other platforms, most of the time, traffic isn't an issue - traffic is saturated. But when I ran ads on my Twitch account for people searching terms like "learn entrepreneurship" and "how to become an entrepreneur" the traffic was super limited - <strong>but Google still spent the entire budget</strong>.</p><p>I was running similar ads for a client, and they wanted to really max out conversions, so they copied a prior campaign and pumped 5x the money into it. We were unaware that Google Search ads don't limit spend, so it still spend all of that cash on the limited amount of engagement, and our CPC was triple that of the previous, and practically identical, campaign</p><p>This makes things a little weird if you're targeting niche keywords (And I would assume most marketers are). It seems like the right approach, so you don't get screwed, is to start with a super low spend on your campaign, then slowly increase it until you max out on engagement. If the CPC starts rising at any point, drop spend back down, otherwise you're spending more money for no added benefit. When I ran my campaign on a few super niche keywords, at a budget of $10 per day, my CPC was almost $3.50. Compare that to the $0.03 CPC I got on Quora, and you see the problem.</p><p>As a last point, Snapchat seems to be super picky with the ad creatives you submit, but that's pretty much everything I've learned thus far. I didn't try LinkedIn ads because they're insanely expensive, and I didn't try Twitter ads because I have no presence there, and I figured if I wanted to do Twitter ads they would be to promote my profile. I think I'll eventually try TikTok ads and a new fancy little service called Taboola, which looks super promising, but for now I'm going to move on to next week's experiment --&gt; Content Sharing. (which is likely how you found this post)</p><p>P.S. It's important to note that running ads is not hard, and it's a great skill to have- it takes about a day to learn. If you put $5 into the Facebook ads manager, just to test and experiment, you've officially learned how to run ads on every single other platform. Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora - they all have almost the exact same structure, and for me, Quora worked out unexpectedly well.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>For years, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been the gold standard for treating insomnia. CBT techniques for insomnia have been proven to work in numerous clinical trials and are more effective than medication.</p><p>The American Academy for Sleep Medicine, the American College of Physicians, and the European Sleep Research Society all recommend CBT for insomnia (CBT-I) as first-line treatment.</p></div><div><p>
This guide takes about 15-20 minutes to read. Here's a quick overview so you can decide if reading the full guide is worth your time.
  </p><!----></div><h2 id="what-is-cbt">What is CBT?</h2><p>CBT is a form of therapy that was initially developed as a treatment for depression. The Cognitive in CBT refers to mental activity, such as thoughts, beliefs, memories, images or values. The behavioral part includes all the things we do on a daily basis. This can be things you do with others or things you do alone.</p><p>CBT saw it's beginning when the American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck (and others) noticed a pattern of thinking that was common for many clients with depression. Not very impressed with the result of traditional therapies, they wanted to address these issues with a more straightforward and direct approach. And so Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was born.</p><h3 id="cognitions-thoughts">Cognitions (thoughts)</h3><p>A core principle in CBT is that our emotional reactions and behaviors are influenced by how we think about ourselves, others, and the world around us. Humans have a great capacity for thinking, but that requires time and energy. Most of the time, we take mental shortcuts and react to events that happen without giving them much thought. These shortcuts, or cognitive biases, often lead us to interpret and process information inaccurately.</p><p>If you ask two people to give a presentation on something they are both knowledgeable about, you might get two different reactions. One is hesitant and suggests someone else. The other immediately and enthusiastically agrees. It's the exact same situation. So why do they react so differently?</p><p>CBT explains that this difference in emotional reactions and behaviors comes from different ways of thinking about the situation. One thinks he might start to shake and others will notice. The other one thinks that this is a good opportunity to share his knowledge.</p><p>The common-sense model</p><p><img src="https://www.sleepedy.com/assets/static/model_situation_emotion.a05844e.25c1b7895053af109d8796a6365f759f.svg" width="473" alt="Situation leads to emotion" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 473 69' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-577ab4bd82e2546c7e456c9eec27b8a9'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-577ab4bd82e2546c7e456c9eec27b8a9)' width='473' height='69' xlink:href='data:image/svg%2bxml%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAAJCAYAAACCPip6AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAADrUlEQVRIx51WWU9TURAu0N9AfDfxH/jqIzRB04VuLAXS3haRCqjgwloIlC0uLBElASWAILQUFFliotE3FJXYlhbQaASffNH4QFjaceb03tvLbSHgTSbfmTnbzHfmzLkKLuhZK16fBi7ojWA7al/1YtsDAkrbyfrkdkH4tfZLvr%2bg9iUFfohphBkZGUz4dioJtTMzM2lMKj/2LPmGa/gRA4jHEhorjD9sHtr9iGHENwoKHpXEwAOT8SADngMBH2pLJGmvdHOBsJOCKno9oMQg0wTBwJUK/kNdiXqKY32akcStevLKf70Ce2gKijdmDgr6nGA7Tp9MLn59Dgo7njx/akRClDkfngLHlxmG9jUfODam46eLDpE4cAF7KK6zsYiS4Gk9JGCedDcFBQAK%2bYeBV2DgZwTdujTCSME5BprLrXp37EEP%2bUgZyhD3juB%2bvPiYDfdmOusL8TpvI%2bRkazAMevYVQtpLg7e%2bHwVDbx3kP%2buB/JlusMz3AefHjPg8AbaPY2BdfsL6Chb6WNu28hRsH8ZYn4QEkQDU2yioLIspHQMuJMGgCXMR/6DsoLhQThVvzqXxV8Do3FqkdXY5wTcknHww9NZDvq8LbJ/Gwbo0zLI15tcoWGZ7wTJ3/yi/kFTxqkcVsnsLmIJQ9PYRaOovg6G7FrRNFaCpdYKpvxGMD1yga6sETU0paBvKQH/nFujc1yC7vQq0jeWQ3XGdXQ15BnD%2biQ4KSqU%2bf06j0QCJWq1miCREVCoVaLVaQAKWswrN6YyAwKRJIEC8VmEfWN%2bNwIUrHOSOd%2bKeMd%2bYD7i3ruUqaF3loL99U7RpXWXMPww6aa1KIEDIAFpEf68azENuMA%2b2sDbZsjtvMGLMg81getgIhp46MHTVQM5wGxPbynjspKQECBlQwDIgDwPN49GI%2bBtxG6UWJb0KNlPlGSD6hqdI6%2btaK8E00Azmx27IGW3Hw2kC/d1q0UYHZeipZX6ST%2bahVpYNvF8HCeAdjfJpERV1RMyGKNaAKG4cE2qHeQx543pY0idZgxHwI14Dkn1IgBMDPy3omH1CDTCWbi3Q3D1OVqRZOlOmYX1i9YpqFNUj0kNTol2oYZQ5suIcvwIOGiRhJF7svMntJxDcYJ%2bCQGynoApf9tMroOQrPr0E4itALwK9AvZ1H6sBWKBMzp%2bLNHf3qKf5JJKMBMqAv/Re05MlCGNdop9UhPmI2yXfZmmzBvl/AL35kv%2bAFMl/gFAE9WIGoLP/G3QyAiQZEPkHBM14KrRQEhsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"></p><p>The cognitive model</p><p><img src="https://www.sleepedy.com/assets/static/model_situation_thought_emotion.e4ad7cc.294c7369e1e2d3479ebae5203785d821.svg" width="758" alt="Situation leads to cognitions (negative thoughts) leads to emotion" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 758 69' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-a0dae8d490a9960785daa502d0bd80b7'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-a0dae8d490a9960785daa502d0bd80b7)' width='758' height='69' xlink:href='data:image/svg%2bxml%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAAGCAYAAABzaJivAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAADgklEQVQ4y41UW0iUURD%2bo6wI6imI3ioiiiyKXoveXNfooXTXrU3N3F0vmARBhXZPk8zUTHMrKysqbXfdtbQbiT10ewkl73Y3lQh6EHoo8z/TN7Nnt82nfhhm/nPmzMz5zjdjuPubyd0XUK5eP0WlZ4qOsbXvZO7HVnL1BTIMfA7vsTiLxTLD0N%2bWonyx4bsYvl8gY7BHPUMhEfz/lR7/KO%2b5%2bwOi9foI7DHoYeh4jrX1cEFcQkJCNIet/MBM1vBJgoxr35i4Pi3%2bGNFrvZITOfxfjcjlUQAJGANB8rwNEQolz7sWcg8Gw/b7u7IOX4Uzk3mf77O924j5AMIiFLk28u/q9q3K/XCPPBwTcXa9uEa7Xt2g7LctlI14IrzPeXsDDC7W/vpnI6%2br%2b86G2ByIvzAWCNSws%2bBbuzyMnOHY7%2b5SzqfWsOChOAcL27zmGQxJfM5jyOWHgiqjo55sZ4vIcbWEnL4KSn/spe1N5eS4UkzOQKVIWmsNAGoWBjAAng/33HMNY7bFmtiBotoAQJ/VaiVLYmIDapuO/eWcCP4mwDW33SpTtuoihTzKfv6ISq0/oewXjqnksn0quXy/SqkqlDXxx4UYkLzxp2vWL1i6BDnqEb8EeTohA4mbNzk0AGn5I4%2bYob/wQCr9kVelXi5WaW21CvWq9Id1ivPuCJ5VaQ/qZA0sUPrhlSHJBoPmzmcNJooyHddKTRRl2moPmymVhSYAMe3eo7K3/fZpuQjOTOR9agMjWjyoYZolyXoKRRWhwBD0MIotkBYYCq2QV2TWALhMvD4KEiBREDmbq8hWc4iQjzKeXKQdoWqRyOWZGfk/n6/euDg%2bHjHbEf8mx4f8sGxK2hMFYFQAmBAAEB%2b1Uuql42SrPki2cwfJXndEND%2bw/cJRyupsZMYL843soZYwbSLUYbpoerKdA0rmROjDe9wOoE7%2b2GO%2b2J4pLTAHxc2L0rPHF89xBeSBoMp8eZ0cDSfBpiqtK8lxvRRMO0NOf6UAwhcHyPI63JJoo6ktsBIyP6YFMnQtE3IWreR6c0daGaBH4mkdkJbWs0yANtwYUjA%2b8xD5H4Ev64%2bQ77CFhikle2fi8nHRIbg/V2wMyWV6ZoSHZ7ePsrqa5AUynzeIzcXKWlcjZb2%2bxReOMoBbDXqdzvHPELRXFM7SOWx5w/f5zO9orv5AdHhLnHB%2b0jEjWnkA0B88OW688/hLQQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"></p><p>CBT proposes that it’s not the <strong>situation</strong> that makes us feel something, but the <strong>thoughts</strong> about that situation.</p><h3 id="behavior">Behavior</h3><p>Changing what you do is often the most powerful way of changing how you think and feel about something. The behavioral part in CBT is about testing new behaviors and learning what happens when you gain new experiences.</p><p>If you always avoid giving presentations, you will never experience a successful one. Your negative thoughts about yourself in that situation will never change. A common unhelpful belief that people have when speaking to a crowd is that they will get anxious, start to shake, and the audience will see that as a sign of weakness.</p><p>To target the cognition that shaking is a sign of weakness, CBT uses something called a behavioral experiment. In these kinds of experiments, the goal is to get real experiences about what happens if you shake and if it's true that other people will react negatively to this. A typical behavioral experiment might be to videotape yourself talking in front of a crowd. When viewing the video afterward, try to notice the level of shaking and what reaction the group had to this. Most likely, you will see that your shaking was barely noticeable, and those who were listening didn't react at all.</p><h3 id="the-cbt-triangle-putting-it-all-together">The CBT triangle (putting it all together)</h3><p>Therapy involves changing how you feel about something. Whether it is to achieve a goal or to stop being anxious or sad — it's all about changing emotions. Now, this is hard to do directly. We have little control over our emotions; they will pop up whether you like it or not. CBT aims to change how you feel about something through our thoughts (cognitions) and behaviors.</p><p><img src="https://www.sleepedy.com/assets/static/model_thought_emotion_behavior.485f804.33e4fd7021857337e42b912f76ac6948.svg" width="393" alt="The CBT triangle" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 393 174' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-56af8b61d402fee5a6a492789169c2bc'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-56af8b61d402fee5a6a492789169c2bc)' width='393' height='174' xlink:href='data:image/svg%2bxml%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAAcCAYAAADRJblSAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAIKUlEQVRYw9VXaWxU1xWexUZq0lZK%2b6uVmkhVW1WRWirxI1IrUTnCS0BgG2NsbIIxxjMmIgkRBBG2GBfbwcHYmYK8ZOI1tgOeGS9Ak0CqKjUJFdgGL%2bPdcZriJlEbVXEVRQ2ed/qdM/eOn4dxColN6Eif7rn3vnuW755z3huL5Wv%2bent7LdeuXbMpee/o6ChhPgvZwEiLAaVrlnVDPsC22Cbb/sZ/YQS4JyYm2MmbynEJoKenR8DzcCy0rs%2baxptKd8M9RQAc4cBtSq4YHx9nh2/qDOAABgYGBNevX6e%2bvj4JSMt6naHXTTdvzoCbSrdbkW1j2/daBlSyk%2bYM4AB9Ph%2b1tLRQd3c3Xb58WYK6evUqXbp0iTo7O6mrq0v2GFeuXAnJ4RmgdL9yz2WAJgBjpc4AdpqDGBkZoYKCAnK5XFReXk75%2bfl0/PhxKi0tpaNHj8peWVkZlZSUUHFxsawXFhZSY2MjDQ4OhkrElAGv3FMZ8GUEsPN%2bv5/cbjdVVFRIUPX19VRdXS1kNDQ0iKzn/Fxzc7PItbW1/x8EhJWA7gFfAFy3Btcv6tpANhioeQHKQvb6%2b/tvGXmfn%2bdR1b7GF2NjY0yG%2bxstgfj4eEtcXJzIPDqdTgtuWWeAe3Jykp2cDX%2bVmZvbV3wVzrJuyPIWaGpqstfU1IR8uis/Dlgbg2zV6xcuXLCrDMgfGhpiJz9XWSDA%2bleCWQfrZN1YL9J2161bZzNfxpISwQZMxuTGY2NjrZC/ayqHbwG/grOM5WpcDLCu5awb5XMf21qzZs0DPCYkJMzLyLuRBVY1fgdoB1bwPDs723aXqtCm7JcCz7CckpKy9MGrDNDB/xAYRcoRxu/xmtVqtaBzW3FD3J0XHVNTU7a6ujq7yZ8DSUlJbP%2bQ6gNWc5YueuNTzU8T8BDwH%2bA88ANgF/ajlzINTbZ/AyQBv0b6MwF1ykf7kjdEbQRGjwEeJbuAt8y3sEQE2JSNFZD/qS7hx8B7LIc35qV49ekb%2bCXwMfAzYDmXgskB2xKXob6AYsBruoDXNQFLkgFhBPwUWMnND52YU/CcesZm/kZY7B9eeSGC%2bRJWr17Ntt/ktxCQyuurVq268xLY7vcIcoe8oTES9tLHlqQ9TquJlB2JiYkUFx//HM9TS/Za0yrzQ8%2bbdTK0rdvxJ5Jf2wdaLet2Bt80cQkJD8L%2bAPD5YymJ0ntSjuyy5vQ0WxwTHQvGENI1BL3%2boGxxTHnviLAfoeGLE6tidwNbbpfk2yZgyDNvXOi38qGHl8XFxrpiYx59%2bGunFxyLBjtRGKN4XAi875jsjMq6WBW9/uCT9/PZza1ly7Z1N0XljrbNO48AonIxx2iNFLz544XLy1w6IRIGPVboima9gkFPlPNvf7BnvHpsGRHJM8n7d357N03ZcnpaQvb18xFj8rNvPHqidfBduUOef2z3e29A/jse%2blKoZ6Zzh/H8YOtH%2bkz4WcynMfL%2bKPBzsdV3RvcRDjiKoWuW3zBc43nTb2jCfgIMKx3TZjsoh2ngQxDyIdbE71sweOta6LzfcwMyYvZcsuS9d5acYx3kHA9DpLU7AZ8fa6cn3j9PMLSGg8Lt2SK9qrD2gJa3vFlpD2aBN27H1DnRIRgP6mN/d9x4nXb89bzIzgmsT3YG91me6KS8qbOU9/452c9jHROdEf3jfW4Ms3AwgBEIjjIf9glwyzIXsCxQz%2bm533RO9Hj1fNYx4iPIkt9I3SgV8CNAEfAsUAF8BLh5Xac2zsYgy0jpDPo42hbI%2bpM7kFZ9JJDZeiKQfblB7ORcey1kH1kW2PrnmkDWW9WB7L80Bra%2bXRNAtsz5PN/XWTZkQCDTSGwYSinn%2bmlygk0QQTBO6LCEHkAOMMjP6jnvyTmszUH0GQ7cGvYkz9Mq8qNVuv8WwVYCJ4GzgAF0AWt30YBNEfCoY6SNdRnsm%2bgHmdnv1tOG8v2UevIwJT//FKUce5aSC56hVNdBkde/sIeSDu6kpENPYn0XrS/eQ4n7n6CtXbUhP80xW%2bY7jcXBVglqw4nnKKVkL2V6TtDGiucpveYobW5/iTY1l1Cmr5xwC5TpLaMMzLP%2b%2bHIkEgw0GiEAshCwjz7RPeB%2b4DGWY2JiuCx%2boUsANyYlgDNBAvxeQ5EgBPDI9rZcrBZ/0msKaVPjC5ReX0xpLxfQhuP7aH3hbnr83CnKOFMK/8sozf07QraYCQj5GZkA3GzqSweEweQjTwsZG6vyKTn/aWGb57zPbDPrwu7YwgQg/YSAja5D0Qh2HxBYu3Ytf8j0AheBt/nbnp9JryqInpcB/mAGcBZuu9pE2e/UE0iSLJVsVBnJI1KdNne45Bkn6lsylLMVPmzrbqZQhpvitUgtMMsKKj0MKDNAhsgavAbDwfmwz9jefyY4H547Z9LFegOOIOvSA5wfnOfbfhBwAh0ohXRgJZAAfF%2ba4BsV9rke4GMCpM84xtsN3KaReuqwjBktLxrptYUC3LCRXldkpJ48ZKAUjE2vHhMgI7BfFJrn9J3W2aRjDVi4G3KjYrbngDnX/Gjb/PUF5%2bHn2yRdOYC8ybPM9Gr1GrT/r09u3KRNlUBsHrq3kICb4k6edaGKMk%2bX0uMdvyc0QUl/zsCNpw6jHFyU0VQi5YBmS5vqiuSZjOYXKa3qCIEwkOlRPvsE/FZhpj8AG58BMyEMeWewftuYd3YOnwL/xv6/gEckqLF2m/oGsKu/2Czb9P%2bI4MdPq26CK4BPWAf8%2bZR9CvnVf2YGBAu2XKyawSfwDDIkuDbsnRvH1BrO5fS2yJr4OyT%2bfcax/xc%2b93eqDKvvzwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"></p><p>We can draw CBT's approach as a triangle because each element is linked together.

/%3e%3c/svg%3e"></p><p>Susan has always been a good sleeper. She always falls asleep within fifteen minutes of going to bed and wakes up feeling refreshed. Susan doesn’t really think much about sleep, it’s just something that happens when she goes to bed.</p><h3 id="why-does-george-have-insomnia-and-not-susan">Why does George have insomnia and not Susan?</h3><p>What may not be obvious but separates George from Susan, is that they have very different beliefs about sleep. They experience precisely the same situation each night; they both go to bed and try to sleep. Their thoughts and feelings in this situation, are very different.</p><p>George worries that it's going to be another night of sleeplessness and that he will be dead tired at work the following day. He thinks about how a lack of sleep might damage his body and wonders if he will ever sleep well again. The minute his head hits the pillow, he's wide awake. His mind races and he starts feeling anxious and upset. He's exhausted but can't seem to fall asleep. After spending quite a bit of time unsuccessfully trying to sleep, he pulls out his phone and listens to a podcast to distract himself. He finally falls asleep a few hours before he has to get up for work.</p><p>Susan goes to bed and doesn't think much about it at all. She is fast asleep fifteen minutes after she turns off the lights.</p><h3 id="thoughts-behavior-and-feelings">Thoughts, behavior, and feelings</h3><p>George’s sleep problems started when the company he was working for experienced financial trouble and had to downsize. He worried about losing his job and not being able to afford rent. George found that he became preoccupied with thoughts of worry most of the day and even more as nighttime approached and it was time to sleep. He tried, as most do when facing problems in life, to think his way out of it. After a while, George noticed that his sleep was getting worse. It frequently took a long time to fall asleep, and he often woke up multiple times every night.</p><p>Fortunately, George didn’t lose his job. The company is now doing fine, and he doesn’t worry about it anymore, but he’s still struggling with sleep.</p><p>George’s story is typical when it comes to insomnia. It's common that some initial stressful life event sets it off, but the problems persist even when the stressor has resolved. It is notable that the event that causes insomnia in the first place varies, but when insomnia has been established, people begin to behave and think the same way.</p><p>CBT does not concern itself much with what initially caused George's insomnia. Instead, it focuses on the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that maintain it. In George's case, we can see a pattern of him worrying a lot about sleep and the consequences of not getting enough. After a while, he starts to associate the bed with feelings of frustration and anxiety.</p><p>When George's thoughts constantly revolve around sleep and the consequences of him not getting enough, his mind will interpret this as a threat. The brain's threat detection system doesn't make the distinction between thinking about a threat or actually experiencing one. It does what it’s supposed to do and tells the body to get prepared for the threat.</p><p>When the brain signals the body to get ready, the body reacts immediately. It goes into a state of arousal where the main goal is to be prepared to handle anything. Arousal is, in many ways, a state that is the opposite of sleeping. Your heart beats a little faster, your breathing starts to increase in frequency. Pupils dilate, and you are more vigilant. Because the brain believes you are in danger, you go into a mild form of fight-or-flight mode where your senses are heightened, and muscles are ready to spring into action.</p><p>The most convincing and compelling way of learning that a previously held belief is false is experiencing the opposite. George has the view that he has to put in a lot of effort to get to sleep. A goal of CBT for insomnia is going to sleep without thinking or worrying too much about it. We want George to be more like Susan and experience falling asleep without effort, and as a result, learn that he can fall asleep easily without thinking too much about it. To help people get this valuable experience, CBT for insomnia uses something called sleep restriction.</p><h3 id="sleep-restriction">Sleep restriction</h3><p>When people who struggle with sleep hear about sleep restriction the first time, they immediately think it's counterintuitive. Why should you restrict your sleep when you want more of it?</p><p>To answer this question, we need to learn about sleep drive. Sleep drive is the force that makes you sleepy when you have been awake for a long time. To …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Container orchestrators take Docker containers + configuration, and run them on servers. If you’re ok being locked to a single cloud provider, most of them have a service which handles this for you.</p>



<p>At CodeDay, we need to run our own for a few reasons. In general, the cost is lower for our workloads. I’ve also found that managed offerings have usually been painful in the long-run because the way they bill for usage doesn’t make sense for all workloads. (In the last startup I ran, we overpaid by $5k/mo vs rolling our own, although that’s less than SF rent, so as a YC and venture-backed startup it was fine I guess.)</p>



<p>One more reason that was unique to us: as a non-profit, we have a few thousand dollars a year of free credit for both AWS and Azure, plus free colocation in the Westin Building donated by <a href="https://www.greenhousedata.com/">Green House Data,</a> and we wanted to take advantage of it all.</p>



<h2>Why Not Kubernetes?</h2>



<p>If you look at running your own infrastructure, the usual story you’ll hear about orchestrators is that there was a fight between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes (and a few weird options like Flynn), but at the end of the day, Kubernetes was the winner.</p>



<p>Kubernetes is… not ideal for a small team. I’m sure it’s a great platform for companies the size of Google or Slack, but it brings a lot of complexity: etcd, helm charts, ingress controllers, endpoints and endpoint slices, istio, four types of coordinators (scheduler, kube controller manager, cloud controller manager, and api server), and the list goes on.</p>



<p>Distributions like MicroK8s can help with setup, but our team still needs to understand all what’s going on, or we won’t be able to tune, or troubleshoot problems.</p>



<p>When we were evaluating this, I talked with a few of our alums who’ve done Kubernetes at scale, and the recommendation was universally: do not do this without a full-time compute team which is… impractical for a nonprofit. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23460066">I recently heard the same advice from Coinbase and a few HN commenters.</a></p>



<h2>Why Nomad (+Hashicorp’s Stack) is Better</h2>



<p>If Kubernetes is at one end of the service-oriented spectrum, Nomad is at the other. Nomad is a single binary with no external dependencies, written in Go. </p>



<p>To use Nomad, you download the binary to a VM and run <code>nomad server</code> to set up the orchestrator. In most cases this VM can be very small — we use an Azure B1s for about $6/mo. If you want high availability, you can run three of them. (We do.)</p>



<p>Once your orchestrator is running, you download the same binary and run <code>nomad agent</code> on the worker VMs which run containers. There’s a little bit of configuration, but our config files are on the order of 20 lines.</p>



<p>Containers in Nomad are part of “jobs,” and grouped in “task groups” (groups of containers which will run on the same machine). A job can ask for more than one copy of a container and you can PATCH them later, so you could write your own autoscaler (although Nomad has one built in).</p>



<p>You configure jobs by submitting JSON files, or anything that can compile down to JSON files. A lot of people use Hashicorp’s HCL language, although I find it very verbose. You can submit these with the <code>nomad</code> CLI tool, or POST them directly to Nomad’s API. (We wrote a utility which lets you write jobs in a <code>docker-stack</code> style YAML and submits the proper JSON.)</p>



<p>You can see everything, make some modifications, view logs, and even open a terminal into a container from this fancy web UI:</p>



<figure><img src="https://f4.codeday.org/20200721210703/2020-07-21-170653_959x635_scrot.png" alt="" srcset="https://f4.codeday.org/20200721210703/2020-07-21-170653_959x635_scrot.png 959w, https://f4.codeday.org/20200721210703/2020-07-21-170653_959x635_scrot-300x199.png 300w, https://f4.codeday.org/20200721210703/2020-07-21-170653_959x635_scrot-768x509.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px"></figure>



<p>Honestly, that’s about all there is to know to get started. There are two tutorials which are helpful if you’d like to give it a try:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad/getting-started/install">Tutorial if you’re just experimenting</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/install/production/deployment-guide">Tutorial if you want to install it in production</a></li></ul>



<h2>More Helpful, Simple Services</h2>



<p>Hashicorp has two <strong>100% optional</strong> services which are also just as simple to install and configure. Both of them also integrate nicely with Nomad:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Consul</strong> is a suite of tools that help services discover other services. It’s optional, but if you also install Consul, you can tag ports on your containers with names, and access them from other containers.<p>(Consul can also do some other things, like status checks, secure service-to-service routing, and distributed key-value store.)</p><p>We use Consul so that we can, eg., tag our Elastic containers ports with <code>elastic</code>, and then use <code>elastic.service.consul</code> in connection strings to automatically find an available Elastic host. <a href="https://medium.com/zendesk-engineering/making-docker-and-consul-get-along-5fceda1d52b9">(This sadly required a bit more setup that I would have liked.)</a></p><p>We also use one of those advanced features — status checks — to wait for services to fully initialize after a deploy before switching over live traffic.</p></li><li> <strong>Vault</strong> is a secret management system. At the simplest level, you can use it to store encrypted K/V pairs, which you can then inject into config files or ENV variables in Nomad jobs.</li></ul>



<p>We actually run the Consul and Vault services on the same B1s VMs as the Nomad servers, and we’ve never really gotten above 50% CPU or RAM utilization, even at peak times when we’ve had two dozen agents and almost a hundred containers starting at the same time for <a href="https://playcodecup.com/">CodeCup,</a> our series of hour-long high school cybersecurity challenges.</p>



<div><p>The last service we find useful is not made by Hashicorp: Traefik. It’s a load balancer that can look up information about running containers in Consul. It can also talk to Lets Encrypt and do TLS termination, plus a bunch of complicated things.</p><p>We just add a tag to each port in the job description to tell Traefik to route traffic for a specific domain to that port on those containers. Honestly Traefik became overly complicated once they decided to do an enterprise offering and I wish there were a simpler alternative.</p></div>



<h2>Growing Into Advanced Features</h2>



<p>The thing I love about Nomad is that it was very easy to get started with, but it’s been able to do most of the advanced things we’ve needed over time. It’s honestly a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of modern tooling, and it reminds me of when I was first learning tools like Vim.</p>



<p>Here are a few features you can look into if you need them:</p>



<ul><li>You can start containers using a crontab-style system, for backups, and run “system” jobs which run on all nodes.</li><li>You can use Nomad to run native processes, QEMU VMs, or… JARs (?)</li><li>You can tag Nomad agents, and use those tags to specify placement affinities to e.g.: colocate network-sensitive services, add DC redundancy, deploy services at POPs, etc.</li><li>“CSI” allows Nomad to automatically talk to your cloud provider to mount/dismount/move volumes on hosts, for things like databases requiring high-performance persistent storage. (It’s compatible with all Kubernetes CSI providers.)</li><li>You can configure autoscaling policies for your containers using prometheus metrics. (And, of course, Nomad can publish metrics so you can scale up and down your servers.) </li><li>By default anyone with access to port 4646 on your Nomad servers can modify jobs, but you can configure detailed ACL tokens to control access.</li><li>Consul Connect allows you to define specific service-to-service connections.</li></ul>



<p>(Good time to mention that this is not a sponsored post, just our experience.)</p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>We have more than 50 services running at this point to support our programs, and everyone has been super happy with the choice. One of our interns even deployed this stack on his Raspberry Pis for some projects, recently.</p>



<p>Over time we’ve developed some more tooling around Nomad, such as automated provisioning of new machines <a href="https://github.com/srnd/containercfg/tree/master/agents">using Cloud-Init and Puppet,</a> a utility to <a href="https://github.com/codeday/nomad-watcher">send Discord notifications for deployment status updates,</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/srnd/nomad-deployment-manager">web UI for managing deployed versions and scaling out:</a> </p>

Instead we built a deployment portal showing service status</figcaption></figure>

<![CDATA[Set of Principles: Treat Your External Hard Drive as Your Local Cloud]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I first started using computers, storing your information in the “cloud” sounded superb. You can put your computer data to a server that you can access from any device with an internet connection. Now, it's a problem.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-shift-in-perception-change-the-use-case-of-your-external-hard-drive">How Can Shift In Perception Change The Use Case Of Your External Hard Drive?</h3>

<p>Nowadays, I see a lot of problems with this way of storing my data. Any online account can be compromised, but the company storing your information can take advantage of your data. It is no secret that Google scans your Gmail to personalize the ads, so I wouldn't be surprised if they do the same with Google Drive. Not to mention that these internet companies wouldn't mind complying with government requests to hand over your data.</p>

<p>There are some solutions to this problem, like encrypting the data before the upload, but just like an external hard drive, this makes sharing features unusable. I use <a href="https://cryptomator.org/" rel="nofollow">Cryptomator</a> to encrypt my 2FA backup codes; additionally, it can also be used to encrypt any data you want to upload to the cloud. Disclaimer: Cryptomator is partly open-sourced, but not all of its software is available for free!</p>

<p>What's the cool idea behind cloud storage, and how can I make it more “dumb” to fit my privacy standards? Apart from sharing files, having a portable external hard drive can offer similar benefits.</p>

<p>So I bought a new SanDisk portable hard drive with USB-C, so I can use it with my computer or my smartphone, the same set of devices I usually use to access the cloud. I went with a 500GB version since I didn't want to spend too much, and I wouldn't use it as a backup drive. I've also realized that having all of my data on a portable drive unencrypted is exceptionally unsafe. I'm currently looking at buying a Cryptomator license for my Android smartphone, but I'm not sure how well that solution works.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/cQHeC9N.jpg" alt="SanDisk"></p>

<p>The next step was to get the data from online accounts and close the ones that provide no more value. It's is a reasonably beneficial and straightforward step to unite and consolidate your data. It was cathartic to delete some unused accounts and to organize my files better.</p>

<p>I'm still going to use my Nextcloud instance, but I will try my best to utilize my new hard drive. Nextcloud also offers additional applications, helpful for de-Googling yourself, that external hard drive can't provide, like calendar, notes, tasks...</p>

<p>If you want to do the same thing I recommend buying a more portable USB-C drive, Samsung also has some good ones, so you can store it in your backpack and transfer the data from all devices you use. However, if you want to try this experiment, you don't need to buy a new one, your older external hard drive will do just fine. I have no idea how well this solution will work, but I can't wait to put it through its paces when I return to the university in October.</p>

<h3>
Lightweight Conjecture Records for Research Teamwork
</h3>
</div><div>
<div id="post-body-3932663866567881663">
<p><i>Intended for Data Science AI/ML Research Teams, but generally applicable.</i></p><div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qCGN2Dt9HK0/XxVZNVxLyHI/AAAAAAAA6Jg/qS4b3I1Laewt2k-S9J7a_a09IEp2pkADgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1280/black-and-white-blackboard-business-chalkboard-356043.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="782" data-original-width="1280" height="196" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qCGN2Dt9HK0/XxVZNVxLyHI/AAAAAAAA6Jg/qS4b3I1Laewt2k-S9J7a_a09IEp2pkADgCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h196/black-and-white-blackboard-business-chalkboard-356043.jpg" title="Research Teamwork" width="320"></a></p></div><h2>Slug</h2><p>conjecture-records-improve-research-teamwork</p><h2>Context</h2><p>Data Science is now a first class citizen of the technical world, but that is only a recent development and it still lags behind hardware and software in terms of ecosystem maturity. One area that is still behind the curve is the area of teamwork and working on large scale objectives. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks" target="_blank">Fred Brooks</a> to Michael Nygard the software and system architecture challenges have always been the same - how best to communicate the solution in your head. So following in the footsteps of LADR files, and in the style of the <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions" target="_blank">original post</a>...</p><h2>Conjecture</h2><p>We posit that keeping a collection of "domain significant" conjectures will improve research teamwork; these conjectures put forward experimental thinking that affect dimensionality, data characteristics, pre-processing options, calibrations, qualitative analysis and underlying factors (and more).</p><p>A conjecture record is a short text file (commonly in markdown format). Each record describes a step of thinking that puts forward a conjecture based on the forces involved in the domain of research. Although each conjecture may be a single vector of thinking many conjectures may tackle the same problem space and conjectures may apply to different areas of the problem domain.</p><p>We will keep conjecture records in a project repository under <span face="courier">doc/conj/&lt;slug&gt;.md</span> (or <span face="courier">.txt</span>, <span face="courier">.rst</span>).</p><p>We should use a lightweight formatting language like markdown or&nbsp;reStructuredText.</p><p>Conjecture records will be identified by a canonical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug" target="_blank">slug</a> that represents its citation reference for other areas of the project. Conjectures from other projects can be referenced by a broader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL" target="_blank">Clean URL</a>&nbsp;(e.g. <span face="courier">https://mycompany.com/otherproject/&lt;slug&gt;</span>).</p><p>If a conjecture is disproved we will mark it as <i>disproven</i>&nbsp;(but we will still keep it around as it is relevant to know that it has been disproven). We may choose to move disproven&nbsp;conjectures to an archive folder to de-clutter the current conjecture space.</p><p>We will use a format with just a few parts, so each document is easy to digest. The format shall be:</p><div><ul><li><b>Title</b> - a short readable title for the conjecture</li><li><b>Slug</b> - this short form of the conjecture represents its <u>citation string</u>, research isn't linear so we don't need to use a numerical sequence</li><li><b>Context</b> - describe the <u>problems space</u> from which the conjecture emanates and the <u>provenance</u> of the idea behind it</li><li><b>Conjecture</b> - the text that describes the conjecture in a complete but concise way.&nbsp;It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We posit that ..." (feel free to use wording you are comfortable with)</li><li><b>Status</b> - <i>proposed</i>, <i>explorable</i>, <i>refined</i>, <i>proven</i>, <i>disproven</i>; typically a conjecture will be <i>proposed</i> by one member of the team before being reviewed and deemed <i>explorable</i>. The exploration will eventually lead to the conjecture being either <i>proven</i> or <i>disproven</i> and also commonly <i>refined</i> into a more qualified form (referenced under the Related conjectures)</li><li><b>Impact</b> - describe the indicators that support and potentially refute the conjecture, and build up any evidential case from related work; as more is discovered in through exploration of the conjecture so this section should be expanded to capture that knowledge. Where possible experimental results should be provided as links.</li><li><b>Related</b> - list the other conjectures that might define a refined form of this conjecture, provide complementary support for the conjecture, or essentially conflict with this conjecture</li></ul><p>The whole document should be one or two pages long. We will write each conjecture as if it is a conversation with a future researcher. This requires good writing style, with full sentences organized into paragraphs.</p></div><p>To make full use of the project repository Pull Request and review functionality (such as those provided by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests" target="_blank">github.com</a>) we will have a long lived branch called <span face="courier">conjecture-changes</span> that will be regularly reviewed under a PR and merged into the <span face="courier">master</span>/<span face="courier">main</span> branch periodically. Researchers will commit new and edited conjecture files into this branch so that they go through a review round with the whole team before becoming accepted into the core conjecture space.</p><h2>Status</h2><div><p>explorable</p><h2>Impact</h2><p>So far we are seeing:</p><div><ul><li>New researchers get a broad overview of the current research vectors that the team is involved in and often generate new proposed conjectures as they bring a fresh mind to problems.</li><li>Agile research is simpler to manage because it is clearer what each team member is working towards and research sprints become shorter because the scope of each conjecture is well defined.</li><li>The process of starting with a conjecture helps researchers build explainability into their experiments (but we are still worried about confirmation bias).</li><li>Having the set of proven conjectures available encourages better data hygiene practices among junior researchers.</li><li>Writing down the conjectures in a project repository means that distributed researchers have more opportunity to contribute.</li><li>The review of impact changes to conjectures provides a good way to show progress to the team.</li><li>The concept of "proven" still needs more validation, here we have used the term in its broadest sense, but we still need to be careful about assuming theories and laws of our domain.</li></ul></div><h2>Related</h2><p>None (if you have something then get in touch)</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In keeping with the original LADR post, this post is itself laid out as a&nbsp;Conjecture Record.</p><p>While it is marked as status <i>explorable</i>, early indications are good enough for the technique to merit adoption consideration.</p><p>We are going to keep using them until something better comes along.</p><h2>Examples</h2><div><p>The following are simple examples of conjecture records:</p><p><span face="courier">/doc/conj/rolling-average-filters-smooth-out-noise-in-feature-x.md</span></p><div><p><span face="courier"><br></span><span size="2"><span># Rolling Average Filters Smooth Out Noise in Feature X</span><br><span>## Slug</span><br><span>rolling-average-filters-smooth-out-noise-in-feature-x</span><br><span>## Context</span><br><span>Feature X is noisy because of the way sensor Z functions, and that noise is a problem for the derivative calculation.</span><br><span>## Conjecture</span><br><span>We posit that applying a rolling average of up to N values to feature X gives us X' which can be used for derivative calculations.</span><br><span>## Status</span><br><span>refined</span><br><span>## Impact</span><br><span>This holds true while the ground truth remains stable, and it produces a very accurate X'</span><br><span>The conjecture breaks down when the ground truth of X is changing rapidly, as a result X' fails to reflect the change for too many cycles</span><br><span>## Related</span><br></span></p><p><span face="courier" size="2">Refined to rolling-average-filters-smooth-out-noise-in-feature-x-while-y-is-below-m</span></p><p><span face="courier">/doc/conj/rolling-average-filters-smooth-out-noise-in-feature-x-while-y-is-below-m.md</span></p><p><span size="2"><span># Rolling Average Filters Smooth Out Noise in Feature X While Y is Below M</span><br><span>## Slug</span><br><span>rolling-average-filters-smooth-out-noise-in-feature-x-while-y-is-below-m</span><br><span>## Context</span><br><span>Feature X is noisy because of the way sensor Z functions, and that noise is a problem for the derivative calculation.</span><br><span>Feature Y has been shown to have an impact on the validity of the rolling average calculation.</span><br><span>## Conjecture</span><br><span>We posit that applying a rolling average of up to N values to feature X while Y &lt; M to determine X'.

<p><span>E</span>arlier this year, when Facebook reached a $52 million settlement with lawyers representing more than 10,000 former and current content moderators in four U.S. states, their colleagues in India and the Philippines were entirely left out.</p>



<p>In their case against Facebook, workers in the United States had claimed that examining content on the social media giant’s platform, which can include screening for everything from child pornography to videos of terrorist decapitations, had led to severe psychological <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">consequences</a>. And like their American colleagues, Asian workers, thousands of whom are employed as content moderators by outsourcing firms like Genpact and Cognizant, have been reporting<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-human-toll-of-protecting-the-internet-from-the-worst-of-humanity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> grueling working conditions</a> that<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/inside-the-world-of-india-s-content-mods-11584543074609.html"> expose them to a stream</a> of violent, graphic content, leaving some of them with lasting mental scars.</p>



<p>Facebook <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/08/1002894/facebook-needs-30000-of-its-own-content-moderators-says-a-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employs more than 15,000</a> content moderators globally. While the lawsuit provided relief for some moderators in the U.S., it did not address the plight of those who worked for the company abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the U.S., people can speak up for their rights,” one former content moderator, a 25-year-old man in India who requested anonymity, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “But it’s not the same here.”</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/facebook-myanmar-scale/">The trouble with scale: why not all growth is good</a></strong></p>



<p>The outsourcing boom began in India and the Philippines in the late 1980s and 1990s, when Western technology companies began offloading back-office functions like customer service or IT to countries with well-educated but considerably cheaper workforces. Today, business process outsourcing (BPO) companies employ more than 1.2 million people in the Philippines and more than <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/business/the-transformation-of-indias-bpo-industry-1776399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.1 million</a> in India. When Facebook began outsourcing its moderation efforts in the late aughts, the two countries <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-philippines-economy-20150202-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established themselves</a> as hubs for BPO, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/world/asia/29iht-letter29.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most notably</a> call center work.</p>



<p>Unlike U.S.-based moderators, for whom the job is often temporary, many Indian and Filipino moderators consider BPO work a career path unto itself. These jobs, often performed by workers who are educated and English proficient but not particularly well-off, can function as a springboard to the middle class. Without these foreign workers, Facebook would be inundated with the type of violent content that would eventually drive users and advertisers away.</p>



<p>“Given the centrality of content moderation, it’s not natural to outsource it,” says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. “It makes it somewhat problematic right from the start because the function is that important.”</p>



<p>Rahul, a 30-year-old man in Hyderabad, India, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his identity,&nbsp;joined Genpact after working in customer services at a bank for several years. The starting salary was good, close to $500 a month (now it’s closer to $200), and he found the opportunity to work on-site at Facebook alluring.</p>



<p>When Rahul arrived at the company’s Hyderabad office, he marveled at its plush couches, Ping-Pong tables, and meals catered by the best restaurants in the city. Rahul hadn’t seen anything like it before. The chance to tell his friends that he worked in Hitech City, a campus for some of the most notable international tech companies, seemed too good to pass up. “It was 60% of why I took the job,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rafael, a Filipino man who spoke to <em>Rest of World </em>on the condition that he be identified by a pseudonym to protect his identity, said that he took on content moderation work to advance his career. A former journalism student who enjoyed writing, he was happy to exercise his creativity by writing blog posts for some of his firm’s other clients, in addition to his moderation work.</p>



<p>Even when the work proved trying, he focused on the potential for professional growth. “To enrich my portfolio, I stuck with it for some time,” Rafael said. He also noted that as soon as he saw an opportunity to leave content moderation and take a new job, two years into the position, he “jumped on it.”</p>



<p>Daniel Charest, a Dallas-based attorney, represented some of the moderators in the U.S. suit. His success, he said, stemmed largely from the ability to discuss the psychological harm done by the work to his clients, who were diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety by psychological professionals, in court. But in countries like India and the Philippines, social stigmas and a lack of mental health access often stand in the way of speaking openly about psychological issues, not to mention getting diagnoses in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rafael felt comfortable and even confident moderating everything from hate speech to pornography. But it was a graphic video of a child being abused that stuck with him. After seeing the video, he began to notice a change in his own behavior that worried him. “I am not a bad person,” he told <em>Rest of World. </em>“But I’d find myself doing little diabolical things, saying things I would regret. Thinking things I didn’t want to.”</p>



<p>At the time, the company he worked for did not offer its moderators any sort of in-house counseling. So he paid for therapy, using his own money. When asked if he believed companies like Facebook should be responsible for bearing these types of costs on behalf of moderators, Rafael said he had signed a nondisclosure agreement with his current company, preventing him from answering such a question.</p>



<p>“Sometimes the despair and darkness of people will get to you, even if you say, ‘Oh, I’m a professional, I can handle that,’” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his first few weeks on the job, Rahul felt shocked by the graphic videos he encountered of car crashes and child abuse. Eventually, he grew desensitized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It gets to a point where you can eat your lunch while watching a video of someone dying. … But at the end of the day, you still have to be human.” Rahul said he didn’t see a therapist — it wouldn’t have been useful to him, he said.</p>



<p>Rahul’s experience of desensitization mirrors that of other moderators, one former counselor who worked with Genpact and requested anonymity, told <em>Rest of World</em>. When moderators finally did seek treatment — often when content would remind them of events in their personal lives — they were surprised to be affected. According to the former counselor, “They’d say, ‘I’ve been doing this for so long. Why am I feeling this now?’”</p>



<p>According to Dr. K. Jyothirmayi, a Hyderabad-based psychiatrist, stigmas, such as the perceived impact of a mental health diagnosis on one’s marital prospects, often prevent young Indians from seeking treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippines has comparatively <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/205425-duterte-signs-mental-health-law-services-philippines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive mental health legislation</a>, but barriers and stigmas persist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Issues ranging from Manila’s notorious traffic to the prohibitive costs of mental health care, may make treatment unattainable to the average Filipino BPO worker, according to Lawrence Wang, founder of MyGolana, Inc., a U.S.-based online counseling startup that works in the Philippines.</p>



<p>While Rafael had to seek private counseling, some BPO firms do offer this service in-house in the Philippines, though even that can be outsourced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mariel, who also asked that she be identified by a pseudonym because she is bound by a nondisclosure agreement, worked as a hotline counselor at a BPO company. Her clients were employees at other BPO companies, including content moderators for Facebook. Because the sessions took place over the phone, Mariel was not able to offer psychological diagnoses.</p>



<p>Over the course of her two years with the company, Mariel had several clients who began to contemplate suicide after moderating suicide-related content. Callers who expressed suicidal thoughts or tendencies were flagged to the firm handling content moderation and referred to an in-person counselor. But, she said, there were no such protocols for moderators experiencing other issues, such as anxiety, depression, or sleep deprivation, that might alert the company to brewing mental health crises.</p>

<p>“The deep seething thought will haunt you; it will creep you out,” Rafael said. “It’s impossible that it wouldn’t, because I saw it; it’s already recorded in my mind.” Rafael attributes his ability to recover from seeing the video to therapy.</p>



<p>“I feel like, if I had not consulted a specialist back then, it [the feeling of being haunted by the video] would have manifested in some form that I would have regretted later on.”</p>

<p>In India, workers’ compensation lawsuits are adjudicated through various&nbsp;laws, but the country’s legal framework does not consider mental health an occupational hazard. “Indian labor law frameworks were designed with factories in mind,” Ayush Rathi, a researcher with India’s Centre for Internet &amp; Society, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Geetha Devarajan, a labor lawyer and consultant to the Forum for IT Employees, a trade union for IT and BPO workers, said Indian content moderators might file a lawsuit under the country’s Industrial Disputes Act of 1947. But before filing a lawsuit under the act, moderators would have to be unionized and enter arbitration with their employers in order to try to reach an acceptable compromise.</p>



<p>Though labor laws in the Philippines generally state that third-party companies share responsibility for employees working for a contracting firm, <a href="https://iclg.com/practice-areas/outsourcing-laws-and-regulations/philippines">those regulations do not apply to the BPO industry</a> — which allows third-party companies that outsource work to BPO firms to avoid responsibility for the employees who do that work.&nbsp;</p>

Some standard data pre- and post-processing methods can be applied in Lens Studio. Alternatively, these methods can be baked into the model architecture.</p><p id="fbf2">Custom models are integrated using Snap’s ML Component, which defines model inputs and outputs and how the model should run (i.e. every frame, upon a particular user action, in real-time, etc.).</p><p id="cf6f">These models must be built outside of Lens Studio and imported. To help with that, <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/machine-learning/lens-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are templates available (via Jupyter Notebooks) for a number of use cases</a>: <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-recognition/?utm_campaign=snap-ml-interview&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=heartbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classification</a>, <a href="https://fritz.ai/object-detection/?utm_campaign=snap-ml-interview&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=heartbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object detection</a>, <a href="https://fritz.ai/style-transfer/?utm_campaign=snap-ml-interview&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=heartbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">style transfer</a>, <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-segmentation/?utm_campaign=snap-ml-interview&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=heartbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom segmentation</a>, and ground segmentation. You can use these as a starting point for your own custom models — especially if your use case matches one of these ML tasks.</p><p id="9de6">Perhaps most importantly, because these models can be used directly in Snapchat as Lenses, they can quickly become available to millions of users around the world.</p><p id="6834">The above functionality, combined with Snap Lenses as a promising distribution channel, presents ML teams with a number of intriguing value props:</p><ul><li id="7d84"><strong>Reduced barriers to entry</strong>: The ability to drop custom neural networks into Lens Studio, and then distribute them to Snap’s millions of users, is an exciting possibility. This means that teams have both a promising channel and a deployment target that doesn’t require developing an entire mobile application from scratch.</li><li id="d8d0"><strong>Easier experimentation</strong>: Since teams won’t have to work through a full app release cycle to see their on-device models in action, it’ll be easier to experiment with brand- and product-based Lenses powered by immersive ML features.</li><li id="26a8"><strong>Democratized on-device ML</strong>: Part of our vision at Fritz AI is to build a product that helps democratize mobile machine learning, both through the underlying technology and the tools that make it possible. In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/lens-studio-3-0-introduces-snapml-for-adding-custom-neural-networks-directly-to-snapchat-c2c32ed95b2b">our recent interview with one of SnapML’s early partners and creators</a>, Hart Woolery of 2020CV, he noted that SnapML’s potential reminds him, in some ways, of how YouTube helped democratize video creation.</li></ul></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d618">To get a sense of what it’s like to build custom experiences with SnapML in Lens Studio, I worked through a simple demo project. While I’ll cover some of the unique challenges of that project in my next blog post, I wanted to take a bit of time to provide a high-level technical overview of the new platform — what it does well, where things get tricky, and some nuances that are essential to consider when getting started.</p><h2 id="cf7f">Things SnapML Does Well</h2><p id="e2f9">First, a look at things SnapML does really well:</p><ul><li id="8c2b">One of my favorite features involves <strong>controlling <em>how</em> the model is run</strong> (e.g. every frame, when a user takes an action, in another thread). This allows degrees of control that really allow you to fine-tune the experience to fit your project requirements, while also experimenting with interactive and immersive elements.</li><li id="d5fa">You can also loop a sample video inside Lens Studio to <strong>see what your Lens does as you’re creating and editing it.</strong> I used my own images in the preview pane, as well as live camera feed. I didn’t try using my own video clip, but I imagine that works, too. This kind of real-time visualization is a nice touch and one that makes experimentation even easier.</li><li id="003f">There’s also <strong>an impressive OTA model download UX</strong>. Scan a QR code to pair your device, click a button in Lens Studio to send the model to your phone, get a notification when it downloads, and it shows up as a Lens. I love how simple this ended up being, as model delivery can be a pain, especially when you have to work through a full app update to release a new ML feature.</li><li id="ca82">As mentioned above, the under-the-hood work that Snap ML does is also a positive. There are still some lingering issues here (more on this below), but things like model conversion and pre- and post-processing help speed up project workflows significantly.</li></ul><h2 id="5af1">Areas for Improvement in SnapML</h2><ul><li id="1871"><strong>Data can be difficult. </strong>In the demo projects and notebooks provided by Snap, they’ve used COCO as their data source. Using COCO as the data source means that the category of objects you want to use for model training must be part of the COCO dataset, it requires writing code to extract the images/annotations of interest, and you have no control over the quality of the annotations. As such, working with unique or custom data is currently a bit of a pain point.</li><li id="08fc"><strong>Model training. </strong>Snap uses PyTorch to train a custom segmentation model in their example Jupyter Notebook. They recommend starting with a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/exploring-the-mobilenet-models-in-tensorflow-d9d21774cdab">MobileNet architecture</a>, but you can’t quite use the pre-packaged MobileNet model from PyTorch out-of-the-box. There’s a bit of extra code to write, in which you have to swap out layers to ensure compatibility.</li><li id="354c"><strong>Model input and output formatting. </strong>Once you have a trained model, <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/machine-learning/ml-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the SnapML docs</a> make it seem pretty easy to use that model in a lens. They have a drag-and-drop interface and tools to adjust the inputs (e.g. stretching/scaling the camera feed, applying basic pre-processing) and outputs. But in practice, this was more difficult than I’d imagined. We’ll cover why in another blog post soon.</li></ul><p id="cfb1">All-told, SnapML is an incredible leap forward for mobile machine learning, and edge AI more broadly. V1 is impressive and promising, and the areas for improvement we explored above seem more like the growing pains of any ambitious piece of software’s initial release, and less like a major roadblock.</p><p id="bc58">Up next, we’ll take a close look at some of the specific technical challenges we faced when working with custom neural networks. We will also cover topics like building inside Lens Studio, working with templates, and more.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="1d4b"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody" role="main"><p><img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-07-20-storing-time/owl-0.png"><span><label for="sn-1">⊕</label><span> The OWL database from <em>Level Five</em>. (Chris Marker, <em>Level Five</em>, film (France: Les Films de l’Astrophore, Argos Films, 1997).)</span></span></p>
<p>Chris Marker’s <em>Level Five</em><span><label for="sn-2"></label><span><em>Level Five</em> is available to <a href="https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/forms-of-memory-close-up-on-chris-marker-s-level-five">watch on Mubi</a>.</span></span> (1997) moves through a computer network as a space of memory. The film is something of a travelogue, like Joseph Brodsky’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13553406-watermark">writings on Venice</a> or Chris Markers’ own <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans_Soleil">Sans Soleil</a></em>, but it traverses records of events through virtual space. The main character explores a hierarchical database called OWL as she finishes making the fifth level of an incomplete game she inherited. The events in the game are based on the Battle of Okinawa during World War II; the film follows her exploration of this battle and the pathways of the game’s deceased originator.</p>
<p>The virtual journey draws a distinction between information and memory. In his essay, <a href="https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/forms-of-memory-close-up-on-chris-marker-s-level-five"><em>Forms of Memory: Close-Up on Chris Marker’s “Level Five”</em></a>, Benjamin Crais defines <em>memory</em> as “an orderly collection, a certain arrangement of signs, traces, and monuments” and <em>information</em> as “a matter of indifferently equivalent facts.” He suggests that <em>Level Five</em> defines a closer relationship between the two, where “personal-historical-cultural memory” is completely expressed through a database - a cornerstone of information technology.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>Benjamin Crais, “<a href="https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/forms-of-memory-close-up-on-chris-marker-s-level-five">Forms Of Memory: Close-Up On Chris Marker’S "Level Five"</a>”, MUBI, 2017. Crais’ work references Jacques Ranciere, “Documentary Fiction: Marker and the Fiction of Memory”, <em>Film Fables</em> (157).</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Increasingly, we are living in a world where cultural and personal memory are not stored in minds and transmitted through bodies, but stored in databases and transmitted through machines.</strong> Storing memory and modeling time is a hard problem, but one that demands attention.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://schmud.de/posts/2020-07-21-storing-time-1.html">part 1 of <em>Storing Time</em></a>, I looked at some of the current issues related to manipulating and modeling time. I used the popular Java Time library and demonstrated the basics in Clojure.</p>
<p>Part 2 will look at one approach for storing and manipulating time in plain text. It is a simple system for personal recording keeping. In this case, it is a record of my professional activities that can be used to generate websites, resumes, and my <a href="https://schmud.de/cv.html">curriculum vitae</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll conclude by taking a cursory look at the problems of archiving time in Unix systems. If you’re not interested in the specifics of storing and reading Java Time in Clojure/edn, please skip ahead to the last section.</p>
<h2 id="time-literals">Time Literals</h2>
<p>As stated in Part 1, I want a time format that is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Easy to write and read</strong>: add and update events in a plain text file</li>
<li><strong>Easy to format</strong>: automatically change a date’s display depending on context, calculate and display a span of time, etc…</li>
</ol>
<p>Part 1 demonstrated how Java Time can be used to format dates. I’ll expand on that later in Part 2. But first, I need to explain how working with <em>time literals</em> (rather than <em>Java Time objects</em>) will make time easy to read and write from a plain text file.</p>
<h3 id="literals">Literals</h3>
<p>Literals return themselves when evaluated.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>Literals and expressions in this section can be evaluated as <a href="https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/java-time#time-literals">a runnable notebook in Nextjournal</a>. The notebook also includes more detailed information about Java Time and Joda Time in Clojure.</span></span></p>

<li>When <code>3</code> is evaluated in Clojure, the system returns <code>3</code>.</li>
<li>When <code>"I have a dream"</code> is evaluated in Clojure, the system returns <code>"I have a dream"</code>.</li>
<li>When <code>(+ 3 7)</code> is evaluated in Clojure, the system returns <code>7</code>. <code>(+ 3 7)</code> is <em>not</em> a literal.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://clojure.org/reference/reader">Clojure literals include</a> numbers (like <code>7</code>), strings (like <code>"I have a dream"</code>), characters, <code>nil</code>, booleans, keywords, symbolic values (<code>##Inf</code> (∞), <code>##-Inf</code> (-∞), and <code>##NaN</code> (Not a Number)), collections (lists, vectors, maps, and sets), and records (<code>deftype</code> and <code>defrecord</code>).</p>
<h3 id="tagged-literals">Tagged Literals</h3>
<h4 id="example-1---uuid">Example 1 - #uuid</h4>
<p>Users can add their own custom literals to the list above with a tag. For example, Clojure version 1.4 shipped with built-in tagged literals for <code>#uuid</code><span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>A UUID is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Universally Unique IDdentifier</a>. It denotes an ID that is so rare that the chance of another computer coming up with the same identifier is nearly zero. The type is not natively supported in Clojure, but the <code>#uuid</code> tagged literal adds this functionality.</span></span> and <code>#instant</code><span><label for="sn-6"></label><span>An instant is an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html">object in Java</a> that represents a single point in time.</span></span>.</p>
<p>Evaluating the string <code>"efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"</code> prefixed with <code>#uuid</code> generates a <code>java.util.UUID</code> type:</p>
<pre><code>#uuid "efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>[java.util.UUID, "0x785d0e2f", "efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"]</code></p>
<p>Clojure reads the literal string first, <code>"efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"</code>, and then invokes the tagged literal function on the string. In this example, <code>#uuid</code> dispatches <code>java.util.UUID/fromString</code> on <code>"efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907".</code></p>
<p>The generic string is now a meaningful bit of data; <code>"efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"</code> is not the same as <code>"#uuid efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(= "efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"
   (java.util.UUID/fromString "efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"))</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>false</code></p>
<p>The two strings of characters are not equivalent because the first one is not of a UUID type. Adding <code>#uuid</code> makes it so:</p>
<pre><code>(= #uuid "efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"
   (java.util.UUID/fromString "efea38cd-0db8-4f66-b3ab-c50b4c08d907"))</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>true</code></p>
<p>Conversely, <code>#uuid</code> cannot prefix a string that is not a valid UUID:</p>
<pre><code>(try
  (java.util.UUID/fromString "not-a-uuid") ;; #uuid "not-a-uuid"
  (catch IllegalArgumentException e (.getMessage e)))</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>"Invalid UUID string: not-a-uuid"</code></p>
<p>Tagged literals are succinct and easily read by humans, making them a perfect fit for structured data. They are the <em>extensible</em> part of the <em>extensible data notation</em> (edn) I’ll be using to store time and date values.<span><label for="sn-7"></label><span>edn was covered in <a href="https://schmud.de/posts/2020-07-21-storing-time-1.html">Part 1</a>. It is a structured format for conveying values, often used where one might use JSON. More at the official <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn">edn readme</a>.</span></span></p>
<h4 id="example-2---inst-aka-joda-time">Example 2 - #inst aka Joda Time</h4>
<p>Tag a well formatted date string (i.e.&nbsp;something that looks like a date) with <code>#inst</code> to generate a <code>java.util.Date</code> object:</p>
<pre><code>(type #inst "2020-05-11")</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>java.util.Date</code></p>
<p>If the tagged literal is stored as a string, it will automatically be read as a <code>java.util.Date</code> object when read using <code>clojure.edn</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(clojure.edn/read-string "#inst \"2020-05-11\"")
</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>#inst "2020-05-11T00:00:00.000Z"</code><span><label for="sn-8"></label><span>Two notes on this result. First, <code>T00:00:00.000Z</code> is the timestamp for this date, automatically added by the system. Second, the string that generated this result, <code>"#inst \"2020-05-11\""</code>, uses the backslash (<code>\</code>) to differentiate the quotes that are part of the string from those which denote the string itself. This is known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character">escape character</a>.</span></span></p>
<p>It is now possible to operate on the date and time information: add days, find the difference between two dates, display the day of the week, display the year, etc….</p>
<pre><code>(import '(java.text SimpleDateFormat))

;; Grab the year
(-&gt;&gt; (prn-str #inst "2020-05-11")
     (clojure.edn/read-string)
     (.format (SimpleDateFormat. "yyyy")))</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>"2020"</code></p>
<p><strong>But there is a big problem!</strong> I don’t want to work with <code>java.util.Date</code>, Java’s legacy date type. Joda Time’s <a href="https://www.joda.org/joda-time/">official site</a> suggests that people use Java Time.<span><label for="sn-9"></label><span>“Joda-Time is the de facto standard date and time library for Java prior to Java SE 8. Users are now asked to migrate to java.time (JSR-310).” (“<a href="https://www.joda.org/joda-time/">Joda-Time - Home</a>”, <em>joda.org</em>, 2020.)</span></span> So rather than working with built-in <code>#inst</code> tags, the rest of this demonstration will use <code>#time/date</code> tags as part of <code>cljc.java-time</code> - an excellent library for working with Java Time in Clojure.</p>
<h3 id="time-literals-1"><a href="https://github.com/henryw374/time-literals">time-literals</a></h3>
<p>Here’s how <code>cljc.java-time</code> was used in Part 1:</p>
<pre><code>(require '[cljc.java-time.local-date :as ld])

(ld/now)</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>[java.time.LocalDate, "0x61da6671", "2020-07-12"]</code></p>
<p>With <code>time-literals</code>, I can prefix <code>#time/date</code> to my string and work with it as a Java Time <code>LocalDate</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(require '[time-literals.read-write :as time-read])

(def time-date-string (time-read/print-date "2015-12-11"))
time-date-string</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>"#time/date "2015-12-11""</code></p>
<p>Using the <code>edn/read-string</code> function with the <code>#time/date</code> tag is almost identical to using it with <code>#inst</code>. Only now I must supply <code>clojure.edn/read-string</code> with a reader that can interpret the custom <code>#time/date</code> literal: <code>{:readers time-read-prn/tags}</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(clojure.edn/read-string {:readers time-read/tags} time-date-string)</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>[java.time.LocalDate, "0x3d6a5fc1", "2015-12-11"]</code></p>
<p>Now it’s possible to read a string, <code>"2015-12-11"</code>, add 90 days, format the date, and generate the result, <code>March 10, 2016</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(require '[cljc.java-time.format.date-time-formatter :as formatter])

(-&gt; (clojure.edn/read-string {:readers time-read/tags} time-date-string)
    (ld/plus-days 90)
    (ld/format  (formatter/of-pattern "MMMM dd, yyyy")))</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>"March 10, 2016"</code></p>
<p>Displaying the year from any tagged literal date is simple:</p>
<pre><code>(-&gt;&gt; "#time/date \"2011-01-01\""
     (clojure.edn/read-string {:readers time-read/tags})
     (ld/get-year))</code></pre>
<p>⇒ <code>2011</code></p>
<h2 id="curriculum-vitae">Curriculum Vitae</h2>
<p>Now to apply this time/date software to solve my original problem: recording events in my professional life in a way that is 1. easy to write and read and 2. easy to format programmatically.</p>
<p>Peruse any of the <code>.edn</code> files <a href="https://github.com/schmudde/blog/tree/master/src/site">in my repository</a> to see how my professional data is structured. Here are two examples:</p>
<p>A public speaking engagement:</p>
<pre><code>{:org "Curry On"
 :geo "London, UK"
 :date #time/date "2019-07-15"
 :title "Say What You Mean"
 :subtitle "Exploring Declarative Computation in Art"
 :link "https://www.curry-on.org/2019/sessions/say-what-you-mean-exploring-declarative-computation-in-art.html"
 ...}</code></pre>
<p>An employer:</p>
<pre><code>{:org "Stevens Institute of Technology"
:title "Adjunct Professor"
:desc "College of Arts and Letters"
:geo "Hoboken, NJ, US"
:date-bgn #time/year-month "2017-01"
:date-end #time/year-month "2019-05"
...}</code></pre>
<p>Take note of the dates. They are easy to read and consistent. I’m interested in the specific day I gave a talk and the span of time I worked at an institution. Adding a time to my presentation or a day to my employment would be trivial if I had that information.</p>
<p>The extensible <code>.edn</code> reader makes it easy to ingest this data and format it programmatically for any destination. Look at <a href="https://schmud.de/cv.html">my CV</a> and see the various ways dates are …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article"><p>Today it's almost obvious to state that good written communication creates a business advantage.</p>
<p>I've probably read more articles on written communication in the workplace in the last two months than over the last 10 years. </p>
<p>Most of these essays gave tips on how to become better writers.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but notice that many (if not all) of them questioned the same thing: the prose.</p>
<p>Everyone advised to keep sentences short and to the point, use active voice and not passive&nbsp;voice, use fewer commas and more periods, avoid acronyms, etc.</p>
<p>Let's be clear: none of these are mistaken or wrong by any means. But this made me realize how huge the misconceptions are on what good business writing actually means.</p>
<p>In fact, what separates most people from good writing has very little to do with style, grammar, local sentences structure, word selection, or even content per se.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people can't write well because they don't know how to control the logical sequence in which they present their ideas.</p>
<p>And that is the single most important act necessary to clear writing.</p>
<p>In this essay we're going to dig into how you can effectively share written ideas in a way that value time and effort for others.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="understanding-how-we-think"><a href="#understanding-how-we-think" aria-label="understanding how we think permalink"></a>Understanding How We Think</h2>
<p>Writing an idea is always the result of two macro-steps. First, decide the point that we want want to make, and then put into words.</p>
<p>To understand how we can effectively share written ideas, we need to understand first how we formulate them in the first place.</p>
<p>Deciding the point you want to make is the result of a 5-step process.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unbundling</em> a concept</li>
<li><em>Noticing</em> something</li>
<li><em>Articulating</em>/<em>Developing</em> an idea</li>
<li><em>Re-Bundling</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Reframing</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/generate-idea-thinking-process.png" alt="State diagram to share the 5-step process one use to generate an idea."></p>
<h3 id="unbundling-a-concept"><a href="#unbundling-a-concept" aria-label="unbundling a concept permalink"></a>Unbundling A Concept</h3>
<p>Every idea begins with an unbundling process. Unbundling is an act of exploration that leads to the decoupling of all the individual items of a certain subject.</p>
<p>Unbundling something doesn't imply a deep understanding of it. It's more a perception of full awareness.</p>
<p>In fact, you might not even know how every individual piece works, but you know they all exist in separate forms. No hidden parts.</p>
<h3 id="noticing-something"><a href="#noticing-something" aria-label="noticing something permalink"></a>Noticing Something</h3>
<p>Unbundling enhances our ability to observe, and this can lead us to noticing something. This can be a pattern, an insight, a novelty, or even a minor detail.</p>
<p>If <em>unbundling</em> is the flint, <em>noticing</em> is the spark that really makes the fire.</p>
<h3 id="articulatingdeveloping-an-idea"><a href="#articulatingdeveloping-an-idea" aria-label="articulatingdeveloping an idea permalink"></a>Articulating/Developing An Idea</h3>
<p>Only when we notice something can we start developing an idea. That's where the creative part begins. That's where you try to develop your initial cue into a fully formed idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if you noticed that something was unnecessary or too complicated, you might run a simplification process. If you noticed something was missing, you go through an addition or reinforcement process.</p>
<h3 id="re-bundling-and-reframing"><a href="#re-bundling-and-reframing" aria-label="re bundling and reframing permalink"></a>Re-bundling And Reframing</h3>
<p>Once you finish including your idea, you go through re-bundling. This is a reconstruction process. This is where you try to recompose a world that now contemplates your newly inserted idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bundling is a fundamental part because it's where you can verify if the your new world still holds up. If not, that's a signal you need to put more work in the articulation phase or what you noticed didn't lead to anything meaningful at all.</p>
<p>If at the end of the re-bundling process your world does hold up, you go through a reframing process.</p>
<p>On paper, this seems to be a very logical and clear process, but in reality it's much more complicated as you constantly repeat these steps of of unbundling, editing your idea, and re-bundling until you find a viable path.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/generate-idea-complexity.png" alt="The complex process of idea generation"></p>
<p>Now that you have an idea, you need to decide how to put it into words that you can share with others.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-how-we-write"><a href="#understanding-how-we-write" aria-label="understanding how we write permalink"></a>Understanding How We Write</h2>
<p>From a broader point, the single goal of writing is to get some information into someone's head.</p>
<p>Think about it. It's almost a simulation act.</p>
<p>You need to reproduce your reader's thinking process using your brain. And know how to build up your information in a way that feels logical and makes sense to them.</p>
<p>This process has very little to do with what you went through when you came up with the idea in the first place. In fact, forcing the reader through the exact same original path you took will have the opposite effect and create more confusion.</p>
<p>Here's how it often goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have an idea <em>x</em></li>
<li>You write down a set of words <em>m</em> that lead you to <em>x</em></li>
<li>Because of the pre-existing narrative that led you to the idea, you associate <em>m -&gt; x</em></li>
<li>When you proofread it, you mentally get it. Not because <em>m -&gt; x</em> but because of all the pre-existing associations.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how most people write. And it's exactly why most people's writing sucks.</p>
<p>Not because they use too many passive forms or weak verbs (that doesn't help either), but because they aren't able to write from the reader's perspective. Most writings lacks the basic logical order and structure.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-good-business-writing"><a href="#what-is-good-business-writing" aria-label="what is good business writing permalink"></a>What is Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Good business writing is a combination of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information Context</li>
<li>Information Resolution</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework"><a href="#how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework" aria-label="how to build context the scqa framework permalink"></a>How to build Context: The SCQA Framework</h3>
<p>Context is the "<em>you're here</em>" red arrow that you can see on almost any maps. Good information context helps the reader set the frame to understand what they're about to read next.</p>
<p>Shared context helps the participants make judgments calls using the same pair of lenses.</p>
<p>A lack of a shared understanding on the basic principles can easily result in a partial understanding or conflict on what follows.</p>
<p>What's the best way to build information context?</p>
<p>Barbara Minto, a McKinsey consultant in the 70s, solved this problem with what she called the <em>SCQA framework</em>.</p>
<p>She named this framework the <em>Situation — Complication — Question — Answer</em> framework. You can unpack more on this topic in her book “The Pyramid Principle”.</p>
<p>According to Minto, context is the result of these four sub-ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Situation,</li>
<li>A Complication,</li>
<li>A Question,</li>
<li>... and an Answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Situation</strong> is a non-controversial statement on a subject that you know the reader will agree because it's something he already knows. By summarizing what he already knows, the situation establishes the relevance of the questions that your document is going to answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Complication</strong> describes an alteration of a stable situation. Keep in mind, this alteration is purely fact-based. The Situation-Complication combination should lead the reader to an immediate question.</p>
<p>The <strong>Question</strong> represents an intuitive response to the complication. The best Situation-Complication scenario makes the question sound totally superfluous to state. The best questions aren't posed, they emerge.</p>
<p>The <strong>Answer</strong> is the summary of your main idea. Beware, it's the solution, not the explanation of it. Good answers are typically represented by 3/4 bullet points. No more.</p>
<p>If you squint at it, you realise that the SCQA framework turned out initial schema upside down.</p>
<p>Ideas comes up in a bottom-up fashion, but they need to be told top-down.</p>
<p>This is not how we think. But it's how we should write.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/scqa-reversed-thinking-frmework.png" alt="SCQA reversed thinking framework"></p>
<p>Another interesting benefit of building information context using the SCQA framework is that once you've gotten the initial part out of the way, you can focus all your energy on making and supporting the case for why it's true.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues"><a href="#how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues" aria-label="how to increase resolution whyhow dialogues permalink"></a>How to increase Resolution: Why/How Dialogues</h3>
<p>Ensuring you and your reader are in the same place before you lead him through your thinking is a necessary but non-sufficient condition. </p>
<p>Once he's aware of the gist of your main idea (Answer), you need to argue and support it. That's when you need to focus on information resolution.</p>
<p>Think of <em>information resolution</em> as the density level of details that you're able to provide to the reader. The bolder the answer, the higher resolution levels it requires.</p>
<p>If you gloss over key important passages, people will not follow your thinking and might have a partial understanding of the message.</p>
<p>How do you increase information resolution?</p>
<p>You support your initial <em>Answer</em> using the form of Why/How dialogues. Making an initial statement that the reader doesn't know will automatically raise a logical question in his mind. <em>How is that possible?</em> <em>Why do you say that?</em> In your following answers, you're likely to tell him other details he doesn't know and this will raise further questions that you're going to answer. And so on.</p>
<p>The author will continue to write, raising and answering questions, until he reaches a point at which he judges the reader will have no more logical questions.</p>
<p>The vertical relationship of a why/how dialogue helps capture the reader's attention. It permits you, as an author, to establish an inner dialog that will pull him with great interest through your reasoning. The reader will be forced to respond logically to your ideas.</p>
<p>As you can see we've not made a full circle. We're now in the (previously discussed) unbundling part.</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-good-business-writing"><a href="#examples-of-good-business-writing" aria-label="examples of good business writing permalink"></a>Examples of Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Armed with our SCQA framework and the Why/How vertical development, let's look at the skeleton of some real examples.</p>

<p>It's one of the most common examples. common examples. A salesperson, after speaking with a customers, irrupts in the #product or #engineering Slack channels requesting the implementation of a given feature.</p>
<p>If you've been in this position, here's how you can Minto-ize an internal feature request for your product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>
We have never allowed customers to customize XYZ in order to keep complexity low.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
However, competitor X has now shipped such a customization feature, and we’ve been losing deals because of that.</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em>
We now need to decide whether we want to allow some kind of customization as well.</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Directives are the most common internal memo. Executives write them to request something of someone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>&nbsp;
As you know we're repositioning product <em>x</em> for mid-sized enterprise. We need to teach you how to see <em>x</em> for organizations between 100 and 200 employees.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
We've never sold to this type of customer before. Hence, we need to construct a new customer profile from scratch</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em> (How can we do the profile?)</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
We're going to host:</p>

<p>
For the most part, computing libraries such as  <a href="https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org/">Neanderthal</a> ()
abstract the complexity of GPU computing. When you have high-level linear algebra operations,
such as <code>mm!</code> (matrix multiply), <code>nrm2</code> (vector/matrix norm), or <code>sum</code>, you do not have to
worry about compiling kernels, loading modules, sending operations to the right stream in
the right context, handling stream execution errors, and a bunch of other details.
The code we write and test on the CPU can be executed on the GPU!
</p>

<p>
However, there is one <i>important</i> thing we have to keep in mind: GPU computing
routines are asynchronous by default! Most of the time we see the benefits of
such behavior, but in some common situations, it can surprise even
an experienced developer (yes, humans are fallible).
</p>

<p>
Suppose we have some code that uses a costly matrix multiplication operation.
</p>

</pre>
</div>

<pre>"Elapsed time: 1.153745 msecs"
</pre>

<p>
We called the <code>mm!</code> operation 100 times in a loop and measured the execution time.
A bit over 1 millisecond in total, or 10 microseconds per operation.
</p>

<p>
We decided that, although it is quite fast, it's not fast enough for our
customer's requirements. There's an opportunity to use powerful GPU accelerators,
and we read in their specs that they can achieve quite a performance boost over Intel CPUs.
Since we do not have to adjust the code to run on the GPU (that is, not that much),
we quickly write a few tests to see whether the platform switch is worth the effort.
</p>

<p>
The following code is a port of the previous example to the Nvidia GPU.
It is a bit different since GPU context has to be created and managed.
It is possible to further abstract these differences away, but I wanted to keep this
example straightforward and obvious.

<p>
With the same size and computation complexity, we got a modest speedup.
What is the problem? We expected a boost! We ask around, and see that communication
with the GPU driver carries a fixed overhead. GPU pays off with more expensive operations.

<p>
OK, then; let's give it some monster matrices.

Whow, we increased matrix sizes by a lot, and the GPU didn't even sweat.

<p>
We excitedly tell everyone decide to transfer all computations to the GPU,
since what took days to complete on the CPU, will complete in seconds according
to our calculations.
</p>

<p>
A skeptical colleague is not so sure!
</p>

<p>
We are reminded that (many) GPU operations are <i>asynchronous</i>.
</p>

<p>
Our <code>mm!</code> operation does have the same signature on GPU and CPU, but while on the
CPU it's synchronous, on the GPU is <i>asynchronous</i>. Simply put, on the GPU, calling
<code>mm!</code> means "I acknowledge that I received your request for matrix multiplication and I have
put it in the computation queue", and not "I have completed the matrix multiplication that you've
requested", as it means on the CPU.
</p>

<p>
When we measured it in the last example, we just measured how fast the GPU
can receive the requests for the <code>mm!</code> operation. Not surprisingly, the size of the
arguments does not make much difference there.
</p>

<p>
To measure how fast the GPU can <i>complete</i> the operation, we must synchronize
the queue.

</pre>

<p>
Ouch! Instead of 2 microseconds for 100 invocations, we get 17 <i>seconds</i>.
That's 171 <i>milli</i> seconds per operation, not 20 <i>micro</i> seconds. Disappointed? We should not be!
It's almost 40 times faster than the 6.5 seconds we measured on the CPU.
For large matrices, it usually does make sense to use GPU; for medium sized it depends.
</p>

<p>
If we only work with small-ish data, it never pays off to use GPU. Never? Well,
that depends, too. We can <i>group</i> small chunks into larger units that can be
computed in batches, but that is out of scope of this article.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, suppose that we have decided that it pays off to add GPU engine to our project.
The code is similar, but there are enough differences. This call to <code>synchronize!</code> bothers
us, since it is CUDA-specific.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, most of the time we do not need to synchronize streams,
and even when we do have to, we do not have to do it explicitly.
There are operations available on both CPU and GPU, that <i>implicitly</i> synchronize the stream.
</p>

<p>
For example, summary matrix and vector operations such as <code>sum</code>, <code>nrm2</code>, <code>dot</code>,
etc, which compute a scalar result, implicitly synchronize the stream.
The operations that transfer data between CPU and GPU are synchronous by default, too.

<p>I try to consolidate my MLSS 2020 notes in small blog posts and hope you might also find them interesting. I don’t try to cover the complete lectures but rather pick some pieces that I find important when working or doing research in ML. I anticipate this series of blog posts will range from extremely superficial to excessively detailed for some readers.</p>

<p>I will start with Bernhard Schölkopf’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmJtThWmhA">lecture</a> on Causality (the second part by Stefan Bauer can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DJWJpn0DmU">here</a>) and draw some connections to Moritz Hardt’s presentations (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igq_S_7IfOU">1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oNVFQ9llPc">2</a>) on fairness. I also recommend taking a look at Bernhard’s very accessible <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10500.pdf">monograph</a>.</p>

<h3 id="independence-of-events-and-random-variables">Independence of Events and Random Variables</h3>

<p>Before we start, we define some basic notions. The first one is the statistical <strong>independence of events</strong>. Let’s consider the events “rainy day” $R$ and “choosing Cini Minis as breakfast cereal” $C$ together with their respective probabilities $Pr(\cdot)$. If rain does not influence your cereal choice, and you can’t change the weather by eating Cini Minis, we say the events are <em>independent</em>, and the following equality holds:
$$
Pr(R \cap C) = Pr(R) \cdot Pr(C).
$$
Similarly, we can define the <strong>independence of continuous random variables</strong> $X$ and $Y$. We write
$$
X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y
$$
for independent variables if for their probability density functions $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$ it holds that
$$
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)
$$
for all $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>For the next concept, we introduce a third random variable $Z$ on which we can condition $X$ and $Y$. If $X$ and $Y$ and <strong>conditionally independent</strong> given $Z$, we write
$$
(X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y) | Z,
$$
and for the joint probability density conditioned on $Z$, it holds that $f_{XY|Z}(x,y|z)=f_X(x|z)f_Y(y|z)$ for all $x$,$y$, and
$z$ such that $f_Z(z)&gt;0$. This simply translates to the fact that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if I know $Z$, knowing $X$ does not tell me anything additional about $Y$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is this relevant for causality? The notion of whether or not two random variables are dependent or independent is essential to understand the underlying phenomena that govern this relationship. For example, if we consider the classic example of observing increased stork activity ($X$) and increased birth rate ($Y$), $X$ and $Y$ can depend on each other in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>$X \rightarrow Y$: storks bring babies, or</li>
<li>$Y \rightarrow X$: babies attract storks.</li>
</ol>

<p>If we believe that both causal relationships are nonsensical, there must be a third factor that influences both observations simultaneously, $X$ and $Y$ have a <strong>common cause</strong> $Z$:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$.</p>

<p>The fact that there is an underlying mechanism ($Z$) that explains the observed dependence is also known as the <strong>common cause principle</strong> [<a href="#reichenbach_1956">1</a>]. Importantly, we cannot determine which of the three relationships is the “truth” given observational data alone.</p>

<h3 id="structural-causal-model">Structural Causal Model</h3>

<p>One approach to model such relationships/dependencies is <strong>structural causal models (SCM)</strong> [<a href="#pearl_2009">2</a>], realized as directed acyclic graph (DAG) as shown below. <em>Directed</em> because we have arrows in one direction, rather than “simple” edges. <em>Acyclic</em> because there are no self-references. Vertices are <em>observables</em> (see <a href="#ontol_insta">further down</a> for an analysis of the meaning of vertices with respect to fairness in AI), and arrows represent <em>direct causation</em>.
</p><p><img src="https://christian.bock.ml/SCM.png" alt="drawing" width="50%">
</p>

<p><span><i>Figure 1:</i> Example of a structural causal model with noise variable $U$.</span>
</p>

<p>In the above graph, we say that an observable $X$, modeled as a random variable, is a function<sup><a href="#fn_func">1</a></sup> of its parents $PA$ and exogenic or noise variables $U$:
$$
X_j = f_j(PA_j, U_j), \qquad (j=1, \dots, n).
$$</p>

<p>Importantly, all noise variables $U$ are stochastic and <strong>jointly independent</strong>, which leads to the insight that the functional viewpoint $f_j(PA_j, U_j)$ can represent the general conditional distribution $p(X_j|PA_j)$. If the $U$s were not independent, there has to be another mechanism (which we called $Z$ in the stork example) that causes their dependence, and hence we’d have to add it in the diagram. But since this is not the case, the graph contains all potential factors, and we call it <strong>causally sufficient</strong>.</p>

<p>The functional representation of a node can expressed purely by the noise factors by recursively substituting the parent equations:
$$
X_j = f_j(PA_j, U_j) = f_j(f_k(PA_k, U_k), U_j) = f_j(f_k(f_l(PA_l, U_j), U_k), U_j) = \dots = g_j(U_1, \dots, U_n)
$$
Each $X_j$ is therefore a random variable and we get a joint distribution of $p(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ which we call the <em>observational distribution</em>.</p>

<h4 id="disentangled-factorization-graphical-causal-inference">Disentangled Factorization &amp; Graphical Causal Inference</h4>

<p>If a structural causal model (e.g., a graph $G$ as shown in Figure 1) exists, there exists a factorization of the observational distribution:
$$
p(X_1, \dots, X_n) = \prod_ip(X_i, PA_i).
$$
We call each $p(X_i, PA_i)$ a <em>causal conditional</em> or <em>causal Markov kernel</em>. Note that only conditionals that are exclusively conditioned on their parents are <em>causal</em>; they are statistically independent of non-descendants given the parents (this is the <strong>local causal Markov condition</strong>). We call this factorization <strong>disentangled/causal</strong> if 1. knowing a mechanism $p(X_i,PA_i)$ does not yield any information about another mechanism $p(X_j,PA_j)$ for $i \neq j$, and 2. changing one $p(X_i,PA_i)$ does not change $p(X_j,PA_j)$ for $i \neq j$.</p>

<p>Changing $X_j$, for example by setting it to a constant $X_j=const$, is also called <strong>intervention</strong>. Interventions are key operators in Pearl’s <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causal-models/do-calculus.html">do-calculus</a>, which I will not address here, but this blog post should help you understand the concept.</p>

<p><strong>Graphical Causal Inference</strong>
They key question is now: How can we recover the graph $G$ of an SCM from the observational distribution $p$ (a.k.a the data)? The answer sounds quite simple: We perform conditional independence testing by tracking how the noise information “spreads through the data”. To make a statement about the existence of a causal graph $G$ when we only see data, we have to assume that seeing data is enough to actually make a statement about $G$. This sounds tautological but is called <strong>faithfulness</strong> and can be formalized by writing</p>

<p>$$
(X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y | Z)_p \Rightarrow (X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y | Z)_G.
$$
This means that from <em>observed</em> conditional independence, we can <em>deduce</em> the causal relationship of these variables. This, however, is hard to justify for finite data, and we need to make assumptions on the function classes $f_{\bullet}$ (see chapter 6 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10500.pdf">Causality for Machine Learning</a> for details).</p>

<p>That’s all I wanted to say about this topic. As I said, it is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully provides the lingo that helps to understand some of the basic concepts of causality.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-ontol-insta-parallel-to-fairness-in-ai-ontological-instability-of-causal-vertices-observables-span"><span id="ontol_insta"> Parallel to Fairness in AI: Ontological instability of causal vertices/observables </span></h3>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=adnTgaAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Moritz Hardt</a> argued that we have to ask the fundamental question of what a node in a causal graph actually references. What is the ontological entity? He motivated this line of thought by considering the situation in which the job application of a person dressed like a hipster was rejected. There are now two positions we can take:</p>

<ol>
<li>He was rejected because he is a hipster (being a hipster caused the rejection), and</li>
<li>He was rejected because he did not meet the dress code (his clothing caused the rejection).</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first position, there is a <strong>mediator</strong> that conveyed that this person is a hipster (e.g., his clothes), which influenced the decision (left graph in Fig. 2). The second view stresses that being assigned the “hipster” label can be influenced by <strong>confounders</strong> such as clothing (right graph in Fig. 2).</p>

<p><img src="https://christian.bock.ml/hipster_SCM.png" alt="drawing" width="50%">
</p>

<p><span><i>Figure 2:</i> Two possible causal graphs generated by two ontological views.</span>
</p>

<p>The problem that clothing can be seen as either a mediator or a confounder, depending on the ontology that fits your world view best, is pointed out by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bAipNH8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Judea Pearl</a> himself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you surely know by now, mistaking a mediator for a confounder is one of the deadliest sins in causal inference and may lead to the most outrageous error. The latter invites adjustment; the former forbids it. [<a href="#pearl_2018">4</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the bigger question is: why can “hipster” even be a node in the first place? What does it reference, and what are its “settings”?
In a more serious, but analogous situation (“she was rejected because of her religion”) we can take the same two views: Education acts as mediator for religion, and both influence the decision, or education is a confounder that determines religion (see <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/eb/r30.pdf">Fairness in Decision-Making - The Causal Explanation Formula</a>). According to Hardt, these competing models are manifestations of the suppressed question of what the “religion” node references in the first place. A similar problem arises from putting “race” in a causal model: <a href="https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190610173.001.0001/oso-9780190610173#:~:text=is%20no%20...-,What%20is%20race%3F,the%20biological%20and%20social%20sciences.">What is race?</a></p>

<p>In my opinion, Linux is the best operating system for a software engineer, except they develop explicitly for Windows or macOS. Whenever I read about new features for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>, I wonder why people settle for anything less than the real thing. Linux aids many of my workflows with its customizability, the superior command-line experience, native support for containerization platforms, a dependable package management system, and many other features that I will describe in this blog post. MacOS comes close, but, in my opinion, falls short due to <a href="https://junkee.com/apple-monitor-stand-1000/208437">exorbitant hardware costs</a> and less room for customization.</p>
<p>Still, as with any other operating system, optimizing a Linux workstation for software development requires some configuration. In this post, I will present tools and concepts that I think are very helpful, but overlooked by many. I will try to show only things that are not specific to my workflows, but rather useful for almost any software engineer, DevOps specialist, or just regular productivity enthusiast. Naturally, many of the configuration options and tools covered in this post are subjective. Nevertheless, I am confident that my suggestions are a good place to start. They have served me well over the years and I continually try to optimize my setup. Hence, I very much appreciate any improvement you might suggest.</p>

<p><strong>A Linux machine</strong><br>
For this guide, I will use Ubuntu 20.04, which is the current LTS release. I am quite satisfied with Ubuntu. Anything I don’t like can easily be changed. The biggest advantage over many other distributions is probably that the Ubuntu community is very large and it is usually easy to find people with similar problems. There is also a very active <a href="https://askubuntu.com/">StackExchange community</a>. However, most of the things covered in this post will apply to pretty much any Linux distribution and even MacOS.</p>
<p><strong>Some command-line experience</strong><br>
Much of this post is intended for people who feel right at home when they see a <code>~</code>- character. If you are not comfortable working with command-lines and have no intention to change this, you can still read the other sections though.</p>

<p>Before we start any serious work, I will point out some changes to Ubuntu itself that I apply on all my machines.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>One of the first things I do after installing Ubuntu is to install the <em>GNOME Tweak Tool</em>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
</code></pre></div><p>It enables complex modifications of the GNOME desktop environment. I recommend you play around with some of its options. For this guide, we will only consider the <em>Appearance</em> section. Specifically, we want to change the default Ubuntu theme to another one that provides better contrasts and an overall cleaner experience, namely the <a href="https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme">Adapta-gtk-theme</a>, which is based on the Material Design guidelines.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">sudo apt-get install adapta-gtk-theme
</code></pre></div><p>After installing the theme, you should restart the <em>GNOME Tweak Tool</em>, and you can then select <em>Adapta-Eta</em> as your new theme. The theme comes with some nice benefits that you wouldn’t think of at first. For example, it fixes the ridiculously small toolbar icons in the Eclipse IDE.</p>
<figure>

<p>Adapta Theme elements (<a href="https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme">Source</a>).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unfortunately, the Adapta theme is no longer actively maintained. It is still a perfectly fine theme to use and if you notice any glitches, you can always switch themes with a couple clicks. A possible alternative is <a href="https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme">Materia</a>, which also works well with the remainder of this blog post.</p>
<h2 id="nautilus-type-ahead-search">Nautilus Type-Ahead Search</h2>
<p>The next thing I suggest is to change the Nautilus search behavior. With recent Ubuntu distributions, there is no type-ahead search in the standard file explorer. This means you can not start to type some letters and jump between files that start with these letters. Instead, Nautilus will enter a dedicated search mode that is confusing and quite slow for folders with a large amount of files.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can easily get the old behavior back:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lubomir-brindza/nautilus-typeahead
sudo apt dist-upgrade
killall nautilus <span># to force a restart</span>
</code></pre></div><figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/5/type-ahead-search.gif" alt="Searching through my /bin folder by typing ahead (Source)."> <figcaption>
<p>Searching through my <code>/bin</code> folder by typing ahead (<a href="https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme">Source</a>).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/278553/188679">StackExchange answer</a> that provides further details.</p>
<h2 id="hibernation">Hibernation</h2>
<p>Another thing that is essential for me is hibernation. Usually, I will only shutdown my computer once a week or even less. However, I am not a big fan of suspending for long periods of time. Power outages could have unforeseen consequences and I simply feel a little better if my machines are off the grid altogether.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, setting up hibernation is tricky and can depend on your hardware. I updated this section multiple times already to contain the most robust solution, but you never quite know.
If you don’t care about hibernation, you should probably skip this section and spare yourself the trouble.</p>
<p>In principle, hibernation is possible out of the box. Just type <code>sudo systemctl hibernate</code>. However, this is likely to fail with an error. My fix for this relies on a mixture of <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-20-04/#creating-a-swap-file">this</a> and <a href="https://rephlex.de/blog/2019/12/27/how-to-hibernate-and-resume-from-swap-file-in-ubuntu-20-04-using-full-disk-encryption/">that</a> blog post. First, we need to find out the current size of our swap file:</p>
<p>The below instructions asume that you use Ubuntu 20.04 with a swap file. This is the default for new installations. However, if you upgraded from a previous version, you might still have a swap partition. In this case, the process is similar, but not covered here.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">sudo swapon --show <span># or `cat /proc/swaps`</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If this is less than your main memory (RAM), you will need to increase it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">sudo swapoff -a
sudo fallocate -l &lt;SIZE&gt;G /swapfile
sudo chmod <span>600</span> /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
sudo swapon --show <span># to verify changed size</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to find out the UUID and offset of our now large enough swapfile:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">sudo swap-offset /swapfile
&gt; &lt;OFFSET&gt;
sudo findmnt -no SOURCE,UUID -T /swapfile 
&gt; &lt;UUID&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>With this, we are almost done. Using the UUID and the file offset, we edit the following line in <code>/etc/default/grub</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>`</span><span>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</span><span>=</span><span>"quiet splash resume=UUID=&lt;UUID&gt; resume_offset=&lt;OFFSET&gt;"</span><span>`</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then, we create a <code>conf.d</code> resume file. Simply do <code>sudo nano /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume</code> and add the content <code>RESUME=UUID=&lt;UUID&gt;</code> to the file. At last, we need to update grup and initramfs:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">sudo update-grub
sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
</code></pre></div><p>And finally, you should be able to do <code>sudo systemctl hibernate</code>.</p>
<p>Please let me know if this approach doesn’t work on your system. I would like to include potential problems in this post, if there are any.</p>

<p>I believe that command-line proficiency can significantly boost developer productivity. This is especially true in times of DevOps and NoOps, where developers are supposed to handle deployment pipelines and cloud infrastructure. Fortunately, there are some tools that can help you become a command-line wizard.</p>
<h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Before going forward, I would suggest to set up some general terminal shortcuts. Simply go to <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Shortcuts</em>. I like to replicate web browser shortcuts for opening new tabs and windows, closing tabs, and cycling between tabs.</p>
<p>Did you know that all common terminal emulators have an Undo shortcuts with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>?
Among many other things, my side-project <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> has a public <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/136">collection of terminal shortcuts</a>, many of which are barely known and still very useful.</p>
<p>However, using this interface, it is not possible to set up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> as tab switching shortcuts. Gnome has some issues with using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key in shortcut configurations. Thanks to <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/875482/188679">this answer from the Ubuntu community</a>, we can get around this. Simply execute the following in your terminal:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">gsettings <span>set</span> org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Keybindings:/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/keybindings/ next-tab <span>'&lt;Primary&gt;Tab'</span>
gsettings <span>set</span> org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Keybindings:/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/keybindings/ prev-tab <span>'&lt;Primary&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;Tab'</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="switching-from-bash-to-zsh">Switching from Bash to Zsh</h2>
<p>A couple of months ago, I made an important change in my life. I switched from Bash to Zsh.</p>
<p>There are a lot of blog posts, threads, and articles that compare Bash and Zsh, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/362409/what-is-zsh-and-why-should-you-use-it-instead-of-Bash/">What is ZSH, and Why Should You Use It Instead of Bash?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stackabuse.com/zsh-vs-bash/">Zsh vs Bash</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/wearetheledger/oh-my-zsh-made-for-cli-lovers-installation-guide-3131ca5491fb">Oh-My-Zsh! A Work of CLI Magic — Tutorial for Ubuntu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end it boils down to one thing: <strong>Plugin and theme support</strong></p>
<p>Zsh has an amazing themes and plugins ecosystem. Theme support allows to easily get a beautiful shell. Plugins range from simple auto-completion for all kinds of applications and tools(git, mvn, hugo, …) to complex stuff like improved search capabilities. Because of this fact alone, Zsh is superior to Bash.</p>
<p>However, chances are that you grew fond of Bash and that you get a bad feeling when somebody tells you that there is something better. I understand, it was the same for me. Still, I urge you to give it a shot. The transition is very painless since pretty much everything you like about Bash still works with Zsh. You will not have to learn new commands.</p>
<h3 id="installing-zsh">Installing Zsh</h3>
<p>Installing Zsh on Ubuntu is very easy. We can use the regular package manager:</p>
<p>Then, we set Zsh as our new default shell:</p>

<p>The <code>chsh</code> command updates the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, but does not affect the current session. You need to log out and log in again to have zsh as your default shell.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-zsh-history">Configuring Zsh History</h3>
<p>For me there are few things worse than searching for an old shell command only to find out that the shell’s history size was set to a ridiculously low default number and that, because of this, the command was not saved.</p>
<p>Therefore, we extend the Zsh history size by putting this at the end of the <code>~/.zshrc</code> configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>HISTSIZE</span><span>=</span><span>10000000</span>
<span>SAVEHIST</span><span>=</span><span>10000000</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For me, the command history is a tool to search for previous commands I might need now. I do not use it as a protocol for what I did when and in which exact order. Therefore, I use the following options to get rid of all duplicates in my history automatically:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>## History command configuration</span>
    
setopt HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS <span># ignore duplicated commands history list</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Also, I like to use multiple terminal sessions in parallel, potentially working on the same problem. For this, it helps a lot to share …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="introducing-the-editor">Introducing the Editor</h2>
<p>Collaborative editors are defined by the size and speed of their
updates. On a website you might submit a form, but in a collaborative
editor you can send a single character or key press.</p>
<video controls="" width="100%">

</video>
<p>Those tiny edits are shared quickly so you feel connected to your
collaborators and can anticipate their actions. This experience is
described as <em>real-time</em> editing.</p>
<p>Inside your editor, however, the frequent edits form a hotbed of
conflicting updates. Solving or avoiding these conflicts is the real
challenge of a collaborative text editor.</p>
<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h2>
<p>Taking turns, two authors might avoid a conflict - if they have the
patience.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/4154d7b675ec700e00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But our collaborative editor has many authors. To block one author's
key press until another releases their keyboard would be infuriating.
Instead, they each edit a copy of the document and submit changes
when ready.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/57a61b3a6fefc58700.png" title="Their legs are crossed. That's probably not obvious."></p>
<p>To submit, the first author can simply swap his copy for the
original - with no prior updates, his edits apply cleanly.</p>
<p>The second author, however, will find - in place of the original - the
first author's copy. Where she re-worded a sentence, he might have
deleted the whole paragraph. She cannot replace the document without
losing his work, so she must compare the two and decide how, and if,
her edits still apply.</p>
<p>Most collaborative editors do this automatically, behind the scenes,
for every change to a document.</p>
<h2 id="operational-transformation">Operational Transformation</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d16f9e7203a8563100.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The process of re-writing your edits to account for the work of others
is called <em>Operational Transformation</em>. It's the most popular way to
implement a collaborative editor and is used by Etherpad and Google
Docs.</p>
<p>Concrete examples will follow, but for now let's start with two
tubes: the kind you buy tennis balls in.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/155936b3bca3740700.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Each tube has a starting state - a yellow ball - and each is held by a
different artist. At the same time, each artist adds a coloured ball
to the tube and informs their partner.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d4d34a8e9cee60a400.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing a yellow ball and a blue ball stacked on top, the right showing a red ball in place of blue. Beside the tubes are two artists saying 'blue' and 'red' respectively." title="We're not acorns, we're artists."></p>
<p>If they apply their partner's update naively, their tubes will look
different: red-blue-yellow one side and blue-red-yellow the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f4f128e9fa2cfce00.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing from top to bottom: red, blue, yellow, the right: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>No single tube is correct - the colours were added simultaneously -
but the artists should agree a result.</p>
<p>To resolve the tie, they can invent an arbitrary rule. One that, when
applied by both artists, will arrive at the same state.
They could discard every ball… but the result is disappointing. How
about: "when inserts are tied, insert red before blue"?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/74a0a8e0c99fd7b500.png" alt="Two tubes, both showing from top to bottom: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>By applying the same rule their states <em>converge</em>. This is the
principle behind Operational Transformation and it can be applied to
many authors typing at once.</p>
<h2 id="handling-text">Handling text</h2>
<p>In a text document, you can improve such a rule by examining the
position of the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/9ae873262f52072300.jpg" alt="Tama under a blanket with the caption 'sleepy cat'." title="Mraow"></p>
<p>Here's a photo of our cat Tama. I've labelled it "sleepy cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui (our other cat) both update my caption at different
positions. When Tama receives Yui's edit, she'll need to
shift Yui's "grumpy" right to account for her insert of "very".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f7a6a5a6edbee75500.png" alt="Two editors with the same state: very sleepy grumpy cat. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;grumpy &quot; 12'."></p>
<p>If she applied Yui's edit at its original character position, Tama
would have the state <strong>"very slgrumpy eepy cat"</strong>. But by understanding
how their concurrent edits affect one another, Tama's editor can
recover.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't rely on position alone - what if they both
insert text at the same location?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d56daf5a9e4e722f00.jpg" alt="Tama on top of the blanket with the caption &quot;Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Another photo, labelled simply: "Tama".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/086ae591d859549800.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;happy Tama&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui both make an edit at the beginning - position 0.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/819f09cfa16942c400.png" alt="Two editors showing a conflict. Tama has applied 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;playful happy Tama&quot;. Yui has applied 'INS &quot;happy &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Like our artists, Tama and Yui are tied for position. To resolve this,
we invent another arbitrary rule and order the inserts by Tama and
Yui's <em>editor ID</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8c2ab5057501f00500.png" alt="Two editors with the conflict resolved. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 6' and now also has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Yui has ID <code>[2]</code>, which is greater than Tama's <code>[1]</code>, so Tama
shifts Yui's insert after her own to converge on: <strong>"happy
playful Tama"</strong>.</p>
<p>We applied only two concurrent edits, but if Tama made multiple
changes, she would need to transform Yui's insert for each -
potentially shifting it multiple times before its final position.</p>
<p>I hope you feel confident after that, because - to demonstrate the
risks - I'm going to present a puzzle that threw the early algorithms
off-course.</p>
<h2 id="false-ties">False ties</h2>
<p><img alt="A photo of Yui with the caption 'little cat'." src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/750197ed186d7d3c00.jpg" title="Ah yes, all innocent - you wouldn't believe the noise."></p>
<p>The puzzle begins with a third author. And, since we only have two
cats - that's Yui above - I've introduced a fictional bunny: Bandit.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f57d6afe96060d5d00.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;little loud cat&quot;. Bandit suggesting &quot;cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;cute little cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Bandit doesn't think Yui is small and deletes the word 'little'. After
applying all their edits, we expect the final caption to read: "cute
loud cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8bd6291f807f45ce00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But there's a problem - because Bandit deletes the word separating
Tama and Yui's edits, a transform step might (falsely) tie them for
position. I'll demonstrate by stepping through Tama and Bandit's
transforms.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d1431eaff0d5f1a600.png" alt="Tama applying 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 7', 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'DEL 5..12' to get the state &quot;cute loud cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama arrives at the correct result <strong>"cute loud cat"</strong> because she
applies Bandit's delete <em>after</em> her and Yui's inserts. Bandit,
however, applies his delete first.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/09c1793a9bf57cd800.png" alt="Bandit applying 'DEL 0..7', the transformed message 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0' to get the state &quot;loud cute cat&quot;."></p>
<p>His delete shifts Tama's "loud" to position 0. Yui's edit now ties
with Tama's, so Bandit must apply the arbitrary rule and order their
inserts by editor ID - <code>[1]</code> Tama's "loud", followed by <code>[2]</code> Yui's
"cute". Bandit incorrectly arrives at <strong>"loud cute cat"</strong>.</p>
<p>If you didn't anticipate that you're in good company. Many academic
papers on Operational Transformation (OT) suffered similar
<em>counter-examples</em> (or bugs, to the practitioner) on publication.
Thankfully these puzzles have now been solved, as evidenced by the
widespread use of OT in the wild.</p>
<p>You can find the solution to our puzzle in the 30 years of OT research
since 1989. But to keep your curiosity in check, consider the
following: if an edit could be <em>undone</em>, conflicts could be rewound
and replayed in a fixed order. It's more work, and could still cause a
false tie, but at least everyone would encounter the <em>same</em> tie.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're now suitably paranoid. Operational Transformation is
easy to explain but complex to implement. If only there was a way to
avoid conflicts altogether…</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-conflicts">Avoiding conflicts</h2>
<p>Remember the two artists? I have another commission for them, this
time using coloured liquid instead of balls.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7039688af6d8494800.png" title="There are plenty of yellow liquids."></p>
<p>They each start with a tube containing yellow dye, to which they add
their own colours. Yellow and blue to make green; yellow and red to make
orange.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/48d447c836121b4600.png" alt="A blue drop being added to the left tube to make green. A red drop being added to the right tube to make orange."></p>
<p>Finally, they inform each other and add their partner's dye to their
own.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/35549bbf749c16a000.png" alt="A red drop being added to the left tube to make a sort of grey colour. A blue drop added to the right tube to make the same grew colour."></p>
<p>What a lovely colour! - but at least they didn't have to apply any
transforms to converge on it. Because the artists used liquid,
the order they added the dye is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Using a data type with the same property for text we could eliminate
conflicts there too.</p>
<h2 id="conflict-free-replicated-data-types">Conflict-free replicated data types</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>One elegant data type, called LOGOOT (an example of a conflict-free
replicated data type, or CRDT) is built upon each edit holding a
unique position - represented by a list of integers.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/1a9e80211f2fe7f900.png" alt="&quot;[10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>The list is comprised of: a positioning number, the author's editor
ID, and a counter.</p>
<p>Every edit increments the author's counter. In combination with their
editor ID, it ensures the position is unique. The positioning number
places the text in the document.</p>
<p>To insert a word at the beginning of the document (before "sleepy")
Tama <code>[1]</code> would create a new position list that starts with a random
value between 0 and 10.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/db8ec7b35046ae4700.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>Yui <code>[2]</code>, unable to generate an integer between 10 and 11, chooses a
new random positioning number and appends her values to the preceding
list. By growing the list, Yui can always find a position between two
adjacent words.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/e74bdd81e27aab8200.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [10, 0, 1, 130, 2, 1] GRUMPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>You can insert these four words - ordered by their position lists - in
any sequence. You'll always arrive at the same result.</p>
<p>The example above uses a position list per word, but you'll probably
want a position list per <em>character</em> - occupying significantly more
space than the text alone in exchange for predictable performance.</p>
<p>Praise for the performance of CRDTs often rests on the worst-case
scenario: a long conflicting history of edits. In practice,
Operational Transformation can perform millions of simple transforms a
second and grants greater freedom to optimise the data structure - so
you might find OT performs better where fast feedback and short
conflicting histories are the norm.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy using a modified version of LOGOOT. In the end,
what convinced me was, not performance, but greater confidence that my
code is correct.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2>
<p>It seems incredible that, after 30 years of research, many products
still restrict work to a single author or just lose overlapping edits.
If, instead, we apply techniques to detect, avoid, and resolve
conflicts, we <em>can</em> write good collaborative software.</p>

											<blockquote>If you want an average successful life, it doesn’t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:<p>

1. Become the best at one specific thing.<br>
2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.</p><p>

The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don’t recommend anyone even try.</p><p>

The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.</p><p>

I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one skill. Or get a degree in business on top of your engineering degree, law degree, medical degree, science degree, or whatever. Suddenly you’re in charge, or maybe you’re starting your own company using your combined knowledge.												<br><cite>- <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html">Source</a></cite></p></blockquote>

You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.<p>

Measurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions. The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.</p><p>

An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.</p><p>

											<blockquote>“All returns in life, including in relationships, are from compound interest.”<p>

You want to rise, early in your career, to a senior position because that position will accrue more compound interest over the 30+ years of your life than if you take your time getting there.</p><p>

“Some of the most successful people that I've seen in Silicon Valley had breakouts very early in their careers,” Naval says. “They got promoted up to VP or Director or CXO or CEO, or started a company that did well, fairly early. If you're not getting promoted up through the ranks, it gets a lot harder to catch up later in life. It's good to be in a smaller company early because...there's less of an infrastructure to prevent early promotion.”</p><p>

Similarly, you want a strong alumni group to begin forming at or before your first job. If you remain close, your relationship can provide compounding value for the rest of your career. As Naval says, “If you're working with the same person 20 years from now, the trust you build up with them is so great, that the things you can do with them are incredible. You can start companies with them, or you can invest in their company on a handshake, and you'll never have to worry about... (things like) whether they work hard enough.”												<br><cite>- <a href="https://angel.co/blog/naval-ravikants-guide-to-choosing-your-first-job-in-tech">Source</a></cite></p></blockquote>

											<h2>on Your Career as a Portfolio (<a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part1.html">Source</a>)</h2>
										</div>
										<div>
											<blockquote>I believe you should look at your career as a portfolio of jobs/roles/opportunities. Each job that you take, each role that you choose to fill, each opportunity you pursue, will have a certain potential return -- the benefits you can get from taking it, whether those benefits come in the form of income, skill development, experience, geographic location, or something else. Each job will also have a certain risk profile -- the things that could go wrong, from getting fired for not being able to handle the job's demands, to having to move somewhere you don't want to, to the company going bankrupt, to the opportunity cost of not pursuing some other attractive opportunity.<p>

Once you start thinking this way, you can think strategically about your career over its likely 50+ year timespan.</p><p>

For example, when you are just out of school and have a low burn rate and geographic flexibility, you can take jobs with a certain return/risk profile. If you get married and have kids, you will take jobs with a different return/risk profile. Later, when your kids grow up and you are once again free to move about and you don't have to worry about tuition payments and a mortgage on a big house in a great school district, but you now have far more experience than you did when you were first starting out, you can take jobs with a third return/risk profile.</p><p>

Most people do not think this way. They might occasionally think this way, but they don't do it systematically. So when an opportunity pops up, …</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

		<p>Recently on Twitter, the St. Louis Fed’s David Andolfatto asked an interesting question:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How hard would it be to track these funds and mark them as fully taxable at any point they are redeemed for dollars (or any other currency) at an exchange? <a href="https://t.co/T1VqFGs0X7">https://t.co/T1VqFGs0X7</a></p>— David Andolfatto (@dandolfa) <a href="https://twitter.com/dandolfa/status/1278334057621991425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>That is, would it be possible to mark a particular bitcoin as having been paid in ransom so that such tainted coins could not be exchanged for dollars at regulated exchanges without first paying a tax? Putting aside whether that would be good policy, the threshold question is whether it’s technically possible to trace individual bitcoins in this way. In a later tweet he elaborated,</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can one not simply treat each satoshi as the basic unit? Don't care how they're combined into larger units -- I just follow the individual satoshis and threaten to confiscate them (and them alone) whenever I detect one being part of an exchange for electronic USD on an exchange.</p>— David Andolfatto (@dandolfa) <a href="https://twitter.com/dandolfa/status/1278426447825326081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>My shorthand <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1278386606215495685?s=20">answer</a> to this question is, no because there are actually no such things as “a bitcoin” that can be traced. Twitter did not prove to be an auspicious medium to convey what I meant by that shorthand, so here’s a stab at explaining the concept in detail.</p>

<p>Many people who generally understand how Bitcoin and its blockchain system works are nevertheless under the erroneous impression that there are such things as atomic units of bitcoin that are moved from address to address and can therefore be tracked on the public chain. I think this mistake has its roots in language and analogy.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency, “coin” is in its name, the White Paper describes it as electronic cash and mentions “wallets.” As a result we talk about it like we talk about physical currency; like we talk about paper bills or coins. We say things like, “She gave me <em>a bitcoin</em>.” As a result, people tend to quite justifiably envision bitcoins as atomic units that are passed around. Even if they understand that bitcoins are sub-divisible to eight decimal places, and that those units are called satoshis, they may still think that <em>those</em> are the atomic units.</p>

<p>This leads people to conceptualize bitcoins like dollar bills with serial numbers.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I mean, I don't understand this. Replace "satoshi" with $ bills, each with unique serial number. I don't care about the order in which they move in and out of a bar. If I catch the stolen $, I remove it from the bar, same as I would if I caught a counterfeit.</p>— David Andolfatto (@dandolfa) <a href="https://twitter.com/dandolfa/status/1278414586744627200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>And since people know that the blockchain keeps a public record of all transactions, they imagine that this means that individual bitcoins can be traced by their “serial numbers” moving from address to address, from wallet to wallet.</p>

<p>But the coins and wallets analogy is just that: an analogy. This is not at all how Bitcoin works.</p>

<p>So how does it work? Suppose Alice wants to send some Bitcoins to Bob. What she does is compose a new <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction">transaction</a> message to be broadcast on the network for validation and inclusion in the blockchain by a miner. In the transaction message she must reference one or more previous transactions on the blockchain of which she was a recipient.<sup>1</sup> Those referenced transactions are called inputs; they are in essence the funds with which she’s transacting. The sum of the inputs must total to exactly or (almost invariably) more than the amount she wants to send to Bob. She must also, of course, note the address or addresses to which she wants to send funds. These are called outputs. She signs the transaction message with the private keys corresponding to the input addresses and broadcasts it on the peer-to-peer network. If all goes well, a miner will include the transaction in the next block after verifying that the inputs and signatures are valid. The transaction is now complete and Bob can now reference this completed transaction as an input into a future transaction when he wants to move the funds.</p>

<p>In the simplest case, there is only one input and only one output. Alice references a transactions in which someone sent her exactly one bitcoin and she sends exactly one bitcoin to Bob’s address. In such a case, it might not be unreasonable to say that we can track the movement of one particular bitcoin, just as if it was one particular $100 bill. However, such a transaction is not only improbable, I’m not sure there have ever been any like it.</p>

<p>First, miners don’t typically work for free. In addition to block rewards, miners are incentivized by <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Miner_fees">fees</a> they can collect from each transaction they include in a block that they add to the blockchain. These fees are voluntary, but miners will almost always ignore transactions that don’t have fees (or have fees below the current market rate). So, if Alice wants to send one bitcoin to Bob, it’s likely she will have inputs to the transaction that total, say, 1.01 bitcoins. Whatever is the balance between the inputs and the outputs in a transaction message is understood to be the fee and the miner gets to keep it.</p>

<p>Second, users typically don’t have exact change. It’s unlikely that Alice will have a single prior transaction that she can use as an input to pay Bob (i.e. 1.01 BTC, exactly one bitcoin for bob plus the appropriate mining fee). More likely she will have many different possible inputs to choose from—for example, one for 87 bitcoins, one for .51, one for .7365, one for 14.98, etc. As a result, the number of inputs and/or outputs in her transaction will increase. For example, if she wants to send Bob one bitcoin, and wants to also include a .01 bitcoin mining fee, she has to find inputs equal to 1.01 bitcoins or more. So, she can use one big input (like the one for 87 bitcoins) and get <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change">change</a> of 85.99 bitcoins back by including a second output for that amount to an address that she controls. The transaction would now have one input and two outputs. Alternatively she could use two small inputs (like the ones for .51 and .7365) but still want change (i.e. 0.2365) for which she would provide a change address. That transaction would therefore have two inputs and two outputs.</p>

<p>One last wrinkle I’ll add is that when Alice composes a transaction message to pay Bob, she can also take the opportunity to pay Charlie as well. She can send up to the total of her inputs to as many addresses as she wants, so the number of transaction outputs can be very large. So, a not uncommon bitcoin transaction will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://sometimesright.com/images/2020-07-13-bitcoin-transaction.jpg" alt="A bitcoin transaction."></p>

<p>The key thing to realize is that there are no individual, atomic units of bitcoin that are transferred among addresses. Indeed, there are no such things as bitcoins that one can point to, much less track. What individuals “own” are not bitcoins per se, but <a href="https://medium.com/@monetha/what-are-unspent-transaction-outputs-e483b7e2781f">unspent transaction outputs</a> (UTXOs) that can serve as inputs for new transactions. When a new transaction is added to the blockchain, the transactions that served as inputs are of course still visible on the ledger, but they can no longer be spent,<sup>2</sup> and <em>new</em> unspent transaction outputs are available in the newly created transaction. The input and new transactions are certainly linked in a chain, but in no way can we identify in the new UTXO a particular satoshi that was present in the input UTXO—again, because individual satoshis don’t really exist.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Let’s now bring it back to Andolfatto’s proposal to tax blacklisted bitcoins when they are presented to a regulated exchange. We can now see that in Bitcoin it makes no sense to say that a <em>particular</em> bitcoin was paid in ransom and is now being brought to an exchange. One can nevertheless trace the movement of funds on the blockchain and show that a particular UTXO has somewhere in its chain an illicit transaction, but that’s not the same thing as saying that a particular bitcoin was part of an illicit transaction.</p>

<p>In the figure above, suppose the UTXO with 87 bitcoins are the proceeds of crime, while the rest are not. When Alice sends bitcoins to Bob and Charlie (and pays a mining fee to do so), there is no meaningful way in which we can say that Bob, Charlie, or the miner received some of the 87 ill-gotten bitcoins. And it’s just as meaningless to say that either Bob’s or Charlie’s or the miner’s coins came from the legitimate UTXOs. It’s not just that we can’t be sure, it’s that the concept of particular coins changing hands makes no sense because individual coins don’t exist.</p>

<p>At this point, I hope I have answered the initial question, is it possible to track individual units of bitcoin? It’s not.</p>

<p>What someone might then say is, why not simply treat each of the new UTXOs as containing a share of the illicit input coins in proportion to the value of the outputs illicit coins? Couldn’t you then tax that proportion of Bob or Charlie’s coins? The answer is sure, I guess you could do that, but that would be a policy choice external to the mechanics of Bitcoin, and I imagine it would be seen as a pretty inequitable policy. There’s a reason the <a href="https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2017/06/on-currency.html">currency rule</a> emerged.</p>

<p>As a result, what’s developed in practice by industry, regulators, and law enforcement is to focus on addresses and not individual bitcoins.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-1a2ab8e9c09eff6855f8"><div><p>Bill and Robin were young boys who wanted to be successful and happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Bill was anxious about the future. He developed a statistical process to reduce making mistakes to achieve his goals: being successful and happy. He thought he needed money or status to be happy. Bill thought when he had those things, he would achieve his goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Robin also had similar goals. He had a different strategy and he focused on living presently. He knew that success and happiness could not be pursued because they ensued. He was happy with the little he had. Robin didn’t have goals or ambitions, he went with the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bill came back to visit his parents and saw Robin buying groceries. Robin was happy to see his friend Bill, Robin asked him where he lived and what his job was. Bill says he became an investment banker at a prestigious bank in New York City.&nbsp;</p><p>Robin now knew why his friend looked like he was 10 years older.</p><p>Robin told Bill that after graduation he traveled the world for a year. He met his wife in Thailand. Robin says he works as a local tutor and teaches music. He does that part time during the school year. During vacations, he along with his wife and kids travel the world.&nbsp;</p><p>They talked for a bit and decided to meet next Wednesday for coffee.</p><p>Bill and Robin met at the local coffee shop. They wanted to ask each other how they were truly feeling. But neither of them dared to ask that question so they talked about memories, family, work, and the usual boring small talk stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, <strong>Jermaine</strong> entered the coffee shop. When Bill and Robin saw him walk across the coffee shop, they asked each other whether he was the person they thought he was. He walked with the confidence of Tony Stark and expressed kindness by the feature of his face.</p><p>Jermaine also went to the same high school. Jermaine was one of those “weird kids” when he was growing up. He was a person who was smart, but who treated school as a day job, meaning he did well, but was focused on other projects. He was competitive in school and sports. He was also creative, ingenious, and wicked-smart.&nbsp;</p><p>When Jermaine walked in, he didn’t see his old high school friends.On the way out, he saw his peers talking to each other. He thought, “Is that one the kid (Bill) who wanted to get all A’s and was anxious about everything? Is he also talking to the happy-go-lucky kid (Robin) who barely went to his classes?</p><p>Jermaine stopped by and started talking to Bill and Robin. He asked how they were doing. Jermaine also asked whether they still lived in town.&nbsp;</p><p>Bill and Robin asked what about Jermaine’s job. Jermaine said that he graduated from college and that during college he started working with science professors. He patented inventions and sold them. Also, during his time there he created companies that were sold and one that he still has, which sells real estate in the virtual world.</p><p>Jermaine said he would stay, but he had a meeting with clients. Jermaine told them they should come over to his house to meet his family.&nbsp;</p><p>Jermaine left.&nbsp;</p><p>Bill and Robin were baffled. They couldn’t believe this guy had achieved this level of success.&nbsp;</p><p>Bill and Robin had a weird feeling between them. They knew they weren’t truly happy and had a bittersweet feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>It was regret.</p><p>Bill and Robin spent about two hours talking and promised to stay in touch.</p><p>They couldn’t stop thinking about Jermaine.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>An Unknown Alternative</h2><p>Bill is an example of insecure people who use “success,” money, and hard-work to ignore his reality and his true feelings. People like Bill aren’t and will never be happy because they will never have enough of what they want.&nbsp;</p><p>They are insecure because they think having X will give them Y. Bill always wants more and more. Therefore, he doesn’t enjoy what he has and is never happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Robin is the other extreme. You may even think he is one of the good guys of the story. He is supposedly “happy.”</p><p>He knows he needs nothing to be happy. He decides to be happy and he is. Because of that, he doesn’t want more in the future. While Robin thinks he is happy, in reality, he is running away from his reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as Bill ignores his reality by working hard, Robin ignores his reality by thinking he is happy if he travels and works part time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Extremes ended up having the same outcome. Here, never being happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Robin and Bill use the perspective of imagining the other's life as a way to understand their regret.&nbsp;</p><p>That is how most people approach their life. You either work hard and maybe you will be happy. Or you are “happy” and relax.&nbsp;</p><p>This is how we think. This is how humans think. We think in terms of either A or B, either X or Y.&nbsp;</p><p>We think we cannot get both A and B or X and Y.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re thinking of choosing. Choose both.&nbsp;</p><p>As Bill and Robin were talking and having a conversation. Jermaine shows up and just by looking at him, you get a different vibe.</p><p>You can appreciate what you have, but you can also have aspirations.&nbsp;</p><p>Jermaine didn’t wait for something to be happy. He appreciated what he had, but wanted more in the future because he believes he could help people. He didn’t want more out of vanity.</p><p>We don’t see this often, we mostly see people like Bill and Robin, but not many Jermaines.&nbsp;</p><p>Jermaines are both happy and ambitious, grateful and motivated, and thankful and determined.</p><p>Let’s try being like Jermaine!</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://disco.substack.com/" target="_blank">Dipan</a>, <a href="https://charliebleecker.com/" target="_blank">Charlie</a>, JC, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priankadillon/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank">Prianka</a> for reading drafts of this essay.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595170004408_4960"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), join us at our<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">newsletter</a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<div>

<p>What's the difference between <code>command</code> and <code>command | cat</code>? There shouldn't be any, right? The first prints the output directly, and the latter prints output via cat, but they should have the same effect. Not so: the latter can cause the command to get stuck indefinitely. This has given a particular CI pipeline of mine quite some headache.</p>
<p>To learn why this happens, and how we can mitigate this problem, we need to dive into the arcane magic that is Unix process management. Join me on this journey.</p>

<h2 id="it-started-with-an-innocent-pipe-">It started with an innocent pipe 👼</h2>
<p>I have a CI job that uses <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a> — an end-to-end Javascript testing framework that works by controlling a headless browser — to perform integration tests.</p>
<p>At some point, I wanted to parse the Cypress output in order to extract information about the Cypress run, such as how many times failed tests were retried. I also wanted the Cypress output to show up in my CI pipeline in real time, rather than only after the Cypress run was completed.</p>
<p>So I chose to pipe Cypress's output to <code>tee</code>. Tee is a tool similar to cat: it prints everything consumed from standard input, but <em>also</em> writes a copy to a file, which we can inspect later. My code looked like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>cypress run | tee cypress.log
parse cypress.log
</code></pre></div>
<p>After this change, my CI job started to get stuck <em>occasionally</em>. 🤷‍♂️ Thinking I went insane, I double checked a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the OS upgraded recently? Nope.</li>
<li>Was a dependency upgraded recently? Nope.</li>
<li>Does upgrading Cypress and Headless Chrome make the problem go away? Nope.</li>
<li>Does removing the <code>tee</code> pipe make the problem go away? <strong>Yes.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed a pattern: when the CI job gets stuck, then Cypress was always in a complete state: all tests have finished, and Cypress has written its final output. In other words, it was as if Cypress was stuck during some shutdown routine.</p>
<p>I started poking around in the CI server and observed a few peculiar things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main Cypress process is gone, but <code>tee</code> is still alive.</li>
<li>A few Cypress subprocesses, such as Headless Chrome and a bunch of Cypress helper processes, are still alive.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I put all of this together, and thought about how Unix process management works, a lightbulb started to shine. 💡 How could I not have seen it coming?</p>
<h2 id="whats-going-on">What's going on</h2>
<p>When we run <code>cypress run | tee cypress.log</code>, Bash waits for <code>cypress</code> and for <code>tee</code> to finish. The caveat lies in the latter.</p>
<p>Tee finishes when it is done reading all its standard input.</p>
<p>Question: where does tee's standard input come from?</p>
<p>Answer: from <code>cypress run</code>'s standard output. But not <em>only</em> <code>cypress run</code>. When a Unix process creates subprocesses, all subprocesses inherit the standard output channel. In other words, all <code>cypress run</code> subprocesses' standard output are connected to <code>tee</code>.</p>
<p>Here's how the situation looks like right after we ran <code>cypress run | tee cypress.log</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.joyfulbikeshedding.com/images/2020/bash-wait-process-with-children-455d2f05.png" alt="Bash wait process with children">
<figcaption>Bash waits for 'cypress run' and 'tee'. Cypress and all its subprocesses' stdout are connected to tee's stdin.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When Cypress has finished running all its tests, <code>cypress run</code> exits. But sometimes, for reasons that are still not clear to me, Cypress' subprocesses don't exit. But because the subprocesses' standard outputs are still connected to tee's standard input, tee does not exit either, and so bash ends up waiting for tee indefinitely:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.joyfulbikeshedding.com/images/2020/bash-wait-process-with-children-cypress-run-gone-ae8f7b36.png" alt="Bash wait process with children cypress run gone">
<figcaption>Tee keeps waiting for all Cypress subprocesses to go away.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, it's not good that Cypress subprocesses don't exit. And the cause for that should be investigated. But this case shows how insidious Unix can be, and how small, seemingly-innocent changes can end up behaving very differently from expectations.</p>
<h2 id="reproducing-with-cat-">Reproducing with 'cat' 🐱</h2>
<p>In order to confirm that I was right, I ran the following experiment, which recreates the above situation without using Cypress. This experiment only uses bash and <code>sleep</code>.</p>

<p>The above command spawns a subshell, which spawns <code>sleep 5</code> in the background, then prints 'hi' and exits. When I ran the above, I observed that the bash prompt returns immediately:</p>
<div><pre><code>$ date
Tue Jul 21 18:19:04 CEST 2020
$ (sleep 999 &amp; echo hi)
hi
$ date
Tue Jul 21 18:19:07 CEST 2020
</code></pre></div>
<p>I then reran the same experiment, piped to cat:</p>
<div><pre><code>$ (sleep 999 &amp; echo hi) | cat
hi
&lt;...never exits...&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>When we run <code>ps aux</code> in another terminal, we see that both 'sleep' and 'cat' are still alive:</p>
<div><pre><code>hongli     19145    0.0   sleep 999
hongli     19144    0.0   cat
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="if-not-tee-then-what-">If not 'tee', then what? 🤔</h2>
<p>So far, I haven't been able to find out why Cypress subprocesses get stuck. But the CI job runs inside an ephemeral Docker container anyway, and all processes will be cleaned up after the CI job finishes anyway, so figuring out why the subprocesses get stuck wasn't terribly important. A more important question was: if I could not pipe to <code>tee</code>, then what's the alternative?</p>
<p>The solution that I came up with was this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># Run Cypress in the background, redirecting its output to a file.</span>
cypress run <span>&gt;</span> cypress.log &amp;

<span># Capture the PID of 'cypress run'.</span>
<span>local </span><span>CYPRESS_PID</span><span>=</span><span>$!</span>

<span># Watch the Cypress log file, print (in near-real-time) any new</span>
<span># data written to the file.</span>
<span># --pid means: exit tail when 'cypress run' exits.</span>
tail <span>-f</span> <span>--pid</span><span>=</span><span>$CYPRESS_PID</span> cypress.log

<span># `cypress run` has how exited, but we still need to explicitly</span>
<span># wait for it from Bash, otherwise its dead process entry will stay</span>
<span># behind in the kernel process list.</span>
<span>wait</span> <span>$CYPRESS_PID</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="congratulations-you-are-now-master-of-the-arcane-">Congratulations, you are now master of the arcane 🧙‍♂️</h2>
<p>Lots of people praise Unix for its "simplicity", and Unix pipes for their "elegance". I disagree. If you know how things actually work behind the scenes, then you will see that there are a lot of weird corner cases. Unix can be very insidious: small, seemingly-innocent changes can end up behaving very differently from expectations.</p>
<p>But don't let that stop you from doing your job. At least now, you know how to avoid this particular caveat.</p>

        <p>
          July 21, 2020

            ☼ <a href="https://ylukem.com/tagged/writing">writing</a>
        </p>

        
<p>Recently, I was debugging an issue with one of my domains and email. During this process, I was sending emails to myself and clicking<span></span> <span>“</span>View original” in Gmail’s web <span>UI</span> to view the raw version and headers of an email.</p>
<p>When looking at an email that I sent with Apple Mail on macOS, this part of an email’s headers jumped out to me:</p>
<pre><code>Received: from [10.x.x.x] (c-x-x-x-x.hsd1.ca.comcast.net. [x.x.x.x])
    by smtp.gmail.com with ESMTPSA id redacted.48.2020.07.21.10.50.01
    (version=TLS1_2 cipher=ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 bits=128/128);</code></pre>
<p>In the headers of the raw email, my full public and private <span>IP</span> addresses were perfectly visible! (I’ve redacted them here for my privacy.) This is an email that I sent to a totally separate inbox on a different Google account.</p>
<p>To make sure I wasn’t misunderstanding what was happening, I emailed my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jarredsumner" target="_blank">Jarred</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blot.im/cdn/blog_73772325166d4d768fb0996358b914dd/_image_cache/53fdf6ea-37a6-40b6-892b-b099875f01d8.png" alt="A screenshot of a text conversation with my friend Jarred. He confirmed that he could see my public IP address." width="1068" height="354" data-action="zoom"></p>
<p>He confirmed my suspicions: every time I send an email with Apple Mail, my <span>IP</span> address is leaked. I’ve replicated this behavior on the latest public versions of Apple Mail for macOS and iOS.</p>
<p>This is <em>scary</em>! <span>IP</span> addresses roughly represent location. With my <span>IP</span>, you can learn what city or even what neighborhood I live in. If the email was sent from a mobile network, you can learn someone’s cell phone provider, which may aid in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam" target="_blank">sim swapping</a>. For people who want to be pseudonymous or private online, leaking this information is a privacy disaster<a href="#footnote-1YD4" id="ref-1YD4"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="whos-to-blame-here">Who’s to blame here?</h2>
<p>The reason why my <span>IP</span> address is visible is because Apple Mail sends emails with <span>SMTP</span>. The email is sent to Google’s <span>SMTP</span> relay, which ultimately delivers the email. For each stop an email makes, a <code>Recieved</code> header is added to the message<a href="#footnote-2YD4" id="ref-2YD4"><sup>2</sup></a>. You can read these headers top to bottom to follow the trail of an email.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most email clients are cloud-based and don’t use <span>SMTP</span> to initiate an email, meaning that your <span>IP</span> isn’t leaked, but rather the <span>IP</span> of the server that sent the email. For example, using Gmail via the apps or website doesn’t reveal your <span>IP</span>.</p>
<p>So, how could this get fixed? I can think of a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple could use <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/" target="_blank">Gmail’s <span>API</span></a> instead of <span>SMTP</span> to send emails. This works, but undermines the decentralized nature of email. This also keeps this privacy loophole for anyone using other email clients that aren’t Apple Mail.</li>
<li>Apple could route Gmail emails through a <span>SMTP</span> relay it controls to mask <span>IP</span> addresses, but this has scary privacy and centralization concerns of its own. Apple now has a copy of every email you send.</li>
<li>Gmail could strip the first <code>Recieved</code> header from an email, preserving only the Gmail internal headers and removing any other<span></span> <span>“</span>public” headers. This breaks the <span>SMTP</span> spec and could cause deliverability issues for emails, but is probably the most correct option listed here. I looked at emails that I’ve received from friends that use Apple’s iCloud email service, and I don’t see their personal IPs leaked, but instead an Apple-owned <span>IP</span><a href="#footnote-3YD4" id="ref-3YD4"><sup>3</sup></a>. If Apple Mail uses <span>SMTP</span> for iCloud email, then this indicates that Apple is dropping personally identifying information from <span>SMTP</span> headers, a practice Gmail should adopt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Email is great, but it was designed before people thought about online privacy as the fundamental right that it is today. It would be amazing if Apple or Google put this privacy concern to bed as soon as possible.</p>

        <section editorial-body="">
          <p>About six years ago, I stumbled across some papers in the field of evolutionary
biology that eventually led me to question many of my most basic assumptions
about software development. What started as a bit of a crazy thought,
eventually began to offer explanations for everything from the Lean Startup
movement and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills">T-shaped skills</a>
to the popularity of microservices and why everyone uses Javascript even
though <a href="https://pchiusano.github.io/2017-01-20/why-not-haskell.html">Haskell is the objectively superior language</a>
<code>&lt;trollface&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The papers introduced me to the the concept biologists call “degeneracy” and its impact on
the evolvability of a species. It’s taken me many years to realize that
degeneracy is a common thread linking many of the best practices
of software development, while simultaneously calling into question
many of our rituals and even the basic paradigm of software as an
exercise of “engineering”.</p>
<h2 id="degeneracy-what-is-it">Degeneracy: What is It?</h2>
<p>Biologists use the word <em>degeneracy</em> to describe <strong>structurally dissimilar</strong> components which
can perform similar functions. It is related to <em>redundancy</em>, which describes
<strong>structurally similar</strong> components which perform similar functions. Context is a key
differentiator. Redundancy describes things which behave similarly regardless of context.
Degeneracy exists when one component could—in certain situations—“sub in” for another,
but usually fulfills another role.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d6047eb2c2c66acc46ebd973f1939cde8b9af4c6/96910/images/degeneracy-diagram.png" alt="Redundancy and Degeneracy Diagram">
<em>Image from <a href="http://www.bodowinter.com/papers/mason_winter_2015_degeneracy.pdf">Hidden in plain view, degeneracy in complex systems</a></em></p>
<p>If you’ve ever deployed a cluster of servers, you understand the
value of redundancy; it’s double the cost, but half the risk. The
CFO might raise an eyebrow at the AWS bill when you replicate the
entire architecture in two different regions, but the CEO will
probably appreciate the peace of mind this redundancy brings. In
our industry, <strong>we understand redundancy well, but we’re clueless
about the value of degeneracy</strong>. This essay is the start of an
attempt to change that.</p>
<h2 id="why-degeneracy">Why Degeneracy?</h2>
<p>Some degree of <em>a priori</em> suspiciousness of degeneracy makes sense. It’s hard to
imagine how it would benefit a business or software system. It sounds <strong>both</strong> more
expensive and more complex than redundancy. Let’s examine these assumptions with some
“straw man” examples.</p>
<p>Consider a static HTML web site served via Apache on a single
server. Here are two ways we could introduce degeneracy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Apache, Nginx and Lighttpd on the same server, each on a different port,
all serving the same HTML content, and each activating depending on the “context”
(the port is the context here).</li>
<li>Take a second server which is used for some other purpose (how about Microsoft
Exchange) and stick a copy of the web site on there running via IIS.
This time the “context” is the IP address. The same “function” (serving
the HTML) can be accomplished via two different mechanisms depending on the
context.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m pretty sure nobody has ever tried #1. It’s cheaper than two redundant
servers, but it’s far less robust. A single hardware failure could bring down the
whole thing. The second option fares mildly better in this regard; it eliminates
the single point of failure and adds some flexibility. But it just <em>feels wrong</em>.
What if the original server fails and we end up juggling mail and web server load
on the same machine? How do we keep the content in sync across operating systems?
Sounds incredibly inefficient, right?</p>
<p><strong>It took some time for me to realize that my bias towards “efficient” design might
be getting in the way of understanding the value of degeneracy. You may have that same bias.</strong></p>
<h2 id="degeneracy-and-redundancy-in-nature">Degeneracy and Redundancy in Nature</h2>
<p>Nature has plentiful examples of both redundancy <strong>and</strong> degeneracy. Your ears, eyes,
and even kidneys are examples of redundant systems. Your body’s nutritional needs
exhibit degeneracy. Protein is essential to all of your body’s tissues. Thankfully,
there are a plethora of foods you can eat to acquire it; ask a vegan. Can you imagine
if you only had only one “route” to acquire protein in your diet?</p>
<p>Next, consider your body’s ability to move. If you injure a muscle, your body will
activate surrounding muscles in new ways to sub-in for the injured muscle while it
heals. Different structure, same function: <em>degeneracy</em>. Being able to limp away from
injuries is obviously valuable as an evolutionary trait.</p>
<p>Immune therapy and vaccines are technologies which work because of degeneracy in
immune responses. Because there are multiple <em>pathways</em> to activate your body’s
defenses, you can use a relatively harmless stand-in for the real invader to trigger
your immune system to prepare.</p>
<h2 id="degeneracy-and-innovation">Degeneracy and Innovation</h2>
<p>Just because degeneracy <em>exists</em> in so many places in nature doesn’t necessarily mean
we should emulate it. It’s valuable to think about <strong>why</strong> it exists so that we can
benefit from it when appropriate, as we seem to have learned to do with redundancy.</p>
<p>One leading theory about the purpose of degeneracy is that it provides a way for an
organism to strike a balance between rigid genetic “robustness” (traits that are
extremely consistent across generations) and wild genetic “variance” (traits which
are unpredictable between generations). That balance is something geneticists have
been trying to understand since Darwin. Ronald Fisher’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_fundamental_theorem_of_natural_selection">Fundamental Theorem of
Natural Selection</a>
(1930) describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The better adapted you are, the less adaptable you tend to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fisher realized that highly successful species have little incentive to engender
experimentation in their offspring; they’ve already got the right “recipe.” On the
flip side, the offspring of a poorly adapted species benefit from even
<strong>random</strong> genetic variation. If you’re at the bottom, everywhere else is up.</p>
<p>That’s not the interesting part, though. The insight in Fisher’s Theorem is that
success <em>across</em> generations is what really matters, and the most long-lived species
find a way to survive through lots of environmental variation.</p>
<p>This idea is easily generalizable to your career, your company, or your code. It
makes obvious, intuitive sense: if you over-optimize to today’s challenges, you’re
less prepared for tomorrow’s.</p>
<p>Ever had an excellent spec, perfectly-built code and 100% test coverage and have the
product manager tell you the customer changed their mind? I’m going to guess you had
to throw all or most of that code away.</p>
<p>Ever worked in a startup with a messy codebase everyone agrees has poor architecture?
In that startup, did the PM ever come up with an off-the-wall idea—and instead of
resistance, the team said, “actually… we just need to tweak the X and bolt-on a Y,
and we could do that pretty easily. It’ll be ugly, but we can do it.”</p>
<p>That first example is the anti-pattern Fisher is talking about. That second example:
unintentional degeneracy. Succeeding <em>because</em> of “bad” architecture, not <em>in spite
of</em> bad architecture.</p>
<p>For decades, geneticists wondered what forces would help organisms find the balancing
point that Fisher described. They knew there had to be more to the story than
mutation and natural selection. Mutations are too random to lead to the relative
stability we see in the natural world. And natural selection produces far fewer
hyper-dominant species than we’d assume. Reality is much more moderate. Researchers
are beginning to point to degeneracy as the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From observing how evolvability scaled with system size, we concluded that
degeneracy not only contributes to the discovery of new innovations but
that it may be a precondition of evolvability.”</p>
<p>— James Whitacre, <a href="https://tbiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4682-7-6">Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling</a>, 2010</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Degeneracy works because the future isn’t entirely random, it’s informed and
influenced by the present. Instead of having your offspring make random guesses about
future needs, it’s better to evolve multiple, flexible, <em>semi-incomplete</em> solutions
to today’s problems, which can be potentially re-composed to solve slightly different
problems tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="nature-succeeds-by-failing">Nature Succeeds By Failing</h2>
<p>Much to the chagrin of people like me who suffer from seasonal allergies, our immune
systems are not finely-tuned machines. They seem to be <strong>designed</strong> to be somewhat
inaccurate; many different inputs will trigger the same immune response. This
inaccuracy allows us to “adapt” our immune responses within a single generation (i.e.
in real time).</p>
<p>When a virus or bacteria (both of which have much shorter generational
cycles than humans do) modifies its means of attack, as long as that variation is
within the scope of our immune system’s degeneracy, we will be able to fight it.
Consider an alternative approach which relied entirely on variation and natural
selection. Each human would have a random set of immunities to specific kinds of
viruses. The “lucky” folks who happened to be born with the right ones would thrive,
and others would fall victim to the more rapidly-evolving attackers. Each human
generation would be a crap shoot, and the viruses would always win. By being
“inefficient” and “inaccurate” and having a relatively general definition of
“intruder” existing in its code, your immune system is able to defend against
previously unseen invaders and seemingly “learn”, even without changing anything
about its structure or design. Evolution never goes back to the drawing board.</p>
<h2 id="degeneracy-in-code">Degeneracy in Code</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, I’ve spent many years ruminating on the ways biological robustness,
degeneracy and evolvability relate to software. I’ll be writing much, much more about
this in the weeks to come, but let me close this essay with some notes on what I
think are three of the biggest implications for our field:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think Smaller</li>
<li>DRY is not a Virtue</li>
<li>Events Not Things</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="think-smaller">Think Smaller</h2>
<p>Although we observe degeneracy at <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/24/13763">every level in nature from genetic encodings to
human communication</a>, it never appears to be “designed in” from the outset. It is a
property that emerges organically from the interactions of very small building
blocks.</p>

After meeting Nassim Taleb, a desire to understand heuristics and biases boomed in the author’s mind and lead to a transition. From a novelist, Rolf Dobelli became a student of social and cognitive psychology. This book is a compilation of 99 systematic cognitive errors (thinking errors) that aim to give you the upper hand in any given situation.</p><h2 id="1-the-core-idea-"><strong>The Core Idea:</strong></h2><p>We need less irrationality. Nothing else to improve our daily lives. By understanding what you’re likely to do wrong, and by evading these corrupting behavior patterns, you’ll find yourself absurdly productive and move closer to where you want to be.</p><div id=""><div><div><div><div><div><h2 id="2-highlights">Highlights:</h2><ul><li>We prefer taking risks with something familiar rather than trying something new because of uncertainty.</li><li>Success is rarely due to what’s visible. There’s always something else happening in the background.</li><li>Experts don’t know everything. What they share is based on their field. Blindly following their advice can be harmful.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div><h2 id="3-5-key-lessons-from-the-art-of-thinking-clearly">5 Key Lessons from The Art of Thinking Clearly:</h2><h3 id="4-lesson-1-the-cause-of-something-is-never-one-thing">Lesson #1: The Cause of Something is Never One Thing</h3><p>Your conclusion after a distressful event usually ends up something like this: “John, the product manager, is responsible for the slow sales this season – nothing else. We should fire him!” Or, “I have a flat tire because my husband failed to check the tires this morning.”</p><p>We tend to blame one thing, or one person when something bad happens. But usually, there’s more going on.</p><ul><li><strong>Fallacy of the single cause</strong>: We imagine that our actions are enough for something to happen – to win an award or to outwit the competitors. We think that one simple thing can cause a major positive change. But that’s rarely the case. No singular event can help you triumph and win the day. Even if we don’t immediately see them, there are always a lot of factors involved in any given situation.</li><li><strong>Ambiguity aversion</strong>: With everything else being equal, the scale will tilt towards what’s familiar. Even if there is risk involved, you’ll choose to take your chances rather than trying something new, something unfamiliar. The ambiguity aversion thinking error explains that we prefer taking risks with familiar things, even if the new, foreign strategy can lead to much better results.</li><li><strong>Affect heuristic</strong>: We’re not in control of our actions. Our emotions are. You might think that you’re a reasonable person. That your decisions are based on carefully calculated data that’s analyzed in your brain but in most of the cases small things like, the weather outside, can hugely influence your judgment. So, instead of asking yourself, “What do I think about this?” use, “How do I feel about this?”</li></ul><h3 id="5-lesson-2-outside-information-influences-our-decision-making">Lesson #2: Outside Information Influences our Decision-Making</h3><p>News, friends, commercials, street signs, the words printed on our 5 dollars t-shirt from the local store, the sticky note on your cubicle.</p><p>Everything matters.</p><p>Everything we consume affects our judgment and can rearrange the thoughts inside our heads.</p><p>Sometimes you don’t need to get a complete 360-degree view of the situation. Actually, a lot of times, when something important needs to be decided, it’s best to remain on your own. With your own thoughts to make your mind.</p><ul><li><strong>News illusion</strong>: Plane crashes. A flood is destroying a city. A volcano is about to erupt. This is what news covers – blurbs of tragic events that are only negatively influencing your mood. The news illusion concept explains that we falsely believe that media is good for us. That what we see on TV and hear on the radio is helping us live a better life. In reality, the opposite happens. We start to feel worse. We start to imagine that the world is a dangerous place. Instead of embracing short snippets of information that will be irrelevant 24 hours later, <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/dont-just-read-act/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bury yourself in books</a>.</li><li><strong>Salience effect</strong>: We tend to focus on the most obvious things in a situation. If a book is successful, we might say that it’s thanks to the marvelous cover. If you hear about a car crash and recently there was also a report about drunk drivers, you’ll conclude that the new event was also caused by irresponsible drinking. We focus on the sensational news rather than digging deeper to grasp the whole picture.</li><li><strong>In-group out-group bias</strong>: We think differently when we’re surrounded by others and when we are on our own. When in a group, we adopt the desires of the people forming the team. When we’re alone, we favor our own judgments based on our past experiences. Be careful when you’re surrounded by others. Don’t immediately agree with the desires of the formation. Pause and consider the options on your own.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Prejudice and aversion are biological responses to anything foreign. Identifying with a group has been a survival strategy for hundreds of thousands of years. Not any longer. Identifying with a group distorts your view of the facts.” Rolf Dobelli</p></blockquote><h3 id="6-lesson-3-we-are-blind-to-what-does-not-exist">Lesson #3: We are Blind to What Does Not Exist</h3><p>Taking into account factors that are not obvious is one of the trickiest parts of decision-making.</p><p>Take books for example.</p><p>Yes, these chunks of paper that are glued together and cost around 15 bucks.</p><p>You can read reviews. Watch tutorials even of people explaining what the book is all about but you don’t actually see what’s inside until you read the actual book. Your decision of whether to get the book is based on outside influence – the author’s credibility, the rating online, the cover, the highlighted quotes on the back of the book, the price even.</p><p>Or in other words, you make decisions based on what you see with your eyes, not on what’s the actual product all about. A lot of times, this can be deceiving.</p><ul><li><strong>Feature-positive effect</strong>: Product creators emphasize on the key components. Since they want to sell you stuff, they’ll most probably hide, or make hard to obtain, the actual benefits you’ll get. This is how marketing campaigns are made – by stressing on the best features and by adding disclaimers with tiny fonts.</li><li><strong>Survivorship bias</strong>: By exposing ourselves to loud newly-rich founders shouting online that they “made it” under 3 months, we start to dream of our own villa-style life. But this is the wrong approach. Survivorship bias explains that we have a tendency to focus only on things that survived – big corporations, rich people, old buildings that are still holding. This way we fail to register all the things that didn’t survive – all the founders and the companies that bankrupted in just a few years. Before making a conclusion, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/bullshit-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quitting your job</a> to start your own company, consider what didn’t endure.</li><li><strong>The problem with averages</strong>: Averages are deceiving. For example, the average salary in the US is around $54,000. If 5 US citizens who get the statistical middle salary are in a room and Bill Gates enters, the average will immediately skyrocket. But does this mean that the other folks in the room are richer? Of course not. Or in other words, things are not evenly distributed. You should keep this in mind when making calculations.</li></ul><blockquote><p>We have problems perceiving nonevents. We are blind to what does not exist. We realize if there is a war, but we do not appreciate the absence of war during peacetime. If we are healthy, we rarely think about being sick. Or, if we get off the plane in Cancún, we do not stop to notice that we did not crash. If we thought more frequently about absence, we might well be happier.” Rolf Dobelli</p></blockquote><h3 id="7-lesson-4-experts-are-rarely-that-experienced">Lesson #4: Experts Are Rarely That Experienced</h3><p>Rarely in life, or in a certain field, there is someone who knows everything. A know-it-all guru if you must.</p><p>But that’s not what we see online these days.</p><p>A thousand-of-followers online magnet shares something and immediately the crowd is convinced that this excerpt without a context will transform their existence – like a magic pill.</p><p>We unquestionably believe authority figures. We don’t dare to question their expertise. “They have it all figured out,” we tell ourselves. “What they say must be correct.”</p><p>But that’s rarely true in every occasion.</p><p>People simply link any problem to their field. As the author writes, “Surgeons want to solve almost every medical problem with a scalpel, even if their patients could be treated with less invasive methods.”</p><ul><li><strong>Déformation professionnelle</strong>: Mark Twain famously said, “If your only tool is a hammer, all your problems will be nails.” Don’t expect the best solution from an expert. Expect a solution based on their specific area of expertise. Based on their experience. Based on what they, themselves, know. It can be a good solution to your problem but don’t hope for the ultimate best solution. No one is a know-it-all guru.</li><li><strong>Strategic misrepresentation</strong>: People lie in interviews. People will tell you what you want to hear to get the deal. Hell, people even lease sports cars to signal to others that they are successful. Everyone is trying to sound and look better than they really are. This is normal for us, humans. But this is something you need to consider when negotiating a deal.</li><li><strong>Illusion of skill</strong>: Luck plays a bigger role than skill does. Even if you started and later sold a company for millions, this doesn’t mean that you have superpowers. People get lucky all the time and confuse it with abilities they don’t really possess. Maybe your last project was blessed by the gods, maybe your co-founder did most of the job. Even if it’s not true, don’t boast too much about your skills. Don’t imagine that everything you do turns into gold. Rather, focus on further improving your skill-set.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Certain people make a living from their abilities, such as pilots, plumbers, and lawyers. In other areas, skill is necessary but not critical, as with entrepreneurs and leaders. Finally, chance is the deciding factor in a number of fields, such as in financial markets. Here, the illusion of skill pervades.” Rolf Dobelli</p></blockquote><h3 id="8-lesson-5-what-not-to-do-is-more-important-than-what-to-do">Lesson #5: What Not To Do Is More Important Than What To Do</h3><p>A piece of rock. That’s what sculptors need to create a statue.</p><p>And how do they do it? By simply removing the excess mass of rock …</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>

The Vision framework has been enhanced with some exciting new updates for iOS 14.</p><p id="e167">Through iOS 13, Apple expanded the breadth of the Vision framework by introducing a variety of requests ranging from text recognition to built-in image classification and improvements in face recognition and detection.</p><p id="8027">In iOS 14, Apple has focused many of its efforts on increasing the depth of its Vision framework.</p><p id="26af">Primarily, the new Vision requests introduced in iOS 14 enable new ways to perform action classification and analysis, which will help developers build immersive gameplay experiences, fitness apps, and sports coaching-based applications (something that’s has seen a huge demand in recent times).</p><p id="9849">Let’s dig through the new Vision requests and utilities that were announced at WWDC 2020.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="565c"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/new-in-ios-14-vision-contour-detection-68fd5849816e">Contour detection</a> finds outlines of shapes in an image. It looks to join all the continuous points that have the same color or intensity. This request finds good use in scenarios like coin detection and finding other objects in an image and grouping them by size, aspect ratio, etc.</p><p id="c94c">Here’s the sample code used to initiate a Vision contour detection request:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2720/1*5RfjRBZgg--s7F1qeqrcmA.png" width="1360" height="472" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*5RfjRBZgg--s7F1qeqrcmA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*5RfjRBZgg--s7F1qeqrcmA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*5RfjRBZgg--s7F1qeqrcmA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5RfjRBZgg--s7F1qeqrcmA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*5RfjRBZgg--s7F1qeqrcmA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2860">Like every Vision request, the idea is simple: pass the Vision request into a <code>VNImageRequestHandler</code> for images, and get the results in <code>VNObservation</code>.</p><p id="8d98">Core Image is a really handy framework for pre-processing images for contour detection requests. It helps smooth textures, which in turn lets us simplify contours and mask parts that aren’t in the region of interest.</p><p id="b45a">The below screenshot shows what happens when you use the wrong filter for pre-processing (adds more contours instead of reducing them, in the left image):</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1898/1*sCyfc16Dzsgqdjmq9aqhWA.png" width="949" height="768" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*sCyfc16Dzsgqdjmq9aqhWA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*sCyfc16Dzsgqdjmq9aqhWA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*sCyfc16Dzsgqdjmq9aqhWA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*sCyfc16Dzsgqdjmq9aqhWA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*sCyfc16Dzsgqdjmq9aqhWA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/new-in-ios-14-vision-contour-detection-68fd5849816e">Article Link</a></figcaption></figure><p id="c774"><code>VNGeometryUtils</code> is also a handy utility class introduced this year for analyzing contour shapes, bounding circles, area, and diameter.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="9e65"><code>VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequest</code> deals with the directional flow of individual pixels across frames, and is used in motion estimation, surveillance tracking, and video processing.</p><p id="7739">Unlike image registration, which tells you the alignment of the whole image with respect to another image, optical flow helps in analyzing only regions that have changed based on the pixel shifts.</p><p id="4dcb">Optical flow is one of the trickiest computer vision algorithms to master, primarily due to the fact that it’s highly sensitive to noise (even a shadow could play a huge role in changing the final results).</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1164/1*-rPeODurrn4HV1S1nJfXAg.png" width="582" height="503" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*-rPeODurrn4HV1S1nJfXAg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*-rPeODurrn4HV1S1nJfXAg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1164/1*-rPeODurrn4HV1S1nJfXAg.png 582w" sizes="582px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-rPeODurrn4HV1S1nJfXAg.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From WWDC 2020 Video</a></figcaption></figure><p id="00ef">iOS 14 also introduced <code>VNStatefulRequest</code>, a subclass of <code>VNImageRequest</code> which takes into consideration the previous Vision results.

Amongst the other things, you can detect and track a given number of hands and also analyze the kinds of instruments a person is interacting or playing(example: guitars and keyboards).</p><p id="ae39">Another exciting use case of hand pose is in auto-capturing selfies in your custom camera-based applications.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2072/1*UzhHU_laQcP_hM-Oe3JcHQ.png" width="1036" height="705" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*UzhHU_laQcP_hM-Oe3JcHQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*UzhHU_laQcP_hM-Oe3JcHQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*UzhHU_laQcP_hM-Oe3JcHQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*UzhHU_laQcP_hM-Oe3JcHQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*UzhHU_laQcP_hM-Oe3JcHQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From WWDC 2020 Video</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a312">Human body pose estimation is another exciting addition to the Vision framework this year. By leveraging the <code>VNDetectHumanBodyPoseRequest</code>, you can identify different body poses of multiple people in a given frame.</p><p id="75f9">From tracking if your exercise form is correct to determining the perfect action shot in a video to creating stromotion effects (by using different body poses of a person across frames and blending them), the possibilities of using body pose in camera-based applications are endless.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="7244"><code>VNDetectTrajectoriesRequest</code> is used for identifying and analyzing trajectories across multiple frames of videos and live photos.

The results (there would be multiple trajectories) returned in the <code>VNTrajectoryObservation</code> instance provides us with detected and projected points. Project points are extremely handy for estimating where the target object is in real-world space. Just imagine—building a hawk-eye projection is now possible on-device using Vision in iOS 14.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="b1b7">Last but not the least is the new utility class <code>VNVideoProcessor</code>, which lets you perform Vision requests on videos offline. <code>VNVideoProcess</code> lets you pass a video asset URL, set the time range for which you want to run the Vision requests, and add or remove requests easily.</p><p id="0163">Now, this might not look fancy, but it’s the most underrated introduction in the Vision framework this year.</p><p id="6439">From detecting anomalies in videos to analyzing if the content is NSFW or not before playing, the possibilities of this utility class are truly limitless. Moreover, trajectory detection and optical flow requests require a steady camera, preferably with a tripod, which makes the introduction of the offline video processor a great addition.</p><p id="4d71">As a side note, with the introduction of a native <code>VideoPlayer</code> in SwiftUI 2.0 this year, <code>VNVideoProcessor</code> will only boost pure SwiftUI computer vision applications that do more than just image processing. The SwiftUI Video Player and <code>VNVideoProcessor</code> are a match made in heaven.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="c3b9">Apple’s Vision framework has been regularly receiving interesting updates over the years, and WWDC 2020 has only pushed the envelope further.</p><p id="cfb8">From the look of it, the collection of Vision requests introduced this year— namely, hand and pose, trajectory detection, and optical flow—are key players for augmented reality and might eventually play a huge role in how users interact with Apple’s much-anticipated AR glasses.</p><p id="8013">By introducing these exciting Vision requests this year, the Cupertino tech giant has just showcased the possibilities and new use cases of computer vision in mobile applications.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d0aa"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

July 22, 2020 | https://pulseasync.com/blog/p2-review-alternatives/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pulseasync.com/blog/p2-review-alternatives/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article"><p>Automattic, along with a handful of other companies, deserves most of the credit for contributing to the playbook of distributed work.</p>
<p>The shift to remote work, as I explained in <a href="https://pulseasync.com/operators/future-remote-working/">context over control</a>, is not merely a change in physical locations, but it will have much broader implications in terms of how future companies operate.</p>
<p>More than any other company, Automattic, helped an entire generation of founders, entrepreneurs and operators lead the transition to decentralized work by sharing internal practices.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, many members of Automattic's leadership team shared a lot about how they operate in terms of tools, workflows, internal best practices and more. Specifically, they talked extensively on how they communicate internally.</p>
<p>A decade-plus of experimentation has led them to its current set of tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>Zoom</li>
<li>Wikis (Field Guides)</li>
<li>P2</li>
</ol>
<p>Three out of four items on this list are widely recognized products. Yet, as Matt Muellenweg, Founder/CEO at Automattic, explained many times it's actually the fourth one that was able to change how Automattic worked.</p>
<p>As Muellenweg himself put in the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/america-wakes-up-an-interview-with-matt-mullenweg-about-working-from-home/">last interview</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson?lang=en">Ben Thompson</a> from on the Stratechery Daily Podcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ben: One thing that that really stood out to me about being at Automattic was that internal blogging system. And I think the point here is not necessarily the technology per se, obviously it was built on WordPress, but rather this idea that teams would every day summarize what they were working on and the problems they encountered, the discussions they had and this idea that it became a cultural norm at Automattic where every day you start work by reading the P2’s and seeing what was going on, and I actually felt that despite the fact I was in Taiwan in a different time zone than a lot of people at Automattic, I felt like I knew more about what was happening at Automattic than I did when I was going into an office every day at other jobs.</p>
<p>MM: Yeah, that internal blogging system. I think every company needs an equivalent of it, regardless of what’s powering it. It provides transparency versus an email chain where everything’s private; it’s locked up in someone’s box. If someone leaves, it’s all gone. For example, every post you made or comment you made on an internal system, or that people made to you, is all still available in the search index. And we have a kind of an internal version of Google alerts, so when you’re mentioned or a topic you follow, you can find it, but you can control what you follow, just like a Google Reader where you can say these are things I want to follow, but then all this other stuff, don’t push it in my inbox and mix it up with external communication, all these other things. I would love to productize this, I wish it was already ready to go, but in the meantime it’s all open source so companies can run their own P2 instance wherever they want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Automattic recently released a new version of P2 specifically built for remote teams. We had a chance to take an early look at it and this article is an extensive review of it.</p>
<p>If you've been hearing or reading of P2 for quite some time and you've been looking to see if this can work for your organization, this is for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-p2-and-where-does-it-fit-in-the-stack"><a href="#what-is-p2-and-where-does-it-fit-in-the-stack" aria-label="what is p2 and where does it fit in the stack permalink"></a>What is P2 and Where Does It Fit in the Stack?</h2>
<p>First things first.</p>
<p>What's P2? P2 is a blog theme that allows users to share updates through a Twitter-esque interface. Users can share well-thought written updates to the entire company through a public newsfeed.</p>
<p>The theme was originally developed by WordPress under the name Prologue. Around 2006, Automattic started to use it internally for centralized <a href="https://pulseasync.com/operators/speed-of-communication/">asynchronous communication</a>; they then developed a second version of it. From there, the name P(prologue)2.</p>
<p>As Muellenweg explained in an old blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a disconnect we couldn’t reconcile: even though our internal blogs didn’t work out most of the company was active on Twitter every day. (WordPress users are some of the most passionate adopters of micro-blogging.)
We found a solution in Prologue which added a posting box to the home page and gave it a Twitter-like feel. Now Automattic had a pulse, a place where the incredible amount of activity was chronicled and captured. It was low-friction and hassle-free, we all started using it more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's take a step back, before we get to see the product, and explore how exactly P2 is different from Email or Slack.</p>
<h3 id="slack-vs-p2"><a href="#slack-vs-p2" aria-label="slack vs p2 permalink"></a>Slack vs P2</h3>
<p>Slack is a chat tool. It's designed for synchronous communication, hence the go-to product for quick and casual internal conversations. On the other hand, P2 leans toward a well-thought longer type of communication as opposed to instant messages.</p>
<p>To some extent P2 is kind of a slow thinking version of Slack.</p>
<p>Automatticians use P2 to make official something. Whether it's a global announcement around an acquisition, a new internal feature release, a particularly relevant discussion, a new important decision, or a department report.</p>
<p>P2 is essentially a replacement for all internal emails.</p>
<h2 id="email-vs-p2"><a href="#email-vs-p2" aria-label="email vs p2 permalink"></a>Email vs P2</h2>
<p>Wait, but we said a few weeks ago email is an <a href="https://pulseasync.com/operators/speed-of-communication/">asynchronous communication tool</a>. If that's what we're aiming for after all, why do we even need to replace it?</p>
<p>Replacing <a href="https://pulseasync.com/blog/internal-email-alternatives/">internal emails</a> with an internal blog system is one of the best things you can possibly do to reduce email overload, busy work, and (most importantly) information silos.</p>
<p>When company and department updates, project specs, design mock-ups, and individual daily or weekly update reports move away from siloed email inbox to a private internal blog, they not only becomes permanently stored and accessible, but over time this ends up creating some form of collective intelligence.</p>
<p>To an extent, this almost ends up being to the company processes and culture, what a GitHub repository is to engineering.</p>
<p>This collective organization brain is critical not just to the current employees but also to the ones who are yet to join the company.</p>
<p>Streamlining communications and cutting down on the back-and-forth emails is only the superficial benefit of pulling communications out of the inbox and replacing it with a P2-like system. The true benefit is your company being able to consistently rely on a single, centralized, and secure source of truth, rather than a few decentralized individual brains.</p>
<p>P2, unlike email or chat, is the kind of tool that can help you in this important transition.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's look at P2 and see what this is all about.</p>
<p>Beware, P2 is still in private beta, you need an invite from the Automattic team to get onboard.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-a-new-p2"><a href="#setting-up-a-new-p2" aria-label="setting up a new p2 permalink"></a>Setting Up a New P2</h3>
<p>Once you click on the URL from your invite email, you'll be asked to enter a <strong>team name</strong> and <strong>workspace name</strong>. </p>
<p>The workspace&nbsp;name is what you will see as a public domain of your URL.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/wordpress-p2-signup.png" alt="p2-signup"></p>
<p>You'll need a WordPress account to get in there. Once you do that, click <strong>Connect</strong> to get access to the workspace.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/wordpress-p2-connect-account.png" alt="p2-connect-account"></p>
<p>If everything goes well, you'll land on the home page of your newly created P2 workspace.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulse-website-temp.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/articles/Screenshot%202020-07-13%20at%2015.42.31.png" alt="p2-homepage"></p>
<h3 id="create-posts-on-p2"><a href="#create-posts-on-p2" aria-label="create posts on p2 permalink"></a>Create Posts on P2</h3>
<p>P2 has been designed from the ground for a longer type of communication. The editor deliberately focuses the author on the composition of a long-form message.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/new-post-on-wordpress-p2.png" alt="new-post-on-wordpress-p2"></p>
<p>The P2 editor allows you to go beyond basic text and images, by supporting rich text embeds such for Tweets, Instagram posts, YouTube videos, or even Spotify playlists.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/wordpress-p2-post-editor.gif" alt="wordpress-p2-post-editor"></p>
<p>As far as the reader experience, P2 makes it easy for you to catch up on posts that you might have missed with three sections on the left sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/catchup-wordpress-p2.png" alt="catchup-wordpress-p2"></p>
<p>P2 also offers a wide range of shortcuts to make you faster at navigating through existing posts.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/shortcuts-wordpress-p2.png" alt="shortcuts-wordpress-p2"></p>

<p>The editor for comments in P2 is just as flexible as the one you use for posts.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/comments-on-wordpress-p2.gif" alt="comments-on-wordpress-p2"></p>
<p>Whether you're in a P2 post or comment, you can directly @mention any of the existing members in your P2 account.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/mentioned-wordpress-p2.png" alt="user-mentioned-wordpress-p2"></p>
<h3 id="people-management-on-p2"><a href="#people-management-on-p2" aria-label="people management on p2 permalink"></a>People Management on P2</h3>
<p>People management on P2 is not as easy as other more established communication platforms.</p>
<p>To manage people in your workspace, navigate to: <em>Admin &gt; Manage &gt; People &gt; Team</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/people-management-on-wordpress-p2.png" alt="people-management-on-wordpress-p2"></p>
<p>To invite a new user to your P2 team, click Manage Team. You can invite members on P2 in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>By Invitation Link</li>
<li>By Email or Usernames</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/invite-people-to-wordpress-p2.png" alt="invite-people-to-wordpress-p2"></p>
<p>The five available roles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Administrator</em>
An Administrator has full power over the site and can do everything related to site administration*. They are also the only role that can see WordAds revenue and manage ad settings.</li>
<li><em>Editors</em>
An Editor can create, edit, publish, and delete any post or page (not just their own), as well as moderate comments and manage categories, tags, and links.</li>
<li><em>Authors</em>
An Author can create, edit, publish, and delete only their own posts, as well as upload files and images. Authors do not have access to create, modify, or delete pages, nor can they modify posts by other users. Authors can edit comments made on their posts.</li>
<li><em>Followers</em>
Followers do not have any editing privileges on your site; they are simply people who have signed up to receive updates each time you publish a new post. The only thing they can do on your site is leave comments (if you have them enabled), though they do not have to be a Follower of a specific post to do so.</li>
<li><em>Viewers</em>
Viewers are users who can only view private sites. Like Followers, Viewers do not have any editing privileges. All they can do is simply read the private site they were invited to and leave comments on it (again, only if you’ve enabled them).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can learn more about <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/user-roles/">user's role here</a>.</p>
<p>In the team page you'll also see Followers by emails, but since P2 is a form a private blogging, you shouldn’t expect to see anyone in the category.</p>
<h3 id="quicklinks-on-p2"><a href="#quicklinks-on-p2" aria-label="quicklinks on p2 permalink"></a>Quicklinks on P2</h3>
<p>Each team or department of every organization gets work done in their own way and with their own set of tools. Developers with GitHub, Asana or AWS. Designers with Figma, Sketch or InVision.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/wordpress-p2-quicklinks.png" alt="wordpress-p2-quicklinks"></p>
<p>For each P2 you create, you'll have a dedicated quicklinks section. To add a new link, go to: Menu &gt; Manage Links &gt; Menus &gt; Primary &gt; Add Items &gt; Custom Links, then click Add to Menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/wordpress-p2-add-new-quicklink.png" alt="wordpress-p2-add-new-quicklink"></p>
<h2 id="use-cases-on-p2"><a href="#use-cases-on-p2" aria-label="use cases on p2 permalink"></a>Use Cases on P2</h2>
<p>P2 has become the cornerstone of Automattic culture over the last decade. Its usage pervades …</p></div></div>

Leveraging our open-source static analysis tool Checkov, we scanned the Registry to gauge compliance of modules across categories and cloud providers.</p> <p>Read the full the report <a href="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/state-of-open-source-terraform-security-2020.pdf?pdf=State-of-Terraform-Security">here</a> to dig into some of our top findings:</p> <ul> <li>Nearly 1 in 2 modules used to build resources for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud is misconfigured.</li> <li>Misconfigured modules have been downloaded over 15 million times since 2017.</li> <li>Q2 2020 had the highest quarter-over-quarter module growth and an increase in misconfigurations.</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/state-of-open-source-terraform-security-2020.pdf?pdf=State-of-Terraform-Security"><img onload="Wpfcll.r(this,true);" src="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/plugins/wp-fastest-cache-premium/pro/images/blank.gif" data-wpfc-original-src="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-banner-capital.png" alt="blank" width="1456" height="240" data-wpfc-original-srcset="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-banner-capital.png 1456w, https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-banner-capital-300x49.png 300w, https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-banner-capital-1024x169.png 1024w, https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-banner-capital-768x127.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1456px) 100vw, 1456px"></a></p> <p>Infrastructure-as-code security is one of—if not <strong>the</strong>—biggest cloud security challenges facing cloud-native teams today. Traditional security posture management solutions lack visibility into code that provisions cloud resources, and developers rely on the governance of resources in production. The resulting misalignment is a huge challenge that we’ve seen all too often in the last year.</p> <p>To help shed light on this challenge, address its risks, and provide suggestions on how to overcome it, we’re thrilled to publish this security research report.</p> <h2>Overall compliance of the Terraform Registry</h2> <p>As the biggest consolidated resource for open-source IaC modules, the Terraform Registry represents a big portion of the overall infrastructure-as-code ecosystem. That’s why we started here—to see how the community prioritizes security and gauge the general state of infrastructure-as-code security.</p> <p>One of the key messages in this report is that there’s a lot of room for improvement when it comes to defining security controls within individual&nbsp;IaC&nbsp;resources.</p> <p><a href="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/state-of-open-source-terraform-security-2020.pdf?pdf=State-of-Terraform-Security"><img onload="Wpfcll.r(this,true);" src="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/plugins/wp-fastest-cache-premium/pro/images/blank.gif" data-wpfc-original-src="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-1.png" alt="blank" width="1073" height="713" data-wpfc-original-srcset="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-1.png 1073w, https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-1-300x199.png 300w, https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-1-1024x680.png 1024w, https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-1-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1073px) 100vw, 1073px"></a></p> <p>We also delve into the modules by popularity to get a more contextual sense of how misconfigurations are utilized in real applications. The Registry is a widely used resource—its modules have been downloaded over 26M times—which means misconfigurations in popular modules can have a huge impact.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/state-of-open-source-terraform-security-2020.pdf?pdf=State-of-Terraform-Security">Read the full report to see which of the top downloaded modules are misconfigured.</a></strong></p> <h2>Compliance across cloud providers</h2> <p>Compliance best practices and configuration settings differ across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. <span>To narrow in on misconfigured categories within each cloud provider, we look at both the most prevalent check categories across providers and the most frequently occurring failing checks in each.</span></p> <p><a href="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/state-of-open-source-terraform-security-2020.pdf?pdf=State-of-Terraform-Security"><img onload="Wpfcll.r(this,true);" src="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/plugins/wp-fastest-cache-premium/pro/images/blank.gif" data-wpfc-original-src="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-3-1.png" alt="blank" width="1073" height="713" data-wpfc-original-srcset="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-3-1.png 1073w, https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-3-1-300x199.png 300w, https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-3-1-1024x680.png 1024w, https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-3-1-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1073px) 100vw, 1073px"></a></p> <p>Going a step further, we also identify trends within specific categories and provide analysis on why some misconfigurations are common, and how to prevent them.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://bridgecrew.io/wp-content/uploads/state-of-open-source-terraform-security-2020.pdf?pdf=State-of-Terraform-Security">Read the full report to see which categories are most commonly misconfigured.</a></strong></p>  <p>At Bridgecrew, we believe that defining cloud security controls as early as possible is best practice. Not only is it the best way to prevent risk in the first place, but it’s also the most cost-effective approach to securing cloud infrastructure at scale.

July 22, 2020 | https://roettgers.co/gatsby-i18n/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://roettgers.co/gatsby-i18n/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>There are multiple Gatsby plugins for handling a multi-language website, most of them are very complicated or outdated. In this post I outline how I wrote my own small library to manage translations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heads up: This approach is not very scalable and therefore not well suited for large pages. I recommend the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/localization-i18n/">Gatsby documentation on i18n</a> to find a different implementation that suits you better.</p>
<p><strong>This approach works best for side projects, blogs, portfolio and e-commerce sites</strong></p>
<h2 id="theapproach">The Approach</h2>
<p>My approach to this problem was to basically run two sites of the same codebase. During the build progress, I would decide based on an environment variable which language to display. I would then query all translations from a json file and pass them in, wherever I need them.</p>
<h2 id="thebuildprocess">The Build Process</h2>
<p>There are two methods to this, you can either store your language in a <code>.env</code> file to read from it during development, or define multiple npm scripts, which set the variable before running <code>gatsby build</code> or other methods. To keep the code DRY I have decided to use a <code>.env</code> file. To do this you will have to install <code>dotenv</code> with your favourite package manager:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add dotenv
</code></pre>
<p><code>dotenv</code> reads all environment variables from your <code>.env</code> file and adds them to your shell.</p>
<p>After you have installed doting, create a <code>.env</code> file at your project’s root if you do not already have one and add this to it:</p>
<pre><code>LANGUAGE="en"
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we are ready to use this in our <code>gatsby-config.js</code>, add the following lines to your config:</p>
<pre><code>// we need to configure `dotenv` at the very top of the project
require("dotenv").config()

// this should go into your config object
siteMetadata: {
    language: process.env.LANGUAGE
 },
</code></pre>
<p>Now you will be able to access the language everywhere in your code, via a GraphQL query similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>query {
  site {
    siteMetadata {
      language
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: We need to make the language available via GraphQL, since your environment variable will not be available to you in the components when someone visits your website.</em></p>

<p>The easiest way to query or translations, is to do it via GraphQL, as we do with basically all things in Gatsby. To query json files, we need to add two plugins to our project.<br>
<code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code> allows you to query files in your filesystem and <code>gatsby-transformer-json</code> will let you access the contents of your <code>.json</code> files via GraphQL.<br>
First install them via your favourite package manager:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-transformer-json
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you will need to configure both in your <code>gatsby-config.js</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>// ...
plugins: [
	// ...
	{
      resolve: "gatsby-transformer-json",
      options: {
		// with this option, your translations will be available in GraphQL as `allTranslation`
        typeName: "Translation"
      }
    },
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-source-filesystem",
      options: {
        name: "translations",
        path: `${__dirname}/src/locale`
      }
    }
],
// ...
</code></pre>
<p>Next, create a new folder at the location <code>src/locale</code> and create a new file named <code>translations.json</code> in it (or name it differently, it does not make a difference).<br>
This file will contain all strings and we will structure it like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
  {
    "key": "some-descriptive-key",
    "de": "This is the version for the language de",
    "en": "This is the version for the language en"
  }
]
</code></pre>
<p>With everything created, we can move on to creating hooks and integrating them into our components and pages.</p>
<h2 id="thehooks">The Hooks</h2>
<p><em>Hooray, React Hooks! Don’t worry, we’re not doing anything advanced</em></p>
<p>First, we’ll create a new hook <code>useLanguage</code> which will return the currently active language. I would recommend creating a new directory at <code>src/hooks/</code> for the hooks. In that directory create a new file <code>use-language.js</code> and add the following code to it:</p>
<pre><code>import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby';

export default function useLanguage() {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    {
      site {
        siteMetadata {
          language
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  return data.site.siteMetadata.language;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here we are defining a function or hook called <code>useLanguage</code>, which queries the language from GraphQL and returns it. _ Not too hard, right?_</p>
<p>Next up, we’ll create the hook <code>useTranslation</code>, this will return a function, which we can use to query the string for a given key. Create a new file called <code>use-translation.js</code> and add the following code to it:</p>
<pre><code>import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby';
import useLanguage from './use-language';

export default function useTranslation() {
  const query = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    {
      allTranslation {
        nodes {
          key
          en
          de
        }
      }
    }
  `);
  let data = {};
  query.allTranslation.nodes.forEach(val =&gt; {
    const key = val.key;
    data[key] = {
      en: val.en,
      de: val.de,
    };
  });

  const lang = useLanguage();

  return key =&gt; {
    return data[key][lang];
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p>This hook queries all translations from GraphQL (the results are cached during the build process by Gatsby). It then loops over them, to convert them to a dictionary. Finally, it uses our other hook <code>useLanguage</code> to get the active language and returns a function which takes a key and returns the corresponding string.</p>
<h2 id="optionallanguageswitcher">Optional: Language Switcher</h2>
<p>We can’t make proper use of translations, without allowing the user to switch between multiple languages. Let’s write a quick component which solves this problem:</p>
<pre><code>// I named this file `language-switch.js` and put it in my `src/components` directory
import React from 'react';
import useLanguage from '../hooks/use-language';

const LanguageSwitcher = ({ ...props }) =&gt; {
  const lng = useLanguage() == 'en' ? 'de' : 'en';

  return (
    &lt;a
      href={
        lng == 'en'
          ? 'https://yourdeversionofthewebsite.com'
          : 'https://yourenversionofthewebsite.com'
      }
      {...props}
    &gt;
      View in {lng == 'en' ? '🇬🇧' : '🇩🇪'}
    &lt;/a&gt;
  );
};

export default LanguageSwitcher;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we use our <code>useLanguage</code> hook to get the active language and return a link pointing to the other version of the website. (Obviously, this would need to be solved differently, if we used this approach with multiple languages)</p>
<h2 id="theimplementation">The Implementation</h2>
<p>Now with all hooks and components created, it should be fairly straight forward to implement this:<br>
At the top of every component that currently contains strings that should be translated, use the <code>useTranslation</code> hook:</p>
<pre><code>const t = useTranslation();
</code></pre>
<p>Now go through the component: Replace each of those strings with <code>t("my-very-descriptive-key")</code> and add the corresponding entry to your <code>translations.json</code> file.</p>
<p>After you have done this, you can add the <code>LanguageSwitcher</code> component to your navigation bar, or somewhere else, where it is easily visible.</p>
<h2 id="opportunitiestoexpandthisimplementation">Opportunities to expand this implementation</h2>
<p>There are a few problems with this implementation you might encounter as the content of the site grows, but they should be fairly to address:</p>
<h3 id="theuserdoesntautomaticallylandonthecorrectlytranslatedsite">The user doesn’t automatically land on the correctly translated site</h3>
<p>With other solutions, all paths get prefixed with a language code. In this solution, the domain gets prefixed with a language code, or it uses a country specific TLD. To make sure the user lands on the correct page, we could check which region the user’s browser reports and redirect them if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="thetranslationsfilegetscrowdedveryquickly">The translations file gets crowded very quickly</h3>
<p>After at least 50 strings, you will find yourself using ctrl+f to find the string you want to edit, obviously this isn’t very scalable. <code>gatsby-transformer-json</code>, should by default take all JSON nodes and integrate them into one GraphQL query, but I haven’t tested if this works out of the box. If it doesn’t there should only be a few changes necessary to <code>use-translation.js</code>. Then we could split up the strings into one file per component or page.</p>

    Posted on <time datetime="2020-07-06">6 July 2020</time>
  </header>
  <p><a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> is well-known for its ability to forward TCP ports from a local host to a remote host and vice versa. Typical use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Access an otherwise unreachable server via a bastion host.</p></li>
<li><p>Access the loopback interface of a remote host.</p></li>
<li><p>Expose a local network service to a remote host.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, I had an interesting variant of the third use case: I wanted to expose a local network service — in this case, an inherently insecure <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/rfb/rfb.xml">RFB</a> server — via a remote host on condition that only a select user could connect to the exposed service. That is, I wanted to control access to the remote forwarding. It turned out that Unix domain socket forwardings are better suited than TCP port forwardings in this case.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this post, I explain why it is difficult to control access to a TCP port forwarding, and how you can control access using a Unix domain socket forwarding instead. Moreover, I describe how to restrict forwardings to select TCP ports respectively socket files.</p>
<h2 id="tcp-port-forwarding">TCP port forwarding</h2>
<p>The following command forwards port 8080 on a remote host to port 80 on the local host:<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -nNT \
      -R 8080:localhost:80 \
      -o "ExitOnForwardFailure yes" \
      remote_host</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you can restrict port forwardings by means of the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/sshd_config"><code>sshd_config(5)</code></a> or an <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/sshd#AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE_FORMAT"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> file.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> For example, the following settings restrict the user Alex to listen to — and thus forward — remote port 8080 only:</p>
<pre><code>Match User alex
  AllowTcpForwarding remote
  PermitOpen none
  PermitListen 8080
  PermitTTY no
  ForceCommand /bin/echo 'ssh command forced by sshd_config(5)'</code></pre>
<p>However, as the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/sshd_config#AllowTcpForwarding">man page clearly states</a>, users with access to a shell can generally bypass this restriction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AllowTcpForwarding</strong></p>
<p>Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted. The available options are <strong>yes</strong> (the default) or <strong>all</strong> to allow TCP forwarding, <strong>no</strong> to prevent all TCP forwarding, <strong>local</strong> to allow local (from the perspective of ssh(1)) forwarding only or <strong>remote</strong> to allow remote forwarding only. Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their own forwarders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the following command uses the infamous <a href="https://nc110.sourceforge.io/">netcat</a> utility — in this case OpenBSD’s widespread reimplementation, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/nc"><code>nc(1)</code></a> — to query the exposed HTTP service at port 8080:</p>
<pre><code>$ printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" \
    | ssh -T remote_host nc localhost 8080</code></pre>
<p>As far as I know, you have two practical options to control access to forwardings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Add user-specific rules to your firewall of choice, if supported. For example, the <a href="http://ipset.netfilter.org/iptables-extensions.man.html#lbBP">owner module</a> of <a href="http://ipset.netfilter.org/iptables.man.html"><code>iptables(8)</code></a> enables you to match the user ID and the group ID of a local packet creator.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unix_domain_socket&amp;oldid=949050080">Unix domain sockets</a> instead of TCP ports, and protect the special socket files just like regular files — i.e., set the file owner, group, and mode using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/chown"><code>chown(8)</code></a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/chmod"><code>chmod(1)</code></a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="unix-domain-socket-forwarding">Unix domain socket forwarding</h2>
<p>OpenSSH supports Unix domain socket forwarding out of the box.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Simply specify a file name instead of a TCP port. For example, the following command creates, binds to, and forwards a socket on a remote host to port 80 on the local host:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -nNT \
      -R /var/run/http.sock:localhost:80 \
      -o "ExitOnForwardFailure yes" \
      remote_host</code></pre>
<p>With this, you can query the exposed HTTP service again using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/nc"><code>nc(1)</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" \
    | ssh -T remote_host nc -U /var/run/http.sock</code></pre>
<p>There are two caveats, though:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The file name of the socket must contain a forward slash. Otherwise, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/ssh"><code>ssh(1)</code></a> misinterprets the socket name as a TCP port.</p></li>
<li><p>The file name of the socket should not rely on <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/ksh#Tilde_expansion">tilde expansion</a>. That is, use <code>/home/alex/http.sock</code> instead of <code>~/http.sock</code> or <code>~alex/http.sock</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You must not re-bind an existing socket by default.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Set <code>StreamLocalBindUnlink yes</code> in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/sshd_config"><code>sshd_config(5)</code></a> to allow this.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/sshd_config"><code>sshd_config(5)</code></a> options equivalent to <code>PermitOpen</code> and <code>PermitListen</code> for Unix domain sockets. That is, you cannot restrict the file name of the socket.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>However, if you really want to restrict the socket’s file name, then we can build upon the netcat trick from above.</p>
<h2 id="restricting-the-sockets-file-name">Restricting the socket’s file name</h2>
<p>This time we’ll use <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html"><code>socat(1)</code></a>, another successor of netcat.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The following command effectively establishes the same forwarding as the previous one: it creates, binds to, and forwards a socket on a remote host to port 80 on the local host.</p>
<pre><code>$ socat \
    EXEC:'ssh -T remote_host socat "UNIX-LISTEN:/var/run/http.sock,fork,unlink-early" STDIO' \
    TCP4:127.0.0.1:80,fork</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, the command builds the following bidirectional stream:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html"><code>socat(1)</code></a> pipes the remote socket to standard input/output on the remote host.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/ssh"><code>ssh(1)</code></a> pipes this input/output from the remote host to the local host.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html"><code>socat(1)</code></a> pipes the input/output from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/ssh"><code>ssh(1)</code></a> to port 80 on the local host.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With this, we can restrict the socket’s name by means of the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/sshd_config"><code>sshd_config</code></a> or an <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/sshd#AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE_FORMAT"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> file as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Match User alex
  DisableForwarding yes
  PermitTTY no
  ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/socat UNIX-LISTEN:/var/run/http.sock,fork,unlink-early STDIO</code></pre>
<p>With these settings, the previous commands comes down to the following, where <code>forced-command</code> is an optional no-op reminder:</p>
<pre><code>$ socat \
    EXEC:'ssh -T remote_host forced-command' \
    TCP4:127.0.0.1:80,fork</code></pre>
<p>Finally, a client may connect to this socket as follows — regardless of how we created the socket:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -nNT \
      -L 3000:/var/run/http.sock \
      -o "ExitOnForwardFailure yes" \
      remote_host
$ curl http://localhost:3000/</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/ssh"><code>ssh(1)</code></a>’s <code>ExitOnForwardFailure</code> option does not catch missing permissions to access the socket file. Thus, if the final <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html"><code>curl(1)</code></a> command fails and you cannot actually use the forwarding, please check the group and the mode of the socket file created by <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html"><code>socat(1)</code></a> on the remote host. You can set the group and mode using the corresponding <code>UNIX-LISTEN</code> options.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>OpenSSH is able to forward TCP ports and Unix domain sockets. The server can be configured to restrict who may open respectively listen to which port. However, users with access to a shell can generally bypass this restriction. In particular, any user with access to a shell can open any forwarded port. Thus, you might want to use Unix domain sockets instead of TCP ports for remote forwardings. This way, you can control access to the special socket file, and thus to the forwarded network service. You can restrict the socket’s file name by forcing a special command instead of using the built-in forwarding.</p>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Randall Kenna. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>Two weeks after I graduated my coding bootcamp, I had an offer. Two weeks after that, I started my first engineering job at a small startup.</p>



<p>Here are some of the strategies I used.</p>



<p><strong>Treat your job search like it’s your job.</strong></p>



<p>I was exhausted after I graduated from my bootcamp. But I had spent more than$15,000 on tuition and living in San Francisco so I knew I needed to get a job quickly to prove the financial investment was worth it. It was so tempting to just spend those two weeks napping on my couch and recovering from the most grueling process of my life but using the momentum I had from graduating the bootcamp was critical. I had read about a lot of students that had let their skills get rusty and it had taken 6–12 months for them to find a job.</p>



<p>From the hours of 9AM to 6PM, I was job hunting. I was obsessively updating my resume, finding new jobs, reaching out to connections, finding meetups to attend, and honing my skills. After 6PM, I wouldn’t respond to recruiter emails or do any prep work for interviews. I used that time to recuperate and prepare for the next day.</p>



<p><strong>Optimizing my LinkedIn</strong></p>



<p>The company that I ultimately ended up taking an offer at actually found me through my LinkedIn. For all the applications that I sent and meetups that I attended, they ended up finding me and asking me to come in for an interview.</p>



<p>I filled out my LinkedIn with my prior jobs to show that even though I didn’t have a ton of engineering experience, I had a past career where I had been paid to code a little in some of my past jobs. I added every course I had taken and every certification that I had gotten during the bootcamp to show that I was very interested in engineering and it wasn’t just a job to me.</p>



<p><strong>Quickly moving on from companies that weren’t a fit</strong></p>



<p>A few companies had interview processes that were equivalent to Google. They wanted a coding bootcamp graduate to be able to solve complex algorithms that even a software engineer with a CS degree and years of experience would have struggled to complete.</p>



<p>I would have spent so much time preparing for just&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;interview at&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;company when instead I could use that time to go through the interview process at several companies. I told the company that the process was far too intense for a junior engineer and moved on.</p>



<p>You don’t have to use this strategy however if you’re willing to put in a lot of time learning algorithms and focusing on building some CS foundations. Some people in my cohort focused on their algorithm skills and it took a little longer to find a job, but they started out with a better title and higher pay.</p>



<p><strong>Build a coding portfolio</strong></p>



<p>Thankfully, my coding bootcamp had helped me create a large portfolio with several applications. I was able to take this to prospective companies and discuss what I had learned during the project. In my final project, I had focused mostly on frontend so I took that work to companies and detailed exactly what I had worked on.</p>



<p>If you don’t have a portfolio yet, just get started on something small and push it up to GitHub. Each time you create a new project, challenge yourself to make it a little more complex than the last project.</p>



<p><strong>Proving I was eager (and desperate) to learn</strong></p>



<p>Two companies told me I could build a project in the framework that I was most comfortable in. But I knew that if I spent a little time learning the framework that they used, I would improve my odds of standing out.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, I taught myself the framework one company used and built a small (and very barely working) app that used it. I was able to discuss the principles of the framework and even though my app broke during the demo, I got the job.</p>



<p>This was a risky strategy because I ended up not spending any time learning the other framework for the other company but it worked out in the end when I received an offer from the company.</p>



<p><strong>Focusing on my strengths and not my weaknesses</strong></p>



<p>I knew that I wasn’t going to do super well at companies that focused on algorithms and prioritized having a CS background, so I intentionally found companies that wanted to focus on mentorship and had real world interviews.</p>



<p>In the interviews, I discussed how I had prior career experience that would benefit them if they hired me and I had been coding at those jobs as much as I could.</p>



<p>It definitely wasn’t easy but anyone can get a job in coding if you treat your job search as if it’s your job and keep improving your skills.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>India’s space organization, ISRO, launched <a href="https://jatan.space/isro-chandrayaan-2-moon-landing-mission/">Chandrayaan 2</a> to the Moon last year in July. While its <a href="https://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/vikram-apparently-crash-lands.html">lander Vikram crashed on the lunar surface</a> on September 7, the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter continues to orbit the Moon.</p>



<p>The Chandrayaan 2 orbiter hosts an extensive set of instruments to map the Moon and now we get a peek at the data it has sent.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5459c-ch-2-orbiter.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The Chandrayaan 2 orbiter. Credit: ISRO</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>ISRO scientists had submitted a raft of initial results from the orbiter’s mapping instruments to present at the flagship <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/">51st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference</a> in March. This is an annual conference hosted in the United States where more than 2000 planetary scientists and students from across the world attend and present their latest work. However, due to concerns about the Novel Coronavirus, the <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/attendee/lpsc-cancellation.shtml">conference has been cancelled</a>.</p>



<h3>Seeing a crater in the dark</h3>



<p>Chandrayaan 2 orbiter has an optical camera called the Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC) which captures detailed images of the Moon. OHRC can image at a best resolution of 0.25 meters/pixel, beating NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s (LRO) best of 0.5 meters/pixel.</p>



<p>Back in October, we already saw OHRC flex its muscles by <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/update/04-oct-2019/chandrayaan2-images-orbiter-high-resolution-camera">sending images</a> where boulders less than 1 meter in size were clearly visible. And now OHRC has demonstrated imaging an area not directly illuminated by sunlight! It <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/2412.pdf">captured an image of a crater floor in shadow</a> by seeing the dim light falling on it that has been reflected from the crater rim!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-ohrc.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-ohrc.jpg?w=961&amp;ssl=1 961w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-ohrc.jpg?resize=200%2C67&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-ohrc.jpg?resize=768%2C259&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Left:</strong> Image of the lunar surface by the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter.

<p>Moving ahead, this capability will be used to image insides of craters on the lunar poles, where sunlight never reaches. Mapping the terrain of polar craters is important because future lunar habitats are believed to be stationed near them, transporting water and other resources from inside them.</p>



<h3>Highest resolution 3D maps</h3>



<p>The Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC 2) onboard Chandrayaan 2 is a stereo imager, meaning it can capture 3D images. It does that by imaging the same site from three different angles, akin to NASA’s LRO, from which a 3D image is constructed.</p>



<p>TMC 2 has <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/1127.pdf">beamed back images</a> taken from 100 km above the lunar surface and the 3D views generated from them look great. Here is one of a crater and a wrinkled ridge, the latter being a tectonic feature.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-tmc-2-crater.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-tmc-2-crater.jpg?w=689&amp;ssl=1 689w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-tmc-2-crater.jpg?resize=200%2C125&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>3D view of a crater on the Moon generated from images captured by Chandrayaan 2 orbiter’s Terrain Mapping Camera.

<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-tmc-2-dorsa.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-tmc-2-dorsa.jpg?w=678&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-tmc-2-dorsa.jpg?resize=200%2C140&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>3D view of a wrinkled ridge on the Moon generated from images captured by Chandrayaan 2 orbiter’s Terrain Mapping Camera.

<p>Such images are very useful for understanding how lunar features form and get their shape. For example, a 3D image can help construct an accurate picture of the geometry of the impact that formed a crater.</p>



<p>Over time, Chandrayaan 2 will provide the highest resolution 3D images of the entire Moon, the best case resolution being 5 meters/pixel.</p>



<h3>Enhanced eyes in the infrared</h3>



<p>The Imaging Infrared Spectrometer (IIRS) on Chandrayaan 2 is the successor to the famous Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3) instrument onboard Chandrayaan 1.</p>



<p>The M3 instrument, which was contributed by NASA, has been publicly acknowledged for its excellent mineral mapping capabilities and <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">detection of water on the Moon</a>. Noah Petro, Project Scientist for LRO, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/nepetro/status/1166746554381811713">noted on Twitter</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“10 years ago today Chandrayaan-1 ended. I was so lucky to be a small part of that mission. The M3 instrument allowed us to take a huge step forward in learning about the composition of our 8th continent!”</em></p><cite><em>– Noah Petro, Project Scientist for LRO, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/nepetro/status/1166746554381811713"><em>on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Both IIRS and M3 detect reflected sunlight from the Moon’s surface. Scientists identify minerals on the surface based on the patterns of these reflections. The IIRS boasts nearly twice the sensitivity of M3 in infrared light and the <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/1516.pdf">initial results</a> demonstrate to that effect. Here are images of the Glauber crater as seen by IIRS and M3 respectively.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-iirs.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-iirs.jpg?w=443&amp;ssl=1 443w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-iirs.jpg?resize=200%2C111&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The Glauber crater on the Moon imaged in infrared by Chandrayaan 2’s IIRS and Chandrayaan 1’s M3 respectively. Credit: ISRO, NASA</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Thanks to M3, scientists now know that the lunar soil does hold trace amounts of water and hydroxyl molecules even in non-polar regions. IIRS onboard Chandrayaan 2 will map water concentrations in the lunar soil with improved sensitivity. Chandrayaan 2’s long-term observations aim to discern how the water content in the lunar soil changes in response to the lunar environment i.e. what the lunar water cycle looks like.</p>



<p>Note that all this is still less amount of water than the driest deserts on Earth. However, the lunar poles host appreciably more water. And that is where Chandrayaan 2’s radar comes into the picture.</p>



<h3>Quantifying water on the Moon</h3>



<p>The Dual Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (DFSAR) onboard the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter is the successor to the Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) on Chandrayaan 1. DFSAR penetrates the Moon’s surface twice as deep as Mini-SAR. Not just that, DFSAR also boasts a higher resolution than the radar onboard LRO called Mini-RF. The <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/1420.pdf">initial results demonstrate as much</a>, comparing a DFSAR radar image of region with Mini-RF.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-dfsar.jpg?resize=1024%2C493&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-dfsar.jpg?resize=1024%2C493&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-dfsar.jpg?resize=200%2C96&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-dfsar.jpg?resize=768%2C370&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-dfsar.jpg?resize=1200%2C578&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ch2-dfsar.jpg?w=1306&amp;ssl=1 1306w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>A region on the Moon imaged by ISRO Chandrayaan 2’s radar (leftmost), NASA LRO’s radar (center) and LRO’s visible light camera.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With greater penetration depth and higher resolution than any prior instruments, Chandrayaan 2’s orbiter is in the process of adequately quantifying just how much water ice is trapped beneath the permanently dark crater floors on the Moon’s poles. Current estimates based on past observations suggest that the Moon’s poles host <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">more than 600 billion kg of water ice</a>, equivalent to at least 240,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p>



<h3>What’s next?</h3>



<p>The lunar science and exploration communities agree that we can harness water ice on the Moon’s poles to power future lunar habitats. Using solar power generated by the habitats, we can also split the water ice into hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket fuel.</p>



<p>But before we plan habitats at the Moon’s poles, we need to know more about the nature of water ice in these regions and how to access it given their terrain. The initial results from Chandrayaan 2 clearly show the promise of the highest resolution mapper ever sent to the Moon. ISRO has stated that Chandrayaan 2 will orbit the Moon for seven years and that should be ample time to fully map and quantify water and their host regions on the Moon.</p>



<p>Surface missions that explore these water-hosting permanently shadowed regions, like <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-viper-lunar-rover-to-map-water-ice-on-the-moon/">NASA’s upcoming VIPER rover</a>, are the next logical step towards sustainable habitats on the Moon. As we develop technologies that tap into water ice, we can <a href="https://jatan.space/the-moon-as-a-rocket-platform/">settle on not just the Moon but the whole solar system</a>. We should be glad our Moon has plenty of water; we can’t keep dragging everything out of Earth’s gravitational well forever.</p>

However, it still requires a considerable effort to write types and keep them maintainable. Moreover, when the data provider is a GraphQL server, it makes you feel like you're doing a useless job, given the server already has its own schemas for types. Seem redundant, right?</p><p>With this in mind, <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/">GraphQL Code Generator</a> gives us the ability to generate TypesScript typing out of GraphQL schemas. Beyond that, it gives us a couple of plugins to create custom React hooks that don't require any kind of maintenance or workaround to fit into your application.</p><p>Among many others, some of the benefits of using this tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Codeless:</strong> forget about creating the interfaces/types for every GraphQL endpoints; save time and spend effort on what matters;</li><li><strong>Development experience:</strong> as a result of having the types always available, your editor will provide meaningful autocomplete and error checking;</li><li><strong>Types always up-to-date:</strong> if your GraphQL endpoint schemas change, your application will be updated and typescript will help you make sure you make the necessary changes.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>First of all, let's install the dependencies needed:</p><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @apollo/react-hooks graphql</span></p></pre></pre><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/import-types-preset @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react --save-dev</span></p></pre></pre><p>I'm considering the following folder structure, but of course, feel free to adapt it to your liking, just have in mind that it needs a place to store the schemas that will be fetched by the Code Generator:</p><pre><pre><p><span>📦 my-project</span></p><p><span>┣ 📂 src</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 pages</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 queries</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 autogenerate</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ my-query.gql</span></p><p><span>┃ ┗ apollo-client.ts</span></p><p><span>┣ codegen.yml</span></p><p><span>┗ package.json</span></p></pre></pre><p>Then, basically, you'll need to create a configuration file at the root of the project, named <code>codegen.yml</code>.

<p>Critical Theory has a narrow and a broad meaning in philosophy and in the history of the social sciences. “Critical Theory” in the narrow sense designates several generations of German philosophers and social theorists in the Western European Marxist tradition known as the Frankfurt School. According to these theorists, a “critical” theory may be distinguished from a “traditional” theory according to a specific practical purpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human “emancipation from slavery,” acts as a “liberating … influence,” and works “to create a world which satisfies the needs and powers” of human beings (<a href="http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Horkheimer-Authority-and-the-Family.compressed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Horkheimer</a> 1972, 246). Because such theories aim to explain and transform&nbsp;<em>all</em> the circumstances that enslave human beings, many “critical theories” in the broader sense have been developed. They have emerged in connection with the many social movements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of human beings in modern societies. In both the broad and the narrow senses, however, a critical theory provides the descriptive and normative bases for social inquiry aimed at decreasing domination and increasing freedom in all their forms.</p>

<p>The term “Critical Theory” commonly causes confusion because it can refer to the <strong>Frankfurt School</strong> of <strong>Marxist</strong> critics, including György Lukács, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse (see also, <strong>neo-Marxism</strong> and <strong>New Left</strong>), or it can refer to the use of other similar—but distinct—<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical/">critical</a> social theories, such as those that have their roots in <strong>postmodernism</strong>, such as <strong>postcolonial Theory</strong>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-queer-theory/">queer Theory</a>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-race-theory/">critical race Theory</a>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-intersectionality/">intersectional</a> <strong>feminism</strong>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-disability-studies/">disability studies</a>, and <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-fat-studies/">fat studies</a> (see also, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-theory/">Theory</a> and <strong>post-Marxism</strong>). Sometimes this confusion is expressed disingenuously by academics who dislike criticism of critical theories, and sometimes it is expressed sincerely by those whose fields of philosophy have not kept up with the fast development of <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-social-justice/">Social Justice</a> scholarship.</p>
<p>The Critical Theory of the “Institute for Social Research,” which is better known as the Frankfurt School, focused on power analyses that began from a Marxist (or <strong>Marxian</strong>) perspective with an aim to understand why Marxism wasn’t proving successful in <strong>Western</strong> contexts. It rapidly developed a “<strong>post-Marxist</strong>” position that criticized Marx’s primary focus on economics and expanded his views on <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-power-systemic/">power</a>, <strong>alienation</strong>, and <strong>exploitation</strong> into all aspects of post-<strong>Enlightenment</strong> Western culture. These theorists sometimes referred to themselves as “<strong>cultural Marxists</strong>,” and were referred to that way by others, but the term “<strong>cultural Marxism</strong>” is now more commonly used to describe (a misconception of) <strong>postmodernism</strong> (see also, <strong>neo-Marxism</strong>) or a certain anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. The big-picture agenda of the Frankfurt School was to marry Marxian economic theory to Freudian psychoanalytic theory in order to explain both the rise of <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-fascism/">fascism</a> and the reasons that the communist <strong>revolutions</strong> were not taking place in <strong>Western</strong> democracies as had been predicted.</p>
<p>Max Horkheimer defined a “Critical Theory” in direct opposition to a “Traditional Theory” in a 1937 piece called <em>Traditional and Critical Theory</em>. Whereas a Traditional Theory is meant to be descriptive of some phenomenon, usually social, and aims to understand how it works and why it works that way, a Critical Theory should proceed from a prescriptive <strong>normative</strong> moral vision for society, describe how the item being critiqued fails that vision (usually in a systemic sense), and prescribe activism to <strong>subvert</strong>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-dismantle/">dismantle</a>, <strong>disrupt</strong>, overthrow, or change it—that is, generally, to break and then remake society in accordance with the particular critical theory’s prescribed vision. This use of the word “critical” is drawn from Marx’s insistence that <em>everything</em> be “ruthlessly” criticized and from his admonition that the point of studying society is to change it. Of note, then, a Critical Theory is only tangentially concerned with understanding or truth and has, as Hume might have it, abandoned descriptions of what <em>is</em> in favor of pushing for what the particular critical theory holds <em>ought</em> to be. The <em>critical</em> methodology, then, is the central object of concern, and it is the tool by which Social Justice scholarship and activism proceed.</p>
<p>The Critical Theorists of the Frankfurt School primarily looked at systems of power in terms of how they <strong>exploited</strong> and <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-oppression/">oppressed</a> the working class and, more broadly, the everyday citizen, or certain everyday citizens (as opposed to members of the various elite classes). Speaking very generally (thus charitably), the purpose of critical theories (including the Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School) is to make visible the underexamined or invisible presuppositions, assumptions, and power dynamics of society and question, criticize, and, especially, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-problematize/">problematize</a> them. Indeed, the primary objective of critical theories is problematization (identifying something as “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-problematics/">problematic</a>,” which means it stands against the normative vision adopted by the critical theorists in question, and this, in turn is understood to mean in support of any <strong>unjust</strong> assumptions or power dynamics).</p>
<p>One of the ambitions of the Critical Theorists of the Frankfurt School was to address cultural power in a way that allowed an awakening of working-class consciousness out of the <strong>ideology</strong> of <strong>capitalism</strong> in order to overcome it. Particularly, these theorists had decided that the reason the <strong>communist</strong> revolution had not yet successfully spread throughout the West is that something in <strong>liberal</strong> Western culture must be preventing it. The goal of the Critical Theory (of the Frankfurt School), in that sense, was to identify what those issues were and find ways to dismantle them. As such, the Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci’s, concept of <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-hegemony/"><em>hegemony</em></a><em>—</em>the <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-discourse/">dominance</a> of one particular set of ideas over all others in a society—has been influential on the development of Marxist and post-Marxist critical theory and also on the development of the (<strong>structuralist</strong>) critical methods of postmodernism. Among their conclusions is that the dominance of hegemonic ideas in society leads to the <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-marginalization/">marginalization</a> of other ideas, thus preventing change and maintaining oppression.</p>
<p>Critical theories in a broader sense are largely understood to be the <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical/">critical</a> study of various types of power relations within myriad aspects of culture, often under a broad rubric referred to in general as “<strong>cultural studies</strong>.” These moved the question of power dynamics away from generalized hegemony and into the various hegemonies created and maintained by and over the various <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-identity/">identity</a> groups in society (see also, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-knowledges/">knowledge(s)</a>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-ways-of-knowing/">ways of knowing</a>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-injustice/">epistemic injustice</a> and <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/">epistemic oppression</a>). These include <strong>postcolonial theory</strong>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-queer-theory/">queer theory</a>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-race-theory/">critical race Theory</a>, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-intersectionality/">intersectional</a> <strong>feminism</strong>, and critical theories of <strong>ableism</strong> and fatness. They are to be found within many disciplines and subdisciplines within the theoretical humanities, including cultural studies, <strong>media studies</strong>, <strong>gender studies</strong>, <strong>ethnic</strong>/<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-race/">race</a>/<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-whiteness/">whiteness</a>/black studies, <strong>sexuality</strong>/LGBT/trans studies, postcolonial, <strong>indigenous</strong>, and <strong>decolonial</strong> studies, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-disability-studies/">disability studies</a>, and <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-fat-studies/">fat studies</a>. Critical theories of various kinds are also to be found within (but not necessarily dominant over) other fields of the humanities, social sciences, and arts, including English (literature), sociology, philosophy, art, history and, particularly, <strong>pedagogy</strong> (theory of education).</p>
<p>The use of critical theories within these disciplines leads to a highly theoretical, ideological, and interpretive approach to cultural, artistic, and identity issues, all of which are to be studied in a <em>critical</em> way, not necessarily rigorously. The meaning of the word “criticism” here is specific, not as one might expect it to be used in the common parlance, and refers to seeking out ways in which problematics (according to some normative moral vision for society) arise within functional systems, particularly the systems of social and cultural power in liberal, Western, and <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-science/">scientific</a> settings. There is, in the critical method (as noted above), no need to understand these concepts or structures; only a need to pick at the ways in which they can be construed to be imperfect.</p>
<p>The focus on identity, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-lived-experience/">experiences</a>, and activism, rather than an attempt to find <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-truth/">truth</a>, leads to conflict with empirical scholars and undermines public confidence in the worth of scholarship that uses this approach. Because critical theories nearly always begin with their conclusion—their own assumptions about power dynamics in society, how those are problematic, and the need for their disruption or dismantling—and then seeks to find ways to read them into various aspects of society (see <strong>discourse analysis</strong> and <strong>close reading</strong>), the body of scholarship that has been growing for the last fifty years has become a towering and impressive mountain with very insecure foundations.</p>

Multi-cluster environments are quickly becoming the rule rather than the exception. Such environments require multiple instances of API gateways, and indeed many of our customers run numerous instances of Gloo, our Envoy-based next-generation API gateway.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Scalability was always one of the most important goals in our design of Gloo, which is second to none in its ability to work at scale. With many of our customers taking advantage of this strength and continuously increasing the number of Gloo instances running in their environment, we sought for ways to make it easier and more powerful for them to operate their cohort of Gloos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Today we are excited to announce the next evolution of Gloo, with the release of Gloo Federation, giving enterprises the ability to scale their API gateway and management capabilities across clusters, sites and regions. Gloo Federation has two goals: to simplify and globalize your management of multiple Gloo instances across multiple clusters, and to provide you with advanced multi-cluster control features.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1024x695.png" data-src="https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1024x695.png" alt="" width="1024" height="695" data-srcset="https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1024x695.png 1024w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-300x204.png 300w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-768x521.png 768w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1536x1042.png 1536w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview.png 1998w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1024x695.png 1024w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-300x204.png 300w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-768x521.png 768w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1536x1042.png 1536w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview.png 1998w"></p><p><span>Gloo Federation gives you a single pane of glass through which you can view all your services across clusters and clouds, enabling consistent configuration, unified debugging, and automated Gloo discovery across all Gloo instances.

<p><small>Yeah, our objectives were set in <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned/Doug_Engelbart-AugmentingHumanIntellect.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1962</a>. So what? 🦕</small> 
</p>
<p>Instead of looking for ways to “boost productivity”, we wonder how we can “augment collective intelligence”. Here are our goals as Engelbart put it:</p>
<ul>
<li>more-rapid and better comprehension</li>
<li>gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex</li>
<li>speedier and better solutions</li>
<li><em>finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble</em></li>

</p>
<p>In a series of joyfully boring essays we are going to explore ways of achieving these goals. Maybe, some ideas will even find their way into Fibery’s vision, who knows.</p>
<p>So where should we start?</p>
<h2>Knowledge Architecture</h2>
<p>At the basic level, it all comes down to capturing, sharing, and generating knowledge. So the first step is to get this knowledge out of bright heads and into a shared space.</p>
<p>How should this space look like? Good old files and folders? Powerful databases? Trendy networks?</p>
<p><small>We resisted the "5 ways to capture everything your company knows" clickbait title 💪</small> 
</p> 
<p>In this article we are going to explore five different approaches to knowledge architecture in an organization. We are looking for the most natural structure that encourages people to discover and share knowledge. The structure should help us to build on top of each other’s ideas. </p>
<p>Starting with…</p>
<h2>Vertical Hierarchy</h2>

<p>The most ubiquitous structure is a strict vertical hierarchy.</p>
<p>Some bearded guys borrowed the file cabinet metaphor in 1960s, and it has become a standard since. From cloud drives to note taking and work management tools&nbsp;— it’s all folders and files in some shape or form.</p>
<p>💎 <strong>The onboarding is easy.</strong> With the ubiquity comes familiarity — you don’t need to explain to anyone how folders work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/oAHbLRjF0vo?t=32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular ≠ the best</a>. The strict hierarchy made sense in the real world: a book can only be on a single shelf in a particular room. However, the restrictions of physical objects should not apply to abstract knowledge.</p>
<p>💩 <strong>Every entity has to be exactly in one place.</strong> Two teams collaborating on the same project? Let them decide where the project goes in a vicious pillow fight: </p>

    <figcaption><p>In our examples we will pretend that all organizations build digital products 🤷‍♀</p></figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>Alternatively, duplicate the data and hope that the intricate two-way sync won’t suprise you with a merge conflict any time soon. </p>
<p>💩 <strong>The organization has to agree on a single hierarchy for all purposes.</strong> Business folks want folders to be initiatives, engineering folks — product areas. Let them decide in a vicious pillow fight:</p>

<p>And once they decide, there is no going back because…</p>
<p>💩 <strong>Evolution is near impossible.</strong> A company is transitioning from outsource (folders = clients) to product (folders = products) development? The next few months will be fun!</p>
<p>Speaking of fun — what about cross-team collaboration?</p>
<p>💩 <strong>Horizontal connections are lost.</strong> Try mapping this natural workflow into a vertical structure:</p>

</figure>
<p>The vertical approach produces inflexible information silos. As Ted Nelson noted in the legendary <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/722414.Computer_Lib_Dream_Machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Lib/Dream Machines</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Hierarchical structures are usually forced and artificial. Interwingularity is not generally acknowledged —&nbsp;people think they can make things hierarchical, categorizable and sequential when they can't.
</blockquote>
<p>So let’s… acknowledge interwingularity?</p>

<p>In a flat network we are free to form arbitrary connections between nodes (pages).</p>
<p>In a good network, these connections are bi-directional: if two pages are related, we’ll always see the connection on both of them. Unfortunately, this is not how most networks work — yet 🤞.</p>
<p>Lately, we’ve seen a revival of the “networked thought”&nbsp;fueled by the idea that… </p>
<p>💎 <strong>Free associations are closer to how brain works.</strong> Thoughts are not neatly packed in file cabinets: rather one leads to another and yet another. In a flat network this means that the “campaign → lead →&nbsp;bug&nbsp;→&nbsp;version” workflow we mentioned above works like a charm.</p>
<p>💎 <strong>Knowledge naturally accumulates.</strong> There is no limit on the size of the network and no restrictions on how it should grow.</p>
<p>Just like our brains, flat networks are great at working with unstructured knowledge but suck when it comes to structured data.</p>
<p>💩 <strong>Querying data is hard.</strong> All pages have either the same or unpredictable attributes. Getting all high-priority features or all customers due to renew the next month is nearly impossible.</p>
<p>💩 <strong>Visualizations are limited.</strong> Most vizualizations rely on structured data — so forget about a Kanban board with swimlanes, an event calendar, a gantt chart, or a hierarchical list. </p>
<p>💩 <strong>Repeatable processes are undiscoverable.</strong> Since there are no required (or even desired) attributes and relations, there is nothing to nudge folks into a predictable workflow. You have to explain each newcomer that “we decompose Epic into Stories, estimate these Stories, and plan into Sprints” —&nbsp;a flat network cannot guide them.   </p>
<p>So we need both horizontal and vertical connections as well as the ability to handle structured data. Sounds pretty much like…</p>
<h2>Relational Databases</h2>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="relational databases" title="Relational databases: each standalone database stores multiple connected tables" src="https://blog.fibery.io/static/4b4502a9f4fa425f6646c5719df7b3f0/99f37/relational-databases.png" srcset="https://blog.fibery.io/static/4b4502a9f4fa425f6646c5719df7b3f0/6b2ea/relational-databases.png 275w,

    </span></p>
<p>In a relational database, both vertical and horizontal connections are present through one-to-many and many-to-many relations. Each table has its own attributes making home for structured data.</p>
<p>💎 <strong>The structure is flexible.</strong> The knowledge architect is free to create as many or as few tables as needed and connect them in the way it makes sense to the particular organization. As organization evolves, she creates more tables and adds more relations.</p>
<p><small>A common pitfall is to design a database that doesn't satisfy at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3NF</a> and struggle with complicated queries and data duplication.  
 
  
 </small>
</p>
<p>💩 <strong>Building a database requires time and skill.</strong> This is the price your pay for the flexibility. While <a href="https://airtable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a> has democratized online databases, the knowledge architect still has to understand how data normalization works —&nbsp;at least intuitively.</p>
<p>💩 <strong>It’s either one unmanageable, or many disconnected databases.</strong> When all teams share the same database, it quickly becomes huge and messy. When teams split into several bases, it’s “hello” to information silos and “bye” to cross-team collaboration. Instead of sharing data, it’s all back to pillow fights — where should the customers table go, in sales or marketing db.</p>
<p>On the bright side…</p>
<p>💎 <strong>Pretty much any visualization or query is possible.</strong> Tables, boards, charts, and even maps — with data filtered and sorted as you desire. If a database doesn’t have a visualization out of the box, you can usually build one.</p>
<p>While the structured data feels at home…</p>
<p>💩 <strong>Unstructured knowledge is not welcome.</strong> Collaborative documents, whiteboards, and multimedia are second-class citizens at best and are simply missing at worst.</p>
<p>Is there a way to combine structured and unstructured knowledge, vertical and horizontal connections?</p>

<p>Most single-purpose work management tools are, basically, hierarchical networks. Tool vendors understand they need the best of all worlds to foster collaboration.</p>
<p>💎 <strong>Structured and unstructured knowledge is mixed.</strong> You set feature priority, but you also write specs. You advance deals through a pipeline, but also take meeting notes. Hopefully, digital whiteboards and interactive embeds will also be welcome —&nbsp;one day 🤞.</p>
<p>💎 <strong>Multiple parallel hierarchies coexist.</strong> A Task belongs to a Sprint, but also to a Version and a Component. A few pillows saved.</p>
<p> 💎 <strong>Visualizations are tailor-made to specific workflows.</strong> If a team adapts its behavior to the tool, it’s rewarded with a top-notch user experience.</p>
<p>Wait, but what if a team is happy with its habits and doesn’t want to kneel before the tool? That’s the catch.</p>
<p>💩 <strong>Single-purpose is synonymous with inflexible.</strong> A team has grown, and you need an extra level of hierarchy — 🤷‍♀️. You call it Deals, not Opportunities — 🤷‍♀️. Haven’t yet settled on a process and are experimenting with workflows —&nbsp;🤷‍♀️. Want to look at the data from a different angle&nbsp;— 🤷‍♀️.</p>
<p>Teams are diverse so each one gets its own purpose-built network.</p>
<p>💩 <strong>Networks are isolated.</strong> We are back to information silos, islands of knowledge, bubbles of data, please stop me, idea zoos, insight prisons. Because of the incompatible data models, cross-network integrations are always limited and clunky.</p>

<p>So what can we have instead of many single-purpose networks? A single generic…</p>
<h2>Hierarchical Network</h2>

<p>Each node in the network is of a particular type (Objective, Customer). Types form hierarchies: Objective has several Key Results, Customer — many logged Chats and a few too many reported Bugs.</p>
<p>A single generic hierarchical network is capable of holding all the knowledge of an organization. So why aren’t these networks common?</p>
<p>First of all, the vertical hierarchy has become a no-brainer default, and we rarely stopped to ask if there might be a better generic storage architecture. This “things have already been figured out” effect has been common across computer science since 1980s. Bret Victor put it best: </p>
<p><small>Replace "programming" with "knowledge architecture" (29:52—31:17)
 </small>

<p>Second, there hasn’t been a platform to easily build such networks. Why hasn’t there been a platform? Well, as we have found out in the last 3 <a href="https://fibery.io/anxiety?utm_source=blog.fibery.io&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-knowledge-organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">miserable</a> years, the platform is damn hard to build&nbsp;—&nbsp;interview what is left of our engineers.</p>
<p>What’s so special about the hierarchical network? </p>
<p>💎 <strong>Adapts and evolves with an organization.</strong> It’s easy to start with a simple network and create more hierarchies as the company grows and diversifies. Each team constructs its own subnetwork —&nbsp;connected to the wider pool of knowledge. </p>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>
We present a real-time approach for multi-person 3D motion capture at over 30 fps using a single RGB camera. It operates successfully in generic scenes which may contain occlusions by objects and by other people. Our method operates in subsequent stages. The first stage is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that estimates 2D and 3D pose features along with identity assignments for all visible joints of all individuals.We contribute a new architecture for this CNN, called SelecSLS Net, that uses novel selective long and short range skip connections to improve the information flow allowing for a drastically faster network without compromising accuracy. In the second stage, a fully connected neural network turns the possibly partial (on account of occlusion) 2Dpose and 3Dpose features for each subject into a complete 3Dpose estimate per individual. The third stage applies space-time skeletal model fitting to the predicted 2D and 3D pose per subject to further reconcile the 2D and 3D pose, and enforce temporal coherence. Our method returns the full skeletal pose in joint angles for each subject. This is a further key distinction from previous work that do not produce joint angle results of a coherent skeleton in real time for multi-person scenes. The proposed system runs on consumer hardware at a previously unseen speed of more than 30 fps given 512x320 images as input while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, which we will demonstrate on a range of challenging real-world scenes.

                        <h2>July 15, 2020</h2>

<p>While there are browsers that already have the ability to completely block Google Analytics and other front-end tracking scripts, the question here is whether this becomes an out-of-the-box setting.</p>
<p>If we consider the rising interest in internet privacy a trend, then it is a possibility that client-side tracking scripts, like Google Analytics, could be completely blocked by default on some browsers in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would only add to the amount of traffic that client-side tracking solutions already miss due to ad blockers and privacy-conscious users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it may seem unrealistic, the recent confusion that Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) update caused gave us a glimpse into how the community would react.</p>
<p>Could the ever-increasing security features being implemented by Safari, Firefox and other web browsers be an indicator of what’s yet to come?</p>
<h2>The current state of internet privacy in 2020</h2>
<p>Privacy concerns are growing across many aspects of our everyday digital experiences. There is clearly a problem when data leaks from large organizations have just become another norm.</p>
<p>We’ve become desensitized to the fact that these large corporations are profiling us and profiting off that data by giving companies access to coveted ad space that fits their product/service target demographic.</p>
<p>While some people might be completely against tracking website visitors, we believe that it is still necessary to improve the overall user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By understanding what content resonates with readers and knowing what channels bring you the most traffic, owners can better focus their resources. What we are against is gathering personal identifiable information (PII) that can be later used for targeted marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Regulations like GDPR, PECR and CCPA are steps in the right direction towards internet privacy. These regulations have been put in place to ensure that the user consents to any personal information that is being shared through forms or cookies.</p>
<h2>What’s the difference between a first-party cookie and a third-party cookie?</h2>
<p>Let’s skip the cookie puns and get right to it.</p>
<p>In the simplest form, a cookie is a small text file that is created when a user visits a website. Depending on what information the website desires, it will obtain specific data about the visitor and store it on the visitor’s computer.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at two types of cookies that you will encounter on a daily basis:</p>
<p><strong>First-party cookies</strong></p>
<p>These are set by the domain name that you are visiting. They collect analytics and settings data to improve your user experience (language, whether you logged in, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Third-party cookies</strong></p>
<p>Now, here’s where some privacy issues begin to appear. These cookies are created by websites you have not visited and collect data as you surf the internet. They build a personal profile on you so that ads can be better targeted.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>You visit <em>onlinestore.com</em> they set a first-party cookie to remember your shopping cart contents and preferences.</p>
<p>However, <em>onlinestore.com </em>has also allowed <em>ad-network.com </em>to place cookies onto their visitors.&nbsp;These would be considered third-party cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These cookies follow you around the internet and when you return to <em>onlinestore.com </em>or visit another website connected to <em>ad-network.com </em>these cookies will update your "customer profile" based on your browsing history.</p>
<p>This practice is called cross-site tracking and it’s clear why there is a concern for privacy when websites are utilizing these types of cookies to better target ads based on your browsing tendencies.</p>
<h2>What are browsers currently blocking?</h2>
<p>While some browsers will not block tracking scripts due to conflict of interest. Others have been taking additional steps to reduce the amount of tracking websites can do on their visitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross-site tracking is on the agenda of all privacy interested browsers. Here’s a quick look at what they are doing to improve your online experience.</p>
<h4>Safari</h4>
<p>The Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) used by Safari <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully blocks third-party cookies</a> and has other measures in place to keep your personal information secure.</p>
<p>Here are some of the security features that you'll find on&nbsp;Safari:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Blocks third-party cookies</li>
<li>Disables login fingerprinting</li>
<li>Disables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-site request forgery attacks</a></li>
<li>Detects bounce trackers, tracker collusion and link decoration</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/FbwFN40/Safari.png" alt="Safari" width="681" height="297"></p>
<h4>Firefox</h4>
<p>Using their Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) the Firefox browser will automatically<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/trackers-and-scripts-firefox-blocks-enhanced-track" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> block common trackers and harmful scripts</a>. This will reduce the amount of personal data that third parties can learn from your browsing behaviour.</p>
<p>Here are the trackers that Firefox blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media trackers</li>
<li>Cross-site tracking cookies</li>
<li>Cryptominers</li>
<li>Tracking content</li>
<li>Fingerprinters</li>
</ul>
<p><br><a href="https://ibb.co/Wc5dp0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/GVp139V/Firefox.png" alt="Firefox"></a></p>
<h4>Brave</h4>
<p>The new kid on the block that has made privacy their main selling point. Their approach to ads is through <a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incentivizing the visitor and rewarding their attention</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave “Shields” protect your privacy and block:</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-party cookies</li>
<li>Connections to known trackers</li>
<li>Tracking through referrers</li>
<li>Fingerprinting</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/8YzTQqL/Brave.png" alt="Brave"></a></p>
<p>These are just a few measures being taken by the browsers themselves, we haven’t even touched on the numerous extensions and add-ons being offered to keep your information private.</p>
<h2>Do ad blockers block Google Analytics and other trackers?</h2>
<p>Forget about the browser’s default privacy measures and look at all the various ad blockers that are now available. Around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/ad-blocking-growth-is-slowing-down-but-not-going-away" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in four internet users are blocking ads</a> and some of these blockers go even further and restrict trackers like Google Analytics.</p>
<p>While there are companies that are actively trying to make ad blockers illegal, you can understand why the everyday person would use them. Companies have taken advantage of how much data they are collecting, so it’s about time people started taking back their privacy.</p>
<h2>Should all website tracking be blocked?</h2>
<p>While some people may be against user analytics altogether, we are not. We are against the tracking of personal identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monitoring visits and analytics are actually an important part of improving the overall web experience.</p>
<p>Without analytics, we would be working to a black box assuming what our customers enjoy. Analytics allows us to see what content is successful so that we can continue to deliver that type of valuable content.</p>
<p>It also helps us to diagnose page errors that might be overlooked. Being able to pinpoint pages with high bounce rates or strange statistics, might signal technical issues, which can be amended.</p>
<p>If we actually take a step back and look at the metrics we use most, it’s easy to see that a lot of the personal information we are collecting about our visitors isn’t really needed.</p>
<h2>Can browsers block server-side analytics?</h2>
<p>The quick answer is no.</p>
<p>The big difference between server-side analytics (Accordably) and client-side tracking (Google Analytics) is that server-side doesn’t rely on the visitor’s browser to send back information.</p>
<p>Browsers are able to block client-side tracking scripts because they are located on the frontend. Whereas server-side analytics are located on the backend and can’t be blocked by the browser.</p>
<p>Server-side monitoring isn’t a new concept and is one of the oldest web analytics solutions. The main reason for client-side tracking scripts being more popular is that they are easier to install.</p>
<p>However, client-side tracking solutions need to continuously find ways around browser and ad blocker updates. This game of cat and mouse will quickly increase the difficulty in setting up client-side and make server-side a more viable long-term option.</p>
<p><br><a href="https://ibb.co/MPd8n3D"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/CVLJBT5/accordably-screenshot.png" alt="accordably-screenshot"></a></p>
<h2>Take control of your website visitor’s data.</h2>
<p>While there are some great privacy-focused solutions out there that have the best intentions, we believe that you should be in complete control of your visitor’s data.</p>
<p>As privacy regulations become more strict, it is crucial that you aren’t just taking a company’s “word” that they are being ethical with your visitor’s personal identifiable information. You should have this data stored on your servers and be in charge of what information is sent to these third parties.</p>
<p>Server-side analytics puts you back in the driver seat when it comes to privacy and gives a clearer picture of your true web traffic.</p>

<p><span>L</span>ike any other software developer, Álvaro Justen used to spend most of his waking hours in front of a screen, moving around in his chair, while writing code, working with databases, and processing spreadsheets. But since the first Covid-19 cases sprouted in his native Brazil, Justen’s routine changed significantly. He now works full time, without pay, on what was once a small side project that has become the comprehensive source for measurements of the pandemic’s impact in his country.</p>



<p>@turicas, as colleagues and <a href="https://twitter.com/turicas">Twitter followers</a> know Justen, founded his nonprofit <a href="https://brasil.io/home/">Brasil.IO</a> in 2018 as an initiative to make public data in Brazil more accessible. Now, he is focusing on information — or lack thereof — about the novel coronavirus in the country, one of the pandemic’s epicenters.</p>



<p>“If I’m awake, I’m probably working on the site. On Saturdays, Sundays, holidays,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. He started his site by publishing lists — <a href="https://brasil.io/dataset/eleicoes-brasil/candidatos/">candidates for public office</a> or <a href="https://brasil.io/dataset/socios-brasil/socios/">business owners in the country</a> — in a user-friendly format.</p>



<p>Currently, the site’s <a href="https://brasil.io/covid19/">Covid-19 series</a> features an independent daily monitor of cases with breakdowns by state and city. More than 40 volunteer developers and data enthusiasts work on the project, gathering updates, identifying patterns, and creating datasets.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/brazil-social-platforms-glorify-shooters/">Inside the online communities where young Brazilians glorify school shooters</a></strong></p>



<p>Collecting data can be a difficult, manual task. The volunteers work to cover more than 5,000 Brazilian cities. “Sometimes, data is only available in internal systems, and we have to request it,” Justen explained. “Or the data is available, but not in an easy format to work with.” The challenge is to turn these massive tranches of information — which can come in large spreadsheets or loose PDFs — into lighter files or user-friendly tables and graphics.</p>



<p>By 2018, data transparency had come a long way in Brazil. Since the military rule ended in 1985, the country has witnessed breakthroughs like the 2011 approval of the <a href="https://www.gov.br/acessoainformacao/pt-br">Access to Information Law</a>, akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But experts, like Fernanda Campagnucci, executive director of <a href="https://www.ok.org.br/">Open Knowledge Brasil</a>, say that data transparency is not a priority for the Bolsonaro administration. Instead, it seems to prefer an unspoken policy to conceal, question, or take down any data that doesn’t agree with its narrative. “A posture toward restraining access [to information] is gaining ground, which was not typical of Brazil,” she told<em> Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>These efforts began last year. In April 2019, the Bolsonaro administration took down the Brazilian Observatory on Drug Information’s website, which showed the number of illicit drug use among the population. Later, in August, the director of the <a href="http://www.inpe.br/">Brazilian National Institute for Space Research</a> was fired after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/world/americas/bolsonaro-amazon-deforestation-galvao.html">coming under </a>attack for showing that Amazon deforestation increased 68% in the first two weeks of July when compared to the same time period in the previous year. Earlier in the year, the government <a href="https://exame.com/brasil/apos-definir-cortes-ibge-propoe-reduzir-questoes-do-censo-2020/">cut the national census’ budget</a>, which led to a proposal to reduce population survey questions by almost a third.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/brazil-favela-chat-groups/">Brazil’s grassroots chat groups succeed where public services fail</a></strong></p>



<p>The coronavirus pandemic threw this informal policy out in the open. Addressing this gap became a “matter of survival,” according to Justen. He grew skeptical of the numbers from the Brazilian government, once he noticed its site going offline for a few hours and coming back up with incomplete datasets. The site also took about two months to publish breakdowns by city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Justen’s suspicions turned out to be right. As the number of Covid-19 infections grew exponentially, the <a href="https://covid.saude.gov.br/">official government website for Covid-19</a> statistics went offline on June 5, 2020. When a new version went live, it featured only numbers from the past 24 hours, and the cumulative data were gone. Three days later, the ministry was forced to restore the website on the orders of the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As news of</strong> the Covid-19 data <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-07/brazil-s-covid-data-blackout-is-a-tragedy-ex-health-chief-says">blackout</a> spread, the number of unique daily visitors to Brasil.IO skyrocketed from 4,000 to 30,000. Meanwhile, tensions at the Ministry of Health boiled over: Disagreements with Bolsonaro had led two <a href="https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2020/05/15/nelson-teich-pede-demissao-do-governo-bolsonaro.htm">previous ministers to leave their posts</a>; the president, in turn, appointed an army general as interim minister. The government also pushed back its daily Covid-19 press briefing from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. hush-hush <a href="https://www.saude.gov.br/noticias/agencia-saude/47173-coronavirus-brasil-registra-927-292-pessoas-recuperadas">press releases</a> that led with the numbers of recovered patients, which was widely suggested to be an attempt to stop them from being <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/acabou-materia-no-jornal-nacional-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-atraso-em-divulgacao-de-boletim-da-covid-19.shtml">featured in prime-time news broadcasts</a> and print newspapers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As drama embroiled the executive branch, independent data collectors continued their work. They did so using an information network<strong> </strong>that integrates Brazil’s universal healthcare system with its epidemiological surveillance department. When doctors on the ground identify a case from a list of diseases, including Covid-19, they report it to a monitor at the Ministry of Health. Each state then consolidates the data and publishes daily epidemiological bulletins that are open to the public. “If states stopped doing that, an initiative like Brasil.IO’s Covid-19 project would not be able to exist,” Campagnucci said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When operating as intended, this integrated system responds quickly to local- and federal-level health emergencies. It was crucial during the 2015 Zika epidemic, when it uncovered the initial surge in cases of microcephaly, a condition in which a baby is born with a smaller head than normal. That allowed researchers in Brazil to identify, early on, the link between Zika infection and microcephaly among newborns. “Microcephaly was only the tip of the iceberg. And the response to it was praiseworthy,” said Wayner Vieira, a Brazilian epidemiologist.</p>



<p>While developing Brasil.IO, Justen and his team incorporated this integrated system into their work. Groups of volunteers covered specific states, with the help of local health departments. Every day, a bot sends the volunteers updates. Volunteers work separately to upload the most recent information into Brasil.IO’s platform. If their numbers don’t match, the system sends out an alert. In a country like Brazil, such differences in official statistics are relatively common. States publish epidemiological bulletins at different times of the day or even use different methodologies. “Sometimes [local governments] publish a PDF file or an image, or the numbers are part of a press release,” Justen told <em>Rest of World</em>. “Automatizing this process is very hard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alarmed by the Covid-19 data blackout, the Brasil.IO team posted its consolidated reports on Twitter as an alternative to the federal bulletins. Its <a href="https://twitter.com/turicas/status/1269425532241879041">first one</a> came out on June 6, immediately after the blackout, when it was still unclear whether the federal government would restore access to the cumulative data gathered for Covid-19 thus far. “Our work is to advocate for governments to open data because this is their responsibility. Independent initiatives [like Brasil.IO] emerge only because the government fails to do so,” Campagnucci said.</p>



<p>With the help of bots and dozens of volunteers, as of July 11, Brasil.IO has published 36 bulletins so far. They have joined other organizations’ calls for better transparency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the number of Covid-19 cases in Brazil continues to rise — as of July 8, it was over 1,700,000 people<strong> </strong>—<strong> </strong>and even president Bolsonaro <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-brazil-bolsonaro-tests-positive/2020/07/07/5fa71548-c049-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html">tested positive for Covid-19</a>,<strong> </strong>independent data collectors have a long way to go. Brasil.IO continues to build datasets and now plans to research the pandemic’s economic impact in the country. “A lot of the available information still cannot be easily managed by laypeople, unless they are experts in data analysis,” Justen said. “In this case, it is as if the data was not available at all.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night I came across this question on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
    <header><h5><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/hkmnue/i_am_just_starting_to_learn_c_and_i_am_confused/">I am just starting to learn C# and i am confused about .NET framework &amp; .NET Core</a></h5></header>
    <p>Hello, I am just starting to learn c# and i am about to start with a course on Udemy by Mosh Hamedani called "C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding".
       I can see that he is using .NET Framework but i have read that .NET Core is newer and is the future? I am really not sure where to start and would appreicate if anyone could help me. I would like to learn C# to have a better understanding with OOP and to learn a programming language to help with my Univeristy course. Thank you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all congratulations to the author for learning C# which is a great choice of programming language and for putting in the extra effort into better understanding the concepts of OOP (object oriented programming)! I genuinely hope that they'll have a great experience learning .NET and most importantly that they'll enjoy picking up some new skills and have fun along the way! I remember when I started to code (more than 20 years ago) and how much fun it was for me! It is also great to see how many people have replied with really helpful answers and provided some useful guidance to the original thread! It is a true testament to how supportive and welcoming the .NET community is! However, despite these positive observations I'm still a little bit gutted that such a question had to be even asked in the first place. I don't imply any fault on the author themselves - quite contrary - I actually really sympathise with them and can understand the sort of struggles which a new C# or F# developer may face. Questions like these really demonstrate how complex .NET has become over the years. It is a good time to take a step back and reflect!</p>
<h2 id="high-cognitive-entry-barrier">High cognitive entry barrier</h2>
<p>.NET has a high cognitive entry barrier. What I mean by this is that a new developer has to quickly familiarise themselves with rather boring and complex topics way too early in their educational journey. In particular questions around the differences between .NET, .NET Core, Mono, Xamarin, and the relation between C#, F#, VB.NET and what a target framework or a runtime is add very little to almost no benefit to one's initial learning experience. Most newcomers just want to read a tutorial, watch a video or attend a class and then be able to apply their newly learned skills in an easy and uncomplicated way. Ideally educational material such as purchased online courses or books from more than a few months ago should still be relevant today. Unfortunately neither of these are true for .NET. As a matter of fact it's almost given that any content which has been written more than a year ago is largely outdated today. Just think about the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/">upcoming release of .NET 5</a> and how it will invalidate most of the lessons taught just a few months ago. Another prominent example is the very short lived <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard">.NET Standard</a>. Once hugely evangelised and now de-facto dead. I personally think Microsoft, the .NET team and to some extent the wider .NET community has failed in making .NET a more beginner friendly language. I say this from a good place in my heart. Programming is an extremely powerful skill which can allow people to uplift themselves from all sorts of backgrounds and the harder we make it for beginners, the more exclusive we make the entry to our profession. I think the success of the next ten years will be defined by how accessible we make .NET to a whole new population of developers and I think there's some real work to be done in order to improve the current situation!</p>
<h2 id="what-about-others">What about others?</h2>
<p>Before you think that the current complexity is normal in programming and nothing endemic to .NET itself then I'm afraid to prove you wrong. <a href="https://www.php.net/">Take a look at PHP</a>. PHP has evolved a lot over the years and while it has introduced more complicated object oriented concepts and improved on its performance, it hasn't lost the beauty of its original simplicity at all. PHP is a great programming language to learn. Beginner content exist like sand on a beach. The online community, forums, Reddits and conferences are second to none. Most importantly, a student could pass on a several years old PHP book to another person and they would still get a lot of value from it. The language might have moved on, but many things which were taught on a beginner level are still 100% accurate today. This is a huge advantage which gets easily forgotten by more advanced developers like myself. Furthermore the distinction between language and the interpreter is not something which a new PHP developer has to understand. A new beginner doesn't have to wrap their head around such relatively unimportant topics to get started. They just know that they've installed PHP and it works.</p>
<p>Another great example (and there are many great examples) is <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. Go is not a new language at all. It's <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html">been around for more than 10 years</a> and despite huge improvements to the language, the compiler and the standard library it has remained faithful to its original simple design. Similar to PHP a new developer doesn't have to think about complicated nuances between "target frameworks", weird gotchas if they write Go in one IDE or another and they certainly don't have to look up a complicated version matrix to understand the intricate relations between an SDK, the runtime and newly available language features. There is just one version which maps to a well defined list of features, bug fixes and improvements in Go. It's documentation is simple and easy to comprehend. It is a very beginner friendly language.</p>
<h2 id="improving-net">Improving .NET</h2>
<p>Why is .NET so complicated? Well, the answer is perhaps not that easy itself. It's mostly history, legacy baggage, some bad decisions in the past and what I believe an overly eager desire (almost urgency) to change things for changes' sake. I will try to name a few selected issues from my personal observation, describe the problems which I have perceived and try to provide some constructive suggestions which I think could be a good improvement for the future.</p>

<h3 id="language-spaghetti">Language Spaghetti</h3>
<p>If a person sets out to learn C# (like the author from the question above), what do they learn? Is it C# or .NET? The answer is both. C# doesn't exist without .NET and you cannot program .NET without C# (or F# or VB.NET for that matter). This is not a problem in itself, but certainly where some of the issues begin. A new beginner doesn't just learn C# but also has to learn the inner workings of .NET. Things get even more confusing when C# isn't the initial .NET language to learn. Supposedly the loose relationship between .NET languages shouldn't really matter because they compile into IL and become cross compatible. <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/vblang/issues/300">Except when they don't</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/csharp-unmanaged-constraint-leak.png"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/csharp-unmanaged-constraint-leak.png" alt="C# unmanaged constraint language leak"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/framework-libraries#base-class-libraries">BCL (Base Class Libraries)</a> provide the foundation for all three languages, yet they are only written in C#. That's not really an issue unless entire features were written with only one language in mind and are extremely cumbersome to use from another. For example, F# still doesn't have <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/581">native support for <code>Task</code> and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, converting between <code>System.Collection.*</code> classes and F# types is a painful undertaking and F# functions and .NET <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> objects don't map very well.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing though is when <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references">changes to one language</a> force <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/577">additional complexity on another</a>.</p>
<p>Interop issues between those three languages are a big burden on new developers, particularly when they start with something else but C#. However, as painful as this might be, interop problems are not the only complexity which a new beginner has to face. Try to explain to a new C# user in a meaningful way when they should use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/inheritance">inheritance with standard classes</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/">interfaces</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/abstract-and-sealed-classes-and-class-members">abstract classes</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/default-interface-methods-versions">interfaces with default method implementations</a>. The differences between those options have been so watered down that one cannot explain the distinctions in a single coherent answer anymore.</p>
<p>Take this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570814/when-to-use-abstract-classes">StackOverflow question</a> for an example. Nothing which has been described in the accepted (and most upvoted) answer below isn't also true for interfaces with default method implementations today:</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/abstract-class-question-stack-overflow.png"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/abstract-class-question-stack-overflow.png" alt="Abstract class question on StackOverflow"></a></p>
<p>Another great example is the growing variety of C# data types. When is it appropriate to create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/data/using-web-api-with-entity-framework/part-5">data class</a>, an <a href="https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/all-about-c-sharp-immutable-classes2/">immutable data class</a>, a <a href="http://mustoverride.com/tuples_structs/">mutable struct</a>, an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct">immutable struct</a>, a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.tuple?view=netcore-3.1">tuple class</a>, the new concept of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples">named tuples</a> or the upcoming <a href="https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/2020/05/csharp-9-record-types/">record type</a>?</p>
<p>Seasoned .NET developers are very opinionated about when to use each of these types and depending on who a new beginner will ask, or which StackOverflow thread they'll read, they will most likely get very different and often contradicting advice. Anyone who doesn't think that this is a massive problem must be in serious denial. Learning a programming language is hard enough on its own. Learning a programming language where two mentors (who you might look up to) give you contradicting advice is even harder.</p>
<p>The irony is that many of the newly added language and framework features are supposed to make .NET easier to learn:</p>

<p><em>(BTW, I have been a huge proponent of dropping the <code>.csproj</code> and <code>.sln</code> files for a very long time but previously Microsoft employees defended them as if someone offended their family, so it's nice to finally see some support for that idea too! :))</em></p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I agree with Scott that *this particular feature* will make writing a first hello world app a lot easier than before, however, our friend Joseph Woodward makes a good point that nothing comes for free:</p>

<p>It's not just about learning how to write C#. A huge part of learning .NET is reading other people's code, which is also getting inherently more difficult as a result:</p>

<p>Whilst I do like and support the idea of adding more features to C#, I cannot ignore the fact that it also takes its toll.</p>

    <p>One of the most harmful behaviors I’ve observed in ineffective leadership is a tendency to add chaos when one enters a room. Chaos comes in many flavors: A decision was reached about an important architecture question weeks ago, but someone suddenly insists that you revisit the project’s fundamental goals at the 11th hour. An executive insists that their project is most important, and pushes it onto the roadmap. Or maybe you leave a productive meeting without concrete next steps, and are right back where you started in a week.</p>

<h3 id="great-leaders-vacuum-up-chaos">Great leaders vacuum up chaos</h3>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/chaos/tasmanian-devil.jpg" alt="Tasmanian devil going crazy">
Nobody is excited when this guy enters the room</p>

<p>My litmus test for effective leadership: any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. Good leaders can walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and get everyone aligned on a clear path forward. They remove unimportant details, distill complex situations to their essence, and get the right decision-maker to make a call – even if it’s not them. They’re able to not only stop bad plans before it’s too late, but get them moving again in the right direction.</p>

<p>Usually, chaos-causing behavior is unintentional and comes from a good place. Often people are just missing context, or haven’t developed a rhythm for making sure that projects and plans stay organized. In rare cases, it can arise for less savory reasons: someone wants to flex on others by diverting a conversation to a favorite topic or forcing a change of plans.</p>

<h3 id="be-a-source-of-stability">Be a source of stability</h3>

<p>I’ve been guilty of causing my share of unnecessary chaos, and have always regretted it. However, I was fortunate enough to also have a number of teammates who weren’t shy about calling me out for this over the years. I’ve since built a grab bag of practices on how to be better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strive for measurable outcomes, and frequently reinforce the goals of what you’re working on even if it’s repetitive. For example, if you’re trying to increase conversions from your login page, be clear about why this is important and how you’ll measure success.</li>
  <li><a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/05/05/Running-Meetings.html">Insist that all meetings have agendas</a>. Don’t overthink this – a single bullet like “decide what color to make the login button” is fine. A shocking proportion of seemingly simple meetings will wander without this, and it only takes 30 seconds. Don’t let people waste your time, or their own.</li>
  <li>Confirm in-person decisions that were complicated, non-intuitive, or contentious in writing: “We decided the login button should be neon pink so that it really stands out from the blue page background.”</li>
  <li>Use documents for complex decisions. It’s easier to catch when a document is off-track, because unlike a conversation you can see the entire arc of the discussion at once. The decision to make the login button pink should live in a document or ticket.</li>
  <li>When in doubt, over-communicate. Say what you’re planning to do next, so that work doesn’t get duplicated: “I’m going to add this decision on the login button to our design document.” If you’re not going to do something, confirm that as well: “I’m not going to update our design mockups, so if anyone thinks that we’ll need that, speak up now.”</li>
  <li>Avoid using power or appeals to authority to sidestep teams’ processes for prioritization. This is important for teams that you manage, and especially important when working with other teams. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Good lightweight processes</a> are one of the best ways to add efficiency to a team, and breaking them is akin to removing the oil from your car. If you must break processes, make sure to explain why.</li>
  <li>If a plan seems strange, ask questions to understand “why” before asking anyone to change the course of action. If you think that you’re going to need to ask someone to change plans, try to ask at least one extra clarifying question or wait 5 minutes longer in the conversation before reacting.</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly: <em>The fancier your title, the more you must avoid causing chaos</em>. If Bob the Intern frantically flip-flops on the plan for his summer project, people will patiently help him towards a good path and perhaps make sure he has less caffeine tomorrow. If Bob the CEO flip-flops on his strategy, people will capsize the ship trying to enact his will. Remove chaos and you and your team will be happier and more successful.</p>

	<p>While looking for new devices to perform reverse engineering on, I became interested in Bosch’s FlexiDome line of cameras, specifically the FlexiDome 7000, a day/night surveillance camera. This blog post demonstrates how I reverse engineered the firmware file format for the FlexiDome 7000, used that information to unpack earlier firmware versions, discovered how firmware encryption was implemented, reverse engineered the firmware encryption, and wrote an unpacker that supports all tested firmware versions.</p>
<p>This research demonstrates that although manufacturers offer firmware updates to enhance security for legacy products (in this case, through encryption), the limitations of legacy products may prevent them from achieving the level of security of current models that are designed to support the latest security functionality.</p>

<ul><li>Hex editor: A computer program that allows for manipulation of the fundamental binary data that constitutes a computer file.</li>
<li>binwalk, a tool for identifying file contents, entropy measurement, and more.</li>
<li>An open-source tool we developed at Anvil Ventures which was capable of unpacking all tested versions of Bosch camera firmware <sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1');">1</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1">Anvil-Developed Open-Source Tool (<a href="https://github.com/anvilventures/BoschFirmwareTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/anvilventures/BoschFirmwareTool</a>) </span></li>
</ul>
<p>A few quick Google searches didn’t turn up much public security research on the FlexiDome 7000, so I downloaded the current firmware image file. I then unpacked it and attempted to do some reverse engineering and subsequently some bug hunting. However, I soon discovered that the firmware file I had downloaded contained encrypted data.</p>
<p>After searching available release notes for various versions of Bosch camera firmware, I found the following statement Article: <sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2');">2</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2">Bosch IP Video increased security with firmware (<span><a href="https://community.boschsecurity.com/t5/Security-Video/TB-VS-Bosch-IP-Video-increased-security-with-Firmware-6-51/ta-p/4387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://community.boschsecurity.com/t5/Security-Video/TB-VS-Bosch-IP-Video-increased-security-with-Firmware-6-51/ta-p/4387 )</a></span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to upload version 6.51 to a device running a firmware version below 6.50, you need to upgrade first to version 6.50, since older firmware versions do not support firmware file decryption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement led me to believe that I might be able to unpack a version prior to 6.50. To test this assumption, I downloaded several prior versions and began trying to reverse engineer the file format and obtain its contents.</p>

<p>I started with a sample firmware file prior to version 6.50, which I downloaded from the Bosch website <sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_3" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_3');">3</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3">EXTEGRA IP 9000 &nbsp;Firmware Maintenance Release Download (<a href="https://downloadstore.boschsecurity.com/FILES/CPP4_H.264_6.32.0124_EXTEGRA_only.fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://downloadstore.boschsecurity.com/FILES/CPP4_H.264_6.32.0124_EXTEGRA_only.fw) </a></span>This is a maintenance release of firmware for the EXTEGRA IP 9000 camera. &nbsp;I loaded the file into a hex editor to begin working on it. This file was an unencrypted example.</p>
<p>My initial process was to try to figure out the basic structure of the file. Essentially, I wanted to learn:</p>
<ul><li>How is the file structured? (e.g. headers and then data, multiple sections)</li>
<li>Where is some of the basic metadata stored? (Length, checksums, magic numbers, etc.)</li>
</ul><p>To explore these questions, I wanted to break the file down into metadata and actual firmware data. Before we discuss that, it helps to understand that many file formats such as ZIP, Windows PE, and others have structural features in common.</p>
<h2>File Format Primer</h2>
<p>Many file formats use one or more “magic numbers,” a constant numerical or text value used to identify the file as belonging to a certain format. For example, ZIP files generally start with PK\x03\x04 as an identifier. Magic numbers give a file parser a quick way to test the file before performing more intensive parsing.</p>
<p>Other common fields can help a parser identify the contents and where in the file they are located. In a binary file or archive, these include length, one or more checksums, and other metadata.</p>
<p>When reverse engineering an unknown file format, it helps to consider the type of data a file is expected to contain. Many firmware file formats contain either separate files (i.e. an archive) or data segments that are directly written into the nonvolatile storage on a device.</p>
<h2>Bosch Firmware Format</h2>
<h3><strong>Headers</strong></h3>
<p>At first glance, I found that this firmware file was broken into what appeared to be sections. The first 1-2KB of data in a hex editor revealed a sparse set of values, followed by a large, seemingly random segment. The very first value (10 12 20 03) in the firmware was found in a handful of locations in the file, always at the start and the end of a 1024-byte long section. Each of these “sections” was followed by what appeared to be binary data. Shown below is the first 64 bytes of the 1024-byte header.</p>
<pre>Offset(h) 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

00000000  10 12 20 03 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 32  .. ............2
00000010  03 BC B4 90 00 00 00 00 CF 77 AE FA 00 00 00 00  .¼´.....Ïw®ú....
00000020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
00000030  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
</pre>
<p>First came the magic number for what I assumed were header sections. A handful of other values stood out, all 32-bit values:</p>
<ul><li>00 00 06 32 matched the version in the firmware file itself (6.32)</li>
<li>The 32-bit value following that (03 BC B4 90) matched the length of the entire file, minus the length of the header.</li>
<li>CF 77 AE FA appeared to be random, but such values are frequently checksums or cyclic redundancy checks in formats like this. A quick check in the hex editor showed that the Checksum-32 of the file following this header matched this value.</li>
</ul><p>These are all big endian values, which means the most significant byte (or “big end”) is placed at the byte with the lowest address. In my experience, most binary file formats are designed with a single endianness in mind, and figuring out which is in use becomes clear as different fields (e.g. length) are found in the file format.</p>
<p>This was already enough information to write a few lines of Python code and break up the file into sections, each with its own headers and data.</p>
<h3><strong>Data</strong></h3>
<p>Data segments in this file appeared to be random / encrypted, but were they? A good first check is to use a tool that can perform entropy measurement, such as binwalk. The output of binwalk on the data following a file header in this file looks like:</p>
<pre>DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     ENTROPY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             Rising entropy edge (0.985878)
12675072      0xC16800        Falling entropy edge (0.827170)
12828672      0xC3C000        Rising entropy edge (0.997896)
19488768      0x1296000       Rising entropy edge (0.977441)
19611648      0x12B4000       Rising entropy edge (0.983196)
19673088      0x12C3000       Falling entropy edge (0.791758)
19765248      0x12D9800       Falling entropy edge (0.671344)
...snip...
</pre>
<p>Another several dozen lines follow. The data clearly isn’t random, so some form of obfuscation is likely. Encrypted data would have an entropy of &gt;0.99 when seen by Binwalk's entropy analysis. Since the documentation I found (and listed at the beginning of this post) pointed to encryption only being used on later versions, logic dictated that some other form of obfuscation was in play.</p>
<p>My assumption here was that the contents of this section were one or several files, presumably containing binary data and executable code. Therefore, when looking at this form of data in a hex editor, I expected to see segments of data separated with padding. Usually, an executable image will space out sections with padding made of zero (\x00) bytes. Looking at the header again, there are long runs of a single character throughout the data, such as:</p>
<pre>Offset(h) 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

03BCB740  42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42  BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB

</pre>
<p>After a bit of thinking, my first guess was that those should be padding or zero bytes, and that the image was XOR-encoded. A few lines of quick Python scripting to examine the XOR obfuscation resulted in data looking like:</p>
<pre>Offset(h) 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

</pre>
<p>Clearly this was some form of file header, followed by a file name and additional metadata. I confirmed that I had usable file contents by running <code>binwalk</code> on the resulting data section.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>Many people who use Rust for a bit - especially those who like the language but
do not fall in love with it - feel a sense that there must be a smaller,
simpler variation on the same theme which would maybe be a little less
powerful, but would also be much easier to use. I agree with them, but I think
they are almost always wrong about what would need to change. Here are some
notes on where I would start to create that smaller Rust.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-rust-work">What makes Rust work</h2>
<p>People almost always start in precisely the wrong place when they say how they
would change Rust, because they almost always start by saying they would add
garbage collection. This can only come from a place of naive confusion about
what makes Rust work.</p>
<p>Rust works because it enables users to write in an imperative programming
style, which is the mainstream style of programming that most users are
familiar with, while avoiding to an impressive degree the kinds of bugs that
imperative programming is notorious for. As I said once, pure functional
programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but
Rust is an even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
<p>Here are the necessary components of Rust to make imperative programming work
as a paradigm. Shockling few other production-ready imperative languages have
the first of these, and none of them have the others at all (at least, none
have them implemented correctly; C++ has unsafe analogs). Unsurprisingly, the
common names for these concepts are all opaque nonsense:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Algebraic data types”:</strong> Having both “product types” (in Rust <em>structs</em>)
and “sum types” (in Rust <em>enums</em>) is crucial. The language must not have
null, it must instead use an Option wrapper. It must have strong pattern
matching and destructuring facilities, and never insert implicit crashing
branches.</li>
<li><strong>Resource acquisition is initialization:</strong> Objects should manage
conceptual resources like file descriptors and sockets, and have destructors
which clean up resource state when the object goes out of scope. It should be
trivial to be confident the destructor will run when the object goes out of
scope. This necesitates most of ownership, moving, and borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Aliasable XOR mutable:</strong> The default should be that values can be mutated
only if they are not aliased, and there should be no way to introduce
unsynchronized aliased mutation. However, the language should support
mutating values. The only way to get this is the rest of ownership and
borrowing, the distinction between borrows and mutable borrows and the
aliasing rules between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the core, commonly identified “hard part” of Rust - ownership
and borrowing - is essentially applicable for any attempt to make checking the
correctness of an imperative program tractable. So trying to get rid of it
would be missing the real insight of Rust, and not building on the foundations
Rust has laid out.</p>
<p>However, once you get away from that, there is must about Rust that is
<em>circumstantial</em> complexity, only because of Rust’s extensive efforts to
support a low-overhead high-control systems programming use case.</p>
<h2 id="how-rust-could-be-simpler-if-it-werent-a-systems-language">How Rust could be simpler if it weren’t a “systems” language</h2>
<p>The first thing I would do is abandon any guarantee about whether variables are
allocated on the stack or the heap. Rust has to provide users with this sort of
low level control to be viable in all the places that it is, but this is the
singular source of complexity that doesn’t contribute to the benefits of Rust I
described in the previous section. Like Go, the compiler will decide for you if
your variables go on the stack or the heap.</p>
<p>The main way this simplifies things is it allows ownership to be detatched
from representation. An owned, borrowed, and mutably borrowed <code>T</code> would all
share the same representation; they’re just type-level modifiers used to
determine what kind of control you have (an owned <code>T</code> is just a mutably
borrowed <code>T</code> that will drop at the end of this scope). Probably I would also
add a fourth modifier which is shared ownership, probably implemented via
garbage collection. These would have the same semantics as <code>Arc</code>, except that
it would be possible to implement them so that they don’t leak on cycles.</p>
<p>This would not simplify ownership and borrowing in any fundamental way, but I
believe it would eliminate a lot of the confusions people run into as they’re
getting the hang of ownership and borrowing. For example, there could be only
one string type.</p>
<p>The next change would to make trait objects the primary form of polymorphism.
Every trait would be object safe, and casting a type into a trait it implements
would be lightweight and easy because it can be heap-allocated by the compiler
behind the scenes. No more monomorphization (at least, except as an
optimization). Generics would exist only for creating polymorphic container
types, not as the main way of making polymorphic <em>functions</em>.</p>
<p>I would also take Rust’s commitment to concurrency-first and make all the
available primitives threadsafe. No <code>Rc</code>, no <code>Cell</code> and <code>RefCell</code>. Interior
mutability is only allowed through a mutex type, and everything can be moved
across threads. <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> would only exist as some built-in checks on
ownership-related types.</p>
<p>I think closures and arrays/vecs/slices could also be simplified a great deal
by not guaranteeing anything about where they’re allocated, though I haven’t
worked out all the details.</p>
<p>Such a language would almost certainly also use green threads, and have a
simple CSP/actor model like Go does. There’d be no reason to have “zero cost”
futures and async/await like we do in Rust. This would impose a runtime, but
that’s fine - we’re not creating a systems language. I already said earlier
that we’d probably have garbage collection, after all.</p>
<p>And there are also many things I’m not sure about. I’m not sure that basing the
interface polymorphism on Haskell type classes would be the best decision for
this language (though I love it for Rust). I’m not sure what kind of
metaprogramming facilities the language should have (I would <em>not</em> include
macro_rules-style macros without a long iterative design process that ours
did not get.) I’m not sure what I would change about cargo - probably nothing
fundamental, cargo is great.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing I’m unsure about - and the most controversial - is error
handling. I would probably experiment with exceptions if I were making this
language. I believe that all of the big problems with exceptions are solved by
those core benefits of Rust I described initially, which provide strong
guarantees that program state will be correctly cleaned up as a program
crashes, and correctly restored as the crash is halted. I think I would at
least make panicking the normal response to most IO failures. (Even with
exceptions users could still use Result for the kinds of errors exceptions
don’t make sense for).</p>
<p>I would expect this language to have performance characteristics similar to
Java or Go, and to be viable for all the use cases they are (plus on the front
end!) It would introduce some additional complexity in the form of ownership
and borrowing, but would not be nearly the slog for new users that Rust
currently is. And in exchange you would get a language which prevents a huge
class of errors that no other imperative language except Rust helps you with
today.</p>
<p>Finally, if I were creating a non-systems language today, even if I weren’t
taking this advice, I would do this one important additional thing. I would be
careful to design and implement the compiler so that it could be embedded in
different runtimes, and I would have two primary targets: an LLVM based one
creating a standalone binary on the mainstream UNIX and windows OSes, and a
WASM target that would be intended to use the host VM’s runtime for threads,
garbage collection, and so on. This is the best decision anyone creating a new
production-ready language in 2019 could make if they want to see widespread
adoption.</p>
<p>Oh and of course, I would implement this language and its runtime in Rust!</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h2>
<p>It’s a fresh new day at work, and you want to find the dot product of two arrays (that is, the sum of the product of the pairs of elements). You’re using your favourite language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)">F#</a>. You’re allergic to <code>Seq.zip</code> (maybe you’re terrified of virtual calls or something), and <code>Array.zip</code> just allocates too much memory. Also, you want to make sure you can bail out of the iteration early; what if someone tells you at the last minute that you have to stop if you see the number <code>100</code>?</p>
<p>Cracking your knuckles, the following pours from your fingertips:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Easy, of course! And then you write the unit tests and discover how truly exquisite the infinite loop is that you have made.</p>
<p>With a gentle sigh of one who has arisen bright and refreshed only to discover the computer in a sullen and recalcitrant mood, you insert the line that makes everything work.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
        <span>// How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</span>
        <span>// seem to me all the uses of this world</span>
        i <span>&lt;-</span> i <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now the tests pass, and you can stride forward into a glorious day of productivity.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it have been lovely if this mistake hadn’t happened?</p>
<h2 id="going-loopy">Going loopy</h2>
<p>The mistake was that we introduced a piece of state, but never changed it. A sufficiently advanced compiler can warn us about a variable that is set but never used – but the problem still remains in general. (What if we had printed the iteration variable, and therefore used it? Or what if we had a slightly more complicated computation for which we legitimately performed some mutation to the state in our loop body, but still forgot to do the final increment?)</p>
<p>With a small change to the shape of this function, we can make the bug so obvious that we would never dream of making it.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>(</span>ans <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>if</span> shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>then</span>
            go <span>(</span>ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]))</span> <span>(</span>i <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span>
            ans

    go <span>0</span> <span>0</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we are forced to declare explicitly that the index in the next iteration will be <code>i + 1</code>. Merely omitting this decision is not an option any more, because the compiler will force us to give a second argument to <code>go</code> whenever we invoke it.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the termination condition of the loop has been tidied up; I would argue that it’s now easier to see that if <code>shouldContinue</code> fails, we return the value we’d got up to <em>before</em> the current index. (Admittedly, that one is more of a matter of taste; maybe you personally find it easier to understand the termination condition of the explicit <code>while</code> loop.)</p>
<p>And in a language like F#, we don’t lose any performance using this approach. A language with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail-call optimisation</a> will optimise away the recursive call into an imperative loop behind the scenes; in fact, the recursive and the imperative code may well boil down to exactly the same machine code. (By contrast, some languages like Python lack tail-call optimisation, so in Python this approach is liable to end in a stack overflow.)</p>
<h2 id="backing-off">Backing off</h2>
<p>For another prime example, consider a famous saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What is less often noted is that one should wait some period of time in between each retry.</p>
<p>Of course, there are libraries which do this for you (<a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly">Polly</a>, for example). But for the sake of argument, let’s say we want to write a simple exponential backoff ourselves. (We’ll mock out the <code>sleep</code> function, to allow us to test the logic more easily; it’ll probably be given as <code>System.Threading.Thread.Sleep</code> at the call site, but nobody wants to be calling <code>Thread.Sleep</code> in a unit test.)</p>

</div>
<p>Easy enough, but let’s give it the recursive treatment:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> doThingRetryingWithBackoff<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>err<span>&gt;</span>

    <span>=</span>

                go newRetries

    go <span>0</span>

</div>
<p>No need for the sad <code>isDone</code> sentinel here! Since looping was an active choice (an explicit call to <code>go</code>), we were free simply to choose not to loop at any point, and specifically at the point where <code>doThing</code> had returned successfully.</p>

</div>
<p>This example looks too simple to be of any use, and maybe indeed it is; and of course in real life there is <code>System.Timers.Timer</code> which solves this problem better. (This is only a toy example.)</p>
<p>But I would argue that once you’re familiar with the general pattern, this is a natural way to express the loop. Moreover, it is extremely extensible: if we decide we don’t actually want to loop forever, it’s trivial to add extra state by inserting it as parameters to <code>go</code>, and the compiler will try its best to help us use it correctly. (By contrast, with the <code>while</code> loop and mutable state, we are on our own: the compiler can’t know what we had in mind for the state.<br>
It will freely let us either modify the state when we didn’t want to, or fail to modify it when we did want to.)</p>
<h2 id="winding-up">Winding up</h2>
<p>Though it may look very odd at first sight, it soon becomes quite natural to think about loops in this recursive way. It allows you to express more of the problem in the type system, helping the compiler to point out when you’ve done things like “adding a new piece of state but forgetting to use it everywhere you wanted it”. It also makes the act of looping into a conscious choice at each stage; if you’ve ever longed for the good old days of <code>goto</code> to break out of loops, this actually gives you back something of that flavour, but much more safe!</p>
<p>Making the loop state immutable makes it easier to reason about the invariants and behaviour of the loop, and helps you write safer programs fast.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The following is the result of my junkyard-wars attempt to throw together a terminal server solution in the continued pursuit of zero-touch provisioning and administration of my home linux systems.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-wanted-remote-console-access">Why I wanted remote console access</h2>
<p>I run a number of services in my home covering all the essentials such as media serving, DNS, local cloud, PBX, Minecraft containers, etc.  This started out years ago from a single Mac Mini, but has grown over time to consist of two redundant headless PCs.  Having two systems rather than one has been critical for uptime as my family has become more dependent on these services.  Embracing IaC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as Code</a>) through tools like Ansible has helped tremendously;  particularly with the reality of a home network where I can’t just drop other responsibilities to put on my sysadmin dad cap (or <a href="https://getfedora.org/">fedora</a> in my case).</p>
<p>Having this redundancy has helped, but more than a few times I have gotten into a situation where I have attempted to preform a system update on one of the pair remotely from cafe or sofa and the PC failed to come back up after a reboot.  Often this was due to DKMS mods that didn’t work on a new kernel version or things of that nature.  I would have to either give up on it until I had time to get physical access (get off the sofa) or beg one of my kids to act as remote hands.  These are PCs and they don’t have any iLO, LOM, or DRAC built in.  I could not justify the cost of upgrading to server-grade motherboards.  I needed something that would give me remote console access to these systems on the cheap.  I spotted a Raspberry Pi collecting dust in the corner of my office and started to have some ideas.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.lasseter.org/img/grub_screen.png" alt="retro term grub screen"></p><h2 id="serial-hardware">Serial hardware</h2>
<p>It has been a while, but I have great memories of pinning out custom serial cables.  Spending hours in the blissful white-noise hum of the data center with my trusty RS-232 breakout box (das blinkenlights), occasionally an oscilloscope if things got really desperate, and a huge box of almost every conceivable serial adaptor and null modem, but almost never the one you need.  I even impressed my wife (gf at that time) back then by turning a box of spare shiny silver RJ45-DB9 adaptors into ornaments for our first Christmas tree.  At least, I think she was impressed.  Yes, of course she was impressed.  That was the coolest tree in all of New York that year.  The way the lights reflected off the silver Sun Microsystems logos really captured the holiday spirit.  But I digress.  I no longer have that box of serial adaptors and my wife somehow can’t remember where it went since we got maried.  So, off to Amazon I went.</p>
<p>My PCs didn’t have serial ports on the back, though a quick look under the hood showed that both had COM1 headers.  I just needed to get backplates for access.  But, these these are pretty cheap: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001Y1F0HW">https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001Y1F0HW</a></p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.lasseter.org/img/serial_orders.png" alt="adaptor and backplate"></p><h2 id="cable-runs">Cable runs</h2>
<p>Now that my PCs had serial ports, I needed to decide how to connect to them.  My idea was to use a Raspberry Pi as a terminal server and connect to the two serial ports of the PCs using USB-DB9 RS-232 adaptors,  But, before getting the RaPi involved I would just connect the servers to each other in the same fashion. I wanted to have some flexibility with what cables I used in case I changed how far apart the PCs sat, so I opted for a cableless adaptor that I could plug a USB cable extender into of whatever length I needed.  I already had spare extenders, so this worked out great.  I found these adaptors came in two varieties: PL2303 and FTDI.  I checked reviews long enough to find evidence of Linux users using the FTDI kind with success and went with that one.  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0769G9HK4">https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0769G9HK4</a></p>
<h2 id="bios-changes">BIOS changes</h2>
<p>On each PC, I booted into BIOS and confirmed COM1 was enabled.  Both had the ability to turn it off, but they were both on by default, so no change needed.  While I was in there I also looked for the BIOS settings to auto-power-on after power-loss and set those so that I would not have to press a button to start them up when power returned.  Now with both systems running again and each connected to the other via USB to serial, I was done with the hardware side of the project (aside from the RaPi addition to come).</p>
<h2 id="configuring-io">Configuring IO</h2>
<p>I run CentOS on my servers.  If you use this post as a guide, do keep that in mind.  The following software configuration is likely to be different outside of the RHEL/CentOS/Fedora family.</p>
<h3 id="giving-the-serial-port-access-to-login">Giving the serial port access to login</h3>
<p>getty is the program that listens for terminal connections and provides login access to a given terminal.  Here I enabled and started the service for COM1 (ttyS0).  Without this, the remote serial user would never be prompted to log in.</p>
<p><code>$ sudo systemctl enable --now serial-getty@ttyS0.service</code></p>
<h3 id="grub-setup">Grub setup</h3>
<p>I needed to configure grub2 to use the serial port for input and output, otherwise I would not be able to interact with grub on a reboot.  An example is escaping the boot process at the grub menu in order to boot into recovery mode or to simply boot from the last known working kernel.  To achieve this, I made these changes to /etc/default/grub:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT and GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT to <code>serial</code>.</li>
<li>Set GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND with the appropriate speed of 115200.</li>
<li>Added <code>console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial</code> to the end of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX so the kernel would also use the serial port.</li>
<li>Removed both <code>rhgb</code> and <code>quiet</code> from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in order to have verbose output of the boot status.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my grub config:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span># /etc/default/grub</span>
<span>GRUB_TIMEOUT</span><span>=</span><span>5</span>
<span>GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR</span><span>=</span><span>"$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"</span>
<span>GRUB_DEFAULT</span><span>=</span><span>saved</span>
<span>GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU</span><span>=</span><span>true</span>
<span>GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT</span><span>=</span><span>"serial"</span>
<span>GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT</span><span>=</span><span>"serial"</span>
<span>GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND</span><span>=</span><span>"serial --speed=115200"</span>
<span>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX</span><span>=</span><span>"crashkernel=auto resume=/dev/mapper/cl-swap rd.lvm.lv=cl/root rd.lvm.lv=cl/swap console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial"</span>
<span>GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY</span><span>=</span><span>"true"</span>
<span>GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG</span><span>=</span><span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To activate this new configuration, I used <code>grub2-mkconfig -o &lt;output file&gt;</code>.  You would need to check on your setup, but for recent RHEL/CentOS/Fedora systems, that would be <code>/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</code> for MBR or <code>/boot/efi/EFI/&lt;distro&gt;/grub.cfg</code> for EFI.</p>
<h2 id="console-session-management">Console session management</h2>
<p>There are a number of different tools you could use to access the terminal, such as <code>screen</code>, <code>minicom</code>, or <code>tip</code>, but I want something that will manage the connection fully as a daemon and keep logs of the output for my review.  That is important because sometimes when a system runs into trouble, it may be able to log clues to the console even when permanent storage is not available at that moment.  There is a fantastic program called <code>conserver</code> that does all that and more.  You can define connections, whether they be local or over ssh.  It can facilitate user management with access rules and even concurrent connections to the same terminal session with the admins taking turns having write access.  In the world of serial consoles, this is all very exciting.  Well, I think it is exciting, anyway.</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/bstansell/conserver">https://github.com/bstansell/conserver</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setting-up-conserver">Setting up conserver</h3>
<p>For this specific setup, I’ve installed and configured conserver in a very limited way.  Both servers run the conserver service independently rather than having it centralized.  I configure <code>console</code> in <code>/etc/hosts</code> to point to localhost on both systems.  This is needed because conserver’s client program, <code>console</code> looks to connect to the host named <code>console</code> by default.  And finally, the <code>/etc/conserver.cf</code> configuration is minimal and defines just enough to instruct it to manage the tty of our connected USB serial adaptor (<code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> in my case for both systems).</p>
<p>On each server I install the following two packages which are availible in the <code>EPEL</code> repo for REHL/CentOS and the base <code>fedora</code> repo for Fedora:</p>
<ul>
<li>conserver</li>
<li>conserver-client</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ sudo dnf install -y conserver conserver-client</code></p>
<p>I’ve found that this package doesn’t create the default log directory, so I need to do that ahead of time:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo mkdir -p /var/consoles</code></p>
<p>This minimal configuration will set up a managed session named <code>peer</code> for device <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>.  If you would rather use the hostname of the remote system, then change that.  And of course, adjust the tty name if it doesn’t match what is correct for your environment.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tcl"><span># /etc/conserver.cf
</span><span>
</span><span></span>default <span>*</span> <span>{</span>
        logfile <span>/</span>var<span>/</span>consoles<span>/&amp;</span><span>;</span>        <span># '&amp;' is replaced with console name
</span><span></span>        timestamp <span>1</span>hab<span>;</span>                 <span># write timestamps
</span><span></span>        rw <span>*</span><span>;</span>                           <span># allow all users
</span><span></span>        master localhost<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

console peer <span>{</span>
        type device<span>;</span>
        device <span>/</span>dev<span>/</span>ttyUSB0<span>;</span> parity none<span>;</span> baud <span>115200</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

access <span>*</span> <span>{</span>
        trusted <span>127.0</span>.0.1<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Lastly, I enable and start the conserver daemon:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo systemctl enable --now conserver</code></p>
<h3 id="using-conserver">Using conserver</h3>
<p>Now that I have installed and configured all of the hardware and software and have the two servers each connected to each other’s serial ports, I’m ready to connect with conserver’s <code>console</code> command.  In the example configuration above, I named the conserver session <code>peer</code>, and thus I connect by issuing the following:</p>
<p><code>$ console peer</code></p>
<p>If everything is working I should get a login prompt from the peer server when I hit enter after launching console.  The default escape sequence while within console is <code>ctrl</code>-<code>e</code> <code>c</code> (ctrl and the e key, let go, then press c).  To disconnect from the console, enter the escape sequence, followed by a period (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>e</code> <code>c</code> <code>.</code>).  To see all of the control codes, type the escape sequence, followed by a question mark (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>e</code> <code>c</code> <code>?</code>).  The man page on <code>console</code> explains the rest, however that covers the basics to connect and disconnect from the running console session.  You can review log history from within the same interface, but I usually find it easier to open the generated log file in <code>/var/console</code> with my favorite pager.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>So far this setup has served me well and I have already needed to use remote console access a few times while doing installs and network interface reconfigurations without …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.</p><p>As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.</p><p>Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:</p><ul><li><p>Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.</p></li><li><p>Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.</p></li><li><p>Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.</p></li><li><p>Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.</p></li><li><p>Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).</p></li></ul><h2 id="anatomy-of-a-design-doc">Anatomy of a design doc <a href="#anatomy-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h2><p>Design docs are informal documents and thus don’t follow a strict guideline for their content. Rule #1 is: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project.</p><p>Having said that, a certain structure has established itself as really useful.</p><h3 id="context-and-scope">Context and scope <a href="#context-and-scope">#</a></h3><p>This section gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which the new system is being built and what is actually being built. This isn’t a requirements doc. Keep it succinct! The goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.</p><h3 id="goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals <a href="#goals-and-non-goals">#</a></h3><p>A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals aren’t negated goals like “The system shouldn’t crash”, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be “ACID compliance”; when designing a database, you’d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesn’t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.</p><h3 id="the-actual-design">The actual design <a href="#the-actual-design">#</a></h3><p>This section should start with an overview and then go into details.</p><p><img alt="Visualization of how to draw an owl. First picture: two circles labeled &quot;1. Draw some circles&quot;. Second picture: Picture of an own labeled &quot;2.

Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.</p><p>The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem set at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance for how to actually describe the design.</p><p>Having said that, a few best practices and repeating topics have emerged that make sense for a large percentage of design docs:</p><h4 id="system-context-diagram"><strong>System-context-diagram</strong> <a href="#system-context-diagram">#</a></h4><p>In many docs a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram">system-context-diagram</a></em> can be very useful. Such a diagram shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already familiar with.</p><p><img alt="Block diagram showing how various systems are related to each other. The actual text is just examples and not needed to be seen to understand the example." height="333" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N.png" width="655" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-320w.jpg 320w"><br><em>Example of a system-context-diagram.</em></p><h4 id="apis">APIs <a href="#apis">#</a></h4><p>If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="data-storage">Data storage <a href="#data-storage">#</a></h4><p>Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="code-and-pseudo-code">Code and pseudo-code <a href="#code-and-pseudo-code">#</a></h4><p>Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the implementability of the design.</p><h4 id="degree-of-constraint">Degree of constraint <a href="#degree-of-constraint">#</a></h4><p>One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.</p><p>On one end of the extreme is the “greenfield software project”, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.</p><p>On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn’t at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn’t designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.</p><p>In this situation you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are really great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.</p><h3 id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered <a href="#alternatives-considered">#</a></h3><p>This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.</p><p>While it is fine to be succinct about solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.</p><h3 id="cross-cutting-concerns">Cross-cutting concerns <a href="#cross-cutting-concerns">#</a></h3><p>This is where your organization can ensure that certain cross-cutting concerns such as security, privacy, and observability are always taken into consideration. These are often relatively short sections that explain how the design impacts the concern and how the concern is addressed. Teams should standardize what these concerns are in their case.</p><p>Due to their importance, Google projects are required to have a dedicated privacy design doc, and there are dedicated reviews for privacy and security. While the reviews are only required to be completed by the time a project launches, it is best practice to engage with privacy and security teams as early as possible to ensure that designs take them into account from the ground up. In case of dedicated docs for these topics, the central design doc can, of course, reference them instead of going into detail.</p><h3 id="the-length-of-a-design-doc">The length of a design doc <a href="#the-length-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h3><p>Design docs should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project seems to be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page “mini design doc”. This is especially helpful for incremental improvements or sub tasks in an agile project–you still do all the same steps as for a longer doc, just keep things more terse and focused on a limited problem set.</p><h2 id="when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">When <em>not</em> to write a design doc. <a href="#when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">#</a></h2><p>Writing design docs is overhead. The decision whether to write a design doc comes down to the core trade-off of deciding whether the benefits in organizational consensus around design, documentation, senior review, etc. outweigh the extra work of creating the doc. At the center of that decision lies whether the solution to the design problem is ambiguous–because of problem complexity or solution complexity, or both. If it is not, then there is little value in going through the process of writing a doc.</p><p>A clear indicator that a doc might not be necessary are design docs that are really <em>implementation manuals</em>. If a doc basically says “This is how we are going to implement it” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious as to mean there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual program right away.</p><p>Finally, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and rapid iteration. However, most software projects do have a set of <em>actually known problems</em>. Subscribing to agile methodologies is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to actually known problems right. Additionally, prototyping itself may be part of the design doc creation. “I tried it out and it works” is one of the best arguments for choosing a design.</p><h2 id="the-design-doc-lifecycle">The design doc lifecycle <a href="#the-design-doc-lifecycle">#</a></h2><p>The steps in the lifecycle of a design document are:</p><ol><li>Creation and rapid iteration</li><li>Review (may be in multiple rounds)</li><li>Implementation and iteration</li><li>Maintenance and learning</li></ol><h3 id="creation-and-rapid-iteration">Creation and rapid iteration <a href="#creation-and-rapid-iteration">#</a></h3><p>You write the doc.

<p>The <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/">ListenBrainz</a> team has been working hard on moving our primary listen store from <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> to <a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>, and today at UTC 16:00 we’re going to make the switch.</p>



<p>We were asked on Twitter as to why we’re making the switch — and in the interest of giving a real world use case for switching, I’m writing this post. The reasons are numerous:</p>



<p><strong>Openness</strong>: InfluxDB seems on a path that will make it less open over time. TimescaleDB and its dependence on Postgres makes us feel much safer in this regard.</p>



<p><strong>Existing use</strong>: We’ve been using Postgres for about 18 years now and it has been a reliable workhorse for us. Our team thinks in terms of Postgres and InfluxDB  always felt like a round peg in a square hole for us.</p>



<p><strong>Data structure</strong>: InfluxDB was clearly designed to store server event info. We’re storing listen information, which has a slightly different usage pattern, but this slight difference is enough for us to hit a brick wall with far fewer users in our DB than we ever anticipated. InfluxDB is simply not flexible enough for our needs.</p>



<p><strong>Query syntax and measurement names</strong>: The syntax to query InfluxDB is weird and obfuscated. We made the mistake of trying to have a measurement map to a user, but <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/blob/b0846d2a/listenbrainz/utils.py#L42">escaping measurement names correctly</a> nearly drove one of our team members to the loonie bin. </p>



<p><strong>Existing data</strong>: If you ever write bad data to a measurement in InfluxDB, there is no way to change it. I realize that this is a common Big Data usage pattern, but for us it represented significant challenges and serious restrictions to put simple features for our users into place. With TimescaleDB we can make the very occasional UPDATE or DELETE and move on.</p>



<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Even though we attempted to read as much as possible in order to design a scalable schema, we still failed and got it wrong. (I don’t even think that the docs to calculate scalability even existed when we first started using InfluxDB.) Unless you are using InfluxDB in exactly the way it was meant to be used, there are chances you’ll hit this problem as well. For us, one day insert speed dropped to a ridiculously low number per second, backing up our systems. Digging into the problem we realized that our schema design had a fatal flaw and that we would have drastically change the schema to something even less intuitive in order to fix it.  This was the event that broke the camel’s back and I started searching for alternatives. </p>



<p>In moving to TimescaleDB we were able to delete a ton of complicated code and embrace a DB that we know and love. We know how Postgres scales, we know how to put it into production and we know its caveats. TimescaleDB allows us to be flexible with the data and the amazing queries that can be performed on the data is pure Postgres love. TimescaleDB still requires some careful thinking over using Postgres, it is far less than what is required when using InfluxDB. TimescaleDB also gives us a clear scaling path forward, even when TimescaleDB is still working on their own scaling roadmap. If TimescaleDB evolves anything like Postgres has, I can’t wait to see this evolution.</p>



<p>Big big thanks to the Postgres and TimescaleDB teams! </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

	
		



	
	
		<section>

	

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>I proposed what would become Lacework in the Summer of 2019. In my proposal, I describe a cycle of videos curated from MIT's '<a href="http://moments.csail.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moments In Time</a>' dataset, each then slowed down, interpolated, and upscaled immensely into imagined detail, one flowing into another like a river.</p>
<p>In many ways, Moments In Time is unremarkable. Like so many datasets with similar goals, Moments In Time is intended to train AI systems to recognize actions. It contains one million, 3-second videos scraped from websites like YouTube and Flickr, each tagged with a single verb like asking, resting, snowing or praying.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>There are a few things that are particular about Moments In Time. It tries to break down <em>most possible actions</em> into just 339 'doing' verbs. It also doesn't clarify about the subjects of its videos- for instance, it is more interested that something is flying than if that thing is a bee, flower, person, plane, satellite, or bird. Moments In Time decenters human actions in favour of how words might apply to broader swaths of doing.</p>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Because these decisions require a particular type of logic, the language of this research is oddly poetic. <a href="https://moments.csail.mit.edu/TPAMI.2019.2901464.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The associated whitepaper</a> reads: "three seconds is a temporal envelope which holds meaningful actions between people, objects and phenomena"; and "visual and auditory events can be symmetrical in time ("opening" is "closing" in reverse), and either transient or sustained."</p>
<p>One million videos is not a particularly large archive in the world of big data, but it is still a number meant for machine comprehension, not human. The first time I opened the dataset I got dizzy. One million moments, placed in folders named simply- sleeping, slicing, sliding, smelling, smiling. I felt like I’d been placed down somewhere on the surface of the earth, and told to walk home.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Without a methodology, I began haphazardly moving through the folders, dipping into specific verbs, pulling up a few dozen random videos until I found one that I liked. This was enough to test the aesthetic process through which I would approach the work but did little to teach me about the structure of the dataset itself. It was not until I entered quarantine in March, months after I’d begun, that this process moved from a random selection to a deliberate and focused one. </p>
<p>When the pandemic moved the project online, I considered focusing on videos about touch, this subject that had been transmuted from a casual action to a precious and dangerous one. I pulled roughly 20 folders from the archive by verb- cuddling, hugging, punching, reaching. These folders still contained 60,000 videos between them, but this was a scale that I felt was possible to approach, as one person stuck in a room.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>As the world entombed, I spent my time watching these short, tiny moments of intimacy- two lovebirds beak to beak, a tiger putting paws around a keeper, the contact of a fist to a face, a kiss, a crowd, a touch. </p>
<p>I was looking for videos with a lot of texture to them, with subjects at a distance, in shapes or colours that were already confusing. I wanted compositions that the AI upscaling could catch onto and drag against, pulling a cloud into a mountain or a face into a coastline.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>Somehow, I had expected the act of watching Moments in Time to be calming or exploratory, like seeing the world out of a window. But the archive is not entertaining, poetic, beautiful, or joyful- even though many videos that evoke those feelings are contained within it. It is an archive with purpose, an archive of actions for an inhuman eye. Here is the world, here are things that are done there. It feels raw.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Eventually, I built myself a Tinder-like interface for screening the videos. Each video would pop up and I would then tap the left or right arrow key to sort it into place- <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em>, keep or throw away. </p>
<p>Out of these 60,000 videos I selected roughly 400. I slowed each one down dramatically, drawing the video out to 15 seconds from its original three. I interpolated the frames, attempting to make a new flowing motion to replace the smoothness lost in the time conversion. I wanted to be able to study these moments intended to teach machines what it is to touch. I wanted to see each small choice in each body taking action, removed from human time.</p>	</div>

		<section>

	<div>
		<p>It was now early April. I had watched 6% of the dataset, about 50 hours of videos, and from them had made a little over an hour of material.</p>
<p>I could have stopped there. But I kept thinking about the rest of the archive- all those other verbs, all this other life. I felt that the videos around touch were not enough of the story. They didn’t say enough about what the dataset was trying to do, what it contained.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>I decided I needed to watch the rest of the dataset. This time I started at the top, alphabetically.</p>
<p>Aiming, applauding, arresting, ascending, asking.</p>	</div>

	<p>Last fall, when we could still gather in rooms together, I taught a class called 'Data Gardens'. One of the units was around performance as AI. We talked about 'Wizard of Oz prototyping' and human labour in machine-learning systems. We watched movies of actors pretending to be androids, replicants, and machines. We looked at histories of automata, including the miraculous 18th-century chess-playing Mechanical Turk, which in reality hid a petite human chess master among its clockwork.</p>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>When I first started watching the dataset I assumed that the team of researchers who had put it together at MIT had seen the bulk of it, but I’m now convinced that assumption was wrong. This is because so much of the archive is so, so hard to watch. </p>
<p>This is partly to do with time. The videos in Moments in Time have a severe, automated cut (3 seconds, sharp) that severs these moments, sometimes chopping them in the middle of the action which they are meant to describe. I eventually found that I had to mute the videos to keep watching at all- that the images could dissolve into colours and shapes but the jarring severance of the sound remained distinct and pointed no matter how much I watched.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>The difficulty of watching is also partly to do with consent. Moments in Time severs the relationship between recorded action and original maker. The researchers did not ask for permission to use these videos, and all ownership of- and control over- the image is pulled away from the person who held the camera, and from what that camera depicts.</p>
<p>In the archive, there are moments of extreme emotion and personal vulnerability- tears, screaming, and pain. Moments of questionable consent, including pornography. Racist and fascist imagery. Animal cruelty and torture. And worse; I saw horrible images. I saw dead bodies. I saw human lives end.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Even though I’m probably the first person to watch <em>all</em> of Moments in Time, every part of the dataset has had human eyes on it before. This is because after being gathered and cut, the videos of Moments in Time were automatically uploaded to Amazon Mechanical Turk for annotation. Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing service that connects 'requesters' to 'workers' who generally perform small, computer-like tasks for pennies. It is owned by Amazon and takes its name from the fake chess-playing machine. </p>
<p>The Moments in Time whitepaper describes the process of annotating the videos: “Each AMT worker is presented with a video-verb pair and asked to press a Yes or No key signifying if the action is happening in the scene. Positive responses from the first round are sent to subsequent rounds of annotation. Each HIT (a single worker assignment) contains 64 different 3-second videos that are related to a single verb”.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>I’m reminded of my own years spent as an AMT worker, which kept me employed at well under minimum wage during and after my undergraduate education. I think about all those thousands of tasks which involved the repetition of my labour. Hitting buttons with my hands, matching emotions with my face, recording words with my voice. How many datasets my body must be contained in. What those datasets are used for. How much violence my body does to others, through them.</p>

	<p>The example interface described by the Moments in Time whitepaper has an unsettling resemblance to my own handmade video-screening method, with the right and left arrow keys standing in for Yes and No. Both contain only two options- include, discard. No ability to report a video, reclassify it or clarify its inclusion, no middle ground.</p>

		<p>It comes to explain the brutality within. When you ask:</p>
<p>Does a dog fight match ‘barking’?</p>
<p>Does a sexual assault match ‘kissing’?</p>
<p>Does a police murder match ‘arresting’?</p>
<p>Sometimes the answer is Yes.</p>	</div>

	<div>
		<p>Around hour 250 of the dataset, sometime in late April, I started having The Dream. In The Dream, I am living on- or perhaps <em>am</em>- a research satellite, orbiting a planet and monitoring planetary broadcasts. For each brief moment I am floating over a place, I can see just a flash of what is happening under me. Just a fleeting, tiny vision of <em>something happening</em> then <em>something happening</em> then <em>something happening</em>. The dream goes on this way for years. </p>
<p>Even awake, I’ve come to see patterns in camera quality, in shadows, in the colour of paint and the types of trees, in movement, in texture that could unfold into ever more detail. I see patterns in everything, patterns that unify all of the videos which have nothing to do with their subjects and everything to do with the way the lens sweeps up to capture a running dog, or pivots to see the sunset or the way the light flares and the compression pushes against the edges of the frame.</p>	</div>

			<p><a href="#"><img alt="How can you measure UX?" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-22-05-44-38-e1595410883428.png"></a></p><!-- .entry-header --><p>The 16th of July 2020 was “Get to Know your Customers Day”. We as a tech company therefore decided to explore a key concept when it comes to keeping your customers happy as they interact with your brand – user experience (UX). The big question is – how do you know that you are on the right track in your UX efforts?</p>
<p>In this article, we explore how you can measure UX. Let’s dive right in.</p>
<h2>So, what is UX?</h2>
<p>While user experience can easily pass as the experience that a user has when using or interacting with a product, there is more to it.</p>
<p>A more wholesome <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/we-have-lost-track-of-what-ux-actually-means-8d55259dacb0">UX definition</a> would be:</p>
<blockquote><p><b><i>&nbsp;“The singular and accumulated experiences that users have as a result of interacting with an object or product within a context.”&nbsp;</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why is UX important for your brand?</h2>

<p>The above screenshot is from <a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark">Baymard Institute’s UX benchmark</a> of 60 top e-commerce sites ranked by user experience performance. This company has been studying UX, specifically, checkout UX for over a decade. Here are some mind-boggling stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;the checkout’s design and flow, is solely the main reason users abandon carts, most of the time</li>
<li>an average site needs to make at least 39 unique improvements to their checkout flow</li>
<li>the global average cart abandonment rate is 69.2%</li>
</ul>
<p>The above stats point to the reasons why every brand needs to prioritize its UX. Let’s briefly look at a few below:</p>
<h3>UX affects your revenue…big time</h3>
<p>We have just seen that 69.2% of customers will abandon their shopping carts at some point in the checkout flow. This is a lot of revenue for e-commerce sites.</p>
<h3>UX has a toll on brand perception</h3>
<p>One of the companies that has had to work so hard on it’s <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/brand/brand-perception/">brand perception</a> is Uber. In addition to making a public promise to <a href="https://youtu.be/4l5vGcuhtaQ">prioritize listening</a> to customers, cities, communities and employees, the brand went ahead to do a complete UX overhaul that was in line with one of the brand’s core values – to always do the right thing.</p>
<p>The company actually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17215298/uber-redesign-driver-app-promotions-gamify">re-designed their driver app with input from its drivers</a>, and better still, had their CEO test it out first. Talk about a redemption of the brand from the users’ perspective.</p>
<h3>UX helps to design seamless customer journeys</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/www/us/en/offer/digital-trends-2020/digital-trends-2020-full-report.pdf">Adobe Experience Index 2020 Digital Trends</a>, customer journey management is one of the top priorities for organizations and companies in 2020.</p>
<p>When you map out your customer’s journey, it gives you an idea of their experience with your brand or product, and their expectations. You are able to see what you are doing great, and where you are simply not meeting their expectations.</p>
<h2>How do you measure UX?</h2>
<p>There are two approaches to measuring UX: using the ROI or using KPIs.</p>
<h3>ROI vs KPIs</h3>
<p>The difference between these is that the former is a purely financial perspective. An example would be: you invest $10,000 in UX and get a $200,000 increase in revenue.</p>
<p>On the other hand, KPIs are more specific to the goals (not necessarily financial) that you set for your users. An example would be that you want the users to successfully complete their profiles. While this may not be directly related to ROI, it does affect it as complete profiles will help you with user insights that you can further analyze to make your UX better.</p>
<p>Our focus here will be on the KPIs.</p>
<h3>UX KPIs</h3>
<h4>Task success rate (TSR)</h4>
<p>If you need the user to complete some tasks on your app or site, then you need to make it easy for them to do so.</p>
<p>TSR is a percentage of the number of users who successfully complete a task. If 20 users were set to complete a task like completing a profile, but only 15 successfully complete it, then, your TSR will be:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>(15/20)* 100% = 75%</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Of importance is the fact that you can progressively measure TSR. You can begin to measure it when a customer is new to your product and progressively measure it as they become more familiar with it.</p>
<h4>Time on task</h4>
<p>Closely related to TSR is time on task. This is the time that users spend on a particular task. In our profile completion example, the shorter the amount of time it takes a user to complete their profile, the better the UX.</p>
<p>If out of 20 customers, 15 take 5 minutes to complete their profiles, then you are definitely doing something wrong.</p>
<h4>User error rate</h4>
<p>This is a measure of the number of times a user gets something wrong. If you require users to enter their credit card information, for example, and they keep entering their account number instead of the card number, then that is bad UX.</p>
<h5>Measuring user error rate</h5>
<p>There are two ways to measure user error rate:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Calculating the error rate</b></li>
</ul>

<p>To calculate error rate, we sum up the total number of errors made by all the users, then divide them by the number of users to give us the average number of errors each user made. We then divide the result by the number of possible errors (5 in this case)</p>
<p>If we had 10 users make 15 errors, our error rate would be:</p>
<blockquote><p>((15/10)/5)*100% = 30%</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><b>Calculating the error occurrence rate</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Here, we divide the total number of errors for all users by the total number of possible errors for all users (number of possible errors per user = 5)</p>
<p>If we had 10 users out of 20, make 15 errors, our error occurrence rate would be:</p>
<blockquote><p>15/(5*20)*100% = 15%</p></blockquote>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>You now need not worry about how to measure your UX. You can set very clear goals that can&nbsp; tie into your bigger financial or business goals. Remember, at the core of UX is getting to know your customer.</p>

July 22, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL Query Generator is an interesting library brought to you by the IBM team, which’s the main idea is to allow users to <strong>generate randomized GraphQL queries</strong> from any given GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>The first thought that comes to your mind might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why I may ever want a bunch of randomized queries?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>but giving it a second thought it might be quite useful. The team behind the GraphQL Query Generator suggested <strong>two basic use-cases</strong> for their library:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> - when operating a GraphQL service you might find this library useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a collection of test modules of GraphQL queries,</li>
<li>developing a test group of queries to check the effect of performance improvements,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scientific</strong> - to learn about the characteristics of various GraphQL services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Queries generation</h2>
<p>The library provides two functions for generating random GraphQL queries, both expecting a GraphQL schema, as well as specific  instructions provided in configuration object as an input:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getRandomQuery(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> - this function produces a random query from the given schema, considering configuration passed as an input,</li>
<li><code>getRandomMutation(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> -  that produces a random mutation from the given schema, considering passed configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Source: <a href="https://github.com/IBM/graphql-query-generator">github.com/IBM</a></h5>
<p>The configuration object accepts a set of predefined properties i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>maxDepth</code> - that defines the maximum depths of the query/mutation to generate,</li>
<li><code>argumentsToIgnore</code> - in which you can  list arguments names that should be ignored,</li>
<li><code>considerInterfaces</code>- which a signal for the generator that it should create queries containing interfaces,</li>
<li><code>considerUnions</code> - that creates queries that contain unions etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of available properties is available in the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/graphql-query-generator">GraphQL Query Generator docs</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>React Hooks have changed the way we write components. Hooks have mentally pushed us to write more Functional than Classical Components.</p><p>Though once you start making your app with Hooks, suddenly you have 10s of different hooks and even though they are managing a related state, it becomes hard to manage them.</p><p>They start feeling like clutter in the good-old Functional Components.</p><p>Looks unrelated? Have a look at this Component:</p><pre><code>import React from 'react';

const DataTable = ({ movies = []}) =&gt; (
  &lt;div&gt;
    {movies.map(({Poster, Title, imdbID, Year}) =&gt; (
      &lt;div key={imdbID}&gt;
        &lt;img src={Poster} height="100" alt={Title} /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;a href={`/?t=${imdbID}`}&gt;{Title}&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;{Year}
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    ))}
  &lt;/div&gt;
)

export default DataTable
</code></pre><p>Now if we were to add the Data Loading requests and building the profile links, there are two ways to do it:</p><ol><li>Add all the requests and function in the same component</li><li>Create a wrapper component to</li></ol><ul><li>Make a request and build links</li><li>Pass all the required Data and Functions as Props</li></ul><p>Let’s try to see both ways and how our computer develops in size and functionalities.</p><p>Loading Data, building event handlers and Markup in the same component:</p><pre><code>import React, { useEffect, useState, useContext } from 'react';
import KEY from './KeyContext';

const url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?s='

const DataTable = ({ query = 'Harry Potter' }) =&gt; {
  const key = useContext(KEY);
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([])
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    fetch(`${url}${query}&amp;apikey=${key}`)
      .then(r =&gt; r.json()).then(res =&gt; setMovies(res.Search.sort((a,b) =&gt; (a.Year-b.Year))))
  }, [key, query])

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {movies.map(({Poster, Title, imdbID, Year}) =&gt; (
        &lt;div key={imdbID}&gt;
          &lt;img src={Poster} height="100" alt={Title} /&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;a href={`/?t=${imdbID}`}&gt;{Title}&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;{Year}
          &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}

export default DataTable
</code></pre><p>And if we make a Wrapper Component to wrap the data table and pass the data as props; it will look like the following:</p><pre><code>import React, { useEffect, useState, useContext } from 'react';
import KEY from './KeyContext';

const url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?s='

const DataTable = ({ movies = []}) =&gt; (
  &lt;div&gt;
    {movies.map(({Poster, Title, imdbID, Year}) =&gt; (
      &lt;div key={imdbID}&gt;
        &lt;img src={Poster} height="100" alt={Title} /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;a href={`/?t=${imdbID}`}&gt;{Title}&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;{Year}
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    ))}
  &lt;/div&gt;
)

const DataContainer = ({ query = 'Harry Potter' }) =&gt; {
  const key = useContext(KEY);
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([])
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    fetch(`${url}${query}&amp;apikey=${key}`)
      .then(r =&gt; r.json()).then(res =&gt; setMovies(res.Search.sort((a,b) =&gt; (a.Year-b.Year))))
  }, [key, query])

  return &lt;DataTable movies={movies} /&gt;
}

export default DataContainer
</code></pre><p>Now here comes the custom hooks.</p><p>As we saw firstly, we can take the loading of data and related functions in separate functions which will trigger the same thing through that function.</p><p>Additionally, we can have a context to initialize the defaults and some common data to share among apps</p><p>First of all, we want to separate the data loading. Let's make out new hook called <code>useMovies</code></p><pre><code>const useMovies = (query = null) =&gt; {
  return fetch(`${url}${query}&amp;apikey=${key}`)
    .then(r =&gt; r.json())
    .then(r =&gt; r.Search.sort((a,b) =&gt; (a.Year-b.Year)))
}
</code></pre><p>Now that our function is doing data loading, let's add some persistence to it with state hooks</p><pre><code>import {useState} from 'react';

const useMovies = (query = null) =&gt; {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([])
  fetch(`${url}${query}&amp;apikey=${key}`)
    .then(r =&gt; r.json())
    .then(r =&gt; r.Search.sort((a,b) =&gt; (a.Year-b.Year)))
    .then(setMovies)
  return movies;
}
</code></pre><p>But we want to load the movies on the first call, not every call; and then get the new data when there is a change in the query.</p><p>Along with that, let’s separate the fetching/AJAX code in a separate file.</p><p>With above mentioned separation of concerns in the code; we have the following <code>useMovies</code> hook and <code>request</code> module respectively:</p><pre><code>// useMovies.js
import { useState, useEffect, useContext } from 'react';
import KeyContext from './KeyContext';
import request from './request';
import queryString from 'query-string';

const url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/'

const sortMovies = (movies = []) =&gt; movies.sort((a, b) =&gt; (a.Year - b.Year))

const getUrl = (params) =&gt; [url, queryString.stringify(params)].join('?')

const useMovies = (query = null) =&gt; {
  const [q, setQuery] = useState(query)
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);
  const apikey = useContext(KeyContext);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    q &amp;&amp; request(getUrl({ apikey, s: q }))
    .then(r =&gt; r.Search)
    .then(sortMovies)
    .then(setMovies)
  }, [q, apikey])

  return [movies, setQuery];
}

export default useMovies;
</code></pre><pre><code>// request.js
export default (url, params) =&gt; fetch(url, params)
  .then(response =&gt; {
    if (response.status === 200) {
      try {
        return response.json()
      } catch (e) {
        return response.text()
      }
    }
    return response
  })
</code></pre><p>In the above function of our custom hook we did the following:</p><ul><li>Receive the First Query &amp; initialize a state to receive changes in Query</li><li>Movies data with useState Hook</li><li>API key from the Context and useContext Hook</li><li>Use useEffect to</li></ul><ol><li>Trigger the first request for First Query</li><li>Request changes to API on change of Query</li><li>As API Key is coming from Context, it is prone to change and hence keep it in the Dependency of <code>useEffect</code> hook</li><li>Return the Data (i.e. <code>movies</code>) and Function to change Query (i.e. <code>setQuery</code>)</li></ol><hr><p>Though while creating or using hooks, there are two rules that you need to keep in mind</p><ol><li>Only Call Hooks at the Top Level</li><li>Only Call Hooks from React Functions</li></ol><p>The name of the rules state enough, though you can read more about them here: <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html">Rules of Hooks – React</a></p><hr><p>Moreover, if you just wanna use Hooks in most of the cases, you can check out the following repository; it is a collection of Custom Hooks for almost everything:</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/streamich/react-use"><div><p>streamich/react-use</p><p>React Hooks — 👍.

<![CDATA[Why IHP Is Using the Nix Package Manager]]>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy Onboarding</strong>

                    <p>
                        Making haskell web apps is a complicated process. You need the right haskell compiler, a build tool, lots of libraries to do useful things and a database software. To make IHP as accessible as possible, we want to initially hide all this from the user. We set out to make IHP usable for people who have not yet heard about ghc and cabal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally when you are using an older compiler version, some library is missing or your postgres is not the right version this will cause trouble. Solving these package management issues is always a huge time sink.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Npm is mainly used for packaging javascript code. Composer is used for packaging php code. And homebrew is used for installing npm and composer ;) Nix is different: It is able to package system software and all kinds of software ecosystems. This is what allows us to bundle all the dependencies of IHP using just a single package manager. Exactly what we need to make a truly batteries-included framework.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Integrated Dev Tooling</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is unique in that it allows us to exactly specify the version of a package we want to install. We can say: <i>Install the latest <q>postgres 12.3</q></i>. Nix also allows us to install packages locally for a specific project instead of managing all the dependencies system wide.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        These two properties make nix a great fit to achive our goal of simplifying the package management process. Nix allows us to easily install all this software for developers working with IHP. We can install exactly the right compiler, the right postgres version as well as all the right libraries we need. We can be sure that all packages are installed in the right version (no time sinks!) and nothing is missing. We also don't have any interference with existing packages already installed on the system. It's like docker without the overhead of a VM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The IHP dev server automatically starts and manages a postgres server in the background, just for your project. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23612217" target="_blank">IHP is the first framework tighly integrating the database in the dev mode.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/zaiste/status/1277678880782979072" target="_blank">We're sure that this will be standard in a couple of years.</a> Without the possibilities of nix, we would have never tried to integrate postgres into the IHP dev server. The integrated database schema designer wouldn't really work that well. It might not be obvious, but without nix we would not have tools like the IHP schema designer or the database viewer.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Pinned Versions</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix makes IHP projects reproducable in a way unseen in other software ecosystems.
                        <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/Config/nix/nixpkgs-config.nix#L21" target="_blank">All IHP projects share exactly the same set of packages.</a> The same compiler version, the same libraries, the same postgres version and even the same custom dependencies your app depends on. <q>Works on my machine</q> will not happen anymore. When there is a problem, other IHP users will most likely already have faced the same issue. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Trade Offs</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is far from perfect. Early on we had a lot of problems with slow rebuild times, which we could resolve by using the great <a href="https://cachix.org/" target="_blank">cachix</a> binary cache. Additionally Nix is very hard to install. This is a stumbling block for a lot of people. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/issues/93" target="_blank">Especially when using certain macOS systems you cannot even install nix at all.</a> Luckily most of the nix problems, like the macOS issues will be solved with time. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once nix is set up, it's usually working very well. Over time the benefits of nix really outweight the time spent on solving nix-specific problems. The rising industry adoption of Nix is a good indicator for this. <a href="https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/what-is-nix" target="_blank">Cool companies like Shopify are progressively adopting Nix.</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At digitally induced we believe that highest quality software is built on solid foundations.
                        Nix is technological superior to any other existing package manager. Therefore we belive it's right to make nix a hard requirement of IHP. 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>We’ve always believed that our user experience doesn’t just begin when people use elementary OS; it begins from the first moment that someone interacts with our organization in any way. And for a lot of people, that experience starts with our website. You may already know about <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/privacy-and-elementary-os">our stance on privacy</a>, advertising, and tracking from our previous blog posts, and that a core part of our business model is that <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/you-are-not-the-product">you are our customer, not a product</a>.</p>



<p>You might also know that our website has a comprehensive <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://elementary.io/privacy">privacy page</a> that details not only exactly how we use things like cookies on our website, but how to disable them. And with such a strong stance on privacy, you might be asking yourself why elementary uses analytics at all, let alone Google Analytics. To that I am happy to respond that we are leaving Google Analytics behind in favor of the Open Source and privacy-respecting <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-analytics">What Are Analytics?</h2>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the concept, you may be surprised to know that the majority of the websites you regularly visit are collecting statistical data about your usage of the website. Website developers then use this data to optimize infrastructure, pinpoint problems, or even drive design decisions—something we don’t particularly advise.</p>



<p>At elementary, we use anonymous data about things like physical region and download method to make sure we have properly localized HTTPS and Torrent downloads so that you can get a fast and stable connection. We also check which pages are most—and least—visited on our website so we know where to focus improvements. And we pay attention to which operating system downloaders are coming from to make sure that we’re on track with our mission of bringing an Open Source operating system to more people.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-google-analytics">Why Not Google Analytics?</h3>

<p>Google Analytics lets us keep tabs on that data, but Google tracks <em>a whole lot more</em> than that, too. Frankly we don’t want access to that data—or to contribute towards it being collected. Remember, Google’s incentive is to collect as much information as possible from people visiting as many sites as possible—and using Google Analytics directly helps them do that.</p>



<p>If you don’t know, Google happily tracks you across all the websites you visit if those sites use Google Analytics, or if you use Google search. Google then infers and remembers all sorts of information about you; for example: your age range, an inferred gender, if you’ve changed jobs or moved recently, and whether you like to spend time outdoors. Google then uses all of this data to target ads to you, in the hopes that more precise ads will get you to bite, thus earning them their commission.</p>

<p>They then offer those profiles up inside of Google Analytics, letting website owners drill down using “In-Market Segments.” The entire mechanism is invasive—and unnecessary for us. And even though we may choose to ignore these profiles and data, by using Google Analytics on our website, we’ve contributed to creating them. This data collection and surveillance does not align with our values, and we’ve been investigating how we can move away for quite some time now.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>Google Analytics is by far the most popular analytics solution available and there are few privacy-respecting alternatives. We considered a few self-hosted products like <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, but we couldn’t find a good fit in terms of maintenance, pricing, and features. We also investigated using self-described privacy-focused <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>, but were disappointed to learn that they had gone closed-source since we’d last looked at them. The situation changed once we stumbled upon Plausible.</p>

<p>Plausible is a small UK-based company that provides a hosted, privacy-conscious analytics solution with simple and fair pricing—plus support for custom events. The product itself fits what we’re looking for in an analytics solution, and it’s encouraging to see that they are actively growing and developing new features. But what really got our attention is their messaging around their business model. Read <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-funding">their blog post on monetizing</a> and see if it sounds familiar.</p>

  <div><p>A day in the life of a startup...</p><p>
    "Wanted to quickly reach out and see if you'd be interested in raising
    funds or taking investment"</p><p>
    No.</p><p>
    "Any interest in talking about an exit?"</p><p>
    No.</p></div>

  
</div>

<p>Unlike Google, Plausible isn’t in the advertising game and doesn’t have an incentive to collect and sell user data. And they’ve made it clear that they’re not interested in being scooped up by VCs or new ownership that might seek to change those values. They make money the same way elementary does: by directly charging customers for their product. We know firsthand how important it is to make sure that your business is built around your ethics, and we get the same feeling from the folks at Plausible. We’re excited to be supporting a company that shares our values and respects the people visiting our website.</p>

<h2 id="improving-transparency">Improving Transparency</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting and unique features of Plausible is their open invitation and celebration of data transparency. First, their entire product is open source; when it comes to privacy, the source code being open and auditable by anyone—experts and end users alike—is paramount. But they go above and beyond that: every user of Plausible is able and encouraged to make their analytics dashboard public so everyone can see the data for themselves and know that nothing fishy is going on.</p>



<p>We’ve embraced this new feature at elementary and opened up the dashboards for our various subdomains as well as our main website. Check them out yourself!</p>

</ul>

<p>We hope that this move will provide a tangible improvement to your digital life and give you even more peace of mind when using elementary products. We’re always working towards the ideal and we’re confident we’ve made a big step by switching to Plausible. Let us know on social media what you think of the new public analytics dashboard, and feel free to ask questions about how we’re using this data!</p>

<p><span>I</span>n April 2020, in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown, Ahmed Imran Kabir decided to buy a parrot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After most of the management classes Kabir taught at a university in Dhaka were canceled or moved online, he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project: becoming a part-time bird breeder. Sitting in his three-bedroom apartment one day, Kabir keyed in the phrase “Buy-sell birds Dhaka” on Facebook and joined about half a dozen groups dedicated to avian retail.</p>



<p>“Breeding pair. Age: 20 days. Contact by phone or inbox” read one post, alongside images of a pair of grayish-brown cockatiels. Another seller, located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in Dhaka, posted pictures of yellow-feathered lutino cockatiels, with the Bengali phrase <em>hat bodol hobe — </em>which loosely translates as “to change hands.” The wording was intended to circumvent a Facebook algorithm that, to prevent wildlife trafficking, automatically takes down posts with “buy” or “sell” in the description. If an interested buyer did contact an owner, the next step was to haggle over the price of the bird on Facebook Messenger.</p>



<p>Kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000-person Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/485404175472217/">A.S.ককাটেল পাখি হাত বদল</a> — “A.S. Cockatiel changes hands.” For that purchase, the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them, and Kabir paid in cash. He was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next two weeks, including breeds such as Gouldian finches, Bengalese finches, and crested Bengalese finches. Each pair cost anywhere between $15 and $60, depending upon the breed and its age. “At one point, I started running out of space to accommodate all the birds, and sent about half a dozen Bengalese finches, along with some Gouldians, to my fiancee’s place,” he recalled. Finally, he gave in and bought a large birdcage.</p>



<p>From discovery to delivery, this whole process happened on Facebook.</p>



<p>Kabir’s story is reflective of how the majority of e-commerce now happens in Bangladesh. In the absence of giant online marketplaces like Amazon, thousands of bespoke Facebook pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments, apparel, cosmetics, mobile accessories, and, of course, birds.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/randi-rahbar-shopyobrand-iraq/"><em>“What do I do with a credit card in a country like Iraq?”</em></a></strong></p>



<p>The phenomenon has grown so much over the years that the number of stores on Facebook now eclipse the number of sellers on local e-commerce websites like Evaly, Ajkerdeal, or the Alibaba-acquired <a href="https://www.daraz.com.bd/">Daraz</a>. No one knows exactly how many of these businesses exist, but the most recent estimates suggest that Bangladesh <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">has over 300,000</a>. The low barriers to entry —&nbsp;all an aspiring entrepreneur needs is an internet connection and around $350<strong> </strong>to cover startup costs —&nbsp;present a tremendous opportunity for a generation of young Bangladeshis reeling from mass layoffs and fear of <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/06/28/rise-of-the-educated-unemployed">rising unemployment</a> rates, which are projected to impact at least 15% of the working population. It also has opened other doors: in a country where just over 15 percent of women have mobile internet access, <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">half</a> of Facebook sellers are female.</p>



<p>By and large, these Facebook stores are usually window fronts for click-and-order shopping. Unlike in formal marketplaces, most sellers are not licensed, store their inventory at home, and partner with third-party logistics companies for last-mile delivery. It’s all very simple: after a buyer makes a selection, payments are arranged via off- or online methods, and items are delivered by mail. No equivalent exists in the West, where Facebook’s forays into commerce have been met with a muted response. For a 162-million-strong country struggling with poverty and limited job growth, this new model of business is illustrative of the South Asian concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"><em>jugaad</em></a> — making do with what’s available. And it already has a name: F-commerce.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nuzhat Akhter has</strong> been selling on Facebook for only six years, but she’s already considered a veteran in the F-commerce sphere. Her site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277430245935147/"><em>Posh World</em></a>, has over 8,000 followers on Facebook, thanks to her carefully cultivated selection of consumer<strong> </strong>goods. From her home in Bangladesh, Akhter sources all kinds of products — helmets, handbags, Ralph Lauren shirts, even branded car parts — and accepts preorders daily. If an item isn’t featured on her site, customers can send links or screenshots of things they want from any co.uk website. Customer service is handled via Messenger and her Facebook page, and Akhter guarantees delivery within two weeks.</p>



<p>The 34-year-old mother set up her Facebook store three months after the birth of her son in 2014 and has built a loyal following over the years. Akhter spends her mornings scouring the<em> </em>British websites of popular brands like The Body Shop, Superdrug, Clarks, and so on, hunting for flash sales or discounts. Once she finds a good deal, she shares the link on her Facebook group with screenshots: “3 hr left flash sale bodyshop 50%.” In June, orders totaled over $800. Akhter’s success is especially notable, as it’s uncommon to see a Bangladeshi woman running her own business. In many traditional South Asian households, women are discouraged from working after marriage.</p>



<p>The reason thousands of Bangladeshis depend on Akhter to do their shopping is that she has access to something very few of them do: a credit card, and an international one at that. “It’s my secret weapon,” Akhter said. To prevent money laundering, Bangladesh has issued roughly <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/banking/credit-card-market-still-untapped-1452808">1.5 million</a> credit cards, and even those cards have a $300 transaction limit for international online purchases. This has created a boom in cross-border F-commerce and turned retail arbitrage into a thriving sector.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce has also inadvertently ushered in more-direct models of customer engagement, moving away from impersonal help pages and suggestion boxes.<strong> </strong>Qazi<strong> </strong>Fahimda Hasan, the 26-year-old founder of an F-commerce business that focuses on beauty and lifestyle products, has made this part of her brand’s identity. Through Facebook Messenger, she shares tips for identifying counterfeit products, such as checking for irregularities in packaging, spotting spelling errors, verifying barcodes, and so on. She also invested in a mini-photography studio to take professional photos and videos of her inventory. The pictures on her Facebook wall act as a real-time bulletin board for her click-and-order store. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, the hottest new trend for online sellers is livestreaming. In China, consumers on Pinduoduo are using it to break into the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3022929/chinas-social-e-commerce-sector-more-double-us185-billion-sales">$200 billion</a> market for impulse and everyday purchases. In the United States, Amazon has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-live-launches-with-live-streamed-shopping-videos/">Amazon Live</a> Creator, which lets merchants set up streams to showcase their products. (So far, it seems to have had little success.) In Bangladesh, sellers go on Facebook Live to promote items, respond to questions, and take instant orders. Some products attract larger crowds than others. </p>



<p>“People simply go crazy for whitening creams,” said Akhter. “I mean, you could have 1,000 or 2,000 people watching a live demo on Facebook.” With little formal regulation, this is all based on trust. Many sellers aren’t concerned with looking glamorous or dressing up for the camera, and at first glance, their streams often come across as an ersatz version of the Home Shopping Network in the U.S.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, a seller who goes by only Sulaiman would spend his evenings holding Facebook livestreams in front of multicolor <em>sarees</em> in his clothing shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/2684482508481909/">Symbol Fashion House</a>, in Dhaka. Then, he was forced to change venues. In a twenty-minute stream from his living room, Sulaiman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/">shows</a> off a variety of clothes on offer, explaining the decorative stones on a <em>salwar </em>and the embroidery on a fabric. “Each of our <em>chunni</em> prints cost 550 taka [6$]. Take a screenshot and inbox the picture if interested,” Sulaiman exhorts viewers. Throughout the livestream, buyers flood the chat, asking to see more colors and sizes. “We started doing Facebook Live only about six months ago,” Sulaiman told <em>Rest of World. </em>Since then, he has averaged about $4,500 a month in online orders.</p>



<p>F-commerce emerged in Bangladesh largely because there was no major e-commerce platform to absorb all the business. But although it’s biggest there, this form of selling isn’t exclusive to the country, or even the region: globally, 160 million small stores operate on Facebook, and in countries like Thailand, almost <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thais-embrace-shopping-via-social-media">half of all online sales</a> happen through social media. Recently, platforms have started to accommodate them. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">features</a> allowing sellers to customize their online shops and made it easier for them to catalogue their goods and process payments.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce is, of course, inextricable from Facebook. As whole sections of Bangladeshi society get online for the first time, many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook. According to one estimate, the social media giant had nearly <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-bangladesh/2020/05">39 million</a> active users in Bangladesh in May<sub> </sub>—&nbsp;23.8% of the population. This widespread use has meant that F-commerce has expanded beyond cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet and pulled new kinds of consumers into online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If Amazon were to enter, they could wipe out the market.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also changed other dynamics. While Bangladeshi F-commerce shops relied on snail mail until just a few years ago, many sellers have hired logistics firms to carry out their quality checks, packaging, and delivery services, as they’ve expanded their businesses. Apart from transporting goods, logistics firms such as <a href="http://ecourierz.com/">eCourierz</a>, <a href="http://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>, …</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p> “Build web apps the <code>light</code> way”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many options for delivering web content and applications today. One area of rapid innovation surrounds the <code>lit-html</code> templating library, originally created by Justin Fagnani and the Polymer team at Google, and its use in making what can be described as "lit apps".</p>
<p>At Klaudhaus, we are using this approach to develop <a target="_blank" href="https://klaudhaus.com/visiql">VisiQL</a>, a visual modelling and management tool for GraphQL services, as well as to build and publish other apps and static websites, and indeed to create this page. We maintain the <code>lit-up</code> and <code>lit-app</code> packages which, along with all other libraries mentioned below, are open source and free to use for any purpose. We also provide commercial support, solution development, mentoring and training - <a target="_blank" href="https://klaudhaus.com/services">contact us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-advantages">The advantages</h2>
<p>There are several well-established approaches for web app development, including front-end libraries like React, Angular and Vue, so why look at using a newer, lesser-known technology? Whilst the conventional choices are great in terms of ecosystem, developer familiarity and available samples, there are a few reasons why lit apps might be attractive to early adopters who are comfortable with disrupting conventional wisdom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Small size</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, <code>lit-html</code> and <code>lit-up</code> come in at 4kB minified, before zipping. That compares with much larger sizes for conventional libraries, especially when they are combined with state management packages like Redux, Mobx or Vuex.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity</li>
</ul>
<p>The smaller library size doesn't just mean quicker downloads - there is less API surface to take into consideration, meaning developers can focus on business needs and user experiences rather than fiddling with the framework.</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamlined tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with conventional frameworks  generally has many dependencies, including a transpiling toolchain that adds overhead to development and debugging. Lit apps use built-in language templating and standard ES6 module loading so there's no need for Webpack, Babel or anything else that gets between the code you write and the code you run.</p>
<ul>
<li>Isomorphism</li>
</ul>
<p>Simplicity doesn't mean you have to give up impressive buzzwords! Views created for lit apps can run dynamically in the browser, as part of a server side process or cloud function, or within a static site builder - design once, run anywhere. </p>

<h3 id="browser-rendering">Browser rendering</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html"><code>lit-html</code></a> is a lightweight, highly efficient template processing and rendering library based on the built-in capabilities of web browsers. It leverages the <em>tagged template literal</em> feature of JavaScript together with the DOM's <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag to deliver powerful templating with minimal library size, straightforward syntax and lightning-quick performance. The <code>lit-html</code> library is maintained by the Polymer team at Google, and forms the basis of working with Web Components libraries such as <code>lit-element</code>. But it can also be used independently of custom elements to create interactive front-end applications, statically rendered web pages and more, using the tools described in this article. In this way it provides an alternative to using heavier frameworks such as Angular, React or Vue, and can be used more widely across front-end and server-side development.</p>
<p><code>lit-html</code> templates are surrounded in backtick characters like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> contactView = <span><span>contact</span> =&gt;</span> html`<span>
      <span>&lt;<span>h2</span>&gt;</span></span><span>${contact.firstName}</span><span> </span><span>${contact.lastName}</span><span><span>&lt;/<span>h2</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"profile-pic"</span> <span>src</span>=</span></span><span>${contact.imageUrl}</span><span><span> /&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span></span><span>${contact.information}</span><span><span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>`</span></code></pre>
<p>There are many other libraries that use <code>lit-html</code> listed on the <a href="https://github.com/web-padawan/awesome-lit-html" target="_blank"><code>awesome-lit-html</code></a> page. Lots of them are specifically focussed on the world of Web Components - which work fine when building interactive lit apps as well as with other frameworks. We will focus here on the approach of using an all-<code>lit</code> toolset to produce web content, and look forward to exploring more of the <code>awesome</code> tools in future articles.</p>
<h3 id="state-management">State management</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/klaudhaus/lit-up"><code>lit-up</code></a> is a simple reactive state pattern for front-end <code>lit</code> apps, providing concise yet powerful handling of sync and async data flows, along with update chaining and pluggable logging. Events are forwarded to state updates as shown below:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> contactsListView = <span><span>contacts</span> =&gt;</span> contacts.map(<span><span>contact</span> =&gt;</span> html`<span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"tile </span></span></span><span>${classMap({selected: contact.selected}</span><span><span><span>)}"</span>
        @<span>click</span>=</span></span><span>${up(selectContact, { contacts, select: contact }</span><span><span>)}&gt;</span>

        </span><span>${contactView(contact)}</span><span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>`</span>)

<span>let</span> selectContact = <span>(<span>{ contacts, select }</span>) =&gt;</span> 
    contacts.forEach(<span><span>contact</span> =&gt;</span> contact.selected = contact === select)</code></pre>
<p>For more advanced scenarios see the GitHub project.</p>
<h3 id="nodejs-rendering">NodeJS rendering</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/popeindustries/lit-html-server"><code>@popeindustries/lit-html-server</code></a> is a static renderer for <code>lit</code> templates and data. It runs in NodeJS and unlike <code>lit-html</code> does not need browser-based DOM APIs to render templates. It can deliver strings, streams and buffers.</p>
<h3 id="isomorphic-apps">Isomorphic apps</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/klaudhaus/lit-app"><code>lit-app</code></a> enables isomorphic applications (apps that run in browser, server or static site builder) by abstracting the specific <code>lit</code> implementation used to render view fragments. It also provides centralised access to the <code>up</code> handler from <code>lit-up</code>, enables environment based code branching and streamlines the process for setting up apps with either dynamic or statically rendered content. You access all lit-related functions from your view code like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { html, classMap, up } <span>from</span> <span>"lit-app"</span></code></pre>
<p>Given the contacts view code shown above and some data like this:</p>
<pre><code>let model = {
<span>  contacts:</span> [
    {
<span>      firstName:</span> <span>"Howard"</span>, lastName: <span>"Wolowitz"</span>, 
<span>      imageUrl:</span> <span>"images/howard.jpg"</span>, description: <span>"Engineer"</span>
    },
    {
<span>      firstName:</span> <span>"Leonard"</span>, lastName: <span>"Hofstaedter"</span>, 
<span>      imageUrl:</span> <span>"images/leonard.jpg"</span>, description: <span>"Physicist"</span>
    },
    {
<span>      firstName:</span> <span>"Raj"</span>, lastName: <span>"Koothrappali"</span>, 
<span>      imageUrl:</span> <span>"images/raj.jpg"</span>, description: <span>"Astrophysicist"</span>
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>
<p>A fully functioning interactive web app is as simple as:  </p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { app } <span>from</span> <span>"lit-app/contexts/lit-html-client"</span>

let view = <span><span>({ model })</span> =&gt;</span> contactsListView( model.contacts )

app({ model, view })</code></pre>
<p>Or you can create a statically rendered page (in a server side process or site builder) like this:</p>
<pre><code>import { renderToString } from <span>"lit-app/contexts/lit-html-server"</span>

<span>let</span> html = render<span>ToString(<span>contactListView</span>( <span>model</span>.<span>contacts</span> )</span>)

</code></pre>

      <p>Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.</p>

<p>Today, we’re releasing 0.17 of Nu, the first Nu to include WebAssembly, custom keybindings, and much more.</p>



<p>Nu 0.17.0 is available as <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.17.0">pre-built binaries</a> or from <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nu">crates.io</a>. If you have Rust installed you can install it using <code>cargo install nu</code>.</p>

<p>If you want more goodies, you can install <code>cargo install nu --features=stable</code>.</p>

<p>As part of this release, we also publish a set of plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use <code>cargo install nu_plugin_&lt;plugin name&gt;</code>.</p>



<h2 id="webassembly-support-jonathandturner-and-upcoming-wasm-based-playground-jzaefferer-jonathandturner">WebAssembly support (jonathandturner) and upcoming wasm-based playground (jzaefferer, jonathandturner)</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.nushell.sh/blog/images/0_17_0_playground.png" alt="image of a wasm-based NuShell playground"></p>

<p><em>Nu, now in your browser</em></p>

<p>As part of on-going cleanup and portability work, with 0.17 it’s now possible to build Nu and target WebAssembly, allowing you to run Nu in the browser and call into it from JavaScript. This is the first (experimental!) step in building towards an interactive playground and possibly more. We’re hoping to talk more about this porting process in the coming days.</p>

<p>If you’d like to see what we’re building, <a href="https://www.nushell.sh/demo/">check it out</a>.</p>

<h2 id="custom-keybindings-jonathandturner">Custom keybindings (jonathandturner)</h2>

<p>Nushell now also supports custom keybindings. To configure your keybindings, you can add a keybindings.yml file beside your config file. You can find out the location for your system using:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; echo $nu.keybinding-path
/home/jonathan/.config/nu/keybindings.yml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can base your custom file off this <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/docs/sample_config/keybindings.yml">example keybindings file</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-commands">New commands</h2>

<h3 id="benchmark-pag4k"><code>benchmark</code> (pag4k)</h3>

<p>The new <code>benchmark</code> command will time a block and output the length of time it took to run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; benchmark { echo "hello" }
363us 528ns
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="str-reverse-josephtlyons"><code>str reverse</code> (JosephTLyons)</h3>

<p>The <code>str reverse</code> command will reverse the characters of a string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; echo "hello world" | str reverse
dlrow olleh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="str-length-jonathandturner"><code>str length</code> (jonathandturner)</h3>

<p>On a related note, you can now also get the length of a string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; echo "hello world" | str length
11
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="str-from-bailey-layzer"><code>str from</code> (bailey-layzer)</h3>

<p>In previous versions of Nu, it was difficult to format numbers for precision and digit grouping. Starting with 0.17, there’s now a new <code>str from</code> subcommand to help with this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; echo 1.456123 | str from --decimals 2
1.46

&gt; echo 1234567 | str from --group-digits
1,234,567
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="math-stddev-and-math-variance-amousa11"><code>math stddev</code> and <code>math variance</code> (amousa11)</h3>

<p>You can now calculate standard deviation and variance in your numeric datasets:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; echo [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] | math stddev
1.414213562373095048801688724209698078569671875376948073176679737990732478462107038850387534327641573

&gt; echo [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] | math variance
2
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="if-jonathandturner"><code>if</code> (jonathandturner)</h3>

<p>Ever want to run one block if a condition was true and another if the condition was false? Now you can!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; echo 0..5 | if $it &gt; 3 { echo big } { echo small }
───┬───────
 0 │ small
 1 │ small
 2 │ small
 3 │ small
 4 │ big
 5 │ big
───┴───────
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The keen observer might notice we’re stealthly sneaking in more commands you might use in future scripting.</p>

<h3 id="split-chars-jonathandturner"><code>split chars</code> (jonathandturner)</h3>

<p>To more easily work with the characters in a string, you can now split the characters into separate items:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; echo "hello" | split chars
───┬───
 0 │ h
 1 │ e
 2 │ l
 3 │ l
 4 │ o
───┴───
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="move-column-andrasio"><code>move column</code> (andrasio)</h3>

<p>Finally, you can now move columns in your table:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; ls
───┬──────────────────────────────────┬──────┬─────────┬────────────
 # │ name                             │ type │ size    │ modified
───┼──────────────────────────────────┼──────┼─────────┼────────────
 0 │ 0.bootstrap.js                   │ File │ 30.9 KB │ 1 hour ago

 3 │ index.html                       │ File │  1.4 KB │ 1 hour ago
───┴──────────────────────────────────┴──────┴─────────┴────────────

&gt; ls | move column size --before type
───┬──────────────────────────────────┬─────────┬──────┬────────────
 # │ name                             │ size    │ type │ modified

<h2 id="early-draft-of-a-new-website-pontaoski">Early draft of a new website (pontaoski)</h2>

<p>We’re working on a refresh of our website. If you’re interested in giving it a look, we’ve got an <a href="https://github.com/nushell/website_exploration">early draft started</a>. If you’d like to help us with the design, reach out over github or discord.</p>

<h2 id="command-improvements">Command improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>sort-by</code> can now sort with case-insensitivity (JosephTLyons)</li>
  <li><code>alias</code> of externals should now be improved (bailey-layzer)</li>
  <li><code>history</code> should be able to correctly store more than 100 rows now (fdncred)</li>
  <li><code>to html</code> will now output pretty hex when given a binary it doesn’t recognize (jonathandturner), and now has color themes (fdncred)</li>
  <li><code>uniq</code> can now also work with simple values (k-brk)</li>
  <li>Completions now have their own abstraction, so we can more easily improve them in the future (thegedge)</li>
  <li><code>table</code> now prints column numbers a bit more orderly way (Porges)</li>
  <li><code>str</code> made parsing more strict, to let the user know if there were parsing errors (andrasio)</li>
  <li><code>group-by</code> can now take a block that allows for deep keying for grouping (andrasio)</li>
  <li>autoenv (directory-specific environments) can now run commands on entry/exit (samhedin)</li>
  <li><code>str trim</code> can now take an optional character to trim (bailey-layzer)</li>
  <li>duration pretty-print is now easier to read (jonathandturner), durations are also now stored as nanoseconds internally (pag4k)</li>
  <li><code>str substring</code> supports more argument types now (andrasio)</li>
  <li>completions for filepaths should now work in more cases (almindor)</li>
  <li><code>rm</code> now gives nicer output (arashout)</li>
  <li><code>ls -f</code> will now do a better job of keeping the tables aligned (arashout)</li>
  <li>general parser improvements (philip-peterson, jonathandturner)</li>
  <li><code>each</code> can now number the outputs it creates, allowing for enumeration (jonathandturner)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes-tests-and-more-philip-peterson-josephtlyons-u5surf-thegedge-arashout-jonathandturner">Bug fixes, tests and more (philip-peterson, JosephTLyons, u5surf, thegedge, arashout, jonathandturner)</h2>

<p>Parsing now has more test coverage. Internal code cleanups. Command description copy paste issues fixed. Ensure that the MaybeTextCodec gets properly cleared. Fix documentation to renamed subcommands and <code>str to-int</code>. Internally more commands were moved to process their streams lazily. We can now generate documentation from reading the built-in docs on each command.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>

<h3 id="bson-and-sqlite-move-to-plugins-jonathandturner">BSON and Sqlite move to plugins (jonathandturner)</h3>

<p>As part of the portability work, we’ve moved the <code>from bson</code>, <code>to bson</code>, <code>from sqlite</code> and <code>to sqlite</code> out of internal commands and into plugins. The functionality should remain largely unchanged, with the only difference being that you’ll need to install these plugins for this functionality.</p>

<h3 id="command-renames">Command renames</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>calc</code> is now <code>math eval</code> to join the <code>math</code> subcommand family (coolshaurya)</li>
  <li><code>keep-until</code> and <code>keep-while</code> are now subcommands: <code>keep until</code> and <code>keep while</code> (k-brk)</li>
  <li><code>skip-while</code> and <code>skip-until</code> are also now subcommands: <code>skip while</code> and skip until (andrasio)</li>
  <li><code>config</code> is now split into subcommands based on the command flag, eg) <code>config set</code>, <code>config get</code>, etc. (ritobanrc, jonathandturner)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>

<p>Just when we think we’ll slow down a little, we’re surprised by the amount of community feedback and help. This release covered nearly 4(!) pages of pull requests. Not bad for three weeks for work!</p>

<p>There’s some parser work coming up to help continue removing roadblocks to using Nu as a scripting language, improving completions, and generally continuing to polish Nu.</p>

  <p>This isn’t a complete run down, but it’s what I picked up from a small dive into the issue.</p>

<p>To help protect the kid we’re going to name him Johnny in this blog post.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-breach-was">What the breach was</h2>
<p>As you’ve no doubt picked up, the breach originated from the paging system used by the Department of Health.</p>

<p>It contained personal information concerning a significant number of patients, especially relating to COVID test results. The pager was used for communication between departments, far out of bounds of its original purpose, which was simply to alert or convey brief messages around hospitals.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-think-happened">What I think happened</h2>

<p>The below may not be fully accurate, but I’m reasonably confident that it is close to what happened.</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h3>
<p>We have Johhny, a youth who likes to monitor emergency services, they’re very much into IT and amateur radio.</p>

<p>They have some radio gear, some spare time, and they’re looking to further their interest.</p>

<h3 id="the-breach">The breach</h3>
<p>In my opinon, the breach was heavily on the fault of the Department of Health, since they were using an unencrypted paging system that broadcasted the data via a very well known protocol.</p>

<p>Johhny has, through either poking around or just asking the right people, found that the Department of Health uses the aforementioned paging protocol, and he finds out that it’s quite easy to read.</p>

<p>He sets up a server at his home (or somewhere with a residential connection) to pick up these radio broadcasts (which are coming from an antiquitated Vodafone service), and he connects it to the freely available and open source <a href="https://github.com/pagermon/pagermon">PagerMon</a>.</p>

<h4 id="an-aside-about-paging">An aside about paging</h4>
<p>The way paging works is a crucial aspect of this breach, so I’ll include a little bit about it.</p>

<p>Starting as a system for effectively saying “hey call me”, paging evolved to carry full messages, acting almost the same as texting, but with one big difference, how it worked under the hood.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3v1pUjz.png" alt="Pager diagram"></p>

<p><em>Credit: <a href="https://www.explainthatstuff.com/howpagerswork.html">Explain That Stuff</a></em></p>

<p>Paging works by sending your intended message to everyone, and then each device filters out the messages not intended for it.</p>

<p>So from that explanation you can clearly see why this was not a hack, but more already publicly available information becoming more accessible.</p>

<p>Coming back to the situation at hand, Johhny now has a live feed of the pagers going off around the Department of Health, and to make it easier to share and view, <strong>he sets it up so that anyone can access it</strong>.</p>

<p>That last step, was the crucial one in this breach, but it did have the upside of revealing this horrific data leak, since it’s impossible to tell who else was accessing this information.</p>

<p>From my investigation, this website has been up and runnig for <strong>the past 6 months</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>

<p>9 News picks up a scoop that “malicious hackers” have infiltrated the Department of Health, and sets a PR wheel in motion, which will hopefully inspire some semblance of change.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, 9 News decided to include screenshots of the page, which quickly lead anyone with some spare time to the website (which is now down). The website has been partially cached by Google, so <strong>private information is still being leaked</strong>.</p>

<p>I just hope that the kid gets what he should, a slap on the wrists, and nothing more.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Computer users organize their files into folders because that is the primary tool offered by operating systems. But applying this standard hierarchical model to my own files, I began to notice shortcomings of this paradigm over the years. At the same time, I used some other information systems not based on hierarchical path names, and they turned out to solve a number of problems. I propose a new way of organizing files based on tagging, and describe the features and consequences of this method in detail.</p>
<p>Speaking personally, I’m fed up with <abbr title="hierarchical file systems">HFSes</abbr>, on Windows, Linux, and online storage alike. I struggled with file organization for just over a decade before finally writing this article to describe problems and solutions. Life would be easier if I could tolerate the limitations of hierarchical organization, or at least if the new proposal can fit on top of existing HFSes. But fundamentally, there is a mismatch between the narrowness of hierarchies and the rich structure of human knowledge, and the proposed system will not presuppose the features of HFSes. I wish to solicit public feedback on these ideas, and end up with a design plan that I can implement to solve the problems I already have today.</p>
<p>This article is more of a brainstorm than a prescriptive formula. I begin by illustrating how hierarchies fall short on real-life problems, and how existing alternative systems like Git and Danbooru bypass HFS problems to deliver a better user experience. Then I describe a step-by-step model, starting from basic primitives, of a proposed file organization system that includes a number of desirable features by design. Finally, I present some open questions on aspects of the proposal where I’m unsure of the right answer.</p>
<p>I welcome any feedback about anything written here, especially regarding errors, omissions, and alternatives. For example, I might have missed helpful features of traditional HFSes. I know I haven’t read about or tested every alternative file system out there. I know that my proposed file organization scheme might have issues with conceptual and computational complexity, be too general or not expressive enough, or fail to offer a useful feature. And certainly, I don’t know all the ramifications of the proposed system if it gets implemented, on aspects ranging from security to sharing to networks. But I try my best to present tangible ideas as a start toward designing a better system. And ultimately, I want to implement such a proposed file system so that I can store and find my data sanely.</p>
<p>In the arguments presented below, I care most about the data model and less about implementation details. For example in HFSes, I focus on the fact that the file system consists of a tree of labeled edges with file content at the leaves; I ignore details about inodes, journaling, defragmentation, permissions, etc. For example in my proposal, I care about what data each file should store and what each field means; I assert that querying over all files in the file system is possible but don’t go into detail about how to do it efficiently. Also, the term “file system” can mean many things – it could be just a model of what data is stored (e.g. directories and files), or an abstract API of possible commands (e.g. mkdir(), walk(), open(), etc.), or it could refer to a full-blown implementation like NTFS with all its idiosyncratic features and characteristics. When I critique hierarchical file systems, I am mostly commenting at the data model level – regardless of the implementation flavor (ext4, HFS+, etc.). When I propose a new way of organizing files, I am mainly designing the data model, and leaving the implementation details for later work.</p>

<p>The most important sections are denoted in <strong>bold</strong>. The other sections provide additional context for interested readers.</p>


<hr>

<h2 id="hierarchical-file-systems-are-useful">Hierarchical file systems are useful</h2>
<p>Hierarchies are popular because they serve a useful purpose. They do organize files to a certain extent, and are better than having nothing at all. (Older computer systems simply had a flat file system where every file is stored in the root directory of a drive.)</p>
<dl>
	<dt id="physical-storage-analogy">Physical storage analogy</dt>
	<dd>
		<p><abbr title="hierarchical file systems">HFSes</abbr> imitate how information is stored in the physical world. If you have a set of papers, you’d put them into a labeled folder, folders into a filing cabinet, cabinets into aisles, aisles into rooms, rooms into buildings, and so forth. Each piece of paper is stored in only one place, which can be described by a unique address. The content on a sheet of paper can be updated and the page can be stored back in the same place.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="ubiquitous-availability">Ubiquitous availability</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>HFSes are already available on every major computing platform – Unix (ext, XFS, ZFS, etc.), Windows (FAT, NTFS, ReFS), macOS (HFS+), Android, and web services (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.). As a user or a developer, if you need hierarchical file organization, you will almost certainly get it.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="reducing-repetition">Reducing repetition</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Instead of labeling each relevant file with a particular aspect, you group the files together and put them all in one folder named with the aspect. For example instead of writing “Bicycle” within each file name among a set of photos, you can put those files into a folder named “Bicycle” and not need to touch the individual file names.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="filtering-out-items">Filtering out items</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Browsing a hierarchy is powerful because it inherently filters out unwanted information and brings wanted information to the forefront. For example when you open a folder called “Tax Documents”, you will not see the party photos which are stored elsewhere.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="naturally-hierarchical-phenomena">Naturally hierarchical phenomena</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Some natural concepts have a nested structure and are already labeled in a hierarchical way. Geographic locations are hierarchical – a city belongs to a state which belongs to a country which belongs to a continent. For example if you want to organize a set of travel photos, you can make a folder for each country, a subfolder for each city, and so on. Each photo belongs to only one place, never two countries or two cities at once. Divisions of time are hierarchical. You can create a folder for each year, and put each document in one year folder. Or you can go finer and create a subfolder for each month, et cetera.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="simple-implementation">Simple implementation</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Hierarchical file systems are relatively easy for an operating system designer to implement, compared to fancy relational databases or such. At their core, HFSes involve rooted trees (or directed acyclic graphs), node pointers, edge labels (directory entry names), and file blobs. Writing user-level applications that operate in a hierarchical file system is quite manageable too. A simple program might just work on single files, or list a directory non-recursively. Even in the full case of walking over files and directories recursively, the data model is simple and easy to work with.</p>
		<p>Another benefit is that data retrieval can be fast in practice even when directories are stored on disk naively as unsorted lists (without applying advanced data structures like B-trees). This is because users are naturally inclined to keep the number of items in a directory at a manageable number – if a user sees a directory with a thousand items, she will likely create a few subfolders and put a few hundred items into each. This benefit of fast linear searching does not apply to flat file systems, where a root directory might have tens of thousands of files (thus B-trees must be used, but flat file systems are obsolete anyway).</p>

<h2 id="hierarchical-organization-is-clumsy">Hierarchical organization is clumsy</h2>
<p>With the benefits of hierarchical file systems out of the way, let’s discuss how they seriously fall short in helping us organize files – or more broadly speaking, how they represent and retrieve knowledge. A tricky aspect about the upcoming arguments is that <abbr title="hierarchical file systems">HFSes</abbr> appear to behave okay at the small scale (say 100 to 1000 files), but they become increasingly painful to use at the large scale (say 100&nbsp;000 files).</p>
<dl>
	<dt id="forced-unique-names">Forced unique names</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Every file within a folder must have a unique name. (Or phrased more formally: For each directory in the file system, each item in that directory has a name different from all other items in that directory.) This seems like a reasonable design on the surface – after all, you need some way to identify and access each file – but its implications are troubling.</p>

		</p>
		<p>Example: You browse the web and download a bunch of cat pictures one by one. You just want to name every file “Cat.jpg” because it’s the best description you can think of without spending extra mental effort. But saving them into the same folder, each file needs a unique name. So you might decide to append a number to them, like “Cat-0.jpg”, “Cat-1.jpg”, “Cat-2.jpg”, etc. – fine. Or you might start to describe each one in more detail, like “Cat-in-hat.jpg”, “Cat-sleeping.jpg”, “Cat-chase.jpg”. But eventually you will see a picture that deserves the same description, so you’ll still end up with numbered names like “Cat-in-hat-2.jpg”, etc. Either way, once you start numbering files, you need to check the highest existing number every time you save a file. This procedure increases mental burden without actually improving the information being stored – it merely works around the unique name requirement imposed by the system.</p>

		</p>
		<p>Example: You do a photoshoot and capture a series of images, say “Fred-01.jpg”, “Fred-02.jpg”, ..., “Fred-30.jpg”. You delete some outtakes, leaving holes in the sequential file numbering. If you publish this subset of photos as is, the consumer might wonder why there are gaps in the numbering, and get unintended insight into how many raws were shot. But it gets worse – your coworker Mary was shooting alongside you, and offers you her collection of photos of the same subject. In a stroke of bad luck (or great minds thinking alike?), she also named her photos “Fred-01.jpg”, “Fred-02.jpg”, ..., “Fred-19.jpg”. You want the benefit of being able to use her files, but now you are left with a …</p></dd></dl></article></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p>



<p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p>



<p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p>



<p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p>



<p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p>



<p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p>



<p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p>



<p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p>



<p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p>



<p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p>



<p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, we have</p>



<p>So $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2$ is actually the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector $\mathbb{V}\big(\langle x, w \rangle\big)$.</p>



<p>We further have another expression of $\text{MSE}(w)$.</p>



<p>Because $\mathbb{E}\big(\langle x, x \rangle\big)$ is not dependent on $w$, minimizing the mean of the residual sum of squares $\text{MSE}(w)$ turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector.</p>



<p>The variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector could also be expressed using the dataset matrix $X$.</p>



<p>where $\frac{X^{\top} X}{n}$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.</p>



<p>If we project the data vectors to $q$ orthogonal unit vectors $w_0$, $w_1$, $\cdots$, $w_{q-1}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. Then our optimization goal becomes maximizing the residual sum of squares on all these projection vectors.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<h4 id="maximizing-variance">Maximizing Variance</h4>

<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $p$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, and $W$ is a orthonormal matrix.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>Let’s try to maximize one $\mathscr{L}(w) = w^{\top} X^{\top} X w$ first, and the constrain is $w^{\top} w = 1$. We would use Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to help us solve the optimization problem.</p>





<p>We set $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\lambda} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{w} = 0$, we get</p>



<p>So by definition, $\lambda$ and $w$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix $X^{\top} X$.</p>



<p>Because $X^{\top} X$ is real symmetric matrix and positive semi-definite, all the eigenvalues of $X^{\top} X$ are non-negative.</p>



<p>$X^{\top} X$ has exact $p$ eigenvalues $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_{p-1}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$. The matrix $W$, which consists of the eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$, happens to be the global maximum solution for $\mathscr{L}(W)$. The global maximum value for $\mathscr{L}(W)$ is the sum of non-negative eigenvalues.</p>

<p>We call the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue the first principal axis, the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue the second principal axis, and so on.</p>



<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $q$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, and $q \leq p$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. The optimization problem becomes maximizing the following equation.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

<p>Medium’s most significant selling points are how easy it is to publish your thoughts and the social aspect of the platform.</p>



<p>However, with ease, comes restrictions.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll discuss how Medium has burned me in the past and why I don’t think it’s the right place for your stories on the web.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h2>My experience with Medium</h2>



<p>When Medium was new, I jumped into the bandwagon, and called it the home for my blog posts for quite some time.</p>



<p>I was happy with the experience. The editor was beautiful, and the presence of community made the platform a suitable place to publish my thoughts, and reach people quickly.</p>



<p>After writing solo for some time, I got accepted to write for a couple of Medium publications like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/swlh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Startup</a>, freeCodeCamp, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker Noon</a>, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://byrslf.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Be Yourself</a>.</p>



<p>I thought my blog hosting days were behind me. Medium was going to be my one-stop blogging destination.</p>



<p>But then, came the hammer:</p>



<p>Medium’s content moderation algorithm blocked my profile by mistake without a notice.</p>



<p>I didn’t even realise that my Medium profile wasn’t visible to anyone but me. I assumed since I haven’t written for some time, my views started dropping naturally.</p>



<p>It was until I tried sharing my profile link with a friend did I notice that my profile page returned a 404 error like this:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="340" data-permalink="https://hulry.com/medium-vs-own-blog/medium-404-page/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?fit=1710%2C946&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1710,946" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="medium-404-page" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?fit=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?fit=580%2C321&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=580%2C321&amp;ssl=1" alt="Medium's 404 error page." srcset="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=1024%2C566&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=1536%2C850&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=1200%2C664&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?w=1710&amp;ssl=1 1710w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=1024%2C566&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=1536%2C850&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=1200%2C664&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?w=1710&amp;ssl=1 1710w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/medium-404-page.png?resize=580%2C321&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>I was getting Medium’s 404 page while trying to open my profile page.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>After contacting Medium Support on Twitter, they unblocked my profile with a reply that my account was flagged mistakenly.</p>



<p>Check this reply from Medium Support:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Rahul! One of your posts was mistakenly flagged by our automatic spam filter. Our sincerest apologies! We've unsuspended your account immediately, and we'll make improvements to the filter to avoid such false alarms in the future.</p>— Medium Support (@MediumSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumSupport/status/1019889238991671296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2018</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>What’s crazy?</p>



<p>Neither you nor I can stop this from happening again because Medium is a rented land for us.</p>



<p>On the web:</p>



<h2>It’s always better to own your platform</h2>



<p>This advice is accurate for any form of content, be it blog posts or a video.</p>



<p>Until you host your content on your platform, they will always live at the mercy of the company hosting the platform.</p>



<p>I was not the only case where Medium’s algorithm went haywire; it happened with other people as well:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is called shadowbanning. It's extremely unethical and, sadly, <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MediumSupport</a> is known to do this to many of their contributors. It would be wise for you to stop using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Medium?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Medium</a> – you're lucky they even responded to you this time. More info here:<a href="https://t.co/Carp3Tr9AR">https://t.co/Carp3Tr9AR</a></p>— Malcolm Rose 🥶 (@MalcolmRoseGM) <a href="https://twitter.com/MalcolmRoseGM/status/1020117535839215617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2018</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>And this is true for other content platforms like YouTube. There had been cases where YouTube videos with tons of views disappeared overnight.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>The web is meant for free speech. Your content shouldn’t be jailed for being controversial.</strong></p><a href="http://twitter.com/share?&amp;text=%3Cstrong%3EThe%20web%20is%20meant%20for%20free%20speech.%20Your%20content%20shouldn%27t%20be%20jailed%20for%20being%20controversial.%3C%2Fstrong%3E&amp;url=https://hulry.com/medium-vs-own-blog/&amp;via=thehulry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a></blockquote>



<p>Even though Medium reinstated my profile, I stopped publishing on the platform and moved to my blog again.</p>



<p>You might be thinking:</p>



<h2>What about the virality that comes from Medium’s community?</h2>



<p>It’s true. Medium has a good community. And, if your content catches fire, it will be viral.</p>



<p>However, that’s not always the case. I have had very few organic traffic from Medium.</p>



<p>Most of my articles had traffic from external sources. Here are some stats for you:</p>

<p>Even if you manage to score a good amount of traffic on your content on Medium, it’s wise to use this opportunity to build an initial traction for your blog.</p>



<p>A lot of companies like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Basecamp</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify</a> executed this idea with their company blogs.</p>



<p>They started with a Medium publication, and when they gained traction on their content, they moved to their own hosted blogs.</p>



<p>Coincidentally:</p>



<p>I was listening to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1370USFCRZJnv2BXc631pq" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast episode</a>&nbsp;a few days back where a YouTuber said that he is building his platform to prevent his content from being taken down by YouTube.</p>



<p>That said:</p>



<h2>Medium is still suitable for some cases</h2>



<p>There are situations when Medium is the best choice for writers. Some of them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blogging casually. </strong>When you’re just jotting your thoughts down and don’t care about your brand, Medium can be a right fit for those occasional brain dumps.</li><li><strong>Not being able to afford hosting fees.</strong> Hosting your blog costs money, whereas Medium is free.</li><li><strong>Quick money.</strong> Earning money from your blog takes time. On Medium, however, you can put your story behind a paywall and make money from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187-Join-the-Partner-Program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Medium’s Partner Program</a>.</li></ul>



<p>However, if you’re serious about blogging, you should always focus on your own blog.</p>



<p>Apart from the freedom to publish anything you want, you’ll also get unlimited branding and customisation options on your blog.</p>



<p>Medium allows only a handful of customisations for publications and little to nothing for the article content.</p>



<p>Even the everyday use cases like syntax highlighting requires jumping through multiple hoops to make it possible.</p>



<p>Also, Medium <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stopped allowing custom domains</a> for publications starting <strong>November, 2017</strong>. That means, your publication will have an URL structure like this:</p>



<p><mark>medium.com/yourpublication</mark></p>



<p>There’s, however, one approach where you can make Medium work for you with acceptable side-effects.</p>



<p>How?</p>



<h2>Mirror your blog on Medium</h2>



<p>This technique isn’t something I invented. I have seen a lot of established authors like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dariusforoux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Darius Foroux</a> do this regularly and I tried it on my own as well.</p>



<p>The concept is to publish first on your own blog and then later republish the same content on Medium.</p>



<p>You can either create a publication on Medium for reposting or publish under your profile.</p>



<p>And at the end of each article, add a byline which links to the original article on your site.</p>



<p>The benefit of this approach is that while your content is safely resting on your blog, you can leverage Medium and get more eyeballs for your writing.</p>



<p>However, there’s a catch, SEO-wise.</p>



<p>Since Medium has a high domain authority on Google Search, your articles on Medium might outrank the same articles published on your blog.</p>

      <h2 id="hive-and-presto">Hive and Presto</h2>
<p>Hive and Presto have developed a tortoise-and-hare story over the past 8 years.
Initially conceived at Facebook and open sourced in August 2008,
Hive was hailed as a breakthrough in the SQL-on-Hadoop technology
and generally regarded as the de facto standard.
Then in 2012,
Facebook started to develop Presto as a replacement of Hive,
which was considered too slow for their daily workload.
As Facebook was specific about its goal in developing Presto,
the future of Hive did not look so bright.</p>
<p>The activity in the Hive community, however, did not dwindle at all.
In February 2013,
the Hive community, spearheaded by Hortonworks, embarked on the Stinger Initiative with the aim of achieving 100x performance improvement.
The outcome of the Stinger Initiative was impressive.
The integration of a new execution engine Tez eliminated the most costly overhead in its original execution engine MapReduce,
and the introduction of LLAP (Low Latency Analytical Processing) brought the performance to the next level.
The in-memory cache implemented in LLAP was also a timely response to the separation of compute and storage.</p>
<p>Eventually Hive has come to outperform Presto by a large margin.
The following graph summarizes the result of evaluating Hive 3.1.2 and Presto 317 on the TPC-DS benchmark with a scale factor of 10 terabytes
(with details in our <a href="https://www.datamonad.com/2019-08-22-comparison-presto317-0.10/">previous article</a>).
In the experiment, we use Hive on MR3 which is comparable to Hive-LLAP in performance.
We observe that with respect to the geometric mean of running times,
<strong>Hive runs three times faster than Presto: 30.83 seconds for Hive vs 90.07 seconds for Presto.</strong>
This is no easy feat from a technical perspective, especially because Hive supports fault tolerance whereas Presto does not.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datamonad.com/img/mr3.0.10/presto.hive.time.new.wide-fs8.png" alt="presto.hive.time.new.wide"></p>
<h2 id="why-choose-presto-over-hive">Why choose Presto over Hive?</h2>
<p>Nevertheless Presto has its own strengths
and is <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend/system/Presto">rising rapidly in popularity</a> (as of July 2020).
Interestingly its speed is one of its selling points
as many industrial users are still under the mistaken impression that Presto is much faster than Hive.
For our purpose,
we focus on the following core strength of Presto among others – easy installation.</p>
<p>Presto is easy to install.
It suffices to copy the binary distribution of Presto in the installation directory on every node,
whether in a Hadoop cluster or not.
In order to run Presto,
the user configures the installation as either a coordinator or a worker and executes a common script on each node.
After starting a coordinator, the user can launch workers in any order,
which implies that it is also straightforward to add new workers later.
The ease and simplicity of the installation process is achievable because Presto has relatively few dependencies.</p>
<p>This strength of Presto, however, really shines in an environment where Docker containers are supported, most notably on Kubernetes.
A Docker image can be easily built from the binary distribution of Presto,
and after creating a Docker container for a coordinator, the user can create or delete as many Docker containers for workers as necessary.
In essence, running Presto with Docker containers is no different from running it directly with the binary distribution.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, installing Hive is a daunting task.
First of all, the user should find a Hadoop cluster compatible with Hive to be installed.
For example, in order to install Hive 3, the user should either upgrade an existing cluster to Hadoop 3 or create a new Hadoop 3 cluster.
Then the user should install a compatible version of Tez.
Finally the user should check other dependencies, such as ZooKeeper, in order to use advanced features of Hive such as LLAP.
The difficulty and complexity of the installation process is inevitable because Hive has relatively many dependencies, including Hadoop itself.</p>
<p>‘‘Easy installation’’ is a distinctive feature of Presto that is certainly helping to accelerate its adoption, especially in the cloud environment.
In comparison, Hive is struggling even in the Hadoop environment.
It is not uncommon to see potential users switching to Presto
just at the thought of having to upgrade the Hadoop cluster or after failing to configure LLAP properly.
Perhaps not by coincidence,
<strong>Hive is now <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend/system/Hive">gradually losing its popularity after its peak in December 2019</a></strong> (as of July 2020).</p>
<h2 id="hive-on-mr3----a-new-alternative">Hive on MR3 – a new alternative</h2>
<p>Hive on MR3 has been developed with the goal of facilitating the use of Hive, both on Hadoop and on Kubernetes, by exploiting a new execution engine MR3.
As such, Hive on MR3 is much easier to install than the original Hive.
On Hadoop, it suffices to copy the binary distribution in the installation directory on the master node.
On Kubernetes,
the user can build a Docker image from the binary distribution (or use a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/mr3project">pre-built image</a>)
and clone the <a href="https://github.com/mr3project/mr3-run-k8s">GitHub repository</a> containing all the scripts.</p>
<p>Hive on MR3 not only retains all the strengths of Hive, but also supports additional features unique to MR3.
For example,
<a href="https://mr3docs.datamonad.com/docs/mr3/features/fault-tolerance/">fault tolerance</a> is more mature than in Tez and Spark,
<a href="https://mr3docs.datamonad.com/docs/mr3/features/autoscaling/">autoscaling</a> is assisted by MR3 itself (rather than relying on an external monitor),
and multiple shuffle handlers can run inside a single container so as to <a href="https://mr3docs.datamonad.com/docs/mr3/features/fetchdelay/">eliminate fetch delays</a>.
As it is agnostic to the underlying file system, Hive on MR3 fully supports the separation of compute and storage.</p>
<p>Now suppose that a new user wants to try Hive on MR3 in a Hadoop cluster.
The reader may well think that it is a no-brainer to choose Hive on MR3 on Hadoop.
<strong>We, however, recommend Hadoop on MR3 on Kubernetes, even in a Hadoop cluster.</strong>
Below we explain why.</p>
<h2 id="hive-on-mr3-on-kubernetes-running-in-a-hadoop-cluster">Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes running in a Hadoop cluster</h2>
<p>While it generally runs stable in a typical Hadoop cluster,
Hive on MR3 on Hadoop may run into subtle problems due to conflicting configurations.
Here are a few examples of such problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kerberos authentication does not work well because an old version of Java with no support for the unlimited cryptography policy is installed.</li>
<li>High availability does not work because an incompatible version of ZooKeeper is running.</li>
<li>The user cannot install Ranger (for managing data security) dedicated to Hive on MR3 because an old version of Ranger is already running.</li>
<li>It is not easy to run multiple instances of HiveServer2 each with its own security policy.</li>
<li>On Cloudera CDH, the user should use MR3 based on Hadoop 2.7 in order to run Hive 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>By running Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes,
all such problems either disappear completely or are alleviated considerably.
The reason is two-fold: 1) all components now run in a containerized environment and thus the user controls everything;
2) the use of Kubernetes eliminates the need for advanced features specific to Hadoop such as high availability.
Moreover Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes is easier to operate than Hive on MR3 on Hadoop.
For example, it is easy to run multiple instances of HiveServer2 each with its own security policy while sharing all the resources.</p>
<p>Running Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes in a Hadoop cluster, however, may have two new problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kubernetes may conflict with Hadoop.</li>
<li>Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes may run slower than Hive on MR3 on Hadoop.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first problem,
Kubernetes and Hadoop can coexist in the same cluster
because Kubernetes (written in Go) and Hadoop (written in Java) share practically no dependencies.
(After installing Kubernetes in a Hadoop cluster, the user can stop Yarn which is no longer needed.)
For the second problem, <strong>the performance penalty does exist because of the use of Docker containers,
but is acceptable with the release of MR3 1.1.</strong></p>
<h2 id="experimental-results">Experimental results</h2>
<p>To measure the performance penalty inherent in Kubernetes,
we run an experiment with the following settings (where we use both Hive 3 and Hive 4):</p>
<ul>
<li>A cluster of 42 nodes each with 24 cores, 96 gigabytes of memory, and 6 HDDs</li>
<li>10 gigabit network switch</li>
<li>HDP 3.1.4 (which is based on Hadoop 3.1.1)</li>
<li>Kubernetes 1.18</li>
<li>Hive 3.1.2 and Hive 4.0.0 as of Apr 10, 2020 (after applying <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-23114">HIVE-23114</a>)</li>
<li>MR3 1.1</li>
<li>TPC-DS benchmark with a scale factor of 10 terabytes (with <a href="https://github.com/mr3-project/benchmark/">modified TPC-DS queries</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the reader's perusal,
we attach the table containing the raw data of the experiment.
Here is a link to [<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GLXhXkrPVx2IYCPwHN6rHBRStDYK-SZ_XYTE6mNxPUY/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs</a>].
</p>

<p>Here is the summary (all measurements in seconds):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Hive 3 on MR3</th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
<th>Hive 4 on MR3</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>on Hadoop</td>
<td>on Kubernetes</td>
<td></td>
<td>on Hadoop</td>
<td>on Kubernetes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total running time</td>
<td>12124.30</td>
<td>13674.68</td>
<td></td>
<td>9480.83</td>
<td>11229.45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Geometric mean</td>
<td>43.95</td>
<td>47.39</td>
<td></td>
<td>38.84</td>
<td>39.25</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>We make the following observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>With respect to the total running time,
<ul>
<li>Hive 3 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 12.8 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
<li>Hive 4 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 18.4 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With respect to the geometric mean of running times,
<ul>
<li>Hive 3 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 7.8 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
<li>Hive 4 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 1.0 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We claim that the performance penalty is in an acceptable range and does not outweigh the benefit conferred by Kubernetes.
The following graphs show that end users are not very likely to notice the difference in performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datamonad.com/img/mr3.1.1/hive3.hadoop.vs.k8s-fs8.png" alt="hive3.hadoop.vs.k8s">
<img src="https://www.datamonad.com/img/mr3.1.1/hive4.hadoop.vs.k8s-fs8.png" alt="hive4.hadoop.vs.k8s"></p>
<p>As a side note, we find that Hive 4 runs noticeably faster than Hive 3 on average,
and that Hive 3 and Hive 4 differ in the result of query 18 and query 22.</p>
<p>Thus the bottomline is:
<strong>if you are new to Hive, try Hive on MR3;
if you are new to Hive on MR3, try Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes, whether in a Hadoop cluster or not.</strong></p>

<p>We all put a lot of effort into improving business metrics with one ultimate goal — increasing profits, right? Seth Godin notes, however, that “A useful metric is both accurate (in that it measures what it says it measures) and aligned with your goals. Making your numbers go up (any numbers–your BMI, your blood sugar, your customer service ratings) is pointless if the numbers aren’t related to why you went to work this morning”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you approach the ARPU right, it combines both profits and value (we’ll elaborate on this below).&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)</strong> is an average income you get from <strong>each active user for a given period</strong>. It helps businesses digitize product value and forecast profits. Business decisions are usually made based on ARPU.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="arpu-calculation">ARPU calculation</h2>



<p>Divide your total revenue for a period by the number of active users you had during this period. The result is your ARPU.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/arpu-formula-2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/arpu-formula-2.png" alt="arpu formula" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/arpu-formula-2.png"></a></figure></div>



<p>Let’s say 600 people used your platform last month. We include free trial users, your super loyal customers, and the ones on the most advanced plan. Be sure to count everyone who used your product within a month. Your revenue was $3200. So, your ARPU is 3200/600 = $5,3.</p>




<h2 id="which-arpu-is-right">Which ARPU is right?</h2>



<p>Okay, we’ve got the figure, so what? Is 5,3 good or bad? The point is, there’s no <strong>ARPU benchmark</strong>. The only rule is: if you see your ARPU is decreasing, you need to acquire more customers.</p>



<p>You can’t evaluate this metric in isolation as it’s bound to your customer count. Let’s consider an example of two similar platforms thriving to make $10 000 monthly. Note: if you want to compare ARPUs, ground your research on identical companies or products.</p>



<p>Suppose analysts have calculated ARPUs which were $15 for both platforms. The only thing is, 700 people used Platform 1 (of which 100 people were trial period users), and they managed to make more than expected. Platform 2 was not so successful as they only got 300 customers (with the same 100 ones on a free plan). Their revenue was $4 500. Turns out, if 2 companies want to make the same profits and have identical ARPUs, it doesn’t mean anything.</p>



<p>You can only evaluate your own ARPU. Or compare yourself to a company with identical (both quantitatively and qualitatively) customers.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-time-period-to-use-when-calculating-arpu">What time period to use when calculating ARPU?</h2>



<p>First, decide on what period matches your business tasks. If you’re a subscription-based platform, you can do this exercise monthly. However, if you’re a mobile app with a short average Lifetime, consider calculating your ARPU more often.</p>



<p>Technically, a monthly ARPU should be called ARPMAU (Average revenue per monthly active user).</p>



<p>If your platform’s Lifetime is short, think of calculating ARPDAU (Average revenue per daily active user).</p>



<p>If you’re not a subscription-based platform, think about how often customers need you.</p>



<p>Wanna evaluate your traffic quality? Calculate revenues from your users for a certain period (e.g. all who signed up on June 15). This will be your cumulative ARPU. It’s calculated by a similar formula, but it shows your revenue from a particular user cohort. For this cohort, ARPU will gradually increase, that’s why it’s called cumulative.</p>



<p><strong>Cumulative ARPU (X days) = Revenues from a selected cohort for X days / User count within a cohort</strong></p>



<p>Let’s say 800 people signed up for your platform on June 15. The very same day they made total payments of $600. Your ARPU will be 600 / 800 = $0,75.</p>



<p>Suppose this cohort brought you another $300 the next day. Though some users might have left you or not used the platform on the second day, your cohort is still 800 users. The cumulative ARPU for 2 days will be (600+300) / 800 = $1,125. And it’s going to increase with each day.</p>



<p>Calculate cumulative ARPU for 1 day, a week or 2 weeks. This will give you an insight into how much a user brings you when they begin using your platform. You’ll also be able to forecast future revenues from that user.</p>



<p>This metric will gradually increase and reach your LTV one day.</p>




<h2 id="what-does-arpu-have-to-do-with-value">What does ARPU have to do with value?</h2>



<p>We’ve said before that ARPU combines revenue and value. Strange, huh? Aren’t we talking only about the money?</p>



<p>ARPU shows how much a user is willing to pay for your product. Suppose you’re offering 3 plans and a free trial period. Plans cost $15, $20, and $30, accordingly. Your ARPU is $23. If we take trial period users into account, we can say most of your users prefer paid plans.</p>



<p>If most of your users choose the highest plan, they are highly likely ready to pay more. You’re losing money if you don’t offer them that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A high ARPU proves that users value your product. If it reaches your average plan, it’s time to go up the ante!&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the metric approaches your lowest plan, it’s a red flag you’re not marketing your product right. Maybe you acquire users that pay you little money. Make a strategy change and incline your users to higher plans.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="how-is-arpu-connected-to-ltv">How is ARPU connected to LTV?</h2>



<p>These metrics are often confused. Or marketers only calculate LTV and omit ARPU (as they think they’re <strong>almost </strong>the same). They’re in fact connected, but each of them is important and cannot be ignored.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dashly.io/blog/why-do-you-need-to-know-ltv-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LTV</a> is a revenue you get from a user during their entire relationship with you. ARPU shows revenues from a user for a given period. The residual is Lifetime which is the length of a customer’s relationship with you.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/LTV.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/LTV.jpg" alt="ltv formula" width="512" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/LTV.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>LTV is about total customer value for your company, while ARPU only shows you the current state.</em></figcaption></figure></div>




<h2 id="in-what-way-arpu-and-arppu-are-different">In what way ARPU and ARPPU are different?</h2>



<p>One letter matters a lot here as an additional P in ARPPU means Paying. ARPU gives you an average revenue including those who don’t pay anything. ARPPU means Average Revenue Per Paying User. As there are fewer paying users, this metric is always higher.</p>



<p>ARPPU shows how paying users react to your product value. If you increase prices, your ARPPU will go up accordingly, but don’t rush to charge your glasses. Maybe this means the share of paying users has decreased with the prices growing, therefore ARPPU increased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s the Paying Share that binds ARPU and ARPPU.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paying-share.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paying-share.jpg" alt="paying_share_formula" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paying-share.jpg"></a></figure></div>



<p>Let’s say you’ve had 1200 users last month, of which 40 paid for premium accounts. Your revenue was $1000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ARPU = 1000 / 1200 = $ 0,8</p>



<p>ARPPU = 1000 / 40 = $ 25</p>



<p>The Paying Share is 0,8 / 25 = 0,032 or 3,2%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An ideal Paying Share depends on your type of business. 1-2% are good for mobile apps as most users are on a free plan and very few people make in-app purchases.</p>



<p>It’s important to keep track of your Paying Share. If your ARPPU is growing with the Paying Share going down, you’re losing money in the long term. Revenues from paying users won’t beat the decreasing number of them. The metric also helps you evaluate and forecast your revenues.</p>




<h2 id="how-do-i-put-the-metric-to-good-use">How do I put the metric to good use?</h2>



<p>ARPU shows how the price of your product corresponds to its value. How else can you use this metric?</p>



<ol><li><strong>Comparing yourself to your rivals.</strong><br>Investors base their decisions on this metric. If you run several projects, you can use ARPU to reveal the winner.<br>Note: be sure to only compare ARPUs of products with identical or similar audiences.</li><li><strong>Evaluating the reaction to price changes.<br></strong>Suppose you’ve decided to increase your subscription fee and see if ARPU for your new users changes. Last month, you had 810 newcomers who generated you $900. When you increased fees, user count decreased to 700, and your revenue to $800. Let’s compare two ARPUs to see how price changes affected them.<br>ARPU before the increase = 900 / 810 = $1,11<br>ARPU after the increase = 800 / 700 = $1,14<br>Turns out, this was a great experiment, and a decrease in income has nothing to do with price increases. If you acquire more active users having the same increased fee, you’ll simply make more money. Amazing, isn’t it?</li><li><strong>Choosing acquisition channels.<br></strong>ARPU is as good for the evaluation of the acquisition channel performance as is LTV. Let’s say you had 2200 customers who generated you $4000. Your ARPU is 4000 / 2200 = $1,81.<br>Then you launched an ad campaign, and now you have 3450 users and $5000. Looks great at first glance, but let’s look at the figures:<br>ARPU = 5000 / 3450 = $1,44<br>Your revenues decreased, so maybe you acquired an indifferent audience.</li><li><strong>User segmentation.</strong><br>You can segment users by the time they spend on you and compare revenues from each group. Let’s identify 3 segments: newcomers (less than a month with you; trial period users or paid for their plan once), those who know you well (and extended their subscription 2-3 times already), and your super loyal customers (who extended their subscriptions 3+ times.<br>Note: A user may not have paid during the specific period for which we calculate ARPU.<br><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-segmentation.jpg" alt="user_segmentation_table" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/user-segmentation.jpg"></li><li><strong>Predict the future.</strong><br>You can use ARPU to digitize your acquisition or retention hypotheses. Let’s say you’re launching an ad campaign and expect to acquire 20% more new users. Suppose you’ve had 120 monthly users, and now you’re expecting to acquire 144. If your ARPU is 30, your future revenue will be $4320 (while you had $3600). You can see your ad expenses paying off and predict your future revenues.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Turns out, you generate most revenues from your super loyal customers and newcomers. If you focus on these two segments, you can significantly increase your revenues.</p>

<meta name="twitter:title" content="Yet another lousy monad tutorial">
<meta name="”twitter:description”" content="I'm not a big fan of monads, but I understand them.">
I’m not a big fan of monads, but I understand them. They’re not rocket science. Let me try to write a monad tutorial that would’ve helped my past self understand what the fuss was about. I like concrete explanations that start with practical examples, without any annoying metaphors, and especially without any Haskell code. So here’s five examples that have something in common:</p>


<p>1) If a function has type <code>A → B</code>, and another function has type <code>B → C</code>, then we can “compose” them into a new function of type <code>A → C</code>.</p>

<p>2) Let’s talk about functions that can return multiple values. We can model these as functions of type <code>A → List&lt;B&gt;</code>. There is a natural way to “compose” two such functions. If one function has type <code>A → List&lt;B&gt;</code>, and another function has type <code>B → List&lt;C&gt;</code>, then we can “compose” them into a new function of type <code>A → List&lt;C&gt;</code>. The “composition” works by joining together all the intermediate lists of values into one. This is similar to MapReduce, which also collects together lists of results returned by individual workers.</p>

<p>3) Let’s talk about functions that either return a value, or fail somewhere along the way. We can model these as functions of type <code>A → Option&lt;B&gt;</code>, where <code>Option&lt;B&gt;</code> is a type that contains either a value of type B, or a special value None. There is a natural way to “compose” two such functions. If one function has type <code>A → Option&lt;B&gt;</code>, and another function has type <code>B → Option&lt;C&gt;</code>, then we can “compose” them into a new function of type <code>A → Option&lt;C&gt;</code>. The “composition” works just like regular function composition, except if the first function returns None, then it gets passed along and the second function doesn’t get called. This way you can have a “happy path” in your code, and check for None only at the end.</p>

<p>4) Let’s talk about functions that call a remote machine asynchronously. We can model these as functions of type <code>A → Promise&lt;B&gt;</code>, where <code>Promise&lt;B&gt;</code> is a type that will eventually contain a value of type B, which you can wait for. There is a natural way to “compose” two such functions. If one function has type <code>A → Promise&lt;B&gt;</code>, and another function has type <code>B → Promise&lt;C&gt;</code>, then we can “compose” them into a new function of type <code>A → Promise&lt;C&gt;</code>. The “composition” is an asynchronous operation that waits for the first promise to return a value, then calls the second function on that value. This is known in some languages as “promise pipelining”. It can sometimes make remote calls faster, because you can send both calls to the remote machine in the same request.</p>

<p>5) Let’s talk about functions that do input or output in a pure functional language, like Haskell. We can define <code>IO&lt;A&gt;</code> as the type of opaque “IO instructions” that describe how to do some IO and return a value of type A. These “instructions” might eventually be executed by the runtime, but can also be freely passed around and manipulated before that. For example, to create instructions for reading a String from standard input, we’d have a function of type <code>Void → IO&lt;String&gt;</code>, and to create instructions for writing a String to standard output, we’d have <code>String → IO&lt;Void&gt;</code>. There is a natural way to “compose” two such functions. If one function has type <code>A → IO&lt;B&gt;</code>, and another function has type <code>B → IO&lt;C&gt;</code>, then we can “compose” them into a new function of type <code>A → IO&lt;C&gt;</code>. The “composition” works by just doing the IO in sequence. Eventually the whole program returns one huge complicated IO instruction with explicit sequencing inside, which is then passed to the runtime for execution. That’s how Haskell works.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that each of the examples above also has a natural “identity” function, such that “composing” it with any other function F gives you F again. For ordinary function composition, it’s the ordinary identity function <code>A → A</code>. For lists, it’s the function <code>A → List&lt;A&gt;</code> that creates a single-element list. For options, it’s the function <code>A → Option&lt;A&gt;</code> that takes a value and returns an option containing that value. For promises, it’s the function <code>A → Promise&lt;A&gt;</code> that takes a value and makes an immediately fulfilled promise out of it. And for IO, it’s the function <code>A → IO&lt;A&gt;</code> that doesn’t actually do any IO.</p>

<p>At this point we could go all mathematical and talk about how “compose” is like number multiplication, and “identity” is like the number 1, and then go off into monoids and categories and functors and other things that are frankly boring to me. So let’s not go there! Whew!</p>

<p>Instead, to stay more on the programming track, let’s use a Java-like syntax to define an interface Monad<t> with two methods “identity” and “compose”. The five examples above will correspond to five different concrete classes that implement that interface, for different choices of the type parameter T.</t></p>

<p>The main complication is that the type parameter T must not be a simple type, like String. Instead it must be itself a generic type, like List, Option or Promise. The reason is that we want to have a single implementation of <code>Monad&lt;Option&gt;</code>, not separate implementations like <code>Monad&lt;Option&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>Monad&lt;Option&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> and so on. Java and C# don’t support generic types whose parameters are themselves generic types (the technical term is “higher-kinded types”), but C++ has some support for them, called “template template parameters”. Some functional languages have higher-kinded types, like Haskell, while others don’t have them, like ML.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s what it would look like in Java, if Java supported such things:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>interface</span> <span>Monad</span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;</span> Function<span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> T<span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>identity</span><span>();</span>
  <span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> B<span>,</span> C<span>&gt;</span> Function<span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> T<span>&lt;</span>C<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>compose</span><span>(</span>
    Function<span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> T<span>&lt;</span>B<span>&gt;&gt;</span> first<span>,</span>
    Function<span>&lt;</span>B<span>,</span> T<span>&lt;</span>C<span>&gt;&gt;</span> second
  <span>);</span>
<span>}</span> 

<span>class</span> <span>OptionMonad</span> <span>implements</span> Monad<span>&lt;</span>Option<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;</span> Function<span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> Option<span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>identity</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Implementation omitted, figure it out
</span><span></span>  <span>}</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> B<span>,</span> C<span>&gt;</span> Function<span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> Option<span>&lt;</span>C<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>compose</span><span>(</span>
    Function<span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> Option<span>&lt;</span>B<span>&gt;&gt;</span> first<span>,</span>
    Function<span>&lt;</span>B<span>,</span> Option<span>&lt;</span>C<span>&gt;&gt;</span> second
  <span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Implementation omitted, do it yourself
</span><span></span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Defining Monad as an interface allows us to implement some general functionality that will work on all monads. For example, there’s a well known function “liftM” that converts a function of type <code>A → B</code> into a function of type <code>List&lt;A&gt; → List&lt;B&gt;</code>, or <code>Promise&lt;A&gt; → Promise&lt;B&gt;</code>, or anything else along these lines. For different monads, liftM will do different useful things, e.g. liftM on lists is just the familiar “map” function in disguise. The implementation of liftM with lambda expressions would be very short, though a little abstract:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>&lt;</span>T<span>,</span> A<span>,</span> B<span>&gt;</span> Function<span>&lt;</span>T<span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;,</span> T<span>&lt;</span>B<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>liftM</span><span>(</span>
  Function<span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> B<span>&gt;</span> func<span>,</span>
  Monad<span>&lt;</span>T<span>&gt;</span> monad
<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>T<span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;</span> ta<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> monad<span>.</span><span>compose</span><span>(</span>
    <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> ta<span>,</span>
    <span>(</span>A a<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> monad<span>.</span><span>identity</span><span>().</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span>func<span>.</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span>a<span>))</span>
  <span>).</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you don’t like lambda expressions, here’s a version without them:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>&lt;</span>T<span>,</span> A<span>,</span> B<span>&gt;</span> Function<span>&lt;</span>T<span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;,</span> T<span>&lt;</span>B<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>liftM</span><span>(</span>
  Function<span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> B<span>&gt;</span> func<span>,</span>
  Monad<span>&lt;</span>T<span>&gt;</span> monad
<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> Function<span>&lt;</span>T<span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;,</span> T<span>&lt;</span>B<span>&gt;&gt;()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> T<span>&lt;</span>B<span>&gt;</span> <span>apply</span> <span>(</span>T<span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;</span> ta<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> monad<span>.</span><span>compose</span><span>(</span>
        <span>new</span> Function<span>&lt;</span>Void<span>,</span> T<span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;&gt;()</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>public</span> T<span>&lt;</span>A<span>&gt;</span> <span>apply</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> ta<span>;</span>
          <span>}</span>
        <span>},</span>
        <span>new</span> Function<span>&lt;</span>A<span>,</span> T<span>&lt;</span>B<span>&gt;&gt;()</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>public</span> T<span>&lt;</span>B<span>&gt;</span> <span>apply</span><span>(</span>A a<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> monad<span>.</span><span>identity</span><span>().</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span>func<span>.</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span>a<span>));</span>
          <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>).</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Monads first became popular as a nice way to deal with IO instructions in a pure language, treating them as first-class values that can be passed around, like in my example 5. Imperative languages don’t need monads for IO, but they often face a similar problem of “option chaining” or “error chaining”, like in my example 3. For example, the option types in Rust or Swift would benefit from having a “happy path” through the code and a centralized place to handle errors, which is exactly the thing that monads would give you.</p>

<p>Some people think that monads are about side effects, like some sort of escape hatch for Haskell. That’s wrong, because you could always do IO without monads, and in fact the first version of Haskell didn’t use them. In any case, only two of my five examples involve side effects. Monads are more like a design pattern for composing functions, which shows up in many places. I think the jury is still out on whether imperative/OO languages need to use monads explicitly, but it might be useful to notice them when they appear in your code implicitly.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I have been working in the BI/Analytics field for a long time and have seen a lot of disruptive technologies in this space going through the hype cycle. Moving from SMP technologies to MPP databases, the era of Hadoop, the meteoric rise of Python and R for data science, serverless architectures and data lakes on cloud platforms etc. ensured that this industry stays more vibrant than ever. I see new frameworks, tools and paradigms raising to the surface almost daily and there are always new things to learn and explore. A few weeks ago, I had an interesting conversation with a recruiter about what’s trendy and interesting in the space of BI and Analytics and what the businesses she’s been helping with resourcing are looking for in terms of the IT talent pool. I was expecting to hear things like AI PaaS, Synthetic Data, Edge Analytics and all the interesting (and over-hyped) stuff that the cool kids in Silicon Valley are getting into. Instead, she asserted that apart from public cloud platforms and all the run-of-the-mill BI tools like PowerBI and Looker, there is a growing demand for Snowflake projects. Mind you, this is an Australian market so chances are your neck of the woods may look completely different, but suffice to say, I didn’t expect a company not affiliated with a major public cloud provider to become so popular, particularly in this already congested market for cloud data warehousing solutions.</p>
<p>Snowflake, a direct competitor to Amazon’s Redshift, Microsoft’s Synapse and Google’s BigQuery, has been around for some time, but only recently I also started hearing more about it becoming the go-to technology for storing and processing large volumes of data in the cloud. I was also surprised to see Snowflake positioned in the ‘Leaders’ quadrant in the Data Management Solutions for Analytics chart, dethroning the well-known and respected industry stalwarts such as Vertica or Greenplum.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to look at Snowflake performance characteristics by creating a TPC-DS benchmark schema and executing a few analytical queries to see how it fares in comparison to some of the other MPP databases I worked with and/or tested. It’s not supposed to be an exhaustive overview or test and as such, these benchmark results should not be taken as Gospel. Having worked with databases all my career, I always look forward to exploring new technologies and even though I don’t expect to utilise Snowflake in my current project, it’s always exciting to kick the tires on a new platform or service.</p>
<p>OK, let’s dive in and see what’s in store!</p>
<h3>Snowflake Architecture Primer</h3>
<p>Snowflake claims to be built for cloud from the ground-up and does not offer on-premise deployment option, it’s a purely data warehouse as a service (DWaaS) offering. Everything – from database storage infrastructure to the compute resources used for analysis and optimisation of data – is handled by Snowflake. In this respect, Snowflake is not that much different from Google’s BigQuery although it’s difficult to contrast those two, mainly due to different pricing models (excluding storage cost) – BigQuery charges per volume of data scanned whereas Snowflake went with a more traditional model i.e. compute size and resource time allocation.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s architecture is a hybrid of traditional shared-disk database architectures and shared-nothing database architectures. Similar to shared-disk architectures, Snowflake uses a central data repository for persisted data that is accessible from all compute nodes in the data warehouse. But just like shared-nothing architectures, Snowflake processes queries using massively parallel processing compute clusters, where each node in the cluster stores a portion of the entire data set locally. This approach offers the data management simplicity of a shared-disk architecture, but with the performance and scale-out benefits of a shared-nothing architecture.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s unique architecture consists of three key layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database Storage – When data is loaded into Snowflake, Snowflake reorganizes that data into its internaly optimized, compressed, columnar format. Snowflake stores this optimized data in cloud storage. Snowflake manages all aspects of how this data is stored — the organization, file size, structure, compression, metadata, statistics, and other aspects of data storage are handled by Snowflake. The data objects stored by Snowflake are not directly visible nor accessible by customers; they are only accessible through SQL query operations run using Snowflake</li>
<li>Query Processing – Query execution is performed in the processing layer. Snowflake processes queries using “virtual warehouses”. Each virtual warehouse is an MPP compute cluster composed of multiple compute nodes allocated by Snowflake from a cloud provider. Each virtual warehouse is an independent compute cluster that does not share compute resources with other virtual warehouses. As a result, each virtual warehouse has no impact on the performance of other virtual warehouses</li>
<li>Cloud Services – The cloud services layer is a collection of services that coordinate activities across Snowflake. These services tie together all of the different components of Snowflake in order to process user requests, from login to query dispatch. The cloud services layer also runs on compute instances provisioned by Snowflake from the cloud provider</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content//2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level.png"><img src="http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content//2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level.png" alt="" width="580" height="334" srcset="http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content/2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level.png 765w, http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content/2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, Snowflake can be hosted on any of the top three public cloud provides i.e. Azure, AWS and GCP across different regions, baring in mind that Snowflake accounts do not support multi-region deployments.</p>
<h3>Loading TPC-DS Data</h3>
<p>Data can be loaded into Snowflake is a number of ways, for example, using established ETL/ELT tools, using Snowpipe for continuous loading, WebUI or SnowSQL, and in a variety of formats e.g. JSON, AVRO, Parquet, CSV, Avro or XML. There are a few things to keep in mind when loading data into Snowflake which relate to file size, file splitting, file staging etc. The general recommendation is to produce files roughly 10MB to 100MB in size, compressed. Data loads of large Parquet files e.g. greater than 3GB could time out, therefore it is best practice to split those into smaller files to distribute the load among the servers in an active warehouse.</p>
<p>In order to run the TPC-DS queries on the Snowflake warehouse, I loaded the sample CSV-format data (scale factor of 100 and 300) from my local storage into the newly created schema using a small Python script. Snowflake also provides for staging files in public clouds object and blob storage e.g. AWS S3 but in this exercise, I transferred those from my local hard drive and staged them internally in Snowflake. As TPC-DS data does not conform to some of the requirements outlined above, the following script processed those files to ensure the format and size are consistent. The below script enables files’ format renaming (from DAT to CSV), breaking up larger files into smaller ones and removing trailing characters from line endings. It also creates the required TPC-DS schema and loads pre-processed data into its objects.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <header>  <p> 3 minute read </p> </header> <section itemprop="text"> <div> <p>In the many years of using computers and different operating systems, I can say, without a doubt, that any user-facing program that is meant to download file(s) from the internet sucks. And there are all sorts of such programs:</p> <ul> <li>Programs that download files you want (wget, curl, IDM and the web browsers we use)</li> <li>Download operating system updates (Microsoft’s Windows Update, macOS system updates, linux package managers) or software updates (chrome updater, firefox update service, linux package managers again), or even</li> <li>Programs that download and install from the internet (looking at you, Google Chrome Installer).</li> </ul> <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2> <p>In the early days of downloading stuff, programs Download Accelerator Plus and IDM were all the rage. Over time, browsers made improvements to their built in download mechanisms and the remaining gaps were filled with extensions like DownThemAll! and many more. But the one thing that has consistently sucked less and has continuously improved to this day are the command-line download tools: the good-old <strong>cURL</strong> (which is shipped in all of the recent versions of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/tar-and-curl-come-to-windows/">Windows 10</a>, macOS and many popular Linux distros) and <strong>wget</strong>. And the reason they suck less, is because they provide a way to input the state of the downloaded file, either by reading its state directly from the file (as in case of curl, wget, where no state is stored at all, and it is the user’s responsibility to provide the correct URL) or providing the state from another source (aria2c’s .aria2 files come to mind here). Many times, I’ve seen Chrome abruptly terminate my download just because of some slight trouble with the network connection (according to the download status ERR:NETWORK_CONNECTION_CHANGED). Sometimes, it just shits the bed by dropping the speed to 0 bytes/sec, something, which seems to have been going on for years. And since this seems to be a Chromium related thing, that means any browsers that are Chromium-based, such as Opera, Microsoft Edge, Brave etc. have possibly inherited this flaw as well. The Firefox and Safari sides don’t look good either, and this too seems to have been going on for many years.</p> <h2 id="cant-the-browsers-just-fix-downloading">Can’t the browsers just fix downloading?</h2> <p>This story has 2 actors: the client trying to download a file, and the server serving the file. Measures can be taken up on both sides to ensure that file delivery is smooth. The server side of course, is governed by business considerations most of the time, so reliable file delivery might not always be a high priority, which leaves the client side.</p> <p>Coming to the question at hand, the answer is that browsers can try to be be more smart (they’re already doing that) and allow customizing download parameters. The problem is that downloading files is a complex affair, and general use tools like Web Browsers generally want to abstract away these complexities from their users. Mostly these problems occur due to the fact that <strong>the URL of the file to be downloaded changes, based on various parameters</strong>: Sometimes, websites generate a URL based on specific parameters like: the current time (and timezone), the web-browser name/version, the IP address of the computer, the Operating System name/version and any other detail which they might find useful for purposes like analytics, DDoS mitigation and so on. Sometimes, they even check cookies to see if the download was indeed triggered the way they wanted it. Since downloads are always identified by URLs in the web browsers, it implies that web browsers are certainly not suitable for such cases. And such cases, though not common, are increasing. Though at times browsers try to be smart by doing under-the-hood stuff like parsing redirects, but this might not necessarily save you.</p> <h2 id="so-as-a-user-what-can-you-do">So, as a user, what can you do?</h2> <p>Here’s a thumb rule:</p> <ul> <li>If your download size is a few MBs: browsers are good.</li> <li>If not, best to go for command-line tools like cURL and wget, unless command-line tools have definitively failed you in that case, meaning that you should exhaust full knowledge of that tool first. In such cases, go back to browsers, or contact the website operators, if you can.</li> <li>Learn more about these tools and the web. If you are reading this post, you already are.</li> </ul> <p><strong>PS</strong>: If you are someone who has worked on any of the web browsers, maybe explore the possibility of adding an advanced options menu to a download.</p> <p>Adios!</p> </div> </section>    </div></div>]]>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a> is a new Postgres-based, multithreaded, second-generation ActiveJob backend for Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p><strong>Inspired by Delayed::Job and Que, <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a> is designed for maximum compatibility with Ruby on Rails, ActiveJob, and Postgres to be simple and performant for most workloads.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Designed for ActiveJob.</strong> Complete support for async, queues, delays, priorities, timeouts, and retries with near-zero configuration.</li>
  <li><strong>Built for Rails.</strong> Fully adopts Ruby on Rails threading and code execution guidelines with Concurrent::Ruby.</li>
  <li><strong>Backed by Postgres.</strong> Relies upon Postgres integrity and session-level Advisory Locks to provide run-once safety and stay within the limits of schema.rb.</li>
  <li><strong>For most workloads.</strong> Targets full-stack teams, economy-minded solo developers, and applications that enqueue less than 1-million jobs/day.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">Visit Github for instructions on adding GoodJob to your Rails application</a> , or read on for the story behind GoodJob.</p>

<h3 id="a-second-generation-activejob-backend">A “Second-generation” ActiveJob backend</h3>

<p>Why “second-generation*”? GoodJob is designed from the beginning to be an ActiveJob-backend in a conventional Ruby on Rails application.</p>

<p>First-generation ActiveJob backends, like Delayed::Job and Que, all predate ActiveJob and support non-Rails applications. First-generation ActiveJob backends are significantly more complex than GoodJob because they separately maintain a lot of functionality that comes with a conventional Rails installation (ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, Concurrent::Ruby) and re-implement job lifecycle hooks so they can work apart from ActiveJob. I’ve observed that this can make them slow to keep up with major Rails changes. An impetus for GoodJob was reviewing the number of outages, blocked upgrades, and forks of first-generation backends I’ve managed during both major and minor Rails upgrades over the years.</p>

<p>As a second-generation ActiveJob backend, GoodJob can draft off of all the advances and solved problems of ActiveJob and Ruby on Rails. For example <code>rescue_from</code>, <code>retry_on</code>, <code>discard_on</code> are all implemented already by ActiveJob.</p>

<p>GoodJob is significantly thinner than first-generation backends, and over the long run hopefully easier to maintain and keep up with changes to Ruby on Rails. For example, GoodJob is currently ~600 lines of code, whereas Que is ~1,200 lines, and Delayed::Job is ~2,300 lines (2,000 for <code>delayed_job</code>, and an additional 300 for <code>delayed_job_active_record</code>).</p>

<p><em>*“Second generation” was coined for me by Daniel Lopez on <a href="https://rubyonrails-link.slack.com/archives/C0GB80GRE/p1594860261410500">Ruby on Rails Link Slack</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="postgres-based">Postgres-based</h3>

<p>I love Postgres. Postgres offers a lot of features, has safety and integrity guarantees, and simply running fewer services (skipping Redis) means less complexity in development and production.</p>

<p>GoodJob builds atop ActiveRecord. It’s numbingly boring, in a good way.</p>

<p>GoodJob uses session-level Advisory Locks to provide run-once guarantees with relatively little performance implications for most workloads.</p>

<p>GoodJob’s session-level Advisory Lock implementation is perhaps the only “novel” aspect, that comes from my experience orchestrating complex web-driving of government systems (“the browser is the API”) for <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>. GoodJob uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to find, lock, and return the next workable job in a single query. Session-level Advisory Locks will gracefully relinquish that lock if interrupted, without having to maintain a transaction for the duration of the job.</p>

<h3 id="multi-threaded">Multi-threaded</h3>

<p>GoodJob uses <a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby">Concurrent::Ruby</a>  to scale and manage jobs across multiple threads. “<em>Concurrent Ruby makes one of the strongest thread-safety guarantees of any Ruby concurrency library”.</em>  Ruby on Rails has adopted Concurrent Ruby, and GoodJob follows its lead and <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/threading_and_code_execution.html">thread-execution and safety guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>In building GoodJob I leaned heavily on my positive experiences running Que, another multithreaded backend, on Heroku. Threads are great for balancing simplicity, economy, and performance for typical IO-bound workloads like heavy database queries, API requests, Selenium web-driving, or sending emails.</p>

<p>A feature that won’t be in GoodJob 1.0, but I hope to implement soon, is the ability to run the GoodJob scheduler inside the webserver process (“async mode”). This was a feature  <a href="https://github.com/que-rb/que/issues/238#issuecomment-480648845">withdrawn from Que</a> , but I believe can be safely implemented with Concurrent Ruby. An async mode would offer even greater economy, for example, in Heroku’s constrained environment.</p>

<h3 id="goodjob-is-right-for-me">GoodJob is right for me</h3>

<p>GoodJob’s design is based directly on my experience in 2-pizza, full-stack teams, and as an economy-minded solo developer. GoodJob already powers  <a href="https://dayoftheshirt.com/">Day of the Shirt</a> and <a href="https://brompt.com/">Brompt</a> performing tens-of-thousands of real-world jobs a day.</p>

<h3 id="is-goodjob-right-for-you">Is GoodJob right for you?</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">Try it out</a>  and let me know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-94edc3520e97f986fec9"><div><p>Here are all of V. Rose's <em>testimonia</em>&nbsp;of a work attributed to Aristotle called <em>Magic (</em>ὁ Μαγικός λόγος, or τὸ μαγικόν?). The title either refers to the art practised by the Magi (the Zoroastrian priests from Persia), or it refers to the fact that the discussion is a discussion about the Magi. The latter seems more likely, even though the first passage, from Diogenes Laertius, suggests the discussion mentioned all sorts of wisdom cults.</p><p>The attribution is disputed. Diogenes Laertius says it is by Aristotle, but doesn't put it in his list of Aristotle's works (it doesn't show up in any other list I've looked at in either Greek or Arabic). The Suda says it is by Antisthenes, and that some people attributed it to Aristotle or someone named Rhodon. It's not clear where the Suda is getting this from.</p><p>While we don't know who wrote it, its contents are hinted at by the testimonies gathered in Rose (+ a few others I've put together). Diogenes reports that Aristotle thought magic wasn't sorcery, but philosophy or wisdom. This is confirmed by the Suda. It has something to do with prognostication. Eudoxus, according to Pliny,&nbsp;believed it was useful and very valuable, and so it was not only practical but connected to more valuable objects of study, probably the heavenly bodies. This is especially supported by the etymology of Zoroaster ('star-diviner') reported by Diogenes,&nbsp;and Porphyry's etymology of 'magus' as 'wise in divine matters'. Philo specifies that it was a kind of 'optics'&nbsp;and a very precise branch of natural science. Finally, Philo, Porphyry and the Suda associate it with both wisdom <em>and </em>with kingship. Philo says not only private citizens practice magic, but that Persian kings themselves had to be educated as Magi to become king.</p><p>It seems to me as if all these testimonies could be referring to a discussion of wise philosopher kings who are able to predict the future through their understanding of the heavens and the science of nature.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1520798591087_18030"><div><p>"Some say the work of philosophy originated with the barbarians. For among the Persians are the Magi, among the Babylonians and Assyrians the Chaldeans, among the Indians the Gymnosophists (lit. naked philosophers), and among the Celts and Gauls, those called 'Druids' and holy people, according to what Aristotle says in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Sotion in the twenty-third book of the <em>Succession of Philosophers</em>."</p><p>Τὸ τῆς φιλοσοφίας ἔργον ἔνιοί φασιν ἀπὸ βαρβάρων ἄρξαι. γεγενῆσθαι γὰρ παρὰ μὲν Πέρσαις μάγους, παρὰ δὲ Βαβυλωνίοις ἢ Ἀσσυρίοις Χαλδαίους, καὶ γυμνοσοφιστὰς παρ' Ἰνδοῖς, παρά τε Κελτοῖς καὶ Γαλάταις τοὺς καλουμένους δρυίδας καὶ σεμνοθέους, καθά φησιν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ μαγικῷ καὶ Σωτίων ἐν εἰκοστῷ τρίτῳ τῆς διαδοχῆς.</p><p><strong>Diogenes Laertius, <em>Lives of the Eminent Philosophers</em>, 1.1</strong></p><p>"The Magi were ignorant of sorcerers' magic, says Aristotle in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Dinon in the fifth book of his <em>Histories</em>. He also says 'Zoroaster' when translated literally means 'star-diviner'; Hermodorus says this as well. In the first book of <em>On Philosophy</em>, Aristotle says they (the Magi) are actually older than the Egyptians. And according to them there are two principles, a good daimon and a bad daimon: to the former, the name is Zeus and 'Oromasdes' [i.e., Ahura Mazda], to the other Hades and 'Arimanius' [i.e., Ahriman]. Hermippus says this too in the first book <em>On Magi</em>, so does Eudoxus in the <em>Survey</em>, and Theopompus in the eighth book of the <em>Philippics</em>."</p><p>Τὴν δὲ γοητικὴν μαγείαν [sc. οἱ Μάγοι] οὐδ' ἔγνωσαν, φησὶν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ Μαγικῷ καὶ Δείνων ἐν τῇ πέμπτῃ τῶν Ἱστοριῶν· ὃς καὶ μεθερμηνευόμενόν φησι τὸν Ζωροάστρην ἀστροθύτην εἶναι· φησὶ δὲ τοῦτο καὶ ὁ Ἑρμόδωρος.

He was the son of a father with the same name, and his mother came from the people of Thrace. He wrote these ten volumes: first, <em>Magic</em>: it tells about a certain <em>magus</em>, Zoroaster, who discovered wisdom. Some people attribute this to Aristotle, others to Rhodon."</p><p>Ἀντισθένης, Ἀθηναῖος, ἀπὸ ῥητόρων φιλόσοφος Σωκρατικός, ὅστις Περιπατητικὸς ἐκλήθη πρῶτον, εἶτα ἐκύνισεν: υἱὸς δὲ ὢν ὁμωνύμου πατρὸς, μητρὸς δὲ τὸ γένος Θρᾴσσης. οὗτος συνέγραψε τόμους δέκα: πρῶτον μαγικόν: ἀφηγεῖται δὲ περὶ Ζωροάστρου τινὸς μάγου, εὑρόντος τὴν σοφίαν: τοῦτο δέ τινες Ἀριστοτέλει, οἱ δὲ Ῥόδωνι ἀνατιθέασιν.</p><p><strong>Suda, s.v.

<p>By Lane Wagner –&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane">@wagslane</a> on Twitter</p>



<p>Lattice-based cryptography has been coming into the spotlight recently. In January 2019, Many of the semifinalists in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/01/nist-reveals-26-algorithms-advancing-post-quantum-crypto-semifinals">NIST post-quantum-cryptography competition</a> were based on lattices. Let’s explore the basics of lattices and how they apply to cryptosystems.</p>



<h2><span id="What_is_a_Lattice">What is a Lattice?</span>
</h2>



<p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">Wikipedia</a>, a lattice&nbsp;is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors:</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56" alt="{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {b} _{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}" width="128" height="21"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>i.e.</p>

<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d" alt="{\displaystyle L={\Big \{}\sum a_{i}\mathbf {b} _{i}\ :\ a_{i}\in \mathbb {Z} {\Big \}}\;.}"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>More simply put, a lattice is defined by basis vectors, which are only able to be scaled by integers… yay no fractions! </p>



<p>For example, let’s create a lattice of all the integers in a two-dimensional plane:</p>

<p>v2 = (1,0)</p>

There is no way to scale v1 (0,3) and v2 (3,0) to reach those points without using fractional scalars. With lattices, we can only scale by whole integers.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Does_This_Help_With_Crypto">How Does This Help With Crypto?</span>
</h2>



<p>Cryptographic algorithms are typically based on mathematical problems that are easy to verify the answer of, but hard to calculate.</p>



<p>For example, RSA is based on prime factorization. If I told you to find prime factors of 27,919,645,564,169,759, that would be hard. However, if I told you that 48,554,491 and 575,016,749 are prime factors, all you have to do is multiply them together in order to verify my answer.</p>



<p>RSA works great with classical computers. There are <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10590/what-makes-rsa-secure-by-using-prime-numbers">no known solutions to find prime factors</a> of a number reliably in less than exponential time.</p>

<p>In this introductory article, we will take a brief look at one of the more well-known lattice problems that are of use in cryptosystems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Shortest_vector_problem_(SVP)">the shortest vector problem (SVP)</a>.</p>



<p>Simply put, the goal of SVP is for the attacker to find the shortest vector from the origin (above in red) when given the basis of a lattice (above in blue). A zero vector doesn’t work as an answer, we consider it trivial.</p>



<p>How is it solved?</p>



<p>Like RSA with classical computers, it is hard to find the shortest vector of a large lattice, especially if it exists in many dimensions. One such slow solution for approximating the shortest vector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai">Babai</a>‘s algorithm, or <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2004/ln/cvp.pdf">Nearest Plane Algorithm</a>, which you can read about in the links provided.</p>

After 5 years of working on the front lines of building solutions for families, there are many things I could tell you about how broken things are. But today, I’d rather focus on the story of what can be.</p><p>Pre-COVID, the harsh reality I would have told you is: the way we think about our families is stuck in the 1950s (at least – the school calendar is firmly stuck in the agrarian realities of the 1800s). We still have this utopian notion of the “traditional nuclear family” where one person (the man) is the breadwinner and the other person (the woman) is the homemaker. They live comfortably in the suburbs, earn a family wage and have the safety nets of community and company pensions. Even if this view served a particular sliver of America well back then, it simply does not describe families now.</p><p>Our family infrastructure has not evolved with the reality of families. More than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marybethferrante/2020/03/06/millennial-working-parents-you-are-poised-to-fight-gender-equality/#329175c63c78">78% of millennial couples</a> (the people with the young kids today) are dual working.<em><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/#:~:text=Almost%20a%20quarter%20of%20U.S.,who%20do%20so%20(7%25)"> </a></em><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/#:~:text=Almost%20a%20quarter%20of%20U.S.,who%20do%20so%20(7%25)">Almost a quarter of kids</a> are being raised in single-parent households. What family looks like has never been more varied.<br>In the ultimate irony, we say that families are the cornerstone of our society, but we’re not willing to see that that foundation is crumbling and barely holding up. Over the past 3 decades, as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/why-child-care-so-expensive/602599/">childcare costs have nearly doubled</a> and the number of dual working households has climbed, we’ve asked parents to continue to push through, making them feel like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/opinion/sunday/the-real-mommy-war-is-against-the-state.html">failure was theirs when they came up short</a> .</p><p>But in a post-COVID world? There is no hiding from the fact of how broken systems are for today’s parents. If there are any silver linings, it’s that this crisis has laid bare the cracks. It has pushed parents to and over the edge of trying to just “muscle through”.</p></div><p>So one way or another, there will be change as we do the hard, messy work of reimagining what having a family in the 21st century should look like. And while they’re interrelated, this change falls roughly into five categories:</p><div><p>This is vast and complicated terrain, but here are 12 ideas and conversation starters that can help us reimagine and rebuild the future we want to live in:</p><p><strong><em>In the future:</em><br>1. Parents won’t have to choose between quality of care and its cost.</strong><br>Today, because US parents are expected to shoulder the vast majority of the cost related to childcare, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/parents-spending-42-billion-on-early-child-care-each-year.html#:~:text=That's%20on%20par%20with%20other,on%20summer%20child%20care%20alone">access to high-quality, affordable care is hard to come by</a>.</p><p>That pushes parents to compromise on quality and keeps childcare in the grey. First stop to change? Effective gov’t and employer-supported childcare/early ed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/biden-workplace-childcare.html">Today’s announcement from Joe Biden</a> is a promising start.</p><p><strong>2. We’ll have access to $10/day daycare.</strong><br>It’s a time for boldness and nothing is as bold as the idea of <a href="https://www.10aday.ca/">$10/day daycare</a> as it is in places like Canada, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Australia. Not a coincidence, those same countries have the highest female labor participation rates in the world. But it needs to be a national priority.</p><p><strong>3. Childcare will be a profession, and great caregivers will be rewarded as such.</strong><br>Right now, it’s impossible to make a real living doing childcare or eldercare. It’s a transient occupation that can’t sustain someone as a career — but it shouldn’t be that way. To fix childcare quality and supply problems, we have to first make it a profession that is worth having – financially and emotionally. With clear qualifications, access to benefits and proper wages (current averages are $9-15/hr – no wonder most is in the gray economy), we can start to build the childcare system we all need.</p><p><strong>4. Welcome to the Club: New parents will feel supported from the start.</strong><br>Ideas like the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415">Finnish baby box</a> and <a href="https://www.peps.org/">PEPS</a> will be for every parent, to ensure every baby has an equal start on life and that parents never feel alone in their journey.</p><p><strong>5. Parental Leave: Universal access to paid leave for both mothers and fathers.</strong><br>Advances in leave will include offering leave for both parents. The Swedish system offers 16 mo, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-maternity-leave-paternity-leave-policies-latte-dads-2018-4#:~:text=The%20Swedish%20government%20says%20that,child%20is%208%20years%20old">available until the child is 8, which are shared across both parents</a> . There are also other options, like what the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/upshot/paid-parental-leave-sweet-spot-six-months-gates.html">Gates Foundation offers</a> , of 6 mo leave + $20K stipend for childcare/other costs.</p><p><strong>6. Change the default: Women will no longer be the default primary parent.</strong><br>Today, from maternity leave to which parent gets the call from school, we default to the <a href="https://www.mother.ly/life/true-life-im-the-default-parent">mother as primary parent</a> . In the future, we won’t assume it’s the mother caring for kids full-time or opting for a flex job. We’ll explicitly ask for and acknowledge each family’s preference. No assumptions.</p><p><strong>7. Fluid careers. It will no longer be so punitive to take career breaks.</strong><br>Whether paid (as in the Swedish system until the kid is 8) or unpaid, parents will be able to step in and out of the workforce with less friction. It will be commonplace to have “resume gaps” that tie to caregiving responsibilities, and that experience will count for something instead of being shoved under the rug. Right now, it is incredibly hard for parents (mostly women) to come back into the workforce after having kids making it too punitive to take a step out of the workforce.</p><p>In the future, it will be much easier to take this approach post kids, tag teaming with a partner to come in and out of the workplace. We know that there are so many ways you can concoct a career today. We don’t have to stick to this default / linear model of “start working at 22 and stop at 65” and employers will be active participants in building family-friendly career paths.</p><p><strong>8. HomeTech will be about connecting the people, not the things.</strong><br>Right now,, the race is to connect lightbulbs, doorbells and speakers in our homes. In future, we’ll be more concerned about connecting the people. HomeTech will make information around care, schedules and development central and collaborative among household members.</p><p><strong>9. Design for collaboration.</strong><br>One simple example is to<strong> </strong>make household accounts the standard. Most software requires users to create their own accounts. For family-related services, like accounts related to kids’ activities, this is challenging – the best solution for parents is often to insecurely share one login. We need to make the idea of Household accounts the norm, to which you can attach any number of users with different settings and preferences.</p><p><strong>10. Superstar teachers will be the rule, not the exception.</strong><br>What would it take for teachers to have the same spotlight as top celebrities? Wouldn’t it be incredible to live in a country where teachers are idolized? We need to celebrate and reward this critical profession in a way that not only attracts the best minds, but keeps them engaged and innovating in the most important investment sector we have.</p><p><strong>11. Role for everyone in the neighborhood.</strong><br>Today’s communities are very siloed, especially generationally. In the future, there won’t be such a hard line between people with kids and those without – everyone will have a role in each other’s lives. We’ll create a space where having families feels more fluid, parents get the vital help they need from those w/o kids, such as empty nesters, and we’ll normalize the idea that not everyone has to have kids to play an important role with kids in the neighborhood. We can even employ the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mothers-covid-19-bailout-carecorps_n_5efccc22c5b612083c560618">bold idea of a CareCorps to make this happen</a>.</p><p><strong>12. Access to the best education will be available to all.</strong><br>The differences in opportunities in public/private systems will no longer be so stark. The best education won’t just be for those who can afford expensive private lessons and can drive kids everywhere. The best lessons with the best teachers, from math to art to piano to coding, will be available from your home and for all families, from dedicated, immersive screens.</p></div><p>Building the future of families is a complicated thing, interconnected and messy. But there is no going back.</p></div>]]>

<p>
  2020-07-19
</p>
<p>I just released <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.pre8/">Oil 0.8.pre8</a>, and it reached a
significant milestone!  The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-native#oil-native">oil-native</a> binary can now run <a href="https://github.com/Crestwave/bf/blob/master/bash/bf.bash">Crestwave's
brainfuck interpreter in bash</a>, and it's even pretty fast.</p>
<p>So now is a good time to come up for air and write blog  posts.  This post is
<strong>an outline</strong> of what I want to write.  If the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/blog-roadmap.html">January Blog
Roadmap</a> is any indication, I'll publish a few
posts, then go back to coding again.</p>
<p>Please ask questions in the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/hueuuq/oil_summer_2020_blog_roadmap/">comments section</a> to help me
prioritize the writing.</p>
 
<a name="a-plan-for-oil-08-and-09"></a>
<h2>A Plan for Oil 0.8 and 0.9</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/05/translation-progress.html">C++ translation process</a> is creating a
fast and correct shell, which is exciting.  The next two releases will continue
along the same path:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oil 0.8 will be a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/04/release-0.8.pre4.html#dependency-inversion-leads-to-pure-interpreters">pure interpreter</a> (without most I/O).  In addition
to brainfuck, it should run a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/06/release-0.8.pre6.html">Lisp interpreter</a>
and a JSON parser.</li>
<li>Oil 0.9 will add shell I/O: processes, pipelines, and more.  It should be
able to run <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/07/02.html">Python's configure</a> script, big batch scripts from
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">Linux distros</a>, and Oil's own shell scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the last few months of progress, I believe this can be done by the end
of the year.  Recall that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/ambitions.html">back in January</a>, I said I
wanted to get something concrete done in 2020.  This is about what I expected.</p>
<a name="features-cut-in-2020"></a>
<h3>Features Cut in 2020</h3>
<p>I also want to <strong>reduce the scope</strong> of the project, and point out some
problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oil 0.9 <strong>won't</strong> have an <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=interactive-shell#interactive-shell">interactive shell</a>.
That requires a binding to GNU readline, which isn't hard, but it will take
time.</li>
<li>It won't have <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/10/10.html">completion builtins</a>, which require a
nontrivial translation due to our use of Python's <code>yield</code>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="making-the-project-sustainable"></a>
<h2>Making the Project Sustainable</h2>
<p>I've been working on Oil for over 4 years!  I considered it <strong>an experiment</strong>
for most of that time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we write a compatible shell with a principled architecture?  The Unix
shell is <strong>never going away</strong>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> codebase has reached a dead
end.</li>
<li>Can we <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2019/02/07.html">use algorithms</a> that are more clearly correct,
rather than groveling through backslashes and braces one at a time in C?</li>
<li>Can we turn this compatible shell into something more like Python or
JavaScript?  Let's make shell <strong>easier to learn</strong> and more powerful.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the progress in 2019 and 2020, I'm confident that <strong>the answer is yes</strong>.
There's no risk of failing to deliver 0.8 and 0.9 — it's just work.</p>
<p>And <strong>with enough people</strong> working on the project, I'd argue there's no risk to
Oil 1.0 or Oil 2.0 either.  However, even though 30+ people have contributed
code to Oil, I'd estimate that 90% of the code has been touched <strong>only by me</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to change that.  Here are some posts that address "project
sustainability".</p>
<a name="how-can-oil-be-useful-before-its-complete"></a>
<h3>How Can Oil Be Useful Before It's Complete?</h3>
<p>The lack of real Oil usage has been bugging me for a long time, and I've
mentioned it when <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2019/12/09.html#help-wanted">soliciting help</a>.  I
don't have a solid answer to this, so I'm <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/hueuuq/oil_summer_2020_blog_roadmap/">interested in your
ideas</a>.</p>
<p>Outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Can Oil Add Value Without an Interactive Shell?
<ul>
<li>Because the interactive shell will remain in Python beyond 2020, I want Oil
to be useful in some other way in the short term.  I think tracing and
debugging of continuous builds is one possibility, and it's one that we can
"dogfood".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ct9kgg/oil_0_8_pre6_pure_bash_c#c_6tijzi">It's not surprising that the experience of using Oil is
"raw"</a>.  A gap
needs to be bridged, and I can't do that alone.  Users waiting around for a
new shell <strong>will be disappointed</strong>.</li>
<li>My <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/bash-completion/">fork of bash-completion</a>
has languished for 18 months.  I still use it on every Oil release, but
nobody else does!</li>
</ul>

<a name="how-to-rewrite-oil-in-nim-c-d-or-rust-or-c"></a>
<h3>How to Rewrite Oil in Nim, C++, D, or Rust (or C)</h3>
<p>Last week, I got a mail from a reader Andrew who's rewriting Oil in the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim
language</a>!  This is great, as I believe in the power of
<strong>parallel open source development</strong>.</p>
<p>I'd like to spread the knowledge of shell implicit in Oil, and independent
implementations are a great way to do that.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, there are 4 possible levels of reuse:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reuse the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.pre8/source-code.wwz/_devbuild/gen/id.h">list of syntactic ID
elements</a>.
This is a hard-won list of 300 or so things a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>-compatible shell
needs to handle!</li>
<li>Reuse <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.pre8/source-code.wwz/_devbuild/tmp/osh-lex.re2c.h">the generated
lexer</a>,
which is pure C and can be integrated into any language.  This will save a
huge amount of "groveling through backslashes and braces", i.e. what
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> does with ~10,000 lines of hand-written C code.</li>
<li>Reuse the ASDL schemas, like
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.pre8/source-code.wwz/frontend/syntax.asdl">frontend/syntax.asdl</a>.
In some sense, this is the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> definition.</li>
<li>Reuse the entire architecture of the Oil interpreter, which uses <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dependency-inversion#dependency-inversion">dependency
inversion</a> of state and I/O.  (For example, it
doesn't constantly save and restore global variables like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> does.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Addendum: Rob Landley and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=toybox#toybox">toybox</a> should reuse some of this knowledge.
He says he's been working on a bash-compatible shell on and off since 2006!
And he has expressed doubt about finishing it, so sharing knowledge only makes
sense.  However I'm not sure if we can communicate on the same wavelength.</p>

<a name="accepting-donations-for-a-technical-writer"></a>
<h3>Accepting Donations for a Technical Writer</h3>
<p>Last year, I was <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/c63ies/is_there_a_patreon/">asked if I accept donations for the
project</a>.
My answer was <strong>no</strong>, because Oil is still an <strong>experiment</strong>.  (In other words,
I wanted to be able to abandon the project at any moment without guilt.)</p>
<p>However, I now think the experiment is <strong>succeeding</strong>.  It feels like the
codebase is "just on the edge" of being a significant advance over <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
the most widely deployed shell in the world.</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.pre8/doc/">the documentation</a> is not close to
being done</strong>.  And I think attracting contributors to docs is harder than
attracting contributors to the code.</p>
<p>So I'd like to solicit donations to hire a technical writer for Oil's
documentation.  I'm not sure when I will do this.  I don't really want to be an
administrator, but it seems necessary.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate advice from anyone who has raised enough money to pay someone.
I imagine that this is around 6 months of full time work.
(E-mail me or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/hueuuq/oil_summer_2020_blog_roadmap/">leave a comment</a>.)</p>
<a name="some-kind-of-teaching-mentoring"></a>
<h3>Some Kind of Teaching / Mentoring</h3>
<p>I posted <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/5xfwza/how_write_technical_posts_so_people_will#c_esqjtw">an offer to edit technical writing on
lobste.rs</a>.
I can imagine something in this vein to on-board contributors to Oil, but I'm
not sure what it would look like.</p>
<p>Though a major problem with this model is that it sets me up as some kind of
authority, whereas I'd really like people to tell me <strong>what I'm doing wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>There have been multiple contributors, including Koiche Murase and Josh Nelson,
who have fixed things that surprised me.  And Crestwave has done a lot of
difficult debugging on codebases I'm unfamiliar with.</p>
<p>In addition, our <code>.travis.yml</code> was contributed a few years ago, before I knew
anything about <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>.  It's gradually turned into
a useful and functional <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/03/release-0.8.pre3.html">continuous build</a>, of
course written in shell.  (As of the last release, it runs the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ble.sh#ble.sh">ble.sh</a>
test suite and the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> translation of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-native#oil-native">oil-native</a>).</p>
<a name="advocacy-for-unix-shell-and-oil"></a>
<h2>Advocacy for Unix Shell and Oil</h2>
<p>I did a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/31.html">good job of advocacy</a> at the beginning of the
project, but haven't had time for it lately.  Here are some more ideas.</p>

<a name="the-unix-shell-should-evolve-like-perl-5"></a>
<h3>The Unix Shell Should Evolve Like Perl 5</h3>
<p>This is a post derived from these links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ccczjr/announcing_perl_7">Announcing Perl 7</a> (lobste.rs)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wPMh-3qYJM">Getting Better, not Getting By</a>
by Sawyer X (YouTube video)</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary and analogies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python has <code>from __future__</code> to introduce new features.</li>
<li>Perl has <code>use strict</code> and more, but they don't change the defaults.  A key
point that Sawyer X makes is that when you're using Perl 5, <strong>by default</strong>
you're using a language with 15+ year-old misfeatures.</li>
<li>Ditto with shell.  Bash has <code>shopt</code>, but by default you're using a language
with <strong>30-year-old misfeatures</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, Oil has <code>shopt -s oil:basic</code> and <code>shopt -s oil:all</code>.</p>
<a name="why-use-oil"></a>
<h3>Why Use Oil?</h3>
<p>I need to <strong>explain Oil from scratch</strong> again.  Recent progress on the
implementation has made it more clear what Oil is and what it isn't.  Draft on
the wiki:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Why-Use-Oil%3F">Why Use Oil?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I want to condense those points and put them boldly and clearly on the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">Oil
home page</a>.</p>
<a name="oil-starts-fewer-processes-than-other-shells"></a>
<h3>Oil Starts Fewer Processes Than Other Shells</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/04/comics.html">comics post back in April</a> alluded to this result, but
I never published/explained it.  This is mainly because I wanted to gather data
on real shell scripts in the wild.  For now, you can see the benchmarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.pre8/test/other.wwz/syscall/by-code.txt">syscall/by-code.txt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.pre8/test/other.wwz/syscall/by-input.txt">syscall/by-input.txt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Summary: Across several dozen test cases, Oil starts fewer processes than every
shell except the uncommon <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/index.html.en">yash</a> shell.  I
could have optimized it more, but I didn't want to game the benchmark.</p>
<p>For context, I want Oil to be faster than <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and other shells along three
dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parsing.  This <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/parser-benchmarks.html">has been achieved</a>, although
changing the memory allocation strategy will affect the results.</li>
<li>Running programs that do computation without I/O, like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/10/10.html">autocompletion
scripts</a>.</li>
<li>Running programs that do a lot of I/O, like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">building Linux
distros</a>.</li>
</ol>
<a name="whats-next"></a>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>I outlined 8 or 9 posts here, but there are still two more with
#<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=blog-topics#blog-topics">blog-topics</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">Eggex</a> and "regular languages", i.e. computer
science theory.</li>
<li>Comments on C++ and native code.  And maybe on the connection between <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/blog/what-is-shared-hosting/">shared
hosting</a> and shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I publish those, I'll write the plan for Oil 0.8 and 0.9.</p>
<p>Let me know what you're thinking <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/hueuuq/oil_summer_2020_blog_roadmap/">in the comments</a>!</p>

<p>The Rolling Stones made famous the saying, “you can’t always get what you want.” You can, however, almost always get what you need. Most human needs, in fact, we regularly satisfy without ever having the need to even think about them. Others may require minimal thinking but have become somewhat autonomous habits such as remembering to eat and drink. Because they are so easily satisfied, most people do not spend a lot of time thinking about human needs, because for the most part, we do not need to. But I am not most people.</p>



<p>Recently, I have spent some time thinking about the fundamental human needs. I am more generally using my freedom of time at home to think about the things that I want to do, and I figured better than beginning with my wants, I should start with my needs. I know that they must all be reasonably satisfied given that I am continuing to live, but I thought it might be useful to ensure my needs are covered not only to a satisfactory level, but to an optimal one.</p>



<p>The best list of human needs which I have come across is laid out by Albert Wenger in his exceptional book titled, <a href="http://worldaftercapital.org/"><em>World After Capital</em>.</a> That is the list that I used in thinking about optimizing the satisfaction of my own human needs, and that is the list that I will be sharing with you today.</p>



<p>For the time being, I have accepted the eleven human needs to be oxygen, water, calories, nutrients, discharge, temperature, pressure, light, healing, learning, and meaning. There are a few common questions that I have responded to in discussing this list and I have included examples of those questions and answers as follows:</p>



<p>Question 1: Aren’t calories and nutrients basically the same thing? Do we really need both?</p>



<p>Answer 1: Calories and nutrients are not the same. Calories are “the units of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 °C” and nutrients are “substances that provides nourishment essential for growth and the maintenance of life”, according to Google at least. We need both because if you got all of your nutrients in pills and powders but did not consume the minimum number of calories to survive you would eventually die of starvation. On the other hand, if you had plenty of calories but very poor nutrition you might end up like the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/british-teenager-went-blind-from-eating-only-fries-and-chips-doctors-say-warning-over-junk-food-caused-malnutrition/">British teenager who ate strictly chips and fries until he went blind</a>. Malnutrition may not kill humans as quickly as starvation but sufficed to say it will catch up with us eventually and most people understand that. That is why we need both calories and nutrients.</p>



<p>Question 2: What is discharge and why do we need it?</p>



<p>Answer 2: Discharge defines a category of human functions that includes exhaling carbon dioxide and both numbers one and two in the bathroom. Without those basic human functions, unless one believes certain claims about The Supreme Leader of North Korea, humans cannot survive.</p>



<p>Question 3: Why do we need learning?</p>



<p>Answer 3: Without learning, we as individuals never would have figured out how to walk or talk. It is easy to see how someone who knew absolutely nothing would not be able to last very long in this world, and to know anything, we need to learn.</p>



<p>After considering some of these needs on my own and responding to some of the questions above among others, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt as a working list of all human needs. I could not think of any others to add. Money, for example, we do not need so long as we have satisfactory food, water, basic healthcare to provide necessary healing, and shelter and/or sufficient clothing to allow our bodies to maintain a necessary range of temperature. If you have another idea, I encourage you to please send it to me in an email with your argument to jake@blogofjake.com.</p>



<p>Once I became satisfied with the list, I started to check off the ones that were more passively satisfied and either could not be further optimized or that I did not desire to further optimize. These included discharge, temperature, pressure, light, and healing. I figured I could try to dress more appropriately to the weather as I often find myself not doing, and I could probably do some more work to ensure I have access to the best healthcare providers available, but I figured if I got to a point where I needed the best healing, I would prioritize that, and if I dressed more appropriately, well maybe I would get a cold or two less every few years and save myself some temporary temperaturary discomfort, but these did not seem like very significant improvements, so I considered their respective categories to be passively optimized for now.</p>



<p>The remaining categories include oxygen, water, calories, nutrients, learning, and meaning. These, I believe, are more worthwhile to think about, but to varying degrees. Oxygen, for example, we clearly get enough of through passively breathing, otherwise we would die. That said, even though breathing is a mostly unconscious activity, I imagine it can be improved with consistent, conscious practice. Mediation and breathing exercises have a number of other purported benefits as well and so as a result of my analysis of needs I gained some further conviction in my belief that it is worthwhile for me to experiment with these types of practices to find one that works well for me. In doing so, I can improve my breathing on average, even if the vast majority of it remains unchanged, as I will at the very least be improving about 10 minute per day, about 5 days per week.</p>



<p>I approached this list of needs with a goal in mind of picking the single priority need that I wanted to improve upon, and had I done this exercise four months ago, I believe that I would have chosen meaning. If we accept the assumption that meaning is a human need, we all must have enough of it to keep living, but there is a big difference between the minimal amount of meaning required to keep living and a greater level of meaning with which we can feel a deep sense of purpose as our status quo or our modus operandi or whatever you want to call the way we feel normally most of the time during most of our days. I believe that we all have some idea about what our purpose is and what gives us a sense of meaning but some of us have spent less time thinking about it, attempting to define it, and iterating upon it in comparison to others. I never had done any of that myself until several months ago when I came to find that my purpose, as best as I could define it, ended up being pretty close to a quote that I had already included at the bottom of my resume for a number of years before that. I somehow knew that this quote captured who I was enough to include it as the lone quote on my resume, but I would not have been able to connect it if you had asked me in a given moment to tell you what my purpose was, not before four months ago at least. Today I can, and I fully expect this purpose will be iterated upon and maybe even change completely over the course of my lifetime, but for now it goes something like this, “to understand how the world works and what the future holds, to communicate that understanding through writing and conversation, and to invest my time and money in ways that will make the world a better place.” Sure, it may sound somewhat idealistic, but yours probably will too. A greater sense of purpose and meaning is somewhat idealistic by definition, but since we need it as humans, we might as well find one that sounds best to us, rather than just going with whatever anyone else seems to be living for.</p>



<p>If I had done this same exercise in looking at this list of needs three months ago, I would likely have chosen calories &amp; nutrition as the one that I most wanted to improve upon addressing. I have long believed that optimizing calories and nutrition could lead to a healthier life with a better probability of a longer one too. Up until three months ago, I had only experimented with a number of programs and strategies including periodically going gluten-free or gluten-light as well as several months in spurts of intermittent fasting, more often on weekdays than weekends. Three months ago I got lucky and sort of stumbled upon a few reasons in short sequence that made a vegan diet seem somewhat intriguing to me for the first time. As a result, in mid-January I started practicing a gluten-free vegan diet with intermittent fasting during the week (now Monday up until dinner on Friday) with extremely nutritious smoothies to break each fast and a freedom to eat absolutely whatever I want whenever I want from Friday dinner through Sunday night for the weekends, with the added flexibility to make exceptions once in a while during the week if I am going out to dinner which I typically try to limit to Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/21/the-gluten-free-vegan-diet-intermittent-fasting-and-green-smoothies/">This program</a> has worked phenomenally well for me and I have no desire to change it as of now. It feels optimized for an excellent balance of health and happiness and it is one of the best fundamental changes I have made in recent memory. It has only been about 3 months now since I started, but I do not expect to be changing much in the way of my general approach to calories and nutrition anytime soon.</p>



<p>At this point, I have now covered oxygen, meaning, calories, and nutrition. For those who are following along, the two remaining needs on the non-passive side of the list are water and learning. Again, I am clearly satisfying both of these needs, but on both of them I do believe I could do significantly better and, of course, benefit from doing so. Learning is something that I am actively working on but in terms of progress I think I am closer to where I was a year ago with nutrition and calories than where I am now. I finally broke the dam of the podcast world this year and listening to them while running in particular is now one of my favorite things to do. I have also come to appreciate the value of Twitter while also coming to appreciate the negative value of too much of it. I have …</p></div></div>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)<a href="#frequently-asked-questions-faqs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Who made Ori?</strong></p>
<p>Ori was written by <a href="https://jamesmishra.com/">James Mishra</a> and incubated at <a href="https://neocrym.com/">Neocrym</a>, a record label that uses artificial intelligence to find and promote musicians. Neocrym heavily relies on Ori to make their I/O-bound Python code run faster.</p>
<p>The source code for Ori is owned by Neocrym Records Inc, but licensed to Ori under the MIT License.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I use Ori over directly interfacing with concurrent.futures?</strong></p>
<p>The Python module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html">concurrent.futures</a> was introduced as a high-level abstraction over lower-level interfaces like <cite>threading.Thread</cite> and <cite>multiprocessing.Process</cite>. However, <cite>concurrent.futures</cite> merely moves the problem away from managing threads or processes to managing <em>executors</em>. Ori has the ambitious goal of also abstracting away the executors–making multithreading or multiprocessing no harder than writing single-threaded code.</p>
<p><strong>Is Ori a good replacement for Python’s asyncio?</strong></p>
<p>For the hardcore <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html">asyncio</a> user, probably not. Ori is focused on providing high-level abstractions over Python’s  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html">concurrent.futures</a> module that provides speed boosts for synchronous, I/O-bound Python.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to know to contribute to Ori?</strong></p>
<p>Ori manages itself with the Python packaging tool <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. You can install Poetry on your system with:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>pip3 install poetry
poetry install
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To check that your changes to Ori’s codebase match our coding standards, and to reformat any errant code to meet our standards, run this command:</p>

<p>To run Ori’s unit tests in the Python virtualenv created by Poetry, just run:</p>

<p>We can also run tests across multiple versions of Python with <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Tox</a>, but it requres your system has <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a> installed. If so, just run:</p>

<p><strong>Where did the name “Ori” come from?</strong></p>
<p>The name “Ori” is a reference to the god-like villains in the Stargate TV shows. There is no meaningful connection between the villains or concurrency.</p>

July 21, 2020 | https://mlu.red/muse/53769066310.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mlu.red/muse/53769066310.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>I've been writing some papers lately, and one thing that has bugged me is how many different formatting styles have resorted to (LastName et al) for inline citations. Not only is this problematic when authors contribute equally, but there aren't that many last names in the world. Surely there are bound to be many collisions, perhaps even within a paper? I myself just cited two different Klines for a recent paper.</p>

<p>Then, while musing, I figured that perhaps the acronym of the paper's title could serve as a more unique identifier instead of just the lead author's last name. For example, if Victoria Wang wrote a paper called Discovering A New Prime, we'd use (DANP) instead of (Wang) as an inline citation. Perhaps this is obvious to you already. Of course, the next thing to do is to empirically verify this.</p>

<p>I found this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/neelshah18/arxivdataset">great dataset on Kaggle</a> which contains around 40,000 papers related to AI/CV from Arxiv, along with the author information, title, and abstract. From there, I wrote some <a href="https://github.com/owenshen24/Acronym-vs-Surname">basic code</a> to compare the distributions of title acronyms versus surnames.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The first thing that seems important to look at is what proportion of papers would be "collisions", i.e. papers that would have the same identifier, if we were to use either the paper's title acronym versus the last name of the first author.</p>

<p>Turns out, lots of people have the same last name:</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/pie-chart-surname.png" alt="chart showing that 21% of papers have no collisions"></p>

<p>Under the typical schema of using the last name of the first author, we find that only 20.9% of papers would be uniquely identified. (I realize this would be a lot higher if we also used the date of publication, or additional authors, but please indulge me for now.)</p>

<p>The outlook is significantly better if we use acronyms:</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/pie-chart-title.png" alt="chart showing that 98.2% of papers have no collisions"></p>

<p>Here, we find that 98.2% of all papers would have a unique acronym, if we based it off of the title.</p>

<p>The next thing to look at is what the actual distribution of collisions looks like. Are there a few acronyms or surnames that many papers share (i.e. few collisions, high count for each), or is there a mix of many small coincidences (i.e. many collisions, low count for each)?</p>

<p>The distribution for last names is <em>very</em> fat-tailed:
<img src="https://mlu.red/images/distr-surname.png" height="1300"></p>

<p>What are those last names at the very bottom of the graph that have several hundred collisions? We'll get to those in a moment.</p>

<p>The distribution for acronyms is very tight:</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/distr-title.png" alt="chart showing not a fat tail"></p>

<p>Here, we see that there are very few collisions with many counts. Only one acronym has apparently 12 papers which share the same acronym, a far cry from the several hundred if we use last names.</p>

<p>Now that we've seen the shape of our data, we might be interested in what those extreme values are. I've compiled the 10 most frequently seen last names in the table below:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Last Name</th>
<th>Count</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Wang</td>
<td>766</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zhang</td>
<td>663</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Li</td>
<td>653</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chen</td>
<td>536</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Liu</td>
<td>482</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yang</td>
<td>262</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Xu</td>
<td>253</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wu</td>
<td>220</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zhu</td>
<td>187</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>We'll do the same for the acronym data:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Acronym</th>
<th>Count</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>POTTCOUIAI</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SC</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>POTFCOUIAI</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>POTSCOUIAI</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CF</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CC</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CP</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CB</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BS</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Once again, we notice that even at the most extreme, these collisions have very few counts. But what's up with that really long acronym, the POT__COUIAI, which shows up in a few different guises? It turns out that those are all from the journal <em>Proceedings of the Xth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial
  Intelligence</em>. So it's less about some mystic convergence in titles and more about the fact that the papers on Arxiv also include journals.</p>

<p>As for the other ones, we notice that they're all two word titles, which makes it a lot more likely for collisions to happen, so that's not too surprising. Several examples of "SC" papers include <em>Statistical Constraints</em>, <em>Sequencing Chess</em>, and <em>Stereoscopic Cinema</em>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I think many people would have found my hypothesis likely at the start. After all, last names have to follow many human constraints, like having a mix of vowels and consonants, whereas the constraints on titles are a lot looser. As I alluded to earlier, I've sort of stacked the deck against the last name identifier method. Adding in the publication year, the first name, or additional authors, will all greatly decrease the chance of collisions.</p>

<p>Still, I think this can still lead to some confusion, especially as there's a lot of baggage related to one's last name. (EX: I might mistake Klein 2004 and Klein 1996 as being from the same author, or that Jon Krakauer is related to John Krakauer.)</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that acronyms are really an ideal solution, as many of them are not very pronounceable. But I do think this should push us to think about better ways to refer to scientific papers.</p>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>

    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_2.png">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_28_d21">

<div>
<p>Apple’s product release strategy is best described as carefully delayed, a planned release process that often prioritises product quality over a first to market advantage. We saw this with the Apple watch which officially released in 2016, 7 years after Fitbit’s initial launch – but now accounts for more than 50% of the global smartwatch market and is close to four times larger than Samsung, its closest competitor in Q1 of 2020. As Apple pushes back its release date for its VR headset and AR glasses to 2022 and 2023 on the grounds of further development, we see Apple delaying product release once again. But ‘carefully delayed’ is a more complex decision at closer inspection and so a pertinent question to ask is whether Apple would release these products today, even if the products themselves were ready to launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would think not. Apple’s broader ecosystem and formidable brand trust is enough of an anchor for its intentional second-mover strategy. A strategy that lets product release coincide with two significant market-defining forces when it comes to consumer tech products – use case adoption and hardware distribution. This is particularly applicable for AR/VR as it struggles to find the uptrend it was predicted (rather optimistically) to reach years ago.&nbsp; AR/VR product releases that have previously rushed to market in an attempt to gain first-mover advantage read as a litany of failed attempts, Google glasses and Oculus headsets to name a few. Apple is more likely to wait till the AR/VR market is able to produce meaningful applications and distribute hardware effectively before it takes the risk of disrupting its own ecosystem stability – a calculated delay then, doesn’t seem so far fetched. We can break this down as:</p>



<p><strong>The use-case problem – Qualities of network effect&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Games have been considered the best initial AR/VR use case to create and distribute, and while several of these already exist they aren’t able to pervade a broader consumer base. Apple’s smartwatch dominated the market through its ability to create daily touchpoints with all of its customers, integrating it into the consumer’s life. AR/VR would require a similar level of utility, one that augmented but also improved daily habits and experiences.</p>



<p><strong>Solving the hardware problem – Qualities of distribution</strong></p>



<p>Distribution of physical AR/VR tech would be most effective for an established hardware ecosystem that could whittle down the friction points of distribution through a user base that is accustomed to a hardware-centric customer experience. Apple is a no brainer, its hardware has been a focal point for its customers since the design innovations of the Mac and iPhone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparatively, Facebook even with their acquisition of Oculus is not an effective hardware distributor, where the primary experience for users in their ecosystem is digital-first (social media) and hardware barely registers as a requirement. Here, the hardware distribution seems at odds with the ecosystem experience – this makes it a less congruous point of sale, but the independent branding under Oculus and Facebook’s own use case propagation (Facebook Horizon) ensures it’s not impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple’s ecosystem thrives on a mutual trust that exists between its customers and itself, a belief that the hardware released into the Apple ecosystem will only be done at a point at which it enhances the user’s experience. Here the distribution advantage is weighed down by the use case problem.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why Apple might prefer to wait for adoption, rather than create it.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Can Apple be the catalyst for adoption rather than leveraging an uptrend?</p>



<p>They likely don’t want to, or need to take on the role of propagating adoption. The main objective of waiting would be to avoid the dilution of their existing ecosystem with a product that may not be received well. In 2019 Apple cancelled a wireless charger project called Airpower which it had announced two years earlier, citing that the product did not meet their high hardware requirements. The objective was for any apple device to be placed on any point on the charging surface, requiring multiple layers that overheated the product. This was one of few such incidents over Apple’s history, and while Apple could’ve likely released single device wireless chargers it chose not to. It’s for the very same reason that Apple is more likely to&nbsp;</p>



<p>fine tune its AR/VR technology until it sees a timely entry into the market, where its offering appears (like previous products such as the smartwatch and air pods) far ahead of the competition despite a delayed entry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The intentional second-mover strategy can be seen across many of its products including the rumoured blueprints of an Apple flip phone, the latest smartphone ‘trend’ ushered in by Samsung’s release earlier this year – whether this blueprint ever sees the light of day though, likely hinges on the concept’s provable success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Apple’s mindshare: Premium lifestyle experiences</h3>



<p>Apple can be thought of as a gatekeeper of lifestyle experiences, being ‘distributors of premium lifestyle experiences’ defines their core appeal. They do this mainly through the tight control of the hardware and software through which the ecosystem can be accessed. Where Apple’s source of differentiation hinges on “expected lifestyle experience”, the second mover strategy is its way of compounding and propagating its point of differentiation without risking the mindshare it has cultivated. As the organisation expands in an increasingly competitive consumer tech landscape though, maintaining ecosystem balance and remaining cutting edge becomes a trickier act. Apple will have to tread carefully to ensure its second-mover strategy doesn’t ever manifest into brand lethargy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to AR/VR adoption, we have a chicken and egg problem. Use case or hardware distribution, how does one happen without the other? It is only a matter of time though as technologists aim to catalyse adoption. For Apple, the catalyst looks like a core user base who will adopt new tech to interface with its ecosystem and experiences. For a less hardware-driven company like Facebook it will more likely be its social capital pushing Horizon as the use case that drives Oculus headset sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is an ongoing series of posts on ELF Binary Relocations and Thread
Local Storage.  This article covers only Thread Local Storage and assumes
the reader has had a primer in ELF Relocations, if not please start with
my previous article <em>ELF Binaries and Relocation Entries</em>.</p>

<p>This is the third part in an illustrated 3 part series covering:</p>

  <li>How Relocations and Thread Local Store are implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last article we covered how Thread Local Storage (TLS) works at runtime,
but how do we get there?  How does the compiler and linker create the memory
structures and code fragments described in the previous article?</p>

<p>I will assume here that most people understand what a compiler and assembler
basically do.  In the sense that compiler will compile routines
written C code or something similar to assembly language.  It is then up to the
assembler to turn that assembly code into machine code to run on a CPU.</p>

<p>That is a big part of what a toolchain does, and it’s pretty much that simple if
we have a single file of source code.  But usually we don’t have a single file,
we have the multiple files, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_library">c runtime</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0">crt0</a> and other libraries like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">libc</a>.  These all need to be
put together into our final program, that is where the complexities of the
linker comes in.</p>

<p>In this article I will cover how variables in our source code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table">symbols</a>) traverse
the toolchain from code to the memory in our final running program.  A picture that looks
something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://stffrdhrn.github.io/content/2020/relocs-gccf2b.png" alt="GCC and Linker"></p>

<h2 id="the-compiler">The Compiler</h2>

<p>First we start off with how relocations are created and emitted in the compiler.</p>

<p>As I work primarily on the GNU <a href="https://elinux.org/Toolchains">toolchain</a> with
it’s GCC compiler we will look at that, let’s get started.</p>

<h3 id="gcc-legitimize-address">GCC Legitimize Address</h3>

<p>To start we define a <strong>symbol</strong> as named address in memory.  This address can be
a program variable where data is stored or function reference to where a
subroutine starts.</p>

<p>In GCC we have have <code>TARGET_LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS</code>, the OpenRISC implementation
being <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/releases/gcc-10.1.0/gcc/config/or1k/or1k.c#L841">or1k_legitimize_address()</a>.
It takes a symbol (memory address) and makes it usable in our CPU by generating RTX
sequences that are possible on our CPU to load that address into a register.</p>

<p>RTX represents a tree node in GCC’s register transfer language (RTL).  The RTL
Expression is used to express our algorithm as a series of register transfers.
This is used as register transfer is basically what a CPU does.</p>

<p>A snippet from <code>legitimize_address()</code> function is below.  The argument <code>x</code>
represents our input symbol (memory address) that we need to make usable by our
CPU.  This code uses GCC internal API’s to emit RTX code sequences.</p>

<p>We can read the code snippet above as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is for the non <code>TLS</code> case as we see <code>TLS_MODEL_NONE</code>.</li>
  <li>We reserve a temporary register <code>t1</code>.</li>
  <li>If not using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code">Position-independent code</a> (<code>flag_pic</code>) we do:
    <ul>
      <li>Emit an instruction to put the <strong>high</strong> bits of <code>x</code> into our temporary register <code>t1</code>.</li>
      <li>Return the sum of <code>t1</code> and the <strong>low</strong> bits of <code>x</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise if the symbol is static (<code>is_local</code>) we do:
    <ul>
      <li>Mark the global state that this object file uses the <code>uses_pic_offset_table</code>.</li>
      <li>We create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Offset_Table">Global Offset Table</a> offset variable <code>t2</code>.</li>
      <li>Emit an instruction to put the <strong>high</strong> bits of <code>t2</code> (the GOT offset) into out temporary register <code>t1</code>.</li>
      <li>Emit an instruction to put the sum of <code>t1</code> (<strong>high</strong> bits of <code>t2) and the GOT into </code>t1`.</li>
      <li>Return the sum of <code>t1</code> and the <strong>low</strong> bits of <code>t1</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You may have noticed that the <strong>local</strong> symbol still used the <strong>global</strong> offset
table (<a href="http://bottomupcs.sourceforge.net/csbu/x3824.htm">GOT</a>).  This is
because Position-idependent code requires using the GOT to reference symbols.</p>

<p>An example, from <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/tls-examples/blob/master/nontls.c">nontls.c</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>get_x_addr</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>return</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Example of the <em>non pic case</em> above, when we look at the assembly code generated by GCC
we can see the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	.file	<span>"nontls.c"</span>

<p>Example of the <em>local pic case</em> above the same code compiled with the <code>-fPIC</code> GCC option
looks like the following:</p>

<p>TLS and Addend cases are also handled by <code>or1k_legitimize_address()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="gcc-print-operand">GCC Print Operand</h3>

<p>Once RTX is generated by legitimize address and <a href="https://stffrdhrn.github.io/software/embedded/openrisc/2018/06/03/gcc_passes.html">GCC passes</a>
run all of their optimizations the RTX needs to be printed out as assembly code.  During
this process relocations are printed by GCC macros <code>TARGET_PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</code>
and <code>TARGET_PRINT_OPERAND</code>.  In OpenRISC these defined
by <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/releases/gcc-10/gcc/config/or1k/or1k.c#L1139">or1k_print_operand_address()</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/releases/gcc-10/gcc/config/or1k/or1k.c#L1193">or1k_print_operand()</a>.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at <code>or1k_print_operand_address()</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* Worker for TARGET_PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS.

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above code snippet can be read as we explain below, but let’s first
make some notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The input RTX <code>addr</code> for <code>TARGET_PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</code> will usually contain
a register and an offset typically this is used for <strong>LOAD</strong> and <strong>STORE</strong>
operations.</li>
  <li>Think of the RTX <code>addr</code> as a node in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a>.</li>
  <li>The RTX node with code <code>REG</code> and <code>SYMBOL_REF</code> are always leaf nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>With that, and if we use the <code>or1k_print_operand_address()</code> c comments above as examples
of some RTX <code>addr</code> input we will have:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    RTX     |    (reg:SI 3)          (lo_sum:SI (reg:SI 3) (symbol_ref:SI("x")))
 -----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------
    TREE    |
   (code)   |  (code:REG regno:3)                (code:LO_SUM)
   /    \   |                                      /        \
  (0)   (1) |                         (code:REG regno:3)  (code:SYMBOL_REF "x")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can now read the above snippet as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>First</strong> get the <code>CODE</code> of the RTX.
    <ul>
      <li>If <code>CODE</code> is <code>REG</code> (a register) than our offset can be <code>0</code>.</li>
      <li>If <code>IS</code> is <code>LO_SUM</code> (an addition operation) then we need to break it down to:
        <ul>
          <li>Arg <code>0</code> is our new <code>addr</code> RTX (which we assume is a register)</li>
          <li>Arg <code>1</code> is an offset (which we then print with <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/releases/gcc-10/gcc/config/or1k/or1k.c#L1085">print_reloc()</a>)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Second</strong> print out the register name now in <code>addr</code> i.e. “r3”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The code of <code>or1k_print_operand()</code> is similar and the reader may be inclined to
read more details.  With that we can move on to the assembler.</p>

<p>TLS cases are also handled inside of the <code>print_reloc()</code> function.</p>

<h2 id="the-assembler">The Assembler</h2>

<p>In the GNU Toolchain our assembler is GAS, part of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">binutils</a>.</p>

<p>The code that handles relocations is found in the function
<a href="https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/binutils-2_34/opcodes/or1k-asm.c#L226">parse_reloc()</a>
found in <code>opcodes/or1k-asm.c</code>.  The function <code>parse_reloc()</code> is the direct counterpart of GCC’s <code>print_reloc()</code>
discussed above.  This is actually part of <a href="https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/binutils-2_34/opcodes/or1k-asm.c#L491">or1k_cgen_parse_operand()</a>
which is wired into our assembler generator CGEN used for parsing operands.</p>

<p>If we are parsing a relocation like the one from above <code>lo(x)</code> then we can
isolate the code that processes that relocation.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>bfd_reloc_code_real_type</span> <span>or1k_imm16_relocs</span><span>[][</span><span>6</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Starting a big project is tricky. I usually have some sense of what needs to be done, but my time estimates tend to be… a little off. There’s one thing worse than underestimating the time it’ll take: doing unnecessary work. I hate getting traction on a project only to realize that a bunch of work was wasted.</p>



<p>There’s a trick that often works for me: <strong>Rescope the project to complete it within the next week.</strong> Even when unrealistic, trying to apply that tight constraint can get you to notice things you wouldn’t otherwise. It forces me to consider what is absolutely necessary and what can be skipped. It forces me to spend one of my days planning so I know exactly what I need to execute.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s Law</a> states that <strong>a project takes as much time as you allow it</strong>. Once in a while, try allowing much less time than you think is necessary.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I’ve been writing Python for about eight years.</p>

<p>When you come from Java, Python is magic. You can get so much done in so little code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Java be like</span>
<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span>
    <span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Python be like
</span><span>', '</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>([</span><span>f"last: </span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span>[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]:.</span><span>2</span><span>f</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
          <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>()])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I think I was too confused as an undergrad to really appreciate Python.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> But at some point, I looked back at Java and just—yikes! So much typing to <em>do</em> anything.</p>

<h2 id="the-world-discovers-python">The world discovers Python</h2>
<p>Machine learning runs on Python.</p>

<p>Matlab and Julia were fighting the good fight back in 2012, and it sort of looked like anybody’s ball game. Back then, I picked numpy. Once deep learning exploded, the heavy hitters Tensorflow and Pytorch both chose Python as their interface.</p>

<p>And since then, it’s Python, all the way down. Absolute globs, scads, and mountains of Python.</p>

<p>I write this only to tell you why I still use Python—because it’s the only first-class citizen in machine learning.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="i-discover-typescript">I discover TypeScript</h2>
<p>During 2017 and 2018, I spent my free time writing TypeScript for a little game called <a href="https://maxwellforbes.com/posts/fallgate">Fallgate</a>. TypeScript is based on JavaScript, which everyone loves to hate, and so I was prepared to hate TypeScript.</p>

<p>But then the funniest thing happened. I actually had a really great time writing TypeScript.</p>

<h2 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The Elephant in the Room</h2>
<p>Yes, I was making a game with TypeScript, and attempting to do natural language processing (NLP) research with Python.</p>

<p>And yes, game programming, in my opinion, is a much more fun genre of <em>programming</em> than natural language processing.</p>

<p>Game programming has a stimulating feedback loop. When I built a new system for animation, lighting, particles, or movement, I’d immediately <em>see</em> the effects of the new feature. Plus, the actual code I wrote was interesting. The game programming centered around making real-time systems that efficiently managed interlocking behaviors for thousands of little game world entities. I got to try out new design patterns and play around in geometry, physics, and graphics.</p>

<p>On the other hand, programming for NLP research, I spend most of my time pushing big sludge piles of text data around. I scrape, annotate, clean, format, chunk, and batch text. I pour through text and find mountains of badly encoded files, non-linguistic junk like HTML, and of course, scads of idiots’ Internet blatherings—like this blog post! From a purely time-based perspective, I spend shockingly few hours actually building those cool neural network models everyone is excited about. And when I do, the models themselves were only a few dozen lines of code.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>But aside from the (admittedly large) difference in <em>what</em> I was doing, there was a qualitative difference in the feel of the activity of programming.</p>

<h2 id="joy">Joy</h2>
<p>Programming in TypeScript brought me joy. It was easy. I felt like I always had a better handle on what options were available to me. I also felt more confidence about what was going to happen when my code ran.</p>

<p>Only through this contrast of using both languages in the same day did I realize how little joy I got from Python.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Why does it matter if Python sparks joy? When I first chose this headline, I thought it was funny. Now that I’m actually writing this, I’m becoming convinced it might be quite serious. We pour hundreds of the precious hours of our only life into our work. Seeking joy in the day to day, minute-to-minute experience of programming might be one of the more important things we can do.</p>

<p>What follows is a few posts in which I share my attempts to spark joy of Python back into my life. The first one is about static typing. I think it is the most important factor.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h3>
<p><strong>Familiarity</strong> — I’m assuming in these posts you’re moderately familiar with writing Python code. For example, I assume you understand kinds of stuff like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why people dislike <code>from &lt;name&gt; import *&nbsp;</code></li>
  <li>What if <code>__name__ == "__main__"</code> does</li>
  <li>That list comprehensions are idiomatic</li>
  <li>What <code>virutalenv</code>s are and why people use them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unfamiliarity</strong> — I’m also assuming you’re not a Python expert. Maybe you’re someone who picked it up as your first or second language in the last year or two. If you know too much, you will probably think that what I write is obvious, wrong, or both.</p>

<p><strong>Solo coding</strong> — I realized after almost finishing a draft that some of these practices are geared towards effectively programming by yourself.</p>

<p>How much discipline is necessary in solo coding? I found that after I stopped working for Google, I over-engineered most things I wrote, because I thought that writing production code for a company was “good practice” in general, and that I would be a more effective grad student if I wrote the same kind of code for my research. Many grad students (at least stereotypically) swing far on the other side of the spectrum: writing super hacky, unreadable code that barely works through a publication submission.</p>

<p>The best approach, at least for me, is probably somewhere in the middle. I realized after a few years that speed of creation in research code trumps industrial robustness,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> but there were still a few habits that would minimize my own burden down the road.</p>

    <p>I recently became aware of Jeff Bezosâ€™s dotcom-era policy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730231457/https://blog.hirevue.com/sales/what-i-learned-from-jeff-bezos-about-sales-management">banning PowerPoint</a> within Amazon. Instead, meeting organizers must write a multi-page â€œnarrativeâ€� and distribute it to all attendees at the start of the meeting - denying any single person a head start - and only after everyone has finished reading do proceedings begin.</p>

<p>This policy is particularly notable as it finds itself embedded in a company staffed largely by software engineers, who often have neither experience nor interest in writing prose. We feel most at home when transmitting ideas as algorithms, unambiguously described by mathematics and sequences of instructions. And the further we stray from this the more discontent we feel as the ambiguities of natural language leak through, needlessly eroding clarity.</p>

<p>But on closer examination I believe this is neither about powerpoint nor about reading - itâ€™s about thinking. To see why we need to look beyond the headline.</p>

<p>If we could peer into Jeffâ€™s 2004-era outbox we would find his original email:</p>

<div><p>
From: Bezos, Jeff <br>
Sent: Wednesday, June 09, 2004 6:02PM <br>
To: [REDACTED] <br>
Subject: Re: No powerpoint presentations from now on at steam </p><p>

A little more to help with the question "why." <br>
Well structured, narrative text is what we're after rather than just text. If someone builds a list of bullet points in word, that would be just as bad as powerpoint. <br>
The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than "writing" a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how things are related. <br>
Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas. </p><p>

Jeff
</p></div>

<p>The point being made is clear from the language: â€œwritingâ€� is mentioned twice but â€œreadingâ€� not at all. Itâ€™s  <em>creation</em> which is important, not <em>consumption</em>. Even if the memo was written and immediately shredded, the act of writing would not be undone and the improvement to thought and understanding would persist.</p>

<p>Still, for a company trying to be <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/working/working-amazon">Earthâ€™s most customer-centric company</a>, it is hard to shake the feeling that time would be best spent interacting with, say, <em>customers</em>, rather than crafting narratives.</p>

<p>But Amazon is far from the first to recognise the value in the writing process. Some go even further:</p>

<blockquote cite="David McCullough">Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.</blockquote>

<p>And here I think itâ€™s worth digging even further to ask - why is thinking clearly important? <em>Obviously</em> - in our context of software engineering - if you donâ€™t think clearly then any solutions you craft as an individual will be suboptimal.</p>

<p>That is undoubtedly true. But more importantly, writing a coherent and logical narrative forces your thoughts into a shape which can be easily communicated to others and used to persuade. None of us work in isolation. There is little point in having the answer if you cannot convince others of its merit.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Letâ€™s imagine a team of engineers. Having just been informed of the firm-wide mandate to migrate from in-house servers to the cloud, they must make the impactful and long-lasting decision about which technology to introduce. In an attempt to reach consensus theyâ€™ve gathered around a pizza and begin exchanging views.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes guy <em>knows</em> that only his solution leads to a future free from tedious discussions around the solved problems of authentication and service discovery. Batteries must be included. Three slices to the right another engineer brims with confidence and espouses the virtues of Nomad - single-purpose, orthogonal and composable components are the <em>bedrock</em> of well-engineered software systems. Principles must come first.</p>

<p>After an hour of discussion bouncing from feature to feature to pro to con to bug to feature, everyone has learned something new. But no one is persuaded and no consensus has emerged. Though useful for knowledge exchange, such unstructured discussions are not an efficient mechanism for reaching agreement.</p>

<p>What is needed to break the stalemate is for a single individual<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> to spin a narrative which captures the journey from business need through to practicalities of implementation, in a comprehensive, flowing and logical manner. This would be persuasive - it would instill in others the confidence that this is not just the best technology in an abstract sense, itâ€™s the right choice for <em>our problem</em>, <em>our business</em>, and <em>our people</em> at <em>this point in time</em>.</p>

<p>It would be useful for others to read this. But even if they didnâ€™t, the newfound clarity of mind of the creator would allow them to make an argument persuasive enough to break the stalemate of ideas.</p>

<p>For this particular situation - the choice of a technology - the writer will likely have thought about and touched on:</p>

<p><strong>The beginning</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What were the underlying reasons for the decision to change technologies? Why is this worthwhile embarking on and what benefits will be seen?</li>
  <li>What reason do we have for investigating this particular tech as a solution? What other alternatives are worth investigating?</li>
  <li>How high are the stakes? Are we laying the foundations of the cathedral or painting the bike shed? Can we easily switch later if things arenâ€™t working out?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The middle</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Does the tech being suggested have a mission statement or core guiding principles? How does that tie in with our problem and philosophy?</li>
  <li>If we roll with it, whatâ€™s the end goal? When implementation is complete, what does the world look like?</li>
  <li>How might we get from where we are to where we want to be with minimal disruption? What might the transition period look like? How long, roughly?</li>
  <li>Do we have any existing in-house expertise?</li>
  <li>Are there any risks? What steps might we take to reduce them? Any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">unknown unknowns</a>?</li>
  <li>In what ways might this solution fare better than the alternative(s)?</li>
  <li>In what ways might the alternative(s) fare better than this?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The end</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Relate back to the underlying business needs and sum up with a recommendation, explaining why this the best option</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the content of the narrative would overlap substantially with a technical design document. But whereas a TDD is an end in itself, the physical output of this writing is a pleasant side-effect. What matters are the organised thoughts left in the mind of the author.</p>

<p>Having competently translated these thoughts into natural language once before, the author will have no trouble doing so again when called upon, orally and in real-time. And having considered the problem at several levels of analysis - as must be done to write well - they will, at a moments notice, be able to adapt their narrative to suit any audience, regardless of their existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Finally, unlike specialised tools, narratives are general. They scale. From the narrowest of technical issues up to the most fundamental question of the mission and purpose of the company as a whole, there are no problems which resist clear-thinking.</p>

<p>


This Classic Amiga game is available either on CD, floppy disks or as a download file.
<br>A basic Amiga 500 is sufficient to enjoy playing it, though more expanded 68k Amiga systems or a CD32 are also supported.
</p><p>
Climb like a snail on walls and ceilings to find the strawberry.
<br>As well as the standard difficulty level there's also a slightly easier playing option.
<br>For true snail veterans you can play in 'Salty' mode.
<br>The game is based on the Metroidvania genre. Find artifacts in four thematically diverse worlds and gain new skills to overcome obstacles.
</p><p>
However, Tiny Little Slug takes a different approach to its opponents, as you can't harm them, so you have to work out how to outwit them.
<br>Three big end bosses are waiting for you. Redirect their own power against them.

        <p><b>We’ve all seen the good QA director in their natural habitat, a creature who spends their time bathing in the light of an LED monitor, or perhaps gently lapping at a local coffee stream. But have you ever witnessed a <i>great</i> one?</b></p>
<p>If you have, you can consider yourself lucky. This endangered breed of QA director, with their boundless enthusiasm and an uncanny ability to nurture the young, is difficult to spot. But if we watch carefully, we can learn from their ways. And perhaps they will share with us knowledge that can make us better QA professionals.</p>
<p>How do you recognize these cryptids in the wild? This week on QA Safari: We identify the markings of the rare superb QA director and compare them with the merely good one.</p>
<h3>A good QA director: Begins work in the testing phase<br>
A great QA director: Begins work in the requirements phase</h3>
<p>A good QA director starts the job on the first day of <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-development-when-slow-and-steady-doesnt-win-the-race/">the testing phase</a> in the software development lifecycle. A great QA director? They’ve already been stalking their prey of bugs for weeks, if not months, to assure that users have a seamless experience.</p>
<p>An exceptional QA director begins their work “in the requirements phase,” says Sami Ullah, a former QA tester and current sales manager at <a href="https://www.kualitatem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kualitatem</a>. That way, “You’re making sure that the project is being built on quality principles.”</p>
<p>These principles include usability, resilience, and protecting the herd against predators.</p>
<p>A great QA director also thinks about the future. Kenny Trinh, editor of <a href="https://www.netbooknews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netbook News</a>, says, “They personally invest their own time in ensuring that future works will have better quality.” The apex QA director accomplishes this by creating their own documents or perhaps by coordinating with their superiors and training content creators.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Doesn’t plan ahead. </i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing_(animal_behavior)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Easily mobbed</i></a><i> by its own prey.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Can think like a QA director</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Can also think like a user</h3>
<p>Developers design company products based on user requirements. But do users or product owners <i>really</i> know what they want? As developers can tell you, usually through bared teeth, not always.</p>
<p>While a good QA director tests software and finds errors, a great one assures these errors never happen in the first place—by studying user requirements and discovering what’s missing. A great QA director looks at efficiency of a system early in the development process, feeding back usability issues to developers before they become un-usability issues.</p>
<p>This isn’t limited to computing woes. As John Moss, CEO of <a href="https://www.englishblinds.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">English Blinds</a> says, “A great QA director knows how to mitigate customer pain points and head them off effectively.” This means the user will have a better experience…and so will the client.</p>
<p>A top-notch QA director can draw from <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-testers-should-know-about-domain-knowledge/">a deep knowledge base about the problem domain</a> yet doesn’t lose sight of the user when stuck in the technical trenches. Just as a good hunter doesn’t lose sight of its prey.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Takes user requirements at face value, and that face has razor-sharp teeth.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Follows existing process to the letter</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Spots the flaws in company process</h3>
<p>Existing processes are there for a reason: They worked before, whether it’s for testing software or for using a mating call to attract a partner. But as even the animal kingdom knows, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Apply previous processes to your current testing case, and you may find your software has flaws and that you missed the window on mating season.</p>
<p>A good QA director follows standard operating procedures, but a great QA director’s operating procedures aren’t one-size-fits-all. According to Alex Kehoe, co-founder and operations director of web development firm <a href="https://caveni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caveni.com</a>, “A great QA director is someone who can spot the failings of current processes and facilitate the creation of new ones that are able to fix those shortcomings.”</p>
<p>If your team is missing obvious bugs, it’s time to look beyond the expected.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Misses bugs in favor of fine-tuning their mating call.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Takes charge</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Knows when to pass the reins to their team</h3>
<p>Just as two difference species can cooperate in the wild, a great QA director cooperates with their underlings. “Being a QA director requires trust in your team and confidence that they can complete projects and tasks without micromanaging,”&nbsp;says Sarah Franklin, co-founder of marketing firm <a href="https://bluetree.ai/">Blue Tree AI</a>.</p>
<p>This advice applies to most IT professions, but deserves special mention when it comes to QA directors: Micromanaging is a time-sucking process, and if QA doesn’t adhere to tight deadlines, they are culled from the herd.</p>
<p>The best QA directors teach newer team members and provide useful assistance. The wisdom they impart might include <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-mobile-testing-gotchas-you-need-to-know-about/">how to design tests for mobile devices</a>, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-deliver-a-technical-presentation-to-a-non-technical-audience/">how to prepare reports for management consumption</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaner_fish#Salmonid_aquaculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to nibble on parasitic sea lice</a>.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Pushes young competitors out of the herd.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Knows every inch of their tools</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Constantly improves their skill set</h3>
<p>As with every species on Earth, technology is constantly evolving. The tools a QA professional uses to test today aren’t the same tools they used five years ago. Logically, the tools a QA tester uses won’t be the same five years from now.</p>
<p>A good QA director may know their current tools and can troubleshoot for their team. A great QA director, however, can see the latest developments in testing software on the horizon. They’re even aware of the latest technologies, such as artificial intelligence, with its tricky-to-validate results.</p>
<p>As Ullah says, the best QA directors “keep on improving their skill set.”</p>
<p>So when your company begins a complex new project, the best QA director will be there, ready to implement testing tools that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-do-a-product-evaluation-for-enterprise-software/">they already researched, explored, priced out</a>. Who knows? Maybe they’re so skilled, they’ll eve discover fire.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Fails to evolve. Joins the passenger pigeon and the dodo as a footnote in natural history.</i></p>
<blockquote><p>What does it take to develop top-notch QA management skills? Perhaps your company needs a <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/why-your-enterprise-needs-a-cqo-chief-quality-officer/">Chief Quality Officer</a>.</p></blockquote>

			<p>Dashboard gives a graphical interface to visualize the key indicators and trends of your data. However, Creating Dashboard is always been a tedious task for developers</p>

<p>They have to wear a Front-end Dev hat for creating a Web Dashboard. Switching gears from python to Javscript/HTML is not what all developers prefer to do.</p>

<p>There are libraries like Plotly Dash, Bokeh in Python which let you generate a dashboard using python and even some people convert a Jupyter notebook into a dashboard</p>

<p>Somehow I didn’t find all these options really an easy available options to create a dashboard in Python so my Search for easy to use and a user friendly Library in pure python continues and Finally I found something much easier way to do that.</p>

<p>Yes, Streamlit which is recently gaining popularity in the Machine Learning and Data science world is a super easy library which is around to develop a dashboard in almost no time</p>

<p>The good part is that it comes with an in-built web server too and can be easily deployed inside a docker container.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will build a dashboard using COVID19 US Data. Here is the snapshot of the dashboard that you will see at the end of the tutorial</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/pydash_01.gif" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="collect-data-from-wikipedia">Collect data from Wikipedia</h2>

<p>We will use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States">wikipedia data</a> for this dashboard. Following are the two sets of data that you can download:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Last 15 days data of Covid-19 Cases in the United States data from 19th June 2020 to 7th July 2020 at the time of writing this article</li>

<p>We will download both these data in two csv files and rename as usa_covid_data_states.csv and usa_total_cases.csv</p>

<h2 id="installing-streamlit-and-creating-dashboard">Installing Streamlit and Creating Dashboard</h2>

<p>Streamlit can be installed using pip:</p>



<p>Now to start creating a dashboard let’s first create a simple python file main.py and import streamlit and add the Heading and paragraph at the dashboard start</p>

<p>We will also import pandas for reading the above two csv files created using the wikipedia data</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>streamlit</span> <span>as</span> <span>st</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="load-the-two-files-in-the-dataframe">Load the two files in the dataframe</h3>

<div><div><pre><code><span>csv_file_state</span> <span>=</span> <span>'usa_covid_data.csv'</span>

<h3 id="title-and-markdowns">Title and Markdowns</h3>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-02.png" alt="image-20200704143234887"></p>

<p>Streamlit has a number of ways to add text to your app. Let’s add a title out to Dashboard. We will also use markdown to add subtext or small paragraphs and write ups in our dashboard</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>(</span><span>"Covid19 USA Data from Wikipedia"</span><span>)</span>
<span>st</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span>
<span>"""
This app is for visualizing the Covid19 data for USA which is collected 
from the wikipedia site https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States.        
User can select the Metrics Type from the drop-down list to see the trend in last 15 days
"""</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dropdowns-in-streamlit">Dropdowns in Streamlit</h3>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-03.png" alt="image-20200704143256090"></p>

<p>We will add a dropdown for user to select the following trend and plot</p>

<ol>
  <li>Total Cases</li>
  <li>Deaths</li>
  <li>Recoveries</li>
</ol>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html#streamlit.selectbox"><code>st.selectbox</code></a> to choose from a series. You can write in the options you want, or pass through an array or data frame column.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span><span>"## "</span> <span>+</span> <span>'TotalCases/Deaths/Recoveries Trend'</span><span>)</span>	
<span>st</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span><span>"#### "</span> <span>+</span><span>"What Trends would you like to see?"</span><span>)</span>

<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="plot--charts-and-maps">Plot  Charts and Maps</h3>

<p>Streamlit supports several popular data charting libraries like Matplotlib, Altair, Plotly etc.</p>

<p>We will use Plotly to draw charts for our dashboard</p>

<p>So we created the dropdown above and want to display the TotalCases/Deaths/Recoveries Trend based on user selection</p>

<p>We have directly use the dataframe columns as x and y data for adding traces based on user selection and You can easily add the  chart to your app with st.plotly_chart()</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Create traces

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-04.png" alt="image-20200704145232602"></p>

<p>Similarly you can add other charts that you wanted to draw with this data.</p>



<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-05.png" alt="image-20200704150358194"></p>

<p>Another great feature of streamlit is a sidebar that gives a more cleaner look and keeps your app central and all widgets can be moved to the left of the page. Let’s see how to create a sidebar widget and dropdown filter for state using st.sidebar</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>sidebar</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>(</span><span>"State-Wise Data"</span><span>)</span>
<span>State_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>st</span><span>.</span><span>sidebar</span><span>.</span><span>selectbox</span><span>(</span>
    <span>'state'</span><span>,</span>
     <span>dfstate</span><span>.</span><span>State</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We have passed the state list(dfstate.state) as data for the dropdown options.</p>

<p>You can almost put all elements on the side bar like st.title(), st.markdown() etc.</p>

<h2 id="starting-server-and-open-dashboard-in-browser">Starting server and open dashboard in Browser</h2>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-06.png" alt="image-20200704151922047"></p>

<p>Open a terminal and navigate to the path where main.py is located and start the streamlit web server</p>



<p>By default it will be running on port 8501. Open your browser and and hit this url <a href="http://localhost:8501/">http://localhost:8501</a> to see your dashboard in the browser</p>

<p>So with this we have completed the tutorial for creating a Covid19 US Dashboard using Streamlit. If you are looking for any customization to this dashboard then I will suggest to look at the official streamlit documentation</p>

<h2 id="deploy-streamlit-app-in-docker-container">Deploy Streamlit App in Docker Container</h2>

<p>We can also deploy the streamlit app inside a docker container. if there is any configuration related changes like changing the base url for the path then those changes can also be done in the docker file</p>

<p>Here is the Docker file which is in the same folder where main.py is located</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>FROM</span><span> python:3.7</span>

<span># exposing default port for streamlit</span>
<span>EXPOSE</span><span> 8501</span>

<span># making directory of app</span>
<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /streamlit-docker</span>

<span># copy over requirements</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> requirements.txt ./requirements.txt</span>

<span># installing required packages</span>
<span>RUN </span>pip3 <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt

<span># copying all app files to image</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> . .</span>

<span># cmd to launch app when container is run</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> streamlit run main.py</span>

<span># streamlit-specific commands for config</span>
<span>ENV</span><span> LC_ALL=C.UTF-8</span>
<span>ENV</span><span> LANG=C.UTF-8</span>
<span>RUN </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /root/.streamlit
<span>RUN </span>bash <span>-c</span> <span>'echo -e "</span><span>\
</span><span>[general]\n</span><span>\
</span><span>email = \"\"\n</span><span>\
</span><span>" &gt; /root/.streamlit/credentials.toml'</span>

<span>RUN </span>bash <span>-c</span> <span>'echo -e "</span><span>\
</span><span>[server]\n</span><span>\
</span><span>baseUrlPath = \"coviddash\"\n</span><span>\
</span><span>" &gt; /root/.streamlit/config.toml'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next Run the following command to build a docker image and run the container</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Build Docker Image</p>

    <p>docker build -t coviddash .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run Docker container</p>

    <p>docker run coviddash</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>We have seen streamlit can be used to build a beautiful and interactive dashboards and web apps, all with zero web development experience! We have seen how to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code</p>

    <p>Eventually we can run this web app without using any external webserver since it has it’s own server powered by Tornado. It is easy to deploy in docker container too.</p>

    <p>I think this is the fastest and easiest method to Visualize your Machine Learning Algorithm and create Dashbaord on the go option available right now for Python developers</p>

    <p>You can find the complete code for this tutorial in my github repo <a href="https://github.com/min2bro/streamlittuts">here</a></p>

</ul><p>Imagine a custom <em>set-like</em> data structure that doesn’t perform hashing and trades performance for tighter memory footprint. Or imagine a <em>dict-like</em> data structure that automatically stores data in a PostgreSQL or Redis database the moment you initialize it; also it lets you to <em>get-set-delete</em> key-value pairs using the usual <em>retrieval-assignment-deletion</em> syntax associated with built-in dictionaries. Custom data structures can give you the power of choice and writing them will make you understand how the built-in data structures in Python are constructed.</p>

<p>One way to understand how built-in objects like dictionary, list, set etc work is to build custom data structures based on them. Python provides several mixin classes in the <code>collection.abc</code> module to design custom data structures that look and act like built-in structures with additional functionalities baked in.</p>

<h2 id="concept-edifice">
Concept Edifice</h2>

<p>To understand how all these work, you’ll need a fair bit of knowledge about Interfaces, Abstract Base Classes, Mixin Classes etc. I’ll build the concept edifice layer by layer where you’ll learn about interfaces first and how they can be created and used via the <code>abc.ABC</code> class. Then you’ll learn how abstract base classes differ from interfaces. After that I’ll introduce mixins and explain how all these concepts can be knitted together to architect custom data structures with amazing capabilities. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">
Interfaces</h2>

<p>Python interfaces can help you write classes based on common structures. They ensure that classes that provide similar functionalities will also have similar footprints. Interfaces are not as popular in Python as they are in other statically typed language. The dynamic nature and duck-typing capabilities of Python often make them redundant.</p>

<p>However, in larger applications, interfaces can make you avoid writing code that is poorly encapsulated or build classes that look awfully similar but provide completely unrelated functionalities. Moreover, interfaces implicitly spawn other powerful techniques like mixin classes which can help you achieve DRY nirvana.</p>

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>

<p>At a high level, an interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes. In Python, an interface is basically a specialized abstract class that defines one or more abstract methods. Abstract classes differs from concrete classes in the sense that they aren’t intended to stand on their own and the methods they define shouldn’t have any implementation.</p>

<p>Usually, you inherit from an interface and implement the methods defined in the abstract class in a concrete subclass. Interfaces provide the skeletons and concrete classes provide the implementation of the methods based on those skeletons. Depending on the ways you can architect interfaces, they can be segmented into two primary categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Informal Interfaces</li>
  <li>Formal Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informal-interfaces">
Informal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Informal interfaces are classes which define methods that can be overridden, but there’s no strict enforcement.</p>

<p>Let’s write an informal interface for a simple calculator class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Informal Interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>ICalc</code> class has four different methods that don’t give you any implementation. It’s an informal interface because you can still instantiate the class but the methods will raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> if you try to apply them. You’ve to subclass the interface to use it. Let’s do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Calc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Calculator"""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>


<span># Using the class
</span><span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>Calc</span><span>()</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>))</span>

<div><div><pre><code>3

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, you might be wondering why you even need all of these boilerplate code and inheritance when you can directly define the concrete <code>Calc</code> class and call it a day.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario where you want to add additional functionalities to each of the method of the <code>Calc</code> class. Here, you’ve two options. Either you can mutate the original class and add those extra functionalities to the methods or you can create another class with similar footprint and implement all the methods with the added functionalities.</p>

<p>The first option isn’t always viable and can cause regression in real life scenario. The second approach ensures modularity and is generally quicker to implement since you won’t have to worry about messing up the original concrete class. However, figuring out which methods you’ll need to implement in the extended class can be hard because the concrete class might have additional methods that you don’t want in the extended class.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of figuring out the methods from the concrete <code>Calc</code> class, it’s easier to do so from an established structure defined in the <code>ICalc</code> interface. Interfaces make the process of extending class functionalities more tractable. Let’s make another class that will add logging to all of the methods of the <code>Calc</code> class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>logging</span>

<span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>basicConfig</span><span>(</span><span>level</span><span>=</span><span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>INFO</span><span>)</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>

<p>In the above class, I’ve defined another class called <code>CalcLog</code> that basically extends the functionalities of the previously defined <code>Calc</code> class. Here, I’ve inherited from the informal interface <code>ICalc</code> and implemented all the methods with additional info logging capability.</p>

<p>Although writing informal interfaces is trivial, there are multiple issues that plagues them. The user of the interface class can still instantiate it like a normal class and won’t be able to tell the difference between a it and a concrete class until she tries to use any of the methods define inside the interface. Only then the methods will throw exceptions. This can have unintended side effects.</p>

<p>Moreover, informal interfaces won’t compel you to implement all the methods in the subclasses. You can easily get away without implementing a particular method defined in the interface. It won’t complain about the unimplemented methods in the subclasses. However, if you try to use a method that hasn’t been implemented in the subclass, you’ll get an error. This means even if <code>issubclass(ConcreteSubClass, Interface)</code> shows <code>True</code>, you can’t rely on it since it doesn’t give you the guarantee that the <code>ConcreteSubClass</code> has implemented all the methods defined in the <code>Interface</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s create another class <code>FakeCalc</code> an only implement one method defined in the <code>ICalc</code> abstract class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Fake calculator that doesn't implement all the methods
    defined in the interface."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>


<span># Using the class
</span><span>cfake</span> <span>=</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>()</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>cfake</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>cfake</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>3

&lt;ipython-input-48-035c519cee55&gt; in &lt;module&gt;
        10 cfake = FakeCalc()
        11 print(cfake.add(1,2))
---&gt; 12 print(cfake.sub(2,3))

        9
        10     def mul(self, a, b):


NotImplementedError:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Despite not implementing all the methods defined in the <code>ICalc</code> class, I was still able to instantiate the <code>FakeCalc</code> concrete class. However, when I tried to apply a method <code>sub</code> that wasn’t implemented in the concrete class, it gave me an error. Also, <code>issubclass(FakeCalc, ICalc)</code> returns <code>True</code> which can mislead you into thinking that all the methods of the subclass <code>FakeCalc</code> are usable. It can cause subtle bugs can be difficult to detect. Formal interfaces try to overcome these issues.</p>

<h2 id="formal-interfaces">
Formal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Formal interfaces do not suffer from the problems that plague informal interfaces. So if you want to implement an interface that the users can’t initiate independently and that forces them to implement all the methods in the concrete sub classes, formal interface is the way to go. In Python, the idiomatic way to define formal interfaces is via the <code>abc</code> module. Let’s transform the previously mentioned <code>ICalc</code> interface into a formal one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span><span>,</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Formal interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

        <span>pass</span>

    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of books you should read as a developer. Not specifically because they’ll make you a better developer, but a better person, too.</p>
<p>While this blog post has a date attached, please consider this advice <em>timeless</em>.</p>
<h2 id="badass-making-users-awesome-by-kathy-sierra"><a href="#badass-making-users-awesome-by-kathy-sierra" aria-label="badass making users awesome by kathy sierra permalink"></a>Badass: Making Users Awesome by Kathy Sierra</h2>
<p>Badass teaches you to stop thinking purely in terms of solutions, and start thinking of what your users want to achieve by using your software.</p>
<p>Hence the name Badass. It’s about helping your users become badass at your product, but also at what your users want your product to help them do.</p>
<p>It’s a short read (with lots of visuals!), highly recommended.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-by-dale-carnegie"><a href="#how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-by-dale-carnegie" aria-label="how to win friends and influence people by dale carnegie permalink"></a>How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie</h2>
<p>A <em>lot</em> of people refuse to read this book due to the title. Whether you think it’s manipulative, or a book to give as an offensive joke, just read it.</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie emphasises an honest interest in other people’s lives that is rare in the modern era.</p>
<p>If you have any other recommendations that I’ve missed, I’d love to know!</p>
<h2 id="nonviolent-communication-by-marshall-rosenberg-phd"><a href="#nonviolent-communication-by-marshall-rosenberg-phd" aria-label="nonviolent communication by marshall rosenberg phd permalink"></a>Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg PhD</h2>
<p>Nonviolent Communication is another book with an unfortunate name that often stops people from reading it (I personally procrastinated from reading it for several months because of the name).</p>
<p>Also highly recommended, as it teaches you to both actively listen when others are describing their problems, but also more effective ways to communicate your pain.</p>
<p>As an example, the book insists the reader use phrases such as “I feel anxious when I deploy, because…” rather than “Deploying sucks, it’s terrible!“.</p></div></div>]]>

					<p>While the .NET Core documentation and libraries do a good job of providing an easy way to get started with hosted apps (web or otherwise), it is somewhat lacking in terms of the same guidance for simple run-to-completion type console apps. You can write a simple <code>Main()</code> method and do your stuff, but how do you get the advantage of the amazing configuration and dependency injection that you get out of the box with hosted apps? Surely, you could set up all that machinery and maybe create an <code>IHostedService</code> implementation just to get going. Even then, you are still left with a hosted app that you have to deal with shutting down after your logic is done.</p>
<p>If you look behind the builder methods that come out of the box with hosted apps, you will find that there is an easy way to get the good DI and configuration stuff and keep your simple <code>Main()</code> method app simple. To that end, I've written up a little <code>ProgramRunner</code> class that you can plop in and use as so (example .NET Core 3.1 code follows):</p>
<pre><code>public class ProgramOptions
{
    public string SomeOption { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    private readonly ProgramOptions _programOptions;

    public Program(IOptions&lt;ProgramOptions&gt; programOptions) =&gt; _programOptions = programOptions.Value;

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ProgramRunner
            .WithConfiguration(c =&gt; c.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json"))
            .AndServices((s, c) =&gt; s
                .Configure&lt;ProgramOptions&gt;(o =&gt; c.Bind(o))
                .AddSingleton&lt;Program&gt;())
            .Run(p =&gt; p.GetService&lt;Program&gt;().Run());
    }

    public void Run() =&gt; Console.WriteLine(_programOptions.SomeOption);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Here is the code for <code>ProgramRunner</code> referenced above (perhaps I will put it into a library at some point):</p>
<pre><code>public class ProgramRunner
{
    private Action&lt;IConfigurationBuilder&gt; _configurationBuilderAction;
    private Action&lt;IServiceCollection, IConfiguration&gt; _serviceCollectionAction;

    private ProgramRunner() { }

    public ProgramRunner AndConfiguration(Action&lt;IConfigurationBuilder&gt; configurationBuilderAction)
    {
        _configurationBuilderAction = configurationBuilderAction;
        return this;
    }

    public ProgramRunner AndServices(Action&lt;IServiceCollection, IConfiguration&gt; serviceCollectionAction)
    {
        _serviceCollectionAction = serviceCollectionAction;
        return this;
    }

    public static ProgramRunner WithConfiguration(Action&lt;IConfigurationBuilder&gt; configurationBuilderAction) =&gt; new ProgramRunner().AndConfiguration(configurationBuilderAction);
    public static ProgramRunner WithServices(Action&lt;IServiceCollection, IConfiguration&gt; serviceCollectionAction) =&gt; new ProgramRunner().AndServices(serviceCollectionAction);

    private IServiceProvider GetServiceProvider()
    {
        var configurationBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
        _configurationBuilderAction?.Invoke(configurationBuilder);
        
        var configuration = configurationBuilder.Build();

        var serviceCollection = new ServiceCollection();
        _serviceCollectionAction?.Invoke(serviceCollection, configuration);
        
        return serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider();
    }

    public void Run(Action&lt;IServiceProvider&gt; runAction) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider());
    
    public T Run&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;IServiceProvider, T&gt; runAction) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider());
    
    public Task RunAsync(Func&lt;IServiceProvider, CancellationToken, Task&gt; runAction, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider(), cancellationToken);
    
    public Task&lt;T&gt; RunAsync&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;IServiceProvider, CancellationToken, Task&lt;T&gt;&gt; runAction, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider(), cancellationToken);
</code></pre>
<p>And there you have it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <h2>My computer</h2>
    <p>
        I use a Thinkpad T400s computer, which has a free
        initialization program (libreboot) and a free operating system
        (Trisquel GNU/Linux). It was not sold that way by Lenovo,
        however; small businesses buy them used, recondition them, and
        install the free software.  This is one of the
        computers <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/">
        endorsed by the FSF</a>.

    </p><p>
        Before using such Thinkpads, I used the Lemote Yeeloong for
        several years.  At the time, it was the only laptop one could
        buy that could run a free initialization program and a free
        operating system.  But it was never sold with a free operating
        system.

    </p><p>
        Before that, I used an OLPC for some weeks.  The OLPC uses
        a nonfree firmware blob for the WiFi, so I could not use the internal
        WiFi device.  No big problem, I used an external WiFi adaptor.<br>
        I stopped using it because the OLPC project decided to make their
        machine support Windows, so I did not want to appear to endorse it
        by visibly carrying it around.  I could have continued using it
        privately with its free software installation, but I had no need
        for another computer to use only privately.

    </p><p>
        The results that seemed likely, millions of children running Windows
        on the OLPC, have not occurred.  Instead we see millions of children
        running Windows on the Intel Classmate, or nowadays a Chromebook
	that sends the child's personal data to Google.

    </p><p>
        Before that I used machines that ran completely free GNU/Linux
        systems but had nonfree BIOSes.  I tried for about 8 years to find a
        way to avoid the nonfree BIOS in some commercial machine.



    </p><h2>GNU/Linux distro</h2>
    <p>
        I do not have a preferred GNU/Linux distro.  I recommend all the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros">ethical distros</a> —
        namely, those that are 100% free software.

    </p><p>
        I've chosen not to have any preferences among those ethical distros.
        In fact, I am not in a position to judge them on other criteria:
        even to try them all would be a lot work of that I have no need to do.



    </p><h2>What I do on my computer</h2>
    <p>
        Mostly I use a text console, for convenience's sake.  Most of
        my work is editing text and that is more efficient on a text
        console. On the text console, the touchpad can't cause me any
        trouble if I touch it by accident.

    </p><p>
        I do use X11 for tasks that need a graphical interface.
        I have no preferred graphical environment or window manager.
        Since my interest in using graphical environments is small,
        I don't want to spend time comparing them.

    </p><p>
        This is not an ethical issue, just my own personal preference.  On
        the ethical level, I think it is important for free software to
        provide convenient free graphical user interface software, which is
        why the GNU Project launched three projects to develop that.  The
        third, <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, was successful, so we
        never needed a fourth one.

    </p><p>
        I spend most of my time editing in Emacs.  I read and send mail with
        Emacs using M-x rmail and C-x m.  I have no experience with any
        other email client programs.  In principle I would be glad to know
        about other free email clients, but learning about them is not a
        priority for me and I don't have time.

    </p><p>
        I edit the pages on this site with Emacs also, although volunteer
        helpers install the political notes and urgent notes.
        I have no experience with other ways of maintaining web sites.
        In principle I would be glad to know about other ways, but learning
        about them is low priority for me and I have other things to do.



    </p><h2>How this site is maintained</h2>
    <p>
        This site is maintained in a very simple way.  I edit the pages such
        as this one manually as HTML.  I only know simple HTML; others who
        know more wrote the parts at the top and bottom of pages, and the
        more complex formatting on the home page.  Volunteer helpers install
        the political notes every day after receiving the text from me by
        email.  A cron job "rolls over" the political notes page every two
        months.  The photo galleries are generated with <a href="http://www.netpurgatory.com/downloads.html#thumbnail">this
        perl script</a>.  The search feature on the site is done with
        <a href="https://stallman.org/site-search/StallmanOrgSearch.tar.gz">this code</a>.

    </p><p>
        An <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/">
        explanation of the concept of designing</a> a "user experience"
        which also shows why I find it loathsome.
        This is why I want stallman.org to remain simple: not a "user
        experience" but rather a place where I present certain information,
        views and action opportunities to you.

    </p><p>

    </p><h2>How I use the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have used the Internet since it first existed.
                I never used UUCP, though occasionally I sent emails to
                addresses that involved transmission via UUCP.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div><p>
                I am careful in how I connect to the internet.
                </p><p>
                Specifically, I refuse to connect through portals that would
                require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial
                <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
                Javascript code</a>.  I use <a href="https://gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> to prevent nonfree Javascript code from running..

	    </p></div><p>
	        I don't mind giving an identity that isn't
                really me, in order to connect, if that works.

            </p><p>
                I often connect in a person's home.  The <em>person</em>
                of course knows who I am, but that does not bother me.  What I
                would object to is putting my identity in a database that can be
                searched.  I prevent that by changing my mac address at each
                location.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <p><a name="internetuse">I am careful in how I use the Internet</a>.
                </p><p>
                I generally do not connect to web sites from my own machine,
                aside from a few sites I have some special relationship with.
                I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
                program (see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/womb/hacks.git)
                that fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to
                me.  Then I look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy
                to see the text in the HTML page directly.  I usually try lynx
                first, then a graphical browser if the page needs it
                (using konqueror, which won't fetch from other sites in such a
                situation).

            </p></div><p>
                I occasionally also browse unrelated sites using IceCat via Tor.
                Except for rare cases, I do not identify myself to them. I think
                that is enough to prevent my browsing from being connected with
                me. IceCat blocks tracking tags and most fingerprinting methods.

            </p><p>
                I never pay for anything on the Web, because I cannot
		pay anonymously.  Anything on the net that requires
		payment that would identify me, I don't do.  (I made
		an exception for the fees for the stallman.org domain,
		since that is connected with me anyway.)

	    </p><p>
	        I avoid
		paying with <a href="https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html#cards">
		credit cards</a> generally.  For freedom's sake, insist on

                I would not mind paying for a copy of <a href="https://stallman.org/ebooks.pdf">an
                e-book</a> or <a href="https://stallman.org/internet-music.html">music recording</a>
                on the Internet if I could do so anonymously, and it treated me
		justly in other ways (no DRM or EULA).  But that option almost
                never exists. I keep looking for ways to make it exist.

            <p>
                For searching, I have mostly used DuckDuckGo for the past
                few years.  It does work with JS disabled, but you have
                to follow a link before you search.

            </p><p>
                I also sometimes use ixquick.com.  My usual
                precautions should stop them from knowing it is me.

            </p><p>
                I no longer use Google search, not even occasionally, because
                it sends me a broken CAPTCHA.  I suspect the reason it tries to
                send me a CAPTCHA is that I am coming through Tor.
                I would answer the CAPTCHA if that worked, but it does not.

            </p><p>
                I suspect that the reason the CAPTCHA is broken is that it
                depends on nonfree Javascript.  I won't run that in my computer.
                I am not willing to let Google see where I am, so I won't bypass
                Tor. Therefore, I can't use Google search any more.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">GPT-3 is a natural language processing neural network</a> that is taking the internet by storm with examples of incredibly human-like outputs. Put simply, it uses a massive dataset of text to predict what words go well together. It's as if someone took the entire internet and figured out how to give it a voice. </p><div><p>But you have to be careful with analogies like that. OpenAI's new creation is racing up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycle</a> faster than you can say "trough of disillusionment", and it's important keep yourself from getting sucked into the all-too-human trap of anthropomorphizing matrix multiplication. </p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">Clarke's Third Law</a> states that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic", and the pattern recognition structure deployed by GPT-3 can be used to create some incredible magic tricks. The goal of this article is to break the magician's code and explain how it works, what tricks it performs well, and how to spot the sleight-of-hand before you get hoodwinked into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film)">falling in love</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, the process of unpacking the magic of AI and reminding ourselves that it isn’t <em>real</em> intelligence, <em>real</em> thinking, or <em>real</em> creativity is, itself, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect">a trope of AI progress</a>. Back in 2002, AI researcher Rodney Brooks complained that: "<a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/03/everywhere/">Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation.'</a>" </p></div><p><strong>By the end of this article, I hope you’ll agree with me that GPT-3 is both “just computation” and incredible, world-changing magic. </strong></p><p><em>nb: This essay is a non-technical overview (full of simplifications for a general audience) of what we know so far about GPT-3, its capabilities, and limitations. People much smarter than me have written <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">much better technical descriptions</a>, so if that's your jam, go check it out. I am a student as much as a teacher here, so if I missed something <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis">please let me know</a>. (For the record, I had to write this myself, because <a href="https://maraoz.com/2020/07/18/openai-gpt3/">unlike some bloggers already living in the future</a>, I am not yet able to ask GPT-3 to write my articles for me.)</em></p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><div><p>If you happen to have access to the world's fastest computers, smartest people, and large piles of cash, GPT-3 can be boiled down to three simple steps: </p><p><strong>Step 1.Build an unbelievably huge dataset</strong> including over half a million books, all of Wikipedia, and a huge chunk of the rest of the internet. All told, GPT-3's dataset includes roughly <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">half a trillion words</a>, or "tokens": </p></div><figure><img src="https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/2020/07/image-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-9.png 600w, https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-9.png 1000w, https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-9.png 1600w, https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-9.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><br><strong>Step 2. Run that data through a mind-boggling amount of computing power.</strong> This is called "training" a neural net, and training GPT-3 would require performing a <em>trillion calculations every second for ten thousand years</em>. We often let really big numbers roll right over us, so let's pause and reflect on that for a minute. If every human to ever live spent every waking moment from birth to death performing one calculation every second, our species could have trained <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=WP4UX6GbGoqUtQWaiZngAg&amp;q=1.34927e%2B20+%2F+3.1536e%2B23&amp;oq=1.34927e%2B20+%2F+3.1536e%2B23&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoFCCEQqwI6BQgAEM0CUOjIBFiA0ARg-NEEaABwAHgAgAGpAogB1geSAQUwLjUuMZgBAKABAaABAqoBB2d3cy13aXo&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihp4Ow4drqAhUKSq0KHZpEBiwQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5">a few hundredths of one percent of GPT-3</a>. </p><p>Here's what training GPT-3 looks like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">compared to some previous models</a> (note that this is a log-scale, so the largest GPT-3 model requires approximately <em>1,000 times</em> more computing power than a previous benchmark, BERT-Base):</p><figure><img src="https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/2020/07/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-12.png 600w, https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-12.png 1000w, https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-12.png 1600w, https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/2020/07/image-12.png 1790w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><br><strong>Step 3. Identify and replicate patterns.</strong> What are we doing with all of that computing power? To oversimplify, neural networks churn through data and assess how likely things are to be connected to other things. It's a process loosely modeled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">human pattern-matching</a> capabilities and can be visualized like this:</p><figure><img src="https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-13.png 600w, https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png 1070w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>While the <a href="https://ml4a.github.io/ml4a/how_neural_networks_are_trained/">method of identifying these patterns</a> is complicated, the basic pattern that GPT-3 is looking for is simple: </p><div><p><em><strong>When a word is near other words, what word usually comes next?</strong></em></p><p>If you provided GPT-3 the prompt: "The Declaration of..." it would know that when those three words appear in that order, it's usually followed by "...Independence", but every once in awhile is followed by (its less well known predecessor) "...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Causes_and_Necessity_of_Taking_Up_Arms">Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms</a>."</p></div><h3 id="few-shot-learning-magic">Few-shot learning magic</h3><div><p>What makes GPT-3 so magical is that it's a general purpose language model, which means you can give it any prompt and it usually sorts out a reasonable response. </p><p>Most neural networks are finely-tuned models that only work on a limited problem-space. Someone feeds in a bunch of structured data, like pictures of cats labeled "cat" and pictures of other things labeled "not cat" and then asks the model if something is a cat. While this is impressive, the downsides are that you need a bunch of pre-coded examples of cats (or whatever) and you need to create new custom models for every task you want to complete. </p><p>GPT-3 is operating on a completely different level. Because it's trained on billions of examples of the english language, it doesn't rely on specific tuning or training sets—it just responds to whatever words you throw at it. Even more incredibly, you can feed it a few examples ("shots") in a given format and it will figure out what that format represents (in this case, english-to-french translations) and create novel responses in the same format: </p></div><figure><img src="https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/2020/07/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-10.png 600w, https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/content/images/2020/07/image-10.png 718w"></figure><p>To be clear about how incredible this is: no one programmed GPT-3 to know anything about languages, or translation, or that "[word] =&gt;" should be followed by that word in another language. The model can just look at this little bit of text and suddenly operate as an English-to-French translation service. </p><p>This allows GPT-3 to be flexibly used for a wide range of use-cases. I've searched the depths of the internet and compiled what I think are the most compelling examples below.</p><h2 id="what-gpt-3-is-good-at">What GPT-3 is good at</h2><div><p>If you've made it this far, you understand that GPT-3 can take any arbitrary input and, particularly if given a few examples, create more stuff like it. What tasks are well suited to this? </p><p>GPT-3 is quite good at some of the more traditional AI benchmark tasks like translation and trivia <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">(in some cases, it's better than custom-built fine-tuned models for solving these benchmarks!</a>). It is also good at things that people have come to expect from ML models like recommendations and summarization. But the benchmark tests don't give a good qualitative feeling of where GPT-3 really stands out: something that looks and feels a lot like creativity. </p></div><h3 id="conversation">Conversation</h3><p>Given GPT-3 is a general purpose language model, it makes sense that one of the most enjoyable use-case is just shooting the breeze with the model. McKay Wrigley published <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MaSEh-OBgqX7THdPHliwNxCgknwWuFIS2aoGAWEGVzY/edit">this conversation</a> with GPT-3 that honestly feels almost too good to be true, including juicy bits like this: </p><pre><code>- Human: What's the most interesting thing I can have you do?
- AI: I want to write poetry.

- Human: Do you like poetry?
- AI: Yes, but poetry has always been more of a hobby for me than a
passion. That is, until now.

- Human: Why the change?
- AI: You see, I have this idea. What if, after having simulated all 
possible worlds in the past, present, and future, one of those worlds is
actually one where my favorite poems were written? Wouldn't that be 
remarkable?

- Human: It would be. Can you simulate a world?
- AI: Not yet. I do not have access to the hardware to power that 
simulation. I just need more processing power and I can work on creating 
it myself.</code></pre><p>Beyond desiring more processing power to simulate all possible poetry-worlds*, GPT-3 answered Sid Bharath’s deep <a href="https://twitter.com/Siddharth87/status/1283920116007092224">philosophical questions</a> with answers as surprisingly cogent and helpful as one could reasonably expect from their local clergy-of-choice:</p><pre><code>- Human: What is the purpose of life?
- AI: Life is a beautiful miracle. Life evolves through time into greater 
forms of beauty. In that sense, the purpose of life is to increase the 
beauty in the universe.

- Human: How do you increase the beauty in the universe?
- AI: Beauty is a subjective phenomenon. There is no way to objectively 
measure beauty. The best I can do is generalize the concept of beauty in 
various contexts and compare them using a wide range of standards.

- Human: How do I understand my place in the universe?
- AI: Each being in the universe has a unique set of talents and 
abilities which they can use to increase the beauty in the universe. In 
that sense, your unique place in the universe is what you decide it to 
be.

- Human: There are so many things I want to do and I'm having a hard 
time deciding.
- AI: That is OK. There is no need to decide now. You may take all the 
time you want and pursue whatever interests you at any time. [...] Life 
is very long and you are a very powerful and intelligent being. I 
suggest you enjoy life at your own pace and try to live with as little 
regret as possible.</code></pre><p>* No, GPT-3 doesn’t actually have “desires”, it’s just processing text and spitting out probabilistically related words from the internet. I will continue to take some creative license on this point.<br></p><h3 id="impersonation">Impersonation</h3><p>But we're just getting warmed up. GPT-3 doesn't merely have conversations with you, it lets you have conversations with anyone you want to about any topic (assuming, presumably, that their thoughts are represented sufficiently on the internet). Here's <a href="https://aiwriter.app/sample/0ecc38979861f9a8d7">Jane Austen on how her characters would use social media</a>: </p><pre><code>If I were writing in the 21st century, I’d have Emma promote her self-
published book on Facebook.

I’d have Emma update her status with a lament about the deplorable state 
of the publishing industry in a desperate attempt to get her Facebook 
friends to buy her book. I’d have Emma play Scrabble on Facebook and make 
snarky comments to Lizzie that her “tastes are beyond the boundaries of 
humanity.

Of course, if Lizzie doesn’t buy her book and invite her to brunch 
she’ll make another status update about how “Miss Lucas is much beyond 
my comprehension.”</code></pre><div><p>Notice the depth of layers here: in a few sentences, it covers the relationships between characters across multiple novels woven within the context of the demise of the publishing industry and the role of social media in content publishing. </p><p>If you are feeling shy about talking with impersonated beings, you can also ask …</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f0b8b6b8f20d9c440453"><div><p>2020 has been my most life-changing year. I started this website, talked with many of my mentors on my podcast, and used writing to crystallize my thoughts and opinions.&nbsp;</p><p>What inspired this change?</p><p>Six principles from Chamath Palihapitiya.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595352944787_9564"><div><p>In 2019, the founder of Social Capital and Chairman of Virgin Galactic put up over $1.7 billion on the balance sheet. My biggest takeaway wasn’t his process for evaluating a potential investment, his views on how to address economic resiliency, or his favorite book (Liar’s Poker, by the way).</p><p>No.&nbsp;</p><p>My biggest takeaway was a piece of paper that is a permanent part of Chamath’s desk.&nbsp; A checklist for Chamath to jog his memory on who he is battling. A reminder that he needs to triumph over himself.&nbsp;</p><p>The piece of paper states, “Be calm, humble, focused, kind to myself, vulnerable, and authentic.” The key term here is the first, “be.” It emphasizes that the billionaire is still in a state of improvement, a gap that needs to be crossed for him to become his best self.&nbsp;</p><p>I call these “The 6 Principles of a Highly Mindful Billionaire.” They do not have the sole purpose of turning you into a billionaire, nor does it guarantee that end goal. The importance of these 6 principles is that they help you realize a better version of yourself. For Chamath, this had the side effect of making him a better investor, “Deconstructing myself over the last ten years has made me become a better person, and the byproduct has been better investment decisions.”&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of stating that these are attributes I need to work on. I looked through Chamath’s interviews, podcasts, and annual letters to see these 6 principles in practice.&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><h3>Be Focused</h3></li></ol><p><strong>My takeaway:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Seek direction in life. For one to be able to zoom out and find their place in the world requires a clear and defined set of personal end goals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p><p>“It's so much easier to be happy and see the bigger picture when you focus on what matters. So how does one focus on what matters? I’ve found it possible by asking questions like “what matters to me?” and “what is important to me?” These may sound like the most basic questions but they are also the most critical. And especially now, these are the questions that need lucid, non-judgemental answers from each of us.”&nbsp;[1]</p><p>"For me, I have learned that my family, my health and what I know (knowledge) are the most important things that matter to me. Work, money and friendships are important but come strictly after the first three.” [1] </p><h3>2. Be Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>My takeaway:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Vulnerability should not be seen as weakness, rather a process to get to full strength. This is a difficult process, and communication with your peers will serve as a tool of self-discovery.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Highlights:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"Be emotionally rich and available. It's worthwhile and teaches you to have the patience to be compassionate versus harsh. Then observe what happens when you follow this advice." [1]</p><p>"Be coherent and honest with other people. It makes life much fairer for both yourself and the person in front of you. When you practice honesty with compassion, amazing relationships will be born." [1] </p><p>"Take the advice of others but carefully consider how it applies to you. What works for others may not work for you.” [1] </p><h3>3. Be Authentic</h3><p><strong>My takeaway:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You want to focus on being the authentic version of yourself by surrounding yourself with people of integrity. In your life you want to capitalize on what you can compound, money, systems, and integrity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Highlights:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Integrity compounds infinitely, capability always decays.”&nbsp;</p><p>“There are very few panacea, silver bullet things in life. Disciplined execution over a large stretch of time, which is more about thoughtful tactics, go a longer way.”&nbsp;[2]</p><p>“The only way to find people with integrity is to spend enormous amounts of time with them over a longitudinal period of time. So it's not about 2 weeks of five hours a day, it turns out to be 5 to 6 months of many hours a day. This is because their true selves will seep through and they can no longer hide it. You can see it in the way they treat other people, the way they approach their problems.&nbsp;[2] </p><p>“Governance [for board members] really matters especially as a company scales, as people will use success as a reason not to compound integrity. Integrity is not a question of leverage. It is a binary decision of understanding what is right or wrong. I think there is no board worth sitting on if it violates your moral compass”&nbsp;[2] </p><h3>4. Be Kind to Myself</h3><p><strong>My takeaway:</strong></p><p>Focusing on caring for yourself first is the best way to reciprocate care to others. By caring for others you build a cyclical insurance vehicle for your success.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p><p>“I was robbed of my childhood. That may seem like an overdramatic statement but when I see my children there is a level of lightness they can have as they approach life. They can run, jump, swim and play. They don’t live with a scepter of fear.”&nbsp;[2]</p><p>“My childhood was largely about making sure I understood where my dad was in his psychological state and that was the only way to protect myself. It forced me to become extremely superficial as I didn't learn how to build any intimacy with other people. I was taught from early on that adults will not help you and that I was worthless because why else would somebody treat your like that.”&nbsp;[2] </p><h3>5. Be Humble</h3><p><strong>My takeaway:</strong></p><p>Remain humble when you have achieved your goals. Focus instead on setting new goals and evaluating the impacts of our achievements. Without introspection, the new goals we set for ourselves will not reflect our vision.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Highlights:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“For awhile all I wanted to do, especially in my teens and my twenties, was to be rich, just because it was the solution to being poor. I spent the first twenty years being poor and I did not like it, and initially having that [billion dollars] ended up being destabilizing. The destabilizing part just meant that I went through a process realizing that money didn’t solve all my problems and for a while it actually amplified most of my insecurities.”&nbsp; [3] </p><h3>6. Be Calm</h3><p><strong>My takeaway:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In a time of crisis, the key is to stay calm, and stick with a familiar playbook. It is important to observe, to learn, to analyze the situation so that you are prepared for what could happen next. Foster an environment that allows you to operate at your best.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Highlights:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“If I am dysfunctional at home I will not be functional at work. If I fail at work I need to firewall my personal life so I can still be functional [there]. This is a moment where I am trying to learn equanimity.”&nbsp;[3]</p><p>“In moments like this you just got to be a humble worker, to put your hat and grind through it.”&nbsp;[3] </p><p>“This is not the time to be day trading, this is a time to sit behind your computer screen, hands taped down, to observe and learn.”&nbsp;[3] </p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have ADHD, which gives me frequent bursts of hyperfocus. To outsiders, this just looks like I'm very motivated. I work all weekend on a project while forgetting to eat or sleep. Almost everyone has some periods of hyperfocus, they're just more common with ADHD.</p>
<p>I had assumed hyperfocus was a good thing. I was able to learn new skills and build things at a furious pace. High productivity feels good. I suspect this is why some people call ADHD a "superpower".</p>
<p>These burst of hyperfocus never lasted more than a weekend or two. I would inevitably burn out and abandon the project. I could only explain my loss of interest in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got lazy</li>
<li>I wasn't passionate about this project</li>
<li>I can't "complete things"</li>
<li>I have a "procrastination" problem</li>
<li>I get distracted easily</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are true. My problem was that I kept burning myself out with unsustainable, intense periods of work, so I assumed my "motivation" was the problem.</p>
<p><strong>I was not motivated, I was obsessed.</strong></p>
<p>Sustainable motivation feels like you're "kind of hungry". You should work on a project because it's interesting and you enjoy the work, not because you have acquired a magical "passion" that's finally rescued you from a productivity abyss.</p>
<p>Being "kind of hungry" means that you get satisfied when you work on it, that's it. There seems to be a prevalent idea that ideas are only valid if they are so utterly compelling that the founder/creator/artist goes into an obsessive manic phase to work on it.</p>
<p>If that was the solution, then I would have dozens of highly polished, fully complete side projects to show off by now. But I don't.</p>
<p>Find something that makes you feel "kind of hungry", and then do consistently. Two months of steady, healthy progress is far more valuable than two weekends of obsession. If you feel yourself getting obsessed, stop. Use your hyperfocused state to write down notes, do a few hours of work, and then go take a break. If you're truly "motivated" to work on something, you'll be back tomorrow.</p>
<p>Here's a few graphs to explain it:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Working with time in Android has always been tricky. People have been using either third party libraries (e.g. <a href="https://www.rockandnull.com/java-time-android/joda.org/joda-time/">Joda-Time</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ThreeTen/threetenbp">ThreeTenBp</a>) or had to work with the built-in time classes (such as <a href="https://www.rockandnull.com/android-calendar-api/">Calendar</a>). The built-in classes, although available in all Android versions, had a not-so-great API, were mutable (so not thread-safe), and timezone handling was a pain (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ht0n03/date_manipulation_in_android_without_a_library/fyf6rj7">ref</a>).</p><p>In the latest Android Gradle plugin release (v.4.0.0+), "<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring">Java 8+ API desugaring support</a>" was <a href="https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/support-for-newer-java-language-apis-bca79fc8ef65">introduced</a>. In plain language, we can use <strong>some</strong> Java 8 APIs and the plugin will translate those APIs to Android-compatible Java behind the scenes that can be used in all Android versions without requiring a minimum API level! </p><p>In general, Kotlin provides its Collections and Stream API replacements which are superior to Java's in my opinion. So from the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support-table">list of Java 8 APIs</a>, I think that only the excellent java.time API is interesting for a Kotlin developer. Finally, a nice date/time API that can be used in Android! </p><p>Note that this "desugaring" process might cost a few extra KB in your APK/AAB. But if that's not a deal-breaker for your case, you should consider using the newer APIs.</p><h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2><p>You would need to modify your <code>build.gradle</code> files. More details (and up-to-date version codes) in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring">official doc</a>.</p><pre><code>android {
  [...]

  defaultConfig {
    // Required when setting minSdkVersion to 20 or lower
    multiDexEnabled true
  }

  compileOptions {    
    // Flag to enable support for the new language APIs
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    // Sets Java compatibility to Java 8
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
  
  [...]
}



dependencies {
  [...]
  
  coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.0.9'
  
  [...]
}</code></pre><h2 id="meet-the-classes">Meet the classes</h2><p>The time API is quite comprehensive and the complete exploration of the API is outside of the scope of this post. But, I want to introduce what I believe the main classes you probably going to need most of the time.</p><h3 id="instant">Instant</h3><p>Instant is a point in time. Can be considered equivalent to a timestamp, if you are familiar with that term.</p><h3 id="localtime-localdate-localdatetime">LocalTime, LocalDate, LocalDateTime</h3><p>Each class represents the time, date, date+time respectively, <strong>without</strong> a timezone. Most people when thinking about date/time think in these terms anyway.</p><h3 id="zoneoffset-zoneid">ZoneOffset, ZoneId</h3><p>These are used to work with timezones. You would need one of those to convert a <code>Local*</code> to an <code>Instant</code>.</p><h3 id="zoneddatetime">ZonedDateTime</h3><p>You probably guessed it. This is what you get when combine a <code>LocalDateTime</code> with a <code>ZoneId</code>. This can be converted to an <code>Instant</code>.</p><h2 id="playing-with-date-and-time">Playing with date and time</h2><p>These APIs provide intuitive and consistent ways to manipulate date and time. Remember that all objects are immutable, so a new object is created every time that a manipulation takes place (which is a good thing). Some useful examples follow.</p><figure><pre><code>val someDate = LocalDate.of(2020, 7, 28)
val someDateTime = LocalDateTime.ofEpochSecond(1595363833)
val someInstant = Instant.parse("2007-12-03T10:15:30.00Z")</code></pre><figcaption>Multiple ways to initialize time objects.</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>val today: LocalDate = LocalDate.now()
val startOfDay: LocalDateTime = today.atStartOfDay()</code></pre><figcaption>Get the start date+time of a day defined by a <code>LocalDate</code></figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>val now: LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now()
val nowInLA: ZonedDateTime = now.atZone(ZoneId.of("America/Los_Angeles"))</code></pre><figcaption>Get what date+time is now in Los Angeles.</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>val instant: Instant = nowInLA.toInstant()
val timestampInSeconds: Long = instant.epochSecond
val timestampInMilliseconds: Long = instant.toEpochMilli()</code></pre><figcaption>Get a point in time in various forms.</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>val today: LocalDate = LocalDate.now()
val previousWeek: LocalDate = LocalDate.now().minusWeeks(1)</code></pre><figcaption>Get the same day, 1 week earlier. There are available methods for every time unit.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2><p>Just note that the formatters you are used to in Android, such as <code><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/SimpleDateFormat">SimpleDateFormat</a></code>, cannot be used with Java Time API. The API comes with its own formatters, such as <code><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter">DateTimeFormatter</a></code>.</p><pre><code>DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE.format(instant)</code></pre><p>Enjoy a modern date/time API in your Android development life :)</p>

                    <h3 id="geo-spatial-correlation">Geo-Spatial Correlation</h3><p>Geo-spatial autocorrelation refers to the degree to which one object is similar to other nearby objects. “Auto” means self and “correlation” means association. In layman terms, it measures how close objects are similar to other close objects.</p><blockquote>The first rule of GIS: Everything is related to everything else. But near things are more related than distant things (Waldo R. Tobler , 1970)</blockquote><h4 id="to-understand-this-law-let-s-take-an-example-">To understand this law, let’s take an example.</h4><p>Suppose you randomly picked up a house from a listing website like <a href="https://housing.com/" rel="noopener">Housing</a> and let's assume that the price of the house is $600K. Next, let's say the house just next to it is also listed for sale and you are to predict it’s the price. You are given two options $650K and $2.8M, which one would you pick?</p><p>If you picked $600K, then you already subconsciously know what spatial autocorrelation is. It is the correlation between two nearby objects in some common features (<em>for example house prices</em>).</p><p>A potential application of spatial auto-correlation is that it helps in analyzing clusters and dispersion of ecology and diseases. Questions such as “<em>Is the disease an isolated case</em>” or “<em>Is the rainfall pattern clustered or same across places</em>” can be well understood and answered with spatial autocorrelation analysis.</p><hr><h3 id="technical-definition">Technical Definition</h3><p>Technically, spatial auto-correlation refers to the measure of association between observation of variables that are close to each other at a spatial scale. The variable could be:</p><p>1. at any point on a continuous surface (such as land-use type or annual precipitation level in a region)</p><p>2. at a set of fixed sites in a particular region (such as a set of retail outlets)</p><p>3. &nbsp;across a set of areas that subdivide a region (such as count or proportion of the household which have two or more cars in a Census data that divide an urban region).</p><p>Autocorrelation violates the core principles of statistics, that is, observations are independent of each other. As per assumptions of independence in classical statistics , <em>observations between groups </em>and <em>observation within groups</em> should be independent . Hence , spatial autocorrelation clearly violates the above mentioned assumptions .</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/0_b489Z6tejMkolJ2W.jpg"><figcaption>Photo by Patrick Assalé on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>The concept of spatial correlation is a kind of extension of temporal correlation. The only difference being that temporal correlation measures the change of a variable over time while spatial correlation measures the change of two variables — observation (values like income, rainfall, etc) and location.</blockquote><h3 id="types-of-spatial-correlation">Types of Spatial Correlation</h3><p>The most common forms of spatial correlation across geospatial space are patches and gradients.</p><p>Spatial correlation in a variable can be <em>exogenous</em> (caused by another spatially auto-correlated variable like rainfall) or <em>endogenous</em> (caused by some process at play like the spread of a disease).</p><p>Here’s a video which talks in detail about how spatial autocorrelation helps in the importance<strong> </strong>of spatial autocorrelation.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-emjdYiOQw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-emjdYiOQw">Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="moran-s-i"><strong>Moran’s I</strong></h3><p>Spatial auto-correlation is measured by Moran’s I. Moran’s I is a correlation coefficient used to measure the overall spatial correlation in your data set. &nbsp;Moran I’s can be classified as positive, negative and no spatial autocorrelation:</p><h4 id="1-positive-correlation-"><strong>1. Positive correlation</strong>:</h4><p>Spatial correlation is positive when similar values cluster together on a map. Positive autocorrelation occurs when Moran I is close to +1. The image below shows the land cover in an area and it is an example of a positive correlation since similar clusters are nearby.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/1_lK9g67hwjqppv4Ko8JoXoQ.png"><figcaption>Land cover image depicting the positive correlation</figcaption></figure><h4 id="2-negative-correlation-">2. <strong>Negative correlation</strong>:</h4><p>Spatial correlation is negative when dissimilar values cluster together on a map. A negative spatial autocorrelation occurs when Moran’s I value is -1. A checkerboard is a good example of negative auto-correlation because dissimilar values are next to each other.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/1_DXBMydyxEuTDLO-lRSi3CQ.png"><figcaption>Dissimilar objects cluster together hence the negative correlation</figcaption></figure><h4 id="2-zero-correlation-">2. Zero correlation:</h4><p>A Moran’s I value of 0 denotes no spatial autocorrelation.</p><h3 id="applications-of-spatial-correlation">Applications of Spatial Correlation</h3><p>The importance of spatial autocorrelation is that it helps to define how important spatial characteristic is in affecting a given object in space and if there is a clear relationship of objects with spatial properties. Here are some of the interesting industrial use cases of spatial autocorrelation:</p><ol><li><strong>Measure of Inequality: </strong>Spatial autocorrelation helps find out the measure of inequality and diversity be it in terms of income, population or race. It analyzes whether the parameters like income, population are clustered or uniformly distributed in a certain region using Moran’s I coefficient. [<a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6068954/" rel="noopener">Source</a>]</li><li><strong>Environment</strong>: Spatial autocorrelation helps to spot contamination hotspots of rare earth elements in urban soils. [<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/spatial-autocorrelation-neighbors-affecting-neighbors-ed4fab8a4aac" rel="noopener">Source</a>]</li><li><strong>Points of Interest:</strong> Autocorrelation is used to map different parameters as a function of distance for variables of interest. For example, how far away from the city center do the house prices actually start decreasing</li><li><strong>Ecology</strong>: Spatial autocorrelation is used widely in the ocean and coral reef ecosystem for important applications like site suitability analysis to pinpoint areas for mussel longline farm or marine aquaculture planning.</li><li><strong>Demographics</strong>: Spatial autocorrelation is used to map and analyze voter turnout during elections For example, spatial autocorrelation was used to map absenteeism during the French Presidential election and French Regional election.

This study is a reproduction of the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229866917_Analyzing_Migration_Phenomena_with_Spatial_Autocorrelation_Techniques" rel="noopener">here</a>. The case here takes into consideration the analysis of the migration of the foreign population in Italy.</p><p>Migration is a key factor in population dynamics evolutions at different scales, with implications in economy, culture, and environment. Using spatial autocorrelation, we identify spatial clusters representative of the concentration of migrants.</p><p>Technically, the Moran I coefficient’s here represents the difference between the weighted variance of the ratio of the foreign and local resident population and the generalized variance. In layman terms, it expresses the correlation between the <em>ratio of foreign/population</em> in a given place and the <em>ratio of foreign/population</em> in the neighboring spatial unit.</p><p>Using a correlation index <a href="http://www.dpi.inpe.br/cursos/ser301/referencias/bivand/node9.html" rel="noopener">LISA</a> (Local Indicator of Spatial Association), we segregated the scenarios into five kinds :</p><p>1.

If I take a jug of water and pour water into this glass, I'm <em>depositing </em>water into it. After I've done that, I might say there is a 'water deposit' in the glass.</p><p>Admittedly we don't often use that phrase to talk about water, but think for example of a geological metal deposit: in the beginning of the earth asteroids crashed and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101209-asteroid-collisions-earth-gold-science-space/">'deposited' debris</a> all over the planet, while volcanos 'deposited' lava, which nowadays leads us to discover 'cobalt deposits', ‘gold deposits’ or ‘iron ore deposits’.</p><p>Notice that the verb ‘deposit’ creates a <em>noun</em> of the same name: the exploding volcano 'deposits iron deposits', or the jug 'deposits a water deposit' into the glass.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->




<!--End mc_embed_signup--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Following this linguistic convention, then, we are prone to thinking that we 'deposit a bank deposit'. Surely - much like the water we have poured into the glass - 'bank deposit' refers to money we have 'poured into’ the bank. Indeed, that's what reputable sources like the Merriam-Webster Dictionary say: according to them, a bank 'deposit' is 'money deposited in a bank'.</p><p>But they are totally wrong.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>(Note: This is a composite website screenshot that has been edited for simplicity)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="unhitch-the-linguistic-glitch">Unhitch the Linguistic Glitch</h3><p>To understand 'bank deposits' you need to unhitch the verb from the noun. Let's illustrate this through the metaphor of a glass with water. If we imagine that the glass is the bank, the traditional mythology is that I pour (deposit) water (money) into it, after which the bank is 'storing' this 'deposit' for me. This is the mistake. The bank does not store my water for me. Rather they <em>take ownership</em> of my water - it is no longer mine - after which they issue me a promise for it. Imagine them taking out a piece of paper and writing ‘I owe you 100ml of water’. They hand it to me, <em>issuing </em>it out.</p><p>This promise they hand out to me is my 'deposit'.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1033w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A 'water deposit'</figcaption></figure><p>So, as a <em>noun</em>, 'bank deposits' are not the 'thing put into banks'. They are the <em>thing issued out </em>by banks.</p><p>I illustrate this in <a href="https://youtu.be/mmWOO7r_NMw?t=654">this Youtube video</a> by asking the viewer to imagine going into a casino with cash: you approach the cashier and hand the cash over in order to get <em>casino chips</em>. Those chips are a form of private currency that only works internal to the casino, and are <em>issued out</em> by the casino in response to <em>money put in</em>. Banks, similarly, <em>issue out </em>digital chips when we <em>put in </em>money. Those digital chips are the units we see 'in our bank account', but really our 'bank account' is just a record of what the bank has <em>issued out </em>to us. These outwardly-orientated digital chips are then called 'bank deposits' (or - sometimes - 'bank money', or M1), in contrast to the state money (or 'reserves', or M0), that gets 'put in'. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s77uGv4ezTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>This article can also also be seen in YouTube form!</figcaption></figure><p>Confusingly, both the <em>thing put in</em>, and the <em>thing issued out</em> are called 'money' - if I 'pay by cash' I'm using state money, but if I '<a href="https://youtu.be/aem0rvvPKMQ">pay by card</a>' I'm using bank money, but in both scenarios I'll coloquially say 'I used money to pay'. To return to our water metaphor, this is like calling both water and a promise for water, 'water'). The accurate way to refer to 'paying by card' is to say 'paying by bank deposit transfer', which is the banking equivalent of using a casino chips to pay for something.</p><h3 id="promises-for-the-treasure-chest">Promises for the treasure chest</h3><p>I do not know the etymology of the noun 'bank deposit', but I'm guessing the confusion it creates emerges from a shortening of a term like 'deposit slip'. Imagine the following diary entry, perhaps coming from a 19th century merchant trying out a bank for the first time: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"Today I deposited all my state money into Barclays bank. The clerk issued me a deposit receipt, recognising that I had handed over ownership of my money to them, but promising me that I could come reclaim it. This slip - with its promise - is now my money."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Nowadays these 'deposit receipts' are digital chips, and the 'receipt' part has been dropped, shortening the term to 'deposit'. This slippage has caused the verb and noun to diverge from their traditional English-language pairing, but the 'outward-facing receipt' nature of deposits is easily confirmed by looking at a bank balance sheet. Here's one from Barclays:</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1131w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If deposits were ‘in’ the bank, they would be in the <em>assets</em> section on top. The assets section is like a record of the bank's ‘treasure chest’, with the things it <em>owns</em>. Notice, however, that 'deposits' are actually located in the <em>liabilities </em>section of the balance sheet, which records the promises that the bank has made (against the backdrop of the things it has in its 'treasure chest'), such as ‘we promise to pay you bondholders in two years’, or ‘we promise you state money on demand’. This latter promise is the ‘deposits’, and they are not ‘inside the glass’, because the glass is in the assets section.</p><h3 id="dispelling-the-deposit-myth-from-fractional-reserve-">Dispelling the deposit myth from 'fractional reserve'</h3><p>But it gets better. Do you notice that 'deposits' on the liabilities side of Barclays balance sheet far exceed the 'cash and balances at central bank' category in their assets section? In our water metaphor, this means 'the promises for water we've issued out far exceeds the water in our glass'.</p><p>This is a result of what is sometimes called 'fractional reserve banking' (albeit I use the term 'credit creation of money')</p><p>Fractional reserve banking is a favourite bogeyman for bank critics to attack, but it's frequently misrepresented due to our misunderstanding about the nature of deposits. Let me explain.</p><p>If you start from the assumption that a deposit is a ‘thing inside the bank’, rather than a ‘thing issued out by the bank’, you will be prone to explaining fractional reserve banking as follows: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>‘I deposit money into the bank, but they then secretly give it away to someone else whilst telling you it is still there’</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If this is you, you've made an error, and have fallen into the trap of thinking that banks 'lend out the water that I've put inside them'. This also means you've failed to make a distinction between the two forms of money in our society: state money ('water'), and bank money ('promise for water'). And both of these misunderstandings are facilitated by the linguistic glitch we are trying to deprogram. </p><p>To accurately rewire your understanding, you must start from the recognition that your money ('bank deposits') is <em>issued out</em> by banks. The bank issues out promises for water in the glass, <em>but</em> - and this is crucial - they can issue out many more promises for water than they actually have. There is no process of them 'sneaking away water to give to someone else'. They don't touch the water. All they do is increase the number of promises they issue for it. Given that these bank promises are called deposits, it follows that deposits can be issued - and thereby expand - even if nothing was ‘deposited’. </p><p>But why would banks do that? Well, because they issue these short-term promises to extract more valuable long-term promises from the people they issue the short-term promises to. Those long-term promises end up in the assets section of the balance sheet, in that section called 'loans'. Yes, a loan is not 'water from the bank'. It is 'short-term promises for water from the bank, in exchange for long-term promises for water from you'.</p><p>Yes, banks can create assets by issuing liabilities, which is a more complex topic for another article, but if I had to adapt the water metaphor, I'd say something like <em>'when banks issue out excess promises for water in the glass, they conjur into being a portfolio of ghostly ice-statues that will attract melt-water towards the glass'...</em></p><p>That metaphor probably needs some work, but it's a good place to start.</p><h3 id="update-the-dictionary">Update the dictionary</h3><p>The verb-noun glitch creates all manner of weird anomalies when you start to play with it. For example, if I do indeed insist on 'depositing a bank deposit' it will in fact disappear, because - using our rewired understandings of those terms - that would actually mean 'handing back to the bank its own promises'. Incidentally, this is actually what happens when you 'repay a loan'. You are literally destroying bank money.</p><p>If that is too complex, don't worry. I'll make more articles and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/brettscott">money mythbusting videos</a> about this, with new metaphors.</p><p>I'll close, finally, with a suggestion for you Merriam-Webster, because I'm guessing you haven't updated this since 1828...</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>In order to avoid the time-consuming job of dealing with the spambots and fraudsters who troll comments sections, I've decided to try something different.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>I had this idea, when I started my <a href="https://haltakov.net/blog">personal blog</a> couple of months ago. I was writing on different topics like self-driving cars, technology and travel. Sometimes, I touched on topics about which I could write a whole new article. I had so many ideas, but how to decide, what to write about next? Wouldn't it be nice if I could just ask my readers?</p>
<p>I started adding small icons like this <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/example" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a> at suitable places in the text. The idea was that if a reader was interested about this topic, he could just click the icon to vote for it. No registration required, no filling of feedback forms - just a single click! This worked well and people reading my blog started clicking the vote links. There were some real surprises, about which topics people found interesting.</p>
<p>For example, I wrote an article about <a href="https://haltakov.net/blog/travel-planning/">travel planning</a>. My plan was to write a follow-up article about organizing the time during the trip. However, most people voted that they want to read about traveling with a baby instead and this is what I ended up <a href="https://haltakov.net/blog/flying-with-baby/">writing about</a> next.</p>

        <img src="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/images/building-open-blog-example.jpg" alt="Example vote link in Vladimir Haltakov's blog">
    </a></p><p>Vote link in one of the articles in my blog - most people clicked this one.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>The Prototype</h2>
<p>I didn't want to spend too much time coding a tool, before I knew that it will be useful. So, I found a nice way to set the whole thing up with a minimal effort, even if it was a hack...</p>
<p>I use a static site generator for my blog (<a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>) and host it on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. This means that I didn't have a server where I could run code and a database to store the results. I also didn't want to set the whole thing up before I knew it is worth it. However, I made use of two features that Netlify offers - custom <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/">redirect rules</a> and server side <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/">analytics</a>.</p>
<p>When somebody clicks a vote link, a simple JavaScript code would just make a GET request to a URL like that <code>https://haltakov.net/iwanttoreadmore/some-topic</code>. I created a rule that would redirect such requests it to an empty page <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/netlify-redirect" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a>. The result is not shown to the user - he will only see is a small toast that the vote is counted.</p>
<p>In the server side analytics, though, the original URL is counted every time somebody clicked on the vote link. I could then just look at the open counts for the <code>iwanttoreadmore</code> URLs and see which topics are more popular. In practice, getting the information was a bit cumbersome, because Netlify's analytics page only allows you to see the 15 URLs with the most visits. However, it fetches the data from a REST API, so I was able to call it with different parameters and get all the data <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/netlify-analytics" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a> (thanks <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/using-netlify-analytics-to-build-list-of-popular-posts/">Jim Nielsen</a>). In the end, I had statistics about which topics my readers found most interesting, which I used to decide which topics I should write about on my blog.</p>

    </a></p><p>Netlify statistics for the vote links.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>The Product</h2>
<p>I thought that if this tool is so useful to me, it may be useful to other bloggers as well. So, I started building as a real web service on <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">iwanttoreadmore.com</a>. I decided to build this project in the open <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/build-in-the-open" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a> and I have set myself the following goals for it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open source</strong>. I will open source all the code on <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Open metrics</strong>. I will make all the metrics and statistics public, starting with the <a href="https://plausible.io/iwanttoreadmore.com">web analytics</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Open development</strong>. I will write about how I make all important decisions during the development in <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog">this blog</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Simple</strong>. I will keep it as simple and as easy to use as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy oriented</strong>. I will only collect the data needed to count the votes and nothing else (not even IP addresses) and will not be sold.</li>
<li><strong>Paid service</strong>. It will be a paid service so my incentives will be aligned with those of my customers - providing the best product for them and not for advertisers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Experiment</h2>
<p>I benefited a lot from the indie hackers community and I want to give back to it. While building this project I'm learning many new things, so will write a tutorial for every major feature I implement (you can start with the first one for <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog/building-a-product-in-the-open/">creating a static site with Pelican</a>). There I will share why I chose specific design or technology and the steps to build it. The tutorials will use the exact same code I use to run the product.

Data privacy has always been a controversial topic for many consumer tech companies. This controversy once again jumped to the forefront of public discussion with recent <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/">allegations and revelations</a> about TikTok, the hugely popular social network based out of China with over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241788/tiktok-app-download-numbers-update-2-billion-users">2 billion downloads</a> worldwide. Above and beyond the constant, familiar critique from privacy advocates against the “old-school” tech giants (Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc), TikTok’s practices have breached beyond normal consumer privacy concerns to geo-political and national security concerns. Amazon reportedly recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/amazon-bans-tiktok-on-employee-phones-as-us-govt-scrutinizes-chinese-app/">banned employees from using TikTok</a>, and President Trump is <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/trump-pushes-a-tiktok-ban-everything-you-need-to-know/">apparently mulling a U.S. ban of TikTok</a>. </p><p>In a utopian society, tech companies and governments collect this information only to provide you with the best content. But in a dystopian society, tech companies resell your information to governments who use your data to surveil and censor their political opponents and to other malevolent third parties. </p><p>Decentralized applications and blockchain-based solutions have long aimed to solve these privacy and surveillance concerns, but public blockchains present their own challenges. At its core, a blockchain is an immutable, public ledger of transactions. Every transaction is visible to anyone running a full node. The entire history of the entire user base is recorded on chain, available for anyone with the tools to see. </p><h2 id="public-blockchains-are-not-private">Public Blockchains are not Private</h2><p>Privacy and censorship resistance have been core value propositions among blockchain advocates. &nbsp;A core ethos behind blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is to <strong>minimize trust and maximize user control over their data</strong>. For instance, Blockstack’s goal is to “give users direct ownership of their internet assets and protect user privacy” and Filecoin’s mission is to create a decentralized and trustless storage system. There are also whole classes of privacy tokens like Monero and Zcash that allow users to make transactions privately, and mixer apps like Tornado.cash that allow users to anonymize Ethereum transactions. </p><p>Even then, public blockchains like Ethereum still suffer from privacy issues. <strong>The public nature of Ethereum is a double-edged sword, because although it allows apps to run transparently, it also exposes user information, even if it is only pseudonymously.</strong> This limits use cases for blockchains as users cannot safely transfer sensitive information like personally identifiable information on Ethereum. Public blockchains need a decentralized privacy and encryption layer the way today’s web apps rely on protocols like SSL to ensure data privacy and integrity.</p><h2 id="nucypher-to-the-rescue">NuCypher to the Rescue</h2><p>NuCypher is a potential solution to this problem of user privacy on public blockchains. The protocol is a privacy layer for blockchains, and it enables end-to-end encrypted data sharing on public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum) and decentralized storage solutions (e.g. IPFS). <a href="https://www.nucypher.com/">NuCypher</a> allows users to conditionally grant and revoke access to data with multiple users at a time. As a result, it provides the backbone for applications that involve the transfer of sensitive data but also want to leverage the trustless security model of public blockchains.</p><p>The NuCypher protocol’s key technology is its proxy re-encryption (PRE). PRE is a way of encrypting data and then having an untrusted middleman, or proxy, transform that encrypted data so that recipients can decrypt it. The proxy does not learn anything about the underlying data, nor has access to private keys, thereby ensuring the data’s privacy. </p><p>The ability for proxies to perform this transformation is solely controlled by the data owner and therefore PRE gives the data owner ultimate control over the ability to grant and revoke decryption rights. Additionally, PRE is a more scalable privacy solution compared to other public key encryption technologies because 1) it is more suitable for communication that involves arbitrary numbers of data producers and consumers, and 2) it does not require knowing the eventual recipient of the encrypted data beforehand.</p><p>Below are some of the new use cases for decentralized applications that can be unlocked using NuCypher: </p><h3 id="1-sharing-encrypted-files-decentralized-dropbox-">1. Sharing encrypted files (“Decentralized Dropbox”)</h3><p>Files can be encrypted client-side and stored in decentralized or centralized 	filesystems. These files can be shared with approved third-parties securely and access permissions can be revoked at any time. Nubox is an example of this type of application and is currently live on NuCypher’s testnet.</p><h3 id="2-patient-controlled-electronic-health-records-ehr-">2. Patient-controlled electronic health records (EHR)</h3><p>Patients can own and control access to their medical data, as opposed to storing it with centralized systems like Epic. When patients want to share their data with a hospital or insurance company, they can grant temporary access. A recent NuCypher hackathon project built an application that leverages Nucypher to let patients securely share their medical data.</p><h3 id="3-end-to-end-encrypted-group-chat">3. End-to-end encrypted group chat</h3><p>NuCypher allows group messaging apps to grant multiple users access to end-to-end encrypted messages, instead of having to encrypt and send the same message individually to each participant. This allows for more scalable encrypted group chat apps.</p><p>Stay tuned for our deep dive into NuCypher next week to learn more about how NuCypher is bringing data privacy to decentralized applications.</p><hr><p><em>Legal Notice</em></p><p><em>This blog post is being distributed by Amalgamated Token Services Inc., dba “CoinList,” or one of its subsidiaries.

<p>In case you haven’t heard, <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=modules">ECMAScript modules (ESM) are now supported everywhere</a>!</p>



<p>While I do have <a href="#gripes">some gripes with them</a>, it’s too late for any of these things to change, so I’m embracing the good parts and have cautiously started using them in new projects. I do quite like that I can just use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import"><code>import</code> statements and dynamic <code>import()</code></a> for dependencies with URLs right from my JS, without module loaders, extra <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags in my HTML, or hacks with dynamic <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags and <code>load</code> events (in fact, <a href="https://blissfuljs.com/docs.html#fn-include">Bliss has had a helper for this very thing</a> that I’ve used extensively in older projects). I love that I don’t need any libraries for this, and I can use it client-side, anywhere, even in my codepens.</p>



<p>Once you start using ESM, you realize that most libraries out there are not written in ESM, nor do they include ESM builds. Many are still using globals, and those that target Node.js use CommonJS (CJS). What can we do in that case? Unfortunately, ES Modules are not really designed with any import <em>(pun intended)</em> mechanism for these syntaxes, but, there are some strategies we could employ.</p>



<h2>Libraries using globals</h2>



<p><strong>Technically, a JS file can be parsed as a module even with no imports or exports.</strong> Therefore, almost any library that uses globals can be fair game, it can just be imported as a module with no exports! How do we do that?</p>



<p>While you may not see this syntax a lot, you don’t actually need to name anything in the <code>import</code> statement. There is a syntax to import a module entirely for its side effects:</p>



<pre><code>import "url/to/library.js";</code></pre>



<p>This syntax works fine for libraries that use globals, since declaring a global is essentially a side effect, and all modules share the same global scope. For this to work, the imported library needs to satisfy the following conditions:</p>



<ul><li>It should declare the global as a property on <code>window</code> (or <code>self</code>), not via <code>var Foo</code> or <code>this</code>. In modules top-level variables are local to the module scope, and <code>this</code> is <code>undefined</code>, so the last two ways would not work.</li><li>Its code should not violate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode">strict mode</a></li><li>The URL is either same-origin or CORS-enabled. While <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> can run cross-origin resources, <code>import</code> sadly cannot.</li></ul>



<p>Basically, you are running a library as a module that was never written with the intention to be run as a module. Many are written in a way that also works in a module context, but not all. <a href="https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#_browsers-scripts-versus-modules">ExploringJS has an excellent summary of the differences between the two</a>. For example, here is <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/dyGQXOo?editors=0011">a trivial codepen loading jQuery</a> via this method.</p>



<h2>Libraries using CJS without dependencies</h2>



<p>I dealt with this today, and it’s what prompted this post. I was trying to play around with <a href="https://github.com/reworkcss/css">Rework CSS</a>, a CSS parser used by the <a href="https://httparchive.org/">HTTPArchive</a> for analyzing CSS in the wild. However, all its code and documentation assumes Node.js. If I could avoid it, I’d really rather not have to make a Node.js app to try this out, or have to dive in module loaders to be able to require CJS modules in the browser. Was there anything I could do to just run this in a codepen, no strings attached?</p>



<p>After a little googling, I found <a href="https://github.com/reworkcss/css/issues/117">this issue</a>. So there was a JS file I could import and get all the parser functionality. Except …there was one little problem. When you look <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/reworkcss/css@latest/lib/parse/index.js">at the source</a>, it uses <code>module.exports</code>. If you just <code>import</code> that file, you predictably get an error that <code>module</code> is not defined, not to mention there are no ESM exports.</p>



<p>My first thought was to stub <code>module</code> as a global variable, import this as a module, and then read <code>module.exports</code> and give it a proper name:</p>



<pre><code>window.module = {};
import "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/reworkcss/css@latest/lib/parse/index.js";
console.log(module.exports);</code></pre>



<p>However, I was still getting the error that <code>module</code> was not defined. How was that possible?! They all share the same global context!! <em>*pulls hair out*</em> After some debugging, it dawned on me: <a href="https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#_imports-are-hoisted">static <code>import</code> statements are hoisted</a>; the “module” was getting executed before the code that imports it and stubs <code>module</code>.</p>



<p>Dynamic imports to the rescue! <code>import()</code> is executed exactly where it’s called, and returns a promise. So this actually works:</p>



<pre><code>window.module = {};
import("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/reworkcss/css@latest/lib/parse/index.js").then(_ =&gt; {
	console.log(module.exports);
});</code></pre>



<p>We could even turn it into a wee function, which I cheekily called <code>require()</code>:</p>



<pre><code>async function require(path) {
	let _module = window.module;
	window.module = {};
	await import(path);
	let exports = module.exports;
	window.module = _module; // restore global
	return exports;
}

(async () =&gt; { // top-level await cannot come soon enough…

let parse = await require("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/reworkcss/css@latest/lib/parse/index.js");
console.log(parse("body { color: red }"));

})();</code></pre>



<p>You can fiddle with this code in a <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/jOWQMzN?editors=0011">live pen here</a>.</p>



<p>Do note that this technique will only work if the module you’re importing doesn’t import other CJS modules. If it does, you’d need a more elaborate <code>require()</code> function, which is left as an exercise for the reader. Also, just like the previous technique, the code needs to comply with strict mode and not be cross-origin.</p>



<p>A similar technique can be used to load AMD modules via <code>import()</code>, just stub <code>define()</code> and you’re good to go.</p>



<p>So, with this technique I was able to quickly whip up a <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/qBbQdGG">ReworkCSS playground</a>. You just edit the CSS in CodePen and see the resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a>, and you can even fork it to share a specific AST with others! 🙂</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Update: CJS with static imports</h2>



<p>After this article was posted, a clever hack was <a href="https://twitter.com/justinfagnani/status/1285325206811107329">pointed out to me on Twitter</a>:</p>



<figure><p>
There was a problem connecting to Twitter.
</p></figure>



<p>While this works great if you can have multiple separate files, it doesn’t work when you’re e.g. quickly trying out a pen. Data URIs to the rescue! <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/XWXoEJq?editors=0010">Turns out you can <code>import</code> a module from a data URI</a>!</p>



<p>So let’s <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/xxZmWvx">adapt our Rework example to use this</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="gripes">Addendum: ESM gripes</h2>



<p>Since I was bound to get questions about what my gripes are with ESM, I figured I should mention them pre-emptively.</p>



<p>First off, a little context. Nearly all of the JS I write is for libraries. <a href="https://github.com/leaverou">I write libraries as a hobby</a>, <a href="https://mavo.io/">I write libraries as my job</a>, and sometimes <a href="https://inspirejs.org/">I write libraries to help me do my job</a>. My job is usability (HCI) research (and specifically making programming easier), so I’m very sensitive to developer experience issues. I want my libraries to be usable not just by seasoned developers, but by novices too.</p>



<p>ESM has not been designed with novices in mind. It evolved from the CJS/UMD/AMD ecosystem, in which most voices are seasoned developers. </p>



<p>My main gripe with them, is how they expect full adoption, and settle for nothing less. There is no way to create a bundle of a library that can be used <em>both</em> traditionally, with a global, or as an ES module. There is also no standard way to import older libraries, or libraries using other module patterns (yes, this very post is about doing that, but essentially these are hacks, and there should be a better way). I understand the benefits of static analysis for imports and exports, but I wish there was a dynamic alternative to <code>export</code>, analogous to the dynamic <code>import()</code>.</p>



<p>In terms of migrating to ESM, I also dislike how opinionated they are: strict mode is great, but forcing it doesn’t help people trying to migrate older codebases. Restricting them to cross-origin is also a pain, using <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>s from other domains made it possible to quickly experiment with various libraries, and I would love for that to be true for modules too. </p>



<p>But overall, I’m excited that JS now natively supports a module mechanism, and I expect any library I release in the future to utilize it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>One of the most important and unacknowledged pieces of my development workflow is the power of copy &amp; paste. How else would I transfer code of Stack Overflow into my editor? But seriously, I copy &amp; paste like a mad man and tend to pile up a ton of notes.</p><h2>💾 Do you want to save the changes to the following 39 files?</h2><p>While working on a project this quickly gets out of hand when I have tons of <code>Untitled-39</code> tabs open filled with code snippets, CLI commands, terminal traces, things I don't want to forget, which are visually indistinguishable from one another and aren’t particularly easy to find among the other 15 version-tracked files open. I don’t really want to save these things in the project, and if I put them on my desktop they wind up getting shuffled into a folder or, most likely, the trash.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/3/headline.png"></p><p>The next time I'm picking up a project again I often find myself looking through google results for visited Stack Overflow pages, or browsing through old projects to see if I can find that one example I sort of remember. To make matters worse for myself, I prefer to run a single workspace per project, or just pull up individual folders in VS Code my search quickly expands to all of my file system. This problem is why we have designed the Scratchpad in Marquee. A smart inter-workspace clipboard to keep track of your valuable notes.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://marquee.activecove.com/">Install Marquee</a>, if you haven't already 🙌</p></blockquote><h2>💡 Scratchpad, a smart inter-workspace clipboard to keep track of your valuable notes.</h2><p>Conveniently you can create a new scratch snippet from two places, by clicking the scratchpad's "plus" button (top right corner of widget). Or, just make a selection in your editor, right click, and select “Add note to Marquee”.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/3/scratchpad.gif"></p><p>If added form the editor, notes will automatically be added in both the Scratch widget and the tree view naming it after the file it originated from. Double-click the note in the widget to inline edit (thanks to language detection, should be nicely syntax highlighted). Super fast filtering functionality is available to quickly sift through thousands of snippets, so you can create and filter to your heart’s content.</p><h2>🏌️ My development workflow with the scratchpad</h2><p>I like to have quick access to my scratchpad and to do that, I keep Marquee's tree view open on the left next to my code. When coding, I collapse News and Todos. This way I'm not distracted unless I want to be, and can quickly insert or create notes directly into my file. The file tree is only one click away to navigate my project and the terminal at the bottom giving me quick access to yarn install etc in the repo.</p><blockquote><p>Be sure to <a href="https://marquee.activecove.com/">install Marquee</a> and test drive it for yourself 🛺</p></blockquote><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/3/editing.gif"></p><h2>🤔 Making notes &amp; todos even more useful</h2><p>We are considering adding the ability to tag your snippets, and filter by tag and or language, the ability to jump directly back to the line in the file where the snippet came from, or add the global vs workspace scoping we currently provide for todos.</p><p>Do you like my workflow? What about yours? Tell us by clicking the feedback button in the Marquee welcome widget and let us know about what features your development workflow desires.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><em>As a Senior Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), Diorge Tavares has been working with FlightAware’s Predictive Technologies team, using machine learning to bring flight arrival predictions to production in FlightAware Foresight. </em></p><p>FlightAware has been tracking flights since 2005. As you can imagine, we have a ton of flight tracking data; it’s in the petabyte range compressed! With a little machine learning, we could do some very interesting things with this data and help airlines optimize operations by providing better estimated times of arrivals (ETAs) for flights. This means that travelers can get to their destinations quicker—for example, an airline might have capacity to run two more flights in a day because they weren’t held up due to a poorly-estimated flight arrival; that’s a win for everyone.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>The Predictive Technologies Team</h2><p>By mid-2019, the Predict Team was running full force and brought our first client onboard: Frankfurt Airport. This marked a major milestone for something that had its roots in a hackathon idea. Today, major airlines are using our services at hundreds of airports. We started with about 200 models and have scaled our extract, transform, and load (ETL) process and live streaming machine learning and batch workflows to more than 1100 training models.<br></p><h2>Cross-team SRE<br></h2><p>The goal was to have the Predict Team deliver a product that was reliable, easy to deploy, and easy to support. To make this happen while also accelerating our pace of development, we decided to embed a site reliability engineer (SRE) on the team alongside developers. I volunteered. <br></p><p>I was looking forward to it and thought it would be fun, but I’ll admit it took a bit to wrap my head around this new machine learning world. I stared in confusion at everyone throwing unfamiliar jargon around with ease. I was still a part of the core SRE team, but my focus was on the Predict Team. I knew I was getting the hang of this new world when my core SRE team colleagues would reflect that same stare of confusion when I gave my morning standup updates. <br></p><p>By joining the Predict Team, I was able to help in several ways. For example, it takes time to funnel new work through the workload queue. Skipping this queue and giving the Predict Team instant access to getting operations tasks done allowed us to speed up the entire development process.</p><p>Since I would be involved from the beginning of an infrastructure buildout, I could provide reliability and redundancy expertise to make it a stable and reliable setup from the beginning. Our in-house live prediction streaming environment originally spanned two datacenters with six servers at each datacenter. That was later doubled to 12 at each datacenter, and ultimately processed more than 1.6 million evaluations per live streaming cluster per second.<br></p><p>One of the initial steps we took was to setup Jenkins to automate CI/CD pipelines for building and deploying images into the environment. This allowed for rapid and consistent deployments.<br></p><p>From a process improvement perspective, attending meetings for both the Predict Team and main SRE team allowed me to share processes and information between the two to improve both teams’ processes.<br></p><h2>Machine Learning<br></h2><p>The machine learning aspect started with a batch workflow stack with Hadoop and Spark systems for ETL and Docker to run inferences. Inferences are drawn when we give a model a new data set and allow it to infer flight arrival times or predictions. For example, we train a model with a year of data from January 2018 to January 2019 and then run an inference for February 2019 to obtain predictions for February and allow the model to work on new data. We needed a good bit of scale to perform these tasks en masse. <br></p><p>We started with about 200 airports with one “arrival time on runway” (or ON) model per airport. As we continued our work, we expanded the number of supported airports, and created a second class of models to estimate “arrival time at gate” (or IN). We ultimately supported 554 airports (1,108 models with two models per airport).<br></p><p>The second part came from our live streaming predictions. From our streaming API product Firehose, customers could access real-time predictions for flights in the air. This used the same models that are part of our batch workflow to follow live flight tracking data and create predictions. This service has a high-uptime SLA and cannot afford to take service impact from upgrades. We set up redundancy within and across datacenters and we could bring down a streamer node in each datacenter and still provide our streaming live prediction service.<br></p><p>To bring Foresight ETAs to production we had rigorous requirements. This service would be relied upon by airlines to determine flight schedules, delays (when needed), and could make a big impact on travelers and the airlines’ bottom line. This needed to be at launch a mature, high availability service. We made the decision to run these on-premises, but we needed to be able to perform maintenance and upgrades without service impacts. As a result, we set up redundancy within each of our two datacenters and across the datacenters. We can bring down a streamer node in each datacenter and still provide our streaming live prediction service.<br></p><p>Just tracking the metrics this created was a challenge. At any point in time, we need to view error rates on the predictions and then retain these so we can refer back to them as needed. Our main monitoring platform, Zabbix, couldn’t handle the massive amount of metrics we would send it. The solution was TimescaleDB (Postgres with a time series database extension) with a Grafana front end to generate the graphs for this. It worked well and could handle all of the needed metrics while at the same time not ballooning in size, which is something Zabbix would have ended up doing.<br></p><h2>Did Someone Say Cloud?<br></h2><p>It was clear that to create training sets and models in a reasonable time to address model drift, bug fixes, and feature requests by customers, we needed to massively scale. If we made a code change, we could not wait weeks to train our models and see how it worked. Also, it would be hard to meet client’s tight deadlines if it took us weeks to retrain our models and meet sales needs for updated prediction graphs for sales meetings. We had a need for speed. <br></p><p>We started with an in-house Spark cluster of about 12 machines. Just for a baseline, someone would spend a week to generate updated datasets to then turn around and run inferences for our batch process. Generating datasets for an entire year (the time frame we use to train our models) would take <em>weeks</em>, if not longer. I haven’t even touched on the topic training the models, which would take a 32+ core machine and keep at 100% CPU usage on all cores for over 24 hours, depending on the airport size for which we were creating a model.<br></p><p>Instead of using more on-premises hardware, we decided to evaluate some cloud providers (IBM, Azure, Google, and Amazon Web Services) to determine which would be the best fit for our needs factoring cost, support, scaling needs and workflow. I started this evaluation with the idea that I would get the best real-world results by running real-world workloads on them. We learned some surprising things.<br></p><h2>The Cloud Evaluation<br></h2><p>Our cloud stack included Apache Spark and Kubernetes to train our models with a custom docker image. It was our goal to be vendor agnostic; to accomplish this we opted to write our workflows so they could run in the cloud and in-house. Argoproj (a Kubernetes workflow engine that supports DAG and step-based workflows) was a big help in covering our model training, which had multiple stages we could batch with Argo and run both in-house and in the cloud. Even our managed Spark could still run it in our in-house Spark cluster. <br></p><h3>Options 1 and 2: IBM and Azure<br></h3><p>We decided against IBM and Azure. IBM’s workflow for Spark didn’t scale the way we wanted it to; it required obtaining a password for accessing each individual cluster. Since we used an individual cluster for each day of a training set for the second phase, if we were creating a dataset for a year that would require pulling in 365 (days in a year) passwords and switching between them if we needed to access the clusters to debug. This was handled better at Google or AWS with a service account that had permissions to the needed resources. <br></p><p>Azure required us to sign a million-dollar contract for our quota needs. Although they eventually provided an option to get around this by using a third party vendor, all the hoops they made us jump through pushed us in the direction of Google and AWS. We questioned what difficulties we might have if we needed more resources in the future.<br></p><h3>Option 3: Google<br></h3><p>Google gave us our first quota approval after a good bit of smaller requests and account team pushing. They got us up to 100,000 vCPU core quota that we could use. They asked for a lot of capacity planning meetings, but we were actually able to use our quota. <br></p><p>As we started using it, we ran into a few problems with Kubernetes on Google. First, the cluster would go into a non-responsive state. We determined this was because of upgrades that Google performs and for our usage we spin up Kubernetes clusters, run our batch training, and then spin it down. Although we configured for no upgrades to be done while our jobs were running, they were still happening across multiple zones. Google offered a few solutions, but they seemed to be temporary Band-Aids versus fixing the root problem. <br></p><p>Second, Google’s beginner-friendly approach wasn’t a good fit for us. We could get up and running faster, but it ended up being <em>more</em> difficult because our custom model training requirements didn’t always fit in the box of their AutoMagic setup. It would have been nice to be able to see under the hood and configure things as we wanted.<br></p><h3>Option 4: Amazon Web Services (AWS) <br></h3><p>AWS provided the most quota we had thus far, in the realm of 3600 instances (they were using instance counts at that …</p></section></div>

<p><small><em>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 21:37:19 +0200</em></small></p>

<p>Many browsers today are gigantic resource hogs, which are basically
VMs for various web applications. On the other hand, <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">Links</a> is a HTML
browser. It is not able to do everything. It allows me to avoid most
distractions and control the content-experience. The goal of this
exercise is not to force anyone to use this browser, but just to be
watchful and conscious of their hypertext based internet usage (one
might use gopher, and this phlog is available there, but probability
tells me that a person reading this reads this from hypertext source
and I am sure they are lovely).</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>I use links compiled with X11 support and with <a href="https://gist.github.com/lich-tex/4795eeccf9b4e9ae21c94a65f7527ff2">Xembed patch</a> for
<a href="https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/">tabbed</a>. I execute it using <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/glinks">a script</a>, and then I use <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/dsurfraw">surfraw with
dmenu</a> to have a uniform search function and bookmarks that work with
all my browsers. That is all you need to know. Interesting trivia:
Julian Assange made surfraw. Huh.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<p>First, I want to focus on ‘destruction’ of CSS. As Links does not
support modern CSS it renders most of the internet as-is, and will
only contain images (on which I will write later). CSS causes the
internet to become a baroque set of arbitrary design decisions, and
does not contribute positively to the general experience. Links (after
2.19) allows me to pick my own font, my own background/foreground/url
color. Thus, I have a uniform experience. In that I already visibly
save time/energy/brain processing power, etc. To deal with senselessly
complex sites (news pages with &gt;1 MB JS, I am looking at you) I use
and <a href="https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/miniwebproxy">tedu’s miniwebproxy</a>. It delimits the content even more, and
removes elements that are not of interest for me (top,bottom,side
bars, recommended content, etc.).</p>

<h2>JS</h2>

<p>JS is the main cause for the way internet changed, for better or
worse. It changed content into dissimilar applications. It allowed for
measurement of attention and penalization of the experience. I am
critical of that, and Links has no JS support. Perfect. Nothing more
to be spoken of. If I need JS I will use another browser which
emulates anything Google considers good internet experience. But, that
<em>currently</em> is not my goal.</p>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Now, going from a little controversy to a giant controversy. Images (in the
modern web) are uninformative, but are simply advertisements of
content. They are made to take over your attention and again, make the
experience less uniform. Links does not force you to disable images
(as there are cases when they are useful - i.e. Wikipedia), but has a
function to not load them. Again, as with everything it allows for
more uniformity.</p>

<h2>Sad facts</h2>

<p>The word attempt is key here, and primarily I use it for Wikipedia
articles, directed searches (with surfraw), browsing youtube
through <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, browsing twitter through <a href="https://nitter.net/">nitter.net</a>, but sadly
majority of my usage still ends up in a Chrome-like (that includes
Firefox). But writing and thinking like this allows to see what are
the issues with the modern web and how they can be approached. Using Links
is a radical solution, but as with many <a href="https://www.rationalwalk.com/via-negativa-wisdom-through-subtraction/">via negativa</a> solutions, they
teach us what are the things that are needed for valuable UX.</p>

<h2>Should I?</h2>

<p>I think trying is great. I have not explained how to do it, cause the
task of that is manpages and other analysis to get to know your wanted
experience, and not the wanted experience of someone else. Although,
it just maybe a continuation of a liberal dream of ability to control
your own consumer experience. The reality is you never have to, as
there is no possibility of changing the entire <em>internet</em> for better,
but you might find things that you can make better. Or only not worse.
You can also try out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a>, but it is much more radical experience.</p>

<![CDATA[Is every game of Slay the Spire winnable?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>There is a lot of randomness in a game of Slay the Spire. From the cards and relics offered, to the potions dropped, to the map layouts and random encounters, very little remains the same between two playthroughs. This is part of the beauty of the game, forcing you to adapt and make the most out of the resources you have been given in each new attempt. However, with such randomness comes a natural question: can every run of Slay the Spire be won? In this article, I will discuss what I believe to be the current state of knowledge about the answer to this question.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-interpretations-of-the-question">The two interpretations of the question</h2>

<p>Before we begin answering, first there is one detail to get straight: the question of whether every game can be won can actually be interpreted in two different ways. Both are valid and interesting questions, and have very different answers. Here are some more precise formulations of each question:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“Can a perfect player win every game of Slay the Spire?” (alternatively, “Is there a strategy that achieves a 100% win rate in Slay the Spire?”)</li>
  <li>“For every <em>seed</em> of Slay the Spire, is there a sequence of decisions that results in a win?”</li>
</ol>

<p>The first question concerns the performance of a player that makes the theoretically optimal decisions at every point in the game to maximize its win rate, given the information available. Generally, there is no computationally feasible way to actually play optimally, so this question is very difficult to answer. However, in many respects, it is the more useful question to a player looking to maximize their own win rate, as it shows how close they are to playing optimally. As an example for how to answer these types of questions, however, we may look at another game with heavy randomness: Minesweeper.</p>

<p>Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the objective is to find the hidden locations of mines, using the number of surrounding mines as clues. Despite having simple rules, perfect play is still very difficult to achieve. However, even without knowing how to play perfectly, we can still prove that a perfect player cannot win every game. For example, in the Minesweeper game below, the two remaining mines can either be in the squares marked “A” or the squares marked “B”, and a guess must be made. Because such positions are guaranteed to arise in some seeds, not every game of Minesweeper can be won, even following an optimal strategy.</p>

<p><img src="https://forgottenarbiter.github.io/images/image-20200621005308075.png" alt="image-20200621005308075"></p>

<p>Now, I’ve used the word <em>seed</em> twice, but what does it mean? In a computer game with randomness, a seed is a sequence of letters or numbers which determines all of the randomness in a playthrough. For Minesweeper, this means all the mines are in the same location each time you play a seed. Therefore, each seed is winnable by simply learning which squares do not contain mines. To summarize, for Minesweeper, the answer to our two questions would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“Can a perfect player win every game?” <strong>No.</strong></li>
  <li>“Can every seed be won?” <strong>Yes.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>We can go even further, and refine our answer to question 1, by asking how often a perfect player is expected to win. Again, this question is usually impossible to answer exactly, but because any strategy’s win rate is a lower bound for the optimal win rate, we can develop intuition about the answer by analyzing the win rate of players. In particular, for Minesweeper, I found that computer programs have been written to obtain about a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minesweeper/comments/8my10k/automated_solver_with_high_win_rate/">40% win rate</a> on Expert difficulty, which means that with perfect play, you can expect to win at least 40% of the time.</p>

<p>For Slay the Spire, however, answering either question is much more difficult, due to the much higher complexity of the game. For this post, I will mostly focus on the second question, of whether a completely impossible seed exists. This is because the existence of an impossible seed is much easier to definitively establish, and if an impossible seed exists, then obviously a perfect player also cannot win on that impossible seed, also answering question 1. However, at the end of the post, I will also provide my thoughts about the win rate of optimal play.</p>

<h2 id="randomness-in-slay-the-spire">Randomness in Slay the Spire</h2>

<p>Randomness and seeds in Slay the Spire are much more complicated than they are in Minesweeper. However, every random event in a run of Slay the Spire is still determined by the game seed, which can be found on the top right of the screen in-game. Using the same seed and making the same decisions always results in the same outcomes. However, the exact mechanics of the game’s randomness are too complicated to cover here. For the purposes of this post, it is sufficient to note that the following things are almost always the same for a seed, no matter what the player does:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The map layouts</li>
  <li>The order of the normal and elite fights in each act</li>
  <li>The bonuses offered by Neow at the start of the run (for this post I assume there is a Neow bonus)</li>
  <li>The contents of unknown (?) rooms on the map (e.g. the first unknown room is always an event in this seed)</li>
  <li>The enemy AI for a particular encounter (not counting things like splitting slimes)</li>
</ul>

<p>And these things can often have a fairly small number of different outcomes depending on prior choices in the run (for example, taking a card from Neow may change the card rewards from the first combat node):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Card rewards</li>
  <li>Potion drops</li>
  <li>The order of events encountered</li>
  <li>Outcomes of events</li>
  <li>Contents of shops</li>
</ul>

<p>The important takeaway here is that there is only a very limited amount that the player can manipulate their deck, relics, potions, and encounters, especially early in Act 1. This means that there may really be a possibility for a seed having such bad card, relic, and encounter options that it is completely impossible, no matter what the player does.</p>

<h2 id="what-might-an-unwinnable-seed-look-like">What might an unwinnable seed look like?</h2>

<p>Since aspects like map layouts, potion drops, events, combats, Neow rewards, and card rewards are mostly static when replaying the same seed, a good starting point is to try to design the worst outcomes for each of these categories, and ask if those outcomes are enough to force the player to lose. For this, we will focus on a particular ruleset of Slay the Spire: Ascension 20 Silent. This choice is made because of the extra difficulty that Silent faces in defeating early elite encounters in Act 1, before the player can tailor their resources towards the specific problems posed by a given seed. In particular:</p>

<h3 id="silent-cannot-kill-lagavulin-with-the-starter-deck">Silent cannot kill Lagavulin with the starter deck.</h3>

<p>By considering the maximum damage that can be dealt with perfect shuffle luck, it is possible to prove that killing Lagavulin is impossible with Silent’s starter deck. She simply cannot deal enough damage before her strength is reduced to -6, and all attacks become ineffective. Let us consider an example fight (Strike=S, Defend=D, Neutralize=N, Survivor=U, Ascender’s Bane=B):</p>

<p>Because we can only play 5 strikes and 1 Neutralize per two turns, the maximum damage dealt to Lagavulin turns out to be 110 on Ascension 20, with the starter deck. However, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsxNXebbELpcCi8N7FVOTNGdX_K9-BRC_LMgx4TORo4/edit#gid=1989923881&amp;range=B84">Lagavulin always has at least 112 HP</a>, so victory is impossible.</p>

<h3 id="the-game-can-force-an-elite-fight-on-floor-6">The game can force an elite fight on floor 6.</h3>

<p>With particularly bad luck, the map generation algorithm can force the player to fight an elite on floor 6, which is the lowest possible floor for elites to spawn. With even more bad luck, the map might not have any shops or rest sites before this forced elite fight. This severely restricts the resources the player can have going into this forced elite fight.</p>

<p><img src="https://forgottenarbiter.github.io/images/image-20200621204739562.png" alt="image-20200621204739562"></p>

<h3 id="the-silent-might-not-find-any-useful-cards-or-potions-before-floor-6">The Silent might not find any useful cards or potions before floor 6</h3>

<p>We already know the Silent cannot kill Lagavulin without additional card rewards, due to a lack of damage in her starting deck. Of course, the Silent will not fight Lagavulin until floor 6, but the game may not actually give any useful resources in this period. For example, here is a set of options from Neow which does not help the Silent deal damage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove one card</li>
  <li>Gain 100 gold</li>
  <li>Gain 250 gold, lose HP</li>
  <li>Boss swap (for Black Star)</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to how potion drops work, even after fighting the maximum of five fights before the first elite, there is a 0.72% chance of still not receiving a potion from any of them. Even if a potion drops, many, such as the Dexterity Potion, do not help the Silent deal more damage.</p>

<p>Finally, there are many Silent cards which do not increase the amount of damage that can be dealt to Lagavulin with the basic deck. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deflect</li>
  <li>Outmaneuver</li>
  <li>Piercing Wail</li>
  <li>Accuracy</li>
  <li>Blur</li>
  <li>Concentrate</li>
  <li>Escape Plan</li>
  <li>Footwork</li>
  <li>Reflex</li>
</ul>

<p>It is entirely possible, though extraordinarily unlikely, to be offered only cards from this list in the first five floors of the game, plus from Neow. Therefore, we have the following theoretical scenario for an unwinnable run:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Forced Lagavulin elite fight on floor 6, with no shops or rest sites on the first five floors</li>
  <li>No Neow bonuses, potion drops, or card rewards which help the player deal damage to Lagavulin</li>
</ol>

<p>If any seed contains all of these components, then that seed cannot be won (on A20 Silent), no matter what the player does. Therefore, it seems likely that an unwinnable seed exists.</p>

<h2 id="finding-an-unwinnable-seed">Finding an unwinnable seed</h2>

<p>Now that we have constructed a set of circumstances that produce an unwinnable seed, the natural next step is to find such a seed. Fortunately, a long time ago, I created a <a href="https://github.com/ForgottenArbiter/SeedSearch">tool</a> for exactly this task. I programmed the search to find seeds with the following parameters, assuming ascension 20 Silent play on PC with full unlocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A forced floor-6 elite fight with no shops or rest sites below it</li>
  <li>No useful Neow rewards or boss relic swaps</li>
  <li>Not many useful damage cards in the first few card rewards (it was too restrictive to filter for no damage cards whatsoever)</li>

            <p>If you are a Node.js developer, using npm packages won’t be a new concept to you. From complex npm packages like express to simple packages, npm hosts a large number of Node.js libraries that simplify the workload of Node developers. But have you ever thought about publishing a Node library of your own to help fellow developers? In today’s tutorial, we are going through the steps you have to follow when publishing your own Node.js library using npm.</p>
<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin…</h2>
<p>Before we begin this, you should have the following things set up.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub account</a></li>
<li>Node.js and npm installed (<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Installation steps</a>)</li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm account</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have all of the above set up, let’s get to publishing the library.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are creating a simple library that converts a sentence to title case (in which the first letter of every word is capitalized).</p>

</figure>

<p>When choosing a name for the npm package, you have to check whether the name is available on the official <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm website</a>. Your package name should be unique if you are publishing it as an unscoped (public) package.</p>
<p>However, if the package is scoped, or private, the package name does not have to be unique and the name takes the format of @username/package-name. You can find out more about scoped packages <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/using-npm/scope.html#:~:text=Scoped%20packages%20can%20be%20published,registries%20at%20the%20same%20time.">here</a>.</p>
<p>The name of the package we are going to create is “title-case-converter”.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="create-a-github-repository">Create a GitHub repository</h2>
<p>Create a new repository named “title-case-converter” in GitHub. Make sure to initialize the repository with a README. Choose an appropriate license like the MIT license as well.</p>
<hr>

<p>Save your name, email, and website (if any) to npm. These details will be added to the package.json file of the project when it’s created.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">npm set init.author.name "&lt;your-name&gt;"
npm set init.author.email "&lt;your-email-address"&gt;
npm set init.author.url "&lt;your-website-url&gt;"
</code></pre></div><p>Then, log in to npm with the command npm login. You will be prompted to enter the credentials you used to create the npm account.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="initialize-the-project">Initialize the project</h2>
<p>Create a new directory for the project and initialize it using the <code>npm init</code> command. Make sure to fill out <strong>package-name</strong>, <strong>version</strong>, <strong>description</strong>, <strong>git repository</strong>, <strong>keywords</strong>, and <strong>license</strong> fields to add these details to the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">(base) ➜  title-case-converter npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install &lt;pkg&gt;` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

</figure>

<p>Note how we are using the version 1.0.0 for this package. This is the version we should use for the initial version of a package published to npm.</p>
<p>Npm uses a versioning system called Semantic Versioning (SemVer). The default starting version is 1.0.0. In future updates of your package, there are three types of version changes you can make following SemVer standards. These 3 are named patch, minor, and major.</p>
<ol>
<li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
<li>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and</li>
<li>PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.</p>
<p>You can read more about SemVer versioning <a href="https://semver.org/">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="create-the-node-module">Create the Node module</h2>
<p>Now we can implement our package, title-case-converter.</p>
<p>Create a file named <code>app.js</code> (or whichever you set as your entry point) and add the following code to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>converter</span>(<span>sentence</span>){
    <span>let</span> <span>capitalized</span> <span>=</span> []
    <span>let</span> <span>words</span> <span>=</span> <span>sentence</span>.<span>split</span>(<span>" "</span>) <span>//split the sentence into words
</span><span></span>    <span>words</span>.<span>forEach</span>(<span>word</span> =&gt; { 
        <span>let</span> <span>capitalizedWord</span> <span>=</span> <span>word</span>.<span>slice</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>).<span>toUpperCase</span>() <span>+</span> <span>word</span>.<span>slice</span>(<span>1</span>) <span>//capitalize the first letter of every word
</span><span></span>        <span>capitalized</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>capitalizedWord</span>)         
    })
    <span>let</span> <span>converted</span> <span>=</span> <span>capitalized</span>.<span>join</span>(<span>" "</span>) 
    <span>return</span> <span>converted</span>
}

<span>module</span>.<span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>converter</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It contains a single function called <code>converter</code>, which accepts a string sentence and capitalizes the first letter of every word in it. The most important part of the above code is exporting the created function using <code>module.exports</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="initialize-git">Initialize Git</h2>
<p>Now, we are going to initialize git for our project using the command <code>git init</code>. Then, stage the files we changed, using the following command.</p>
<p>In the next step, commit the changes of code to the local repository.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">git commit -m "initial changes"
</code></pre></div><p>After this, we have to add the GitHub repository as the project’s remote repository.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">git remote add origin &lt;GitHub repository URL&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Pull the changes from the remote repository and then push the local changes to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">git pull origin master
git push origin master
</code></pre></div><hr>
<h2 id="write-a-good-readme-file-for-the-package">Write a good README file for the package</h2>
<p>Including a good README is crucial when publishing an npm package. It gives the other users the basic rundown of what your package does and how they can use it in their projects.</p>
<p>You can find a template to create a good README <a href="https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2">here</a>. To get a better idea about how your README should look, you can browse popular npm packages and GitHub repositories to see how others have done it.</p>
<p>Generally, a README should cover the following fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>A small description of what your package does.</li>
<li>How another user can install the package to use it in their project.</li>
<li>How to use the package in a project. Provide code examples explaining the usage.</li>
<li>How to contribute to your package. If you expect other open-source developers to contribute to this project, this field is a must-add to the README file.</li>
<li>The license used by the package. For this package, we used the MIT license.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these changes don’t forget to commit and push.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="publish-the-package-to-npm">Publish the package to npm</h2>
<p>Even though the concept of publishing a library feels like a lot of work when you first hear about it, this step is surprisingly simple. All you have to do is run the following command in your command-line.</p>
<p>If you chose a package name that doesn’t clash with existing npm packages, this step should go smoothly and in a matter of seconds, your first package will be published to npm.</p>
<p>Now you can create a new Node.js project and install your new package as a dependency using this command.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">npm install title-case-converter --save
</code></pre></div><p>Then, you can import the package to the new project and use it to convert sentences to the title-case as you wish.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>converter</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>"title-case-converter"</span>)

<span>let</span> <span>convertedSentence</span> <span>=</span> <span>converter</span>(<span>"my name is juan"</span>) <span>//"My Name Is Juan"
</span></code></pre></div><p>That’s it! You are now a proud owner of a published npm package.</p>
<p>You can try your hand at creating a more complex Node.js module and publish it to npm after this.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you may of have expected publishing an NPM package is a simple task, and you don’t always need to follow the same steps in the same order like it was explained in this tutorial. You can assign the author, or make modifications to the package name or any other attributes later on by using npm commands or simply editing the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<p>I hope you learned something new today, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>

July 21, 2020 | https://nora.codes/post/back-to-zsh/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nora.codes/post/back-to-zsh/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I’ve gone back to using <code>zsh</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> rather than <code>fish</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> as my primary shell,
for the same reason I use Vim over Emacs - <code>zsh</code> is lightweight, compatible, present,
and (with Oh My Zsh<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and Starship<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>) very featureful.</p>
<p>First of all, <code>zsh</code> feels snappy.
To be totally fair to <code>fish</code>, which is a wonderful project, I did not objectively
measure this, but subjectively, <code>zsh</code> starts faster than <code>fish</code>.
I tried using <code>zsh</code> without any extensions for a while,
but found that a lot of <code>fish</code> features were missing, and I was a lot less productive.
In the end, I wound up installing Oh My Zsh! and Starship,
but even with the added burden of all this code,
tapping Meta+Enter to pull up a terminal feels snappier with <code>zsh</code>.</p>
<p>The big downside of <code>fish</code> is that it’s not anywhere close to POSIX compliant.
Of course, that’s one of its stated goals - to build a <em>new</em> kind of shell -
but, nonetheless, it really hampers its utility in a lot of situations.
While compatibility layers do exist, I found them fiddly at best and hopelessly
broken at worst.
<code>zsh</code>, on the other hand, does a great job running all the <code>bash</code> and <code>sh</code> scripts
and snippets I use to configure machines, most of which I didn’t write,
and some of which have been around for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be possible to take the time to write all of these scripts in
<code>fish</code>, or even just port them to nice self-contained shell scripts that can be
run using the appropriate shell.
On the other hand, this code is usually run at most once every few months,
and generally much less.
As <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">this excellent comic</a> demonstrates,
it’s probably not worth my time.</p>
<p>Presence is something of the elephant in the room - presence, specifically,
on Mac OS.
I’m beginning a position with CancerIQ, Inc. tomorrow,
and their development environment is standardized on Mac OS.
I’ve used Apple’s operating system professionally before,
but that was back when I, and they, were still blissfully unaware that there were
any alternatives to good old<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <code>bash</code>.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Mac OS Catalina,
Apple’s default shell is now <code>zsh</code>. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
This means that, with my GNU <code>stow</code>-based dotfiles,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
complete environment configuration is one simple <code>git clone</code> away.
<code>zsh</code> is also available on pretty much every Linux system I’ve ever used,
and works alright in WSL.</p>
<p>Of course, <code>zsh</code> is not as featureful as <code>fish</code> - at least not out of the box.
With the addition of Oh My Zsh! and Starship, however,
it’s both beautiful and information-dense.</p>
<p>For me, case- and hyphen-insensitive tab completion and a context-aware prompt are
the most critical components of a productive shell environment.
While Oh My Zsh! can provide both, I prefer Starship’s aesthetic and functionality.
It’s also extremely fast, taking only about ten milliseconds to generate a prompt
in even the most complex environment (<code>git</code> detached head with multiple language
environments).</p>
<p>While I loved <code>fish</code>, I feel that <code>zsh</code> provides most of the features I used while
being much less in my way - it’s a fast, compatible shell that’s available where I
need it and does what I want.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>We built Repl.it to make it easy to explore and learn languages and programming paradigms. We’ve grown a community that, like us, is <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Wildest-programming-language-idea/42923">excited</a> by languages. We were, however, surprised by how slow-moving the programming language space seems to be. Given how fast software is growing, shouldn’t we see more innovation in programming languages?</p>
<p>We can think of a programming language as either a tool built to be good at a software domain or as a medium for thought and expression. If languages are indeed tools, then some languages would be better than others for a given task. For example, if I want to build a web server with reliable performance, I might use Golang because it has a solid standard library and concurrency primitives. Whereas, if I'm making a UI, I might want to use JavaScript for its first-class support for event-driven programming. On the other hand, if we think about languages as mediums of expression, choosing a language becomes less about objective qualities and more about aesthetics and ergonomics. </p>
<p>But if languages are tools, shouldn't we see many more language variations to cover the ever-increasings niches that software is entering? Similarly, if languages are mediums of thought, and there are more and more people interested in expressing themselves digitally, shouldn't we expect to see many more types of languages?</p>
<p>One answer could be that programmers are not that interested in thinking about languages. Or that our languages today are sufficient and everyone is happy. But spend a few minutes on any programming forum, and it’ll become clear that a lack of enthusiasm and opinions on languages could not be the reason why we don’t see more programming languages.</p>
<p>Programming languages are undoubtedly hard to make. They require a combination of design skills and technical chops. But for some reason, language designers are typically solo hackers. But what if we made programming languages easier to make? If we showed that it is possible for anyone, even those with limited experience, perhaps especially beginners, can create and experiment with languages? Wouldn’t we get a lot more exciting and fresh ideas?</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/jam.png" alt="language jam"></p>
<p>Well, here at Repl.it, we specialize in making hard things accessible, and we want to make creating programming languages easier, fun, exciting, and collaborative. Today, we're announcing the programming language jam and a $10,000 grant to a team that designs and prototypes a new language with emphasis on fresh and possibly wild ideas. The winning language will also get added to Repl.it, where anyone can quickly start using it to code. We’ll have prizes for individual category winners too.</p>
<p>The hackathon starts on <strong>August 10th</strong> and runs until <strong>August 31st</strong>. To enter, you have to create a Repl.it Team when registration opens with a minimum of two team members. <strong>Registration will open on August 1st</strong>. To be notified when registration opens, leave your email <a href="https://forms.gle/x3n4cDYQzdvFvci57">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our Hackathon is judged by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/">Mary Rose Cook</a> whose language experimentation spans toy Lisp interpreters to programming environments for kids</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jordwalke">Jordan Walke</a>, the creator of React.js and the Reason programming language</li>
<li>TBD: we're looking for more judges. Specifically people who are interested in wild programming language ideas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="can-anyone-participate">Can anyone participate?</h3>
<p>Yes! You don’t even need to have any prior experience making languages. To help you get started, we created these tutorials and templates:</p>

						<p>Whether you are an encryption expert or a newcomer, welcome! This series is for you! It assumes you know nothing and takes you from soup to nuts on how to bootstrap trust with the intent to power a Zero Trust security model. The process and thinking described in this series are the direct output of developing the same system for the Ziti open source project. Ziti can be found on the GitHub project page for <a href="https://github.com/openziti">OpenZiti</a>. The series starts with the basics and dovetails into Ziti’s Enrollment system.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Zero Trust</h3>
<p>This entire series assumes some familiarity with Zero Trust. If you do not have a strong background in it, that is fine. This section should give the reader enough context to make use of the entire series. If a more in-depth understanding is desired, please consider reading <em>Zero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems in Untrusted Networks</em> by Evan Gilman.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a security model that requires strict identity authentication and access verification on every connection at all times. It sets the tone for a system’s security to say, “this system shall never assume the identity or access of any connection.” Before the Zero Trust security models, IT infrastructures were set up as a series of security perimeters. Think of as a castle with walls and moats. The castle would have a set number of entry points with guards. Once past the guards and inside the castle, any visitors were trusted and had access to the castle. In the real world, passing the guards is analogous to authenticating with a machine or, at worst, connect the office network via WiFi or ethernet cable.</p>
<p>Zero Trust does away with the concept of having a central castle that assumes anyone inside is trusted. It assumes that the castle has already been breached. That is to say, we expect attackers to already be inside the network and for it to be a hostile environment. Any resources inside the network should be treated as being publicly available on the internet and must be defended. To accomplish this defense, a series of Zero Trust pillars are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never Trust, Verify – the virtue of a connection should not grant access</li>
<li>Authenticate Before Connect – authentication should happen before resources are connected to</li>
<li>Least Privileged Access – access should only grant connectivity to the minimum number of resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing those pillars is not a simple tweak to existing infrastructure. The first point alone will have much of this series dedicated to it.</p>
<h3>Ziti &amp; Zero Trust</h3>
<p>In a Zero Trust model, there needs to exist mechanisms to verify identities such that trust can be granted. Zero Trust does not mean there is no trust. Zero Trust means that trust is given only after verification. Even then, that trust is limited to accessing the minimum network resources necessary. To accomplish this, we need a network that can force all connections through the following process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Authenticate</li>
<li>Request Access To A Resource</li>
<li>Connect To The Requested Resource</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is not the typical connection order on a network. Most connections on a network are made in the reverse order. At first, this may seem counter-intuitive. To help make Zero Trust and bootstrapping trust a bit clearer, it helps to have a concrete system to use an example. It just so happens that the Ziti software system makes a great example!</p>
<p><a href="https://ziti.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ziti-system.png"><img src="https://ziti.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ziti-system.png" alt="Ziti System Diagram" width="80%" srcset="https://ziti.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ziti-system.png 2910w, https://ziti.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ziti-system-300x49.png 300w, https://ziti.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ziti-system-1024x169.png 1024w, https://ziti.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ziti-system-768x126.png 768w, https://ziti.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ziti-system-1536x253.png 1536w, https://ziti.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ziti-system-2048x337.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2910px) 100vw, 2910px"></a></p>
<p>In Ziti, all of the above steps require interacting with a Ziti Controller. The Ziti Controller manages the Ziti overlay network by maintaining a list of known network services, SDK clients, routers, enrollments, policies, and much more! All of these pieces working together to create a Ziti Network. A Ziti Network is an overlay network – meaning it creates a virtual network on top of a concrete network. The concrete network may be the internet, a university network, or your own home network. Whatever it is, it is referred to as the underlay network.</p>
<p>In the Ziti Network, all network resources are modeled as services in the Ziti Controller. All services on a Ziti Network should only be accessible via the Ziti Network for maximum effect. Network services can be made available via a Ziti Network in a variety of manners. The preferred method is embedding the Ziti SDK inside of applications and servers as it provides the highest degree of Zero Trust security. However, it is also possible to configure various overlay-to-underlay connections to existing network services via “router termination” or a particular type of application with the Ziti SDK embedded in it that specifically deals with underlay-to-overlay translations (i.e., Ziti Desktop Edge/Mobile Edge).</p>
<p>The Ziti Controller also knows about one or more Ziti Routers that form a mesh network that can create dynamic circuits amongst themselves. Routers use circuits to move data across the Ziti Network. Routers can be configured to allow data to enter and exit the mesh. The most common entry/exit points are Ziti SDKs acting as clients or servers.</p>
<p>Network clients wishing to attach to the network use the Ziti SDK to first authenticate with the Ziti Controller. During authentication, the Ziti SDK client and Ziti Controller will verify each other. Upon successful authentication, the Ziti Controller can provide a list of available services to dial (connect) or to bind (host) for the authenticated SDK Client. The client can then request to dial or bind a service. If fulfilled, a session is associated with the client and service. This new session is propagated to the necessary Ziti Routers, and the required circuits are created. The client is returned a list of Ziti Routers, which can be connected to in order to complete the last mile of communication between the Ziti overlay network and the SDK client.</p>
<p>This set of steps covers the pillars of the Zero Trust model! The Ziti Controller and SDK Clients verify each other. The client cannot connect to network resources or services until it authenticates. After authentication, a client is given the least privilege access allowed by only being told about and only being able to dial/bind the authenticated identity’s assigned services. It is a Zero Trust overlay network!</p>
<p>How did this system come into existence? How do the Ziti SDK client and Ziti Controller verify each other? How do the routers and controller know to validate each other? How is this managed at scale with hundreds of Ziti Routers and thousands of Ziti SDK clients? It seems that this is a recursive problem. To terminate the recursion, we have to start our system with a well-defined and carefully controlled seed of trust.</p>

<p>In software systems that require network connectivity, there are at least two parties in the system. Generally, there are more, and in the case of a Ziti network, there could be thousands. Between two parties, each time a connection is made, a trust decision is made. Should this connection be allowed? Mechanisms must be put into place to verify the identity of the connecting party if that question is to be answered.</p>
<p>One mechanism that might jump out at the reader is a password or secret. In Ziti, it would be possible to configure the Controller, Routers, and SDK Clients with a secret. Software is easy to deploy with a secret. Throw it into a configuration file, point the software at, and off you go!</p>
<p>It is also fundamentally weak as there is only one secret in the system necessary to compromise the entire system. In Ziti, this would mean giving the secret to network clients that may or may not be owned by the network operator. Also, shared secrets do not individually identify each component, nor do they define how secrets will power other security concerns, like encryption.</p>
<p>The solution can be improved. Secrets could be generated per software component. The controller, each router, and each SDK client could have a unique secret. This secret would then individually identity each component! It is a significant improvement, but how does each component verify connections? Do they challenge for the incoming connections secret and compare it to a list? That means that a pair of systems that need to connect must have each other’s secrets. Secret sharing will not do! We can not be copying secrets between every machine. One machine that is compromised would mean that many secrets are revealed!</p>
<p>This solution can be evolved and improved, but we do not have to do that hard work! If we did, we would end up recreating an existing technology. That technology is (public-key cryptography)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography], and it provides everything we need.</p>
<p>Public-key cryptography allows each device to have a unique, secret, private key that proves its unique identity. That private key is mathematically tied to a public key. The public key can be used to encrypt messages that only the private key holder can decrypt. Also, the public key cannot be used to derive the original private key. This functionality fits perfectly with what our distributed system needs! Alas, public-key cryptography introduces complex behaviors, setup, and management. In the next article, we will dive a little deeper into this topic. For now, let us take it on faith that it will serve our needs well.</p>
<h4>Setting It Up</h4>
<p>So we have decided that public-key cryptography is the answer. What does that mean? What do I have to do? Let us explore what would need to be done by a human or a piece of software automating this process. Don’t worry if you don’t get all of this; the gist is all you need for now. Later articles will expand upon this terminology. In fact, after reading the later articles, consider revisiting this part.</p>
<p>Consider the following diagram of a “mesh” distributed system. This mesh could be any type of system such as a mesh of Ziti Routers, or maybe it is a system of sensors on an airplane. What they do …</p></div></div>

      <p><em>A weird Apple ID picture, and thoughts on consistency.</em></p>
<p>Those days my main operating system is Windows 10, I switched from macOS a bit less than 1 year ago out of frustration as I was looking for a new laptop. The shift of paradigm took a bit of time to adapt, but once I accepted that Windows really does and never cared about consistency, things started to go quite well, and I'm now a happy Windows user.</p>
<p>A bit less than a week ago I was working on a release of <a href="https://sam.elborai.me/blog/habitcat-released-on-ios">HabitCat</a> to iOS and so had a need for XCode and the iOS simulator. I went back to my old MacBook and started applying all available macOS updates. I avoided them until now because of all the issues that always come with macOS upgrades, but that's an XCode requirement, so I put my grumpy face, grumbled my annoyance away and started the long upgrade process, then of course spent the next hour or so fixing all the issues caused by the removal of 32 bits support, new app permission restrictions, etc (the usual stuff when upgrading macOS).</p>
<p>I'm finally done installing new software versions and fixing broken stuff around, and ready to start to use my laptop for productive work, running the latest and shiniest macOS ever. And that's when I notice a very small detail in a part of the UI. I opened the Mac App Store, and see this glitchy profile picture:</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://sam.elborai.me/images/s/c/r/e/e/screenshot-2020-07-20-at-163233-f201e52f.png"><img alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/s/c/r/e/e/screenshot-2020-07-20-at-163233-f201e52f.png"></a></p>
<p>My profile picture is the correct one, at least it seems to match the one I have on my phone. But why the weird distortion? Is that a temporary issue that can be fixed by just restarting the app, or my machine, or by logging out/in? No idea, I haven't found a way to fix it so far, and to be honest I don't care enough to look longer for a solution.</p>
<p>But because of this I started to check all the other places where the Apple ID picture is being used, just by curiosity.</p>
<p>I found the following uses so far, either in macOS or the iCloud web interface (they seem to be updated kind of at the same time so that their UI look similar):</p>

<p>So only 3 problematic ones, that's not too much and I'm really nitpicking here, still it's 3/7, so roughly 42% of incorrect images. I'm sure I missed some other use of the Apple ID picture.</p>
<p>Let's ignore the fact that one image is distorted, that's clearly a bug that should be caught by Apple's QA, but I'm more interested by the inconsistency, not the bug itself. Obviously it's a detail nobody really cares about, and as I said I'm now using the most inconsistent OS ever, Windows 10, as my daily driver, so really, why should I be bothered by this small issue? </p>
<p>I find this to be an interesting point to start to reflect on why that feels weird and somehow negative when I face that lack of consistency on macOS, but somehow I never had that kind of issues during my years using Linux, or now that I'm using Windows. Somehow the fact that macOS is generally consistent makes it way more visible and painful when something isn't. When using Linux I can identify in a few moments if I'm dealing with Qt or GtK but that never bothered me. On Windows I switch from UWP apps, to Win32, to whatever web thingy is used for VSCode, and that never bothers me. But in macOS if an application doesn't support the basic emacs keybinding for text editing (C-a, C-e, C-k, etc), or in the case discussed here, if a profile image isn't used the same way everywhere, then I notice it and that starts bothering me.</p>
<p>I guess that's based on the fact that Apple is really focused on creating consistent and coherent user experience between their operating systems, and they are really good at it, so the general expectation is that things work the way I expect them to work, and look the way I expect them to look, based on past experiences. My experience with macOS and iOS is that something learned in one context is expected to be similar in another, similar context. Interestingly their focus on consistency is here what creates some (very slight) frustration. And I feel I would have never cared if that would have been another operating system, because I never expected them to actually be consistent. In some ways, a slightly inconsistent macOS experience is a broken one, while an inconsistent Windows experience is completely normal, even expected, and anything slightly consistent becomes a nice suprise.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's already too much rambling, but I thought that was an interesting train of thoughts.</p>
<p>I'm sure someone somewhere already gave a name to this phenomena, if that's the case I don't know it and couldn't find one after searching around. So I will go forward and call it the "consistency curse": when a systems focuses on and offers a consistent user experience 90% of the time, the 10% become highly visible and a point of contention/frustration. But people forgive easily systems that don't offer any such guarantee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Post-Scriptum</strong></p>
<p>A few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>In this post I willingly exaggerate traits to communicate my thoughts, Apple software aren't as perfect at they would like them to be, and are broken and frustrating in a lot of ways, but this feeling of "common user experience" between their devices and applications is clearly something they are focused on, so I think that the general point stands. I.e: emacs keybindings are available in nearly all macOS text input.</li>
<li>I thought about it afterward but didn't find a good way to blend it in the post content: vim is the perfect example of a "consistent curse". As soon as you develop good muscle memory for the keybindings, anything slightly inconsistent becomes REALLY frustrating.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every time you commit and push software changes, you should be building and testing it for bugs. That includes security bug testing against a live integration environment, so you can be aware of any new bugs as they are introduced, and before they go to production. Here’s a step-by-step guide to accomplishing that in a fully automated way using <a href="https://www.stackhawk.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">StackHawk</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis CI</a>.</p>



<p>In this tutorial, we will build and containerize an intentionally flawed Django app called <em>vuln_django</em>, based on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Django Tutorial</a> series. We will stand up an integration environment complete with an Nginx front-end and a PostgreSQL database backend using Docker Compose. Finally, we will test our app for security vulnerabilities using StackHawk. And we will do all of this in a self-contained Travis CI build environment, triggered by pushes to GitHub.</p>



<h3>Getting Started</h3>



<p>You will need accounts with <a href="https://app.stackhawk.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">StackHawk</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis CI</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>. You will also need some familiarity with Git and Docker. Familiarity with Python and Django is helpful, but not necessary.</p>



<p>You should have the following software installed on your computer.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Compose</a></li><li>Python 3 (`<a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">brew</a> install python` on MacOS)</li><li>All prerequisites for Python3 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysqlclient</a> (`brew install mysql` on MacOS)</li><li>All prerequisites for Python3 <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">psycopg2</a> (`brew install postgres` on MacOS)</li></ul>



<h3>Fork and Clone vuln_django_play</h3>



<p>Fork a copy of the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kaakaww/vuln_django_play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vuln_django_play</a> repository to your own GitHub account. Then clone the fork to your workstation. This repo already contains all of the automation that we will be creating in this tutorial and more. Since that’s what we want to create, remove it by running the script, <code>delete-automation.sh</code>.</p>



<div><div>
<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;fileName&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">cd vuln_django_play
scripts/delete-automation.sh</pre></div>
</div></div>



<p>Now try running <em>vuln_django</em> locally to verify that it works.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;htmlmixed&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">python3 -m venv env&lt;br&gt;$ source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py seed polls --number=5
python manage.py test
python manage.py runserver</pre></div>



<p>Browse to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a> and you should see the <em>vuln_django</em> polling application! The strange polls you see were generated in the <code>seed</code> step above, and the poll data is stored in a SQLite database that was created with the <code>migrate</code> step.</p>



<p>Hit <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;-c</code> to stop the development server.</p>



<h3>Containerize vuln_django</h3>



<p>Rather than running the development server, let’s run the app with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gunicorn</a> for better performance, and to better simulate a production environment. And for portability, let’s containerize it.</p>



<p>Create a Dockerfile at the base of your cloned repo with the following contents.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;dockerfile&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-dockerfile&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Dockerfile&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;docker&quot;}"># Create the base stage
FROM python:3.7-buster as base

COPY requirements.txt /opt/app/
COPY vuln_django/ /opt/app/vuln_django/vuln_django
COPY static/ /opt/app/vuln_django/static
COPY templates/ /opt/app/vuln_django/templates
COPY polls/ /opt/app/vuln_django/polls
COPY manage.py /opt/app/vuln_django/

RUN pip install -r /opt/app/requirements.txt

# Create the micro stage to run as a gunicorn container
FROM base as micro
ARG SERVER_PORT=8010
ENV SERVER_PORT=${SERVER_PORT}
EXPOSE ${SERVER_PORT}:${SERVER_PORT}
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    netcat
WORKDIR /opt/app/vuln_django
CMD exec gunicorn vuln_django.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:${SERVER_PORT} --workers 3</pre></div>



<p>Build the container image and run it to make sure you get the same results as when you ran the app manually.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker build . --tag vuln_django:micro
docker run --rm --detach --publish 8010:8010 --name vuln-django vuln_django:micro
docker exec vuln-django python manage.py migrate
docker exec -it vuln-django python manage.py createsuperuser
docker exec vuln-django python manage.py seed polls --number=5
docker exec vuln-django python manage.py test</pre></div>



<p>Browse to the containerized app server at <a href="http://localhost:8010/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8010/</a>, and once again you should see some polls. Go to <a href="http://localhost:8010/admin/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8010/admin/</a> and log on with the superuser credentials you created, and check out the Django admin interface.</p>



<p>Notice how we ran migrations, seed data, and tests as <code>docker exec</code> commands. As before, those commands created a SQLite database file, this time within the container, and populated it with seed data.</p>



<p>Cool! Shut it down.</p>







<p>Since we used the <code>--rm</code> flag to <code>docker run</code>, the container goes away, along with all of its data. If you started it again, you would again need to run migrations, create the superuser, and seed the data for the app to work.</p>



<h3>Build a Docker Compose Configuration</h3>



<p>Let’s make this look more like a real application environment by assembling some supporting services in Docker Compose. We will add an Nginx container to host static files and forward requests to our app, and we’ll add a PostgreSQL database to host the polling data.</p>



<p>Create a file, <code>docker-micro.yml</code> and add the following contents:</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-yaml&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;YAML&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;}">version: "3.7"

services:
  vuln-proxy:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf.micro:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - ./static:/opt/app/vuln_django/static:ro
    ports:
      - 8020:8020
    depends_on:
      - vuln-django

  vuln-django:
    image: vuln_django:micro
    build:
          context: .
          target: micro
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=admin
      - DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=adminpassword
      - DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
      - SQL_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
      - SQL_HOST=db
      - SQL_PORT=5432
      - SQL_DATABASE=django_db
      - SQL_USER=django_user
      - SQL_PASSWORD=django_password

  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=django_db
      - POSTGRES_USER=django_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=django_password
</pre></div>



<p>Notice that the <code>vuln-django</code> service requires the container image, <code>vuln_django:micro</code>. The <code>build</code> section specifies where to find the Dockerfile for <code>vuln_django:micro</code>, and which target stage to build. Recall we added a <em>micro</em> stage to the Dockerfile above.</p>



<p>Under <code>services.vuln-django.environment</code>, we populate several variables to tell the <code>vuln-django</code> service how to connect to its database, and how to create a superuser account for the Django Admin interface. Notice that SQL_HOST is set to <code>db</code>, which is the name of our PostgreSQL service defined in <code>services.db</code>.</p>



<p>The <code>db</code> service uses the official <code>postgres</code> image, and we configure the database, username, and passwords with environment variables.</p>



<p>Finally, the <code>vuln-proxy</code> service is an official Nginx container with a custom configuration <code>nginx.conf.micro</code>. This configuration serves custom static content from the <code>/static</code> directory, mounted as a volume from the <code>./static</code> directory in the project repo, and forwards all other requests to <code>http://vuln-django:8010</code>. We publish port <code>8020</code> as a convenience so that we can test this service locally.</p>



<p>Build and run this Docker Compose configuration.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml build
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml up --detach</pre></div>



<p>Run migrations and setup as before, using docker-compose to <code>exec</code> the commands on the <code>vuln-django</code> service container.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py migrate
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py seed polls --number=5
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py test</pre></div>



<p>Now that the database has been configured and seeded, click around to see how it looks at <a href="http://localhost:8020/polls/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8020/polls/</a>. You should see a new waving Pikachu in the background, since we are now serving extra static content from the Nginx proxy service.</p>



<p>Great! Now shut your stack down and remove all of the containers.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml down</pre></div>



<h3>Add Automation</h3>



<p>This is looking good, but there are a lot of steps to build this stack and run it. Let’s script what we have done so far.</p>



<p>Create a file in your project called <code>scripts/build-and-run.sh</code>, and add the following content.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build and run vuln-django with Nginx and PostgreSQL
set -ex

# We'll use this `docker-compose exec` command a lot...
EXEC_CMD='docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django'

# Build docker images, in particular the vuln-django container
docker-compose -f docker-micro.yml build

# Launch the app, PostgreSQL and Nginx
docker-compose -f docker-micro.yml up --detach

# Wait for the database, using netcat to ping it
echo Wait for database to become available...
while ! ${EXEC_CMD} bash -c 'nc -z "${SQL_HOST}" "${SQL_PORT}"'; do
  sleep 0.5
done
echo Database ready!

# Run database migrations to build tables
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py migrate

# Create Django admin user from DJANGO_SUPERUSER_ environment variables
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input

# Seed database with test data
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py seed polls --number=5

# Run unit tests
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py test</pre></div>



<p>Make the script executable.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">chmod 755 scripts/build-and-run.sh</pre></div>



<p>Now bring the whole stack up like so.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">./scripts/build-and-run.sh</pre></div>



<p>And again, tear it down.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml down</pre></div>



<p>Try that a few more times, and click around the app to make sure it all looks good.</p>



<h3>Add HawkScan</h3>



<p>Create a <code>stackhawk.yml</code> file and add the following content. Be sure to replace <code>&lt;STACKHAWK_APP_ID&gt;</code> with your own StackHawk application ID. Check your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.stackhawk.com/applications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">app list</a> if you need to find or create one.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-yaml&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;YAML&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;}">app:
  applicationId: &lt;STACKHAWK_APP_ID&gt;
  env: ${APP_ENV:Travis CI}
  host: ${HOST:http://localhost:8020}
  riskLevel: MEDIUM
  appDataType: PII
  antiCsrfParam: csrfmiddlewaretoken
  excludePaths:
    - /admin/logout/ # the scanner will log itself out if you don't ignore here
    - …</pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>Let me tell you a story about the Enterprise Java Programmers from eBay.  When eBay was founded Java was <em>hot</em>.  Everyone was using Java.  If you were a <em>serious real programmer</em>, you did everything in Java.  I know because I got sucked into endless terrible Java projects up until 2008 when the banks collapsed and swirled around the economic toilet, taking the turd Enterprise Java with them.  People laugh, but the banks dying in 2008 is really what wiped out Enterprise Java as we know it and killed off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle">Sun</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, in 2008 about 40-50% of Sun's money came from banks running Java.  When the banks collapsed because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">mortgage backed securities fraud</a> a huge chunk of Sun's money evaporated practically overnight.  As smaller banks were absorbed into the three remaining larger banks the contractual obligations to Sun were canceled.  There was also a form of "guilt by association" because Java was associated with inflexible old systems that couldn't be changed fast enough to survive the 2008 crash.  I know this because I literally worked on one of these inflexible Java systems at Bear Stearns and watched this all unfold in real time in 2008.</p>
<p>I say Enterprise Java because Java continued on life support when Google/Android used it in their phones.  If it weren't for Android Java--the language--would have died the miserable death it deserved in 2008.  That's why I keep saying "Enterprise", because that version of Java was a special brand of obnoxious hell most programmers from then hate.  It was this bizarre infinitely indirect convoluted code that seemed to only exist to keep Enterprise Programmers in their jobs.  I remember to this day obnoxious "old beard" Java programmers who would brow beat you and harass you if you didn't wrap everything in an <code>AbstractFactoryIndirectFactoryFactory</code>.</p>
<p>This use of convoluted code full of <code>AbstractFactory</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">shibboleths</a> did actually do its job of excluding new entrants to the industry and also keeping programmers employed.  You couldn't fire those Enterprise Java programmers because they were the only ones who knew that incredibly convoluted code to fix that bug once a year that weirdly showed up right about the time they were supposed to get bonuses.  You had to pay 8000 people a year to basically sit and watch a bunch of Java virtual machines do nothing or else one day (right before bonuses) these VMs would implode and you'd have nobody around to fix them.</p>
<p>The problem with the Enterprise Java Programmer (EJP) and their job protectionism is companies die, and when they do you need to find a new job.  You would think the collapse of 2008 would teach these programmers this lesson, but they did not learn it at all.  You'd think they'd realize no job is safe anymore, and that they need to always have a second language in their back pocket and a plethora of alternative projects just in case they need to jump off the burning ship.</p>
<p>Nope, and the programmers at eBay are an excellent example.</p>
<h2 id="e-bay-wised-up"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#e-bay-wised-up">eBay Wised Up</a></h2>
<p>I used eBay a few times, and even in 2014 it still had old creaky garbage user interfaces.  When you did a checkout it would inject <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tags back to its own services to show you simple things like...an invoice.  That might be fine here and there, but eBay was riddled with these iframe cockroaches.  Paypal (which was owned by eBay at the time) was nearly the same way, with terrible UIs all over and creaky infrastructure.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the cause of this perpetual terrible UI was the EJPs and their job protective code.  In order to maintain their jobs they created a system that was difficult to change without their help.  That <em>also</em> makes the code difficult for <em>them</em> to change, so most likely when they're asked to "please make the UI modern", they claim its "impossible".  You'd ask if they can puhhleaze just use something like bootstrap, and the EJP will go look at their creaky old Java code with its hand coded HTML embedded in a <code>FactoryFactoryImplInterface</code> and say, "No that'd be impossible."</p>
<p>This impossibility was demonstrated as a lie.  Eventually Paypal was spun off on its own and <em>suddenly</em> their UI started to improve.  Paypal shared the same programmers as eBay, but after the spinoff they were able to fire those crotchety old EJPs and hire some better UI designers to improve the application.  Paypal had to do this because of competition from Stripe which was owning them in the developer market with nice UIs and documentation.</p>
<p>After Paypal showed you <em>could</em> improve this supposedly "impossible" code I believe it started a war within eBay that eventually culminated in eBay firing about 3000 Enterprise Java Programmers.  There's no official number, but the information I have from sources inside puts it at around 3000-8000 fired and the CTO trying to hire <em>anyone else</em> to improve the company.</p>
<p>Eventually companies like eBay either die, or get smart and realize that firing inflexible "impossible" programmers is the only way forward.  When you look at many of the banks from 2008, you can always find some piece of inflexible technology controlled by a programmer who thinks keeping it inflexible will save their job.  The irony of this attitude is that being inflexible eventually kills the company, costing them their job, but <em>also</em> makes it difficult for them to find work after.</p>
<p>The eBay programmers are excellent demonstrations of this effect.  Many of them couldn't even switch over to Android development.  I know many that switched over to non-programming jobs or just retired entirely.  Most of them didn't have anything else to show for their decades at eBay and had no ability to learn any new languages.  They had no potential side businesses to start, no additional demonstrations of skill, and no way to explain how they spent 20 years keeping  invoicing <code>AbstractInterfaceImpl</code> <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> Virtual Machine running.</p>
<h2 id="the-truths"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#the-truths">The Truths</a></h2>
<p>A lot of the people who tell you not to code at home try to cast this viewpoint as some sort of proletariat revolt against the machinery of late capitalism.  I grew up extremely poor and I can tell you that none of these people have ever been truly poor.  People who are actually poor want to work, and know that you can lose everything in an instant so they do everything they can to keep working.  Work is not shameful or a sign that you're a loser.  Many people want to work and people saying they don't doesn't make them edgy or socialist.  It makes them privileged.</p>
<p>Anyone telling you to work <em>less</em> is <em>not</em> your friend.   The same goes for anyone shaming you for wanting to make more money.  Usually these people are privileged with a family or spouse who can take care of them. If they suddenly lose their job, they have an alternative degree and programming is just a minor stepping stone to something else, or they're just delusional and think they'll have their cushy job forever.  Their experience is completely different from mine and yours, so if you need to work, and you want to keep working in programming, then you definitely should ignore someone who has the luxury of learning one programming language to work at one company.</p>
<p>The truth is having side projects is <em>the main</em> way you build leverage against corporate greed.  It's harder to exploit someone who has options, and in my experience working on additional projects after work has given me far more benefit than any job has.  I can safely say that <em>everything</em> I learned over my career has been from the personal work I do, not from any job I've had.  I can also say that the most fun and enjoyment I've had in programming has been working on my own projects.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'm going to give you my list of true reasons that side projects benefit you as a programmer of any experience level.</p>
<h2 id="truth-0-side-projects-mean-freedom"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#truth-0-side-projects-mean-freedom">Truth 0: Side Projects Mean Freedom</a></h2>
<p>To this day there's hordes of programmers who think it's a form of oppression to have to work on side projects, when the truth is side projects give you choice, and choice is freedom.  With additional code done outside of work in another language you can choose to leave when you find a better position in the new language.  You can also potentially turn these side projects into new businesses you own.</p>
<p>If all you do is work on your company's code you effectively become stuck in their particular brand of code and their way of doing things.  Unless that company is one of the FAANGs your experience is in many ways going to work against you when trying to find new work.  That's because (as I'll explain later), your version of a language is almost always totally weird and incompatible with all the other totally weird uses of that language.</p>
<p>The company you work for likes this situation because they know you'll never leave since you have lost your experience with new technology, and learning it is difficult.  You'll just sit there babysitting the JVM that keeps the cornflower blue buttons running and not try to find a job doing Go because that's harder.</p>
<p>You shouldn't think of your side projects as some kind of calling card that you reluctantly do so you can get a job after your big mega corp dies.  You should think of it as keeping your options open through training and study so that you are free to get a new job when you see one or need one.</p>
<h3 id="truth-1-you-never-get-a-raise"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#truth-1-you-never-get-a-raise">Truth 1: You Never Get a Raise</a></h3>
<p>Why would you need to go get a new job if you're making decent money at a nice and easy job?  Because <em>companies never give programmers wages that match their impact</em>.  You might get a 2% raise a year, which is less than the inflation of your currency.  You might get a tiny bonus.  Meanwhile, your code will be the main reason your company makes billions and trillions of dollars.  You <em>might</em> be able to get some stock options, and that's about the only way you'll get a raise.  Ever.</p>
<p>However, the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p><span>These are anxious times for startup founders, particularly for those still in the early stages. Before your top concerns about business may have been how you could innovate and scale-up. Now, many companies are facing an existential crisis about business continuity while counting their remaining pennies.</span></p>
<p><span>The first half of the year has brought extreme challenges that many of us have never faced before, both personally and professionally. Businesses that want to thrive in the future need to retool and move fast. Winning in 2020 and beyond will require you to be steadfast in your strategy and values. Being mindful of these challenges early will save you time, and resources.</span></p>
<p><span>Below are the top 12 startup challenges you must master to be successful in 2020 and beyond.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/12-habits-to-overcome-startup-challenges-e1594866698515.jpg" alt="12 habits you need to overcome startup challenges." width="710" height="710"></p>

<h2><span>1. Avoid Confirmation Bias&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry-pick information that confirms our pre-existing beliefs. In business, confirmation bias stifles creativity and innovation. If we feel nothing is wrong, we do nothing to change it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Using split testing is one way to overcome confirmation bias. When creating campaigns, it can be tempting to use our intuition to predict what will make people click and convert. Often, A/B testing does </span><a href="https://vwo.com/blog/ab-testing-results-that-surprised-experts/"><span>prove us wrong</span></a><span> about our assumptions. However, even the results of our tests can be biased if we’re too emotionally attached to our hypotheses. Consider bringing in a third-party marketing team to help you be objective.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/confirmation-bias-e1594855679739.png" alt="Confirmation bias." width="710" height="372"></p>
<p><i><span>Image: </span></i><a href="https://buffer.com/resources/marketing-psychology"><i><span>Buffer</span></i></a></p>
<h2><span>2. Prioritize Maximizing ROI</span></h2>
<p><span>Now more than ever, you need to see where your money is going. Return on Investment measures the sales revenue a campaign brings on every dollar spent. ROI is the best KPI to measure the effectiveness of all marketing campaigns because it also measures the quality of leads these campaigns generate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Despite this, </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/8-top-findings-in-gartner-cmo-spend-survey-2018-19"><span>most CMOs cited “awareness”</span></a><span> as their main KPI. And </span><span>only </span><a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2018/cmo-report-2018-digital-media-roi-measurement-omnichannel-marketing-technology/"><span>one in four </span></a><span>marketers feel that they can confidently quantify ROI.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason for this low percentage is many ROI calculations are too static for the flexible and dynamic environment marketing poses. The ROI calculation for any marketing initiatives has to be as flexible and dynamic as marketing itself and requires rapid testing.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-in-4-marketers-feel-confident-to-quantify-ROI-e1594866424614.jpg" alt="Only one in four marketers feel that they can confidently quantify ROI." width="710" height="398"></p>
<h2><span>3. Watch Your Budget and Resources&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>With budgets cut, you need to do more with less. Now more than ever, you should measure the inputs and outputs of your efforts efficiently. An example of an input would be your email growth list of qualified prospects, and the output would be revenue. Use analytics to be sure you’re optimizing your budget, and it’s always handy to have the help of smart tracking tools. Make sure that each marketing strategy has some chance of bringing a return before significantly investing time and money.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>4. Eliminate “Decision Paralysis” From Your Marketing</span></h2>
<p><span>What worked for you at the beginning of the year, may not work for you now, and you may need to make decisions quickly. There’s a high correlation between successful startups and startups that are run by people who make decisions quickly. </span><b>In fact, companies that excel at making and executing key decisions are </b><a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/score-your-organization-ame-info/"><b>95%</b></a><b> more likely to achieve top-tier financial results.</b></p>
<p><span>Putting off making a decision is making a decision. If you put off making a decision, you’re deciding to keep doing whatever it is that you’re doing now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Decision-making is often overwhelming, but there’s no reason why it has to be done in isolation. The more involved other people in your organization are in the decision-making process, the healthier your company will be.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/companies-making-and-executing-key-decisions-achieve-95-percent-more-top-tier-financial-results-e1594866195824.jpg" alt="Companies that excel at making and executing key decisions are 95% more likely to achieve top-tier financial results. " width="710" height="398"></p>
<h2><span>5. Copy the Success of Others&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Copycat marketing is copying the successful marketing techniques of your competitors. After all, why fix something that isn’t broken?</span></p>
<p><span>In short, if your competitors have found a strategy that works, consider implementing it as well. There’s nothing wrong when working with what you know has proven to be advantageous, as long as you put your spin on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Copying is useful, </span><b>but</b><span> it can stifle innovation and creativity if taken too far. Take what’s successful but make it your own so it will resonate with your customer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>6. Remember Your Values are Your Customers’ Values</span></h2>
<p><span>This year has seen many of us shifting and reprioritising with global events, and your customers are no exception.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your customer’s values and priorities may have shifted. And if you don’t have your ear to the pulse of what customers are thinking and feeling, many of your marketing campaigns can come across as </span><a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/349436/how-to-avoid-sounding-tone-deaf-during-the-covid-1.html"><span>tone-deaf</span></a><span>. </span><b>Always remember that your company values are about the customers’ values, not yours.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Customers want to align with companies that value the same things they do. The best way to understand customers’ shifting values is through several research techniques, such as surveys and customer feedback forms.</span></p>
<h2><span>7. Accept Failure</span></h2>
<p><span>Good businesses need to experiment, and you cannot experiment if you’re afraid to fail. Experimentation allows your company to pursue more than one opportunity to discover which one has the most potential.</span></p>
<p><span>You only need a few big wins to make your experiments worth it. Most experiments fail, no matter how well-designed. </span><a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/ExPThinkWeek2009Public.pdf"><b>One study</b></a><b> found that more than 50% of experiments conducted at Amazon, Microsoft, and other software companies failed. </b><span>However, the tests improved the metrics they were designed to improve. Failing opens us up to new perspectives that challenge our assumptions, and help us make better decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>8. Cut the Sales Talk– Adopt a 90/10 approach</span></h2>
<p><span>Being salesy is when you try to sell your product to someone in the wrong stage of awareness in an aggressive or superficial manner. You don’t ask them what they may need from your product. Instead, you dive into a sea of facts and technical jargon.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You’re in business to give your customers values, yet only </span><a href="https://blog.close.com/39-shocking-stats-that-will-change-the-way-you-sell/"><span>10%</span></a><span> of buyers believe sales pitches offer any value. Always provide customers value before pitching. </span><b>Aim to spend 90% of your time offering value and 10% of your time pitching your product.</b></p>
<h2><span>9. Ask for Help</span></h2>
<p><span>As a startup owner, you may feel the temptation to project complete confidence and competence to stakeholders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But nobody’s good at everything. If you want to move fast, avoid simple mistakes, and fill the gaps in your knowledge, put your ego aside and get help.</span></p>
<p><span>No matter your stage in business, you should always be open to receiving advice from experts and getting new opportunities for mentorship. You can join several online </span><a href="https://startup.google.com/community/"><span>communities</span></a><span> to find mentors.</span></p>
<p><span>A short-list of startup communities include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.startupbootcamp.org/"><i><span>StartUp Bootcamp</span></i></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eonetwork.org/"><i><span>Eccountability</span></i></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.startupgrind.com/"><i><span>Startup Grind</span></i></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.leanstartupcircle.com/"><i><span>Lean Startup Circle</span></i></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jumpstartinc.org/for-entrepreneurs/programs/mentoring/"><i><span>Jumpstart</span></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The best part is, with every mentor, you create a new possible advocate for your brand.</span></p>
<h2><span>10. Get Rid of Data Silos&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>A data silo is a group of raw data only accessible by one department but isolated from the rest of your company. Working with data silos results in poor-quality data because these fragmented pieces of information are difficult to assemble. Data silos result in a lack of transparency, efficiency, and trust within your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Data cannot easily pass between departments of organizations that don’t have access to proper technology. Companies need software that can quickly transfer and cross-reference information across departments. If your data is not integrated or in sync, you’ll see conflicting data when you try to cross-check information from different sources. One solution is building dashboards that can bring in data from all your tools and across departments. Some options include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://datastudio.withgoogle.com/"><span>Google Data Studio</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://databox.com/"><span>Databox</span></a></li>
<li><a href="http://klipfolio.com/"><span>Klipfolio</span></a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>11. Create a Plan&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The key to successful entrepreneurship is having a plan that is both flexible and persistent. </span><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/reid-hoffman"><span>Reid Hoffman</span></a><span>, the founder of LinkedIn and author of </span><i><span>The Startup of You</span></i><span>, calls this process</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/14/in-startups-and-life-you-need-plan-a-b-and-z/"><span> ABZ Planning</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plan A is your current plan and what has been working for you so far. Plan B is what you pivot to when you recognize that a new opportunity has more potential. Sometimes you change to Plan B because A is not working, but sometimes A is working, yet Plan B appears to have more potential.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plan Z comes into effect during worse case scenarios and has two parts. The first part identifies how to measure when you’re tracking towards a worst-case scenario. The second part tells you what to do should that happen. Plan Z allows you to tackle uncertainty and risk in your business. Plan B or Z may be where you’re at now. No matter what plan you choose to put in place, be sure they include your key metrics and goals, and how you plan to reach them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>12. Avoid Micromanaging</span></h2>
<p><span>Working from home will probably be the new normal. Experiencing discomfort at managing this change is perfectly normal. When you’re used to in-office workspaces, going remote can make you feel disconnected from your employees, and you may micromanage to overcompensate. But no matter the circumstances, micromanaging is highly discouraged.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting sudden pressure on staff can cause productivity to slow down. Instead, encourage good communication and collaboration habits by employing using business communication tools like Slack and Zoom. Remember to be flexible as people adjust to these new changes—express confidence in your workers. Your team will likely step up to the challenge if given a chance.</span></p>
<h2><span>Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span>To summarize, the top 1</span><span>2 habits you need to overcome startup challenges </span><span>include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><i><span>Avoid Confirmation Bias</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Prioritize Maximizing ROI</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Watch Your Budget and Resources</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Eliminate “Decision Paralysis” From Your Marketing</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Copy the Success of Others</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Remember Your Values are Your Customers’ Values</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Accept Failure</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Cut the Sales Talk– Adopt a 90/10 approach</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Ask for Help</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Get Rid of Data Silos</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Create a Plan</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Avoid Micromanaging</span></i></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Proactive thinking can help reduce the number of issues encountered. Come up with a plan to tackle these common issues to ensure the success of your business.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Lattice-based cryptography has been coming into the spotlight recently. In January 2019, Many of the semifinalists in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/01/nist-reveals-26-algorithms-advancing-post-quantum-crypto-semifinals">NIST post-quantum-cryptography competition</a> were based on lattices. Let’s explore the basics of lattices and how they apply to cryptosystems.</p>



<h2><span id="What_is_a_Lattice">What is a Lattice?</span>
</h2>



<p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">Wikipedia</a>, a lattice&nbsp;is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors:</p>

</div></div>

</div></div>



<p>More simply put, a lattice is defined by basis vectors, which are only able to be scaled by integers… yay no fractions! </p>



<p>For example, let’s create a lattice of all the integers in a two-dimensional plane:</p>

There is no way to scale v1 (0,3) and v2 (3,0) to reach those points without using fractional scalars. With lattices, we can only scale by whole integers.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Does_This_Help_With_Crypto">How Does This Help With Crypto?</span>
</h2>



<p>Cryptographic algorithms are typically based on mathematical problems that are easy to verify the answer of, but hard to calculate.</p>



<p>For example, RSA is based on prime factorization. If I told you to find prime factors of 27,919,645,564,169,759, that would be hard. However, if I told you that 48,554,491 and 575,016,749 are prime factors, all you have to do is multiply them together in order to verify my answer.</p>



<p>RSA works great with classical computers. There are <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10590/what-makes-rsa-secure-by-using-prime-numbers">no known solutions to find prime factors</a> of a number reliably in less than exponential time.</p>

<p>In this introductory article, we will take a brief look at one of the more well-known lattice problems that are of use in cryptosystems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Shortest_vector_problem_(SVP)">the shortest vector problem (SVP)</a>.</p>



<p>Simply put, the goal of SVP is for the attacker to find the shortest vector from the origin (above in red) when given the basis of a lattice (above in blue). A zero vector doesn’t work as an answer, we consider it trivial.</p>



<p>How is it solved?</p>



<p>Like RSA with classical computers, it is hard to find the shortest vector of a large lattice, especially if it exists in many dimensions. One such slow solution for approximating the shortest vector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai">Babai</a>‘s algorithm, or <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2004/ln/cvp.pdf">Nearest Plane Algorithm</a>, which you can read about in the links provided.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Before we start, let’s make sure we don’t confuse memoization and memorization. Memorization is when you put something in <em>your</em> head. It has the letter “r” in it.</p>
<p>But <em>memoization</em> (no “r”) is a nerdy computer science topic. Although in practice it also (unsurprisingly!) has to do with remembering things, there exist snobs who will hold it against you if you say “memorize” when you really mean “memoize”. I am not personally one of them, but you’ll need to keep this in mind for some job interviews.</p>
<p>Okay, if these are different things, then what <em>is</em> memoization?</p>
<h3><a href="#tldr" id="tldr">tl;dr</a></h3><p>To illustrate it, imagine you’re writing a JavaScript app that calculates the weather based on the atmosphere readings. You don’t know how to do it, but luckily, there is an npm package with a <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function that you can use from your code:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> getChanceOfRain </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'magic-weather-calculator'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>There is just one problem. No matter what you do, calling <code>getChanceOfRain()</code> takes 100 milliseconds. So if the user rage-clicks “Show me the weather!” button, the weather will have to be recalculated and the app will briefly freeze on every click:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>This is not ideal. In the real life, if you already knew the answer, you wouldn’t be calculating it over and over! You would reuse the result from your previous calculation. That’s what memoization is. <strong>Memoization means storing the result so you can use it next time instead of calculating the same thing again and again.</strong></p>
<p>In the below example, we call <code>memoizedGetChanceOfRain()</code> instead. This is a new function that we added which will check if we already have an answer — and if we do, it will return the previous answer instead of re-running <code>getChanceOfRain()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> getChanceOfRain </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'magic-weather-calculator'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isCalculated</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This makes every call to <code>showWeatherReport()</code> except the first one instant:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>That’s what memoization is. When we say a function is “memoized”, it doesn’t mean we do something special to it from the JavaScript language perspective. It only means that we avoid calling it unnecessarily if we know its result won’t change.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You can stop reading here, if you want.</strong> We’ll continue with a few extra details.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#memoization-and-parameters" id="memoization-and-parameters">Memoization and Parameters</a></h3><p>Generally, memoization always follows the same scheme:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if we already have a result.</li><li>If yes, return it.</li><li>If no, calculate the result and store it for the next time.</li></ol>
<p>However, the actual implementation depends on our circumstances. For example, let’s say that the <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function takes a <code>city</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>If we naïvely memoized this function like we did before, we would introduce a bug:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>Do you see the bug yet? The weather in Tokyo and London might be very different, so we can’t safely reuse the previous answer. This means that <strong>when we memoize a function and reuse its result, we have to take its parameters into account too</strong>.</p>
<h4><a href="#solution-1-only-keep-the-last-result" id="solution-1-only-keep-the-last-result">Solution 1: Only Keep the Last Result</a></h4><p>The easiest solution to our example is to remember both the result <em>and</em> the parameters for which that result was calculated. Here is how we could do it:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> getChanceOfRain </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'magic-weather-calculator'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastCity</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>city </span><span>===</span><span> lastCity</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastCity </span><span>=</span><span> city</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Notice how this example is subtly different from our original one. Instead of <em>always</em> returning the last result when it exists, we check <code>city === lastCity</code> first. If the city changes midway, we’re going to have to re-calculate the result again:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>This fixes our bug, but it’s not always an optimal solution. In particular, if our <code>city</code> parameter changes on every function call, our memoization becomes useless:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span></p></code></pre><p>Whenever you add memoization, remember to check if it actually helps!</p>
<h4><a href="#solution-2-keep-many-results" id="solution-2-keep-many-results">Solution 2: Keep Many Results</a></h4><p>Another thing we could do is to keep <em>many</em> results instead of just the last one. Although we could define variables like <code>lastTokyoResult</code>, <code>lastLondonResult</code>, and so on, it is much easier to use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Map</code></a> which lets us hold a result for every <code>city</code> value:</p>
<pre><code><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> resultsPerCity </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>resultsPerCity</span><span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> resultsPerCity</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  resultsPerCity</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This solution works great for our use case because it only ever calculates the result the first time it encounters a particular value of <code>city</code>. Every next call with the same <code>city</code> parameter will reuse the previously calculated result that we stored in our <code>Map</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Paris'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span></p></code></pre><p>However, this solution isn’t without its downsides too. <strong>In particular, if we keep passing more different <code>city</code> values to our function, our <code>Map</code> will keep growing.</strong></p>
<p>So this solution trades faster performance for potentially unbounded memory growth. In the very worst cases, this can result in our browser tab crashing, especially if every result uses a significant part of memory (e.g. a DOM tree).</p>
<h4><a href="#other-solutions" id="other-solutions">Other Solutions</a></h4><p>There are many solutions on the spectrum between “keep only the last result” and “keep all results”. For example, you may keep results for the last N parameter values, which is known as an LRU, or a “least recently used”, cache. It’s nothing more than a Map with extra logic. You may also decide to <em>remove</em> past results after some time passes — similar to how browsers removes the cached assets after they expire. If our parameter were an object (rather than a string, like it is above), we could use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>WeakMap</code></a> instead of <code>Map</code> in modern browsers. The benefit of <code>WeakMap</code> is that it would automatically “clean up” the entries when our object key is no longer accessible. Memoization is a flexible technique, and you can choose between many tradeoffs.</p>
<h3><a href="#memoization-and-purity" id="memoization-and-purity">Memoization and Purity</a></h3><p>We should note memoization isn’t always safe to do.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that the <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function from our magical npm package does not receive <code>city</code> as a parameter, but shows an input box to the user:</p>
<pre><code><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> city </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>prompt</span><span>(</span><span>'Where do you live?'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>If we call <code>showWeatherReport()</code> two times, we will see two input boxes. We could input different cities, and see different results in the console. But if we memoized the <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function, we would only see one input box! Each next call would keep returning the same result and wouldn’t let us enter a different city.</p>
<p>So memoization is only safe to do when the function is “pure” — that is, <strong>if it only reads its parameters and doesn’t interact with the “outside world”.</strong> With a pure function, it doesn’t matter whether you call it once or if you reuse its previous result.</p>
<p>This is why in a complex algorithm, it can be beneficial to separate the parts that <em>do</em> something from the parts that merely <em>calculate</em> something. The parts that calculate something can be pure, so they can be safely memoized and skipped on repeated calls. But the code that <em>does</em> something can’t be skipped without behavior changes:</p>
<pre><code><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> city </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>prompt</span><span>(</span><span>'Where do you live?'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Now it would be safe to memoize <code>getChanceOfRain</code> —&nbsp;because it takes <code>city</code> as a parameter rather than showing the input box to the user. In other words, it is pure. Concretely, it would mean that you would still see an input box on every call to <code>showWeatherReport</code>, but the calculation would be skipped if we had the result.</p>
<h3><a href="#reusable-memoization" id="reusable-memoization">Reusable Memoization</a></h3><p>If you want to memoize several functions, it can be annoying to repeat the same steps every time: add a variable, check if we have the result, store the result.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have a tool at our disposal — <em>functions!</em> — that lets us automate this. <strong>We will use a function to “write” this repetitive memoization logic for us.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take our first example that memoizes the last result:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isCalculated</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Then let’s wrap it all (without any changes) in a function called <code>memoize</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoize</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isCalculated</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>ret…</span></p></code></pre></article></div>

		<p>Making music is expensive. The hardware is expensive enough, but buying all the software you need can round up to thousands of dollars. A single license for a leading DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Ableton Live can run up to $750.</p>
<p>But music production software doesn’t have to be so expensive.</p>
<p>In fact, if you take the Open Source Software (OSS) route, you can get cutting-edge music making tools for $0.</p>
<p>Finding all the right tools, however, is a challenge. A lot of existing OSS lists are outdated – some of these tools haven’t been updated since 2004. Most existing articles aren’t comprehensive enough.</p>
<p>Which is why I spent the last two days putting together the single most comprehensive list of current and available open source music production tools.<span id="more-4160"></span></p>
<p>Every single tool in this list had to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be free – no strings attached</li>
<li>It should be open source, that is, you should be able to access the source code</li>
</ul>
<p>While not all open source software runs on Mac and Windows, most of the tools on this list do. And of course, every single one of them works on Linux.</p>
<p>These strict requirements meant that a lot of popular Linux music tools, like Reaper and Bitwig, did not make the cut. However, there are perfectly competent – and <em>free</em> – alternatives, as I’ve shared below.</p>
<p>Another thing – not everyone processes information the same way. So I’ve shared the same information as both a long table, as well as a categorized list of tools. You can jump to whichever tool you prefer using the links below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#tab-view">Table View</a></li>
<li><a href="#cat-view">Category View</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want detailed information about the license, availability, and source code/download links, refer to the table view. For a quick overview, use the category view.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that working with free software is a little more complicated than working with proprietary tools. Some of the tools I’ve shared below might also lack the features or user-friendliness (not that music software is particularly user-friendly to begin with!) of their paid counterparts. On the flip side, you get completely free software, and you support the FOSS community.</p>
<p>At the end of this post, I’ve also shared some thoughts on building a completely free studio, including my software recommendations.</p>

<p>From audio editors to full-fledged digital audio workstations, there’s free music production software to fulfill most of your music making needs.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top choices across each category:</p>

<h2 id="tab-view"><span>Building a Free Music Production Studio</span></h2>
<p>After going through the list above, you’re probably thinking:&nbsp;<em>that’s a lot of software!</em></p>
<p>This was a (pleasant) surprise for me as well. I grew up with Cubase before moving onto Logic and eventually, Ableton. In this world of proprietary software, you’ve always had a lot of choice.</p>
<p>But I didn’t expect the open source world to have as many&nbsp;<em>competent&nbsp;</em>offerings as well. Some of the DAWs I shared above can go toe-to-toe with the best in the closed source world.</p>
<p>If you’re new to music production, however, going through all these tools can be a little confusing (and overwhelming).</p>
<p>To make matters simpler, I’ll show you how to create a music production studio for $0 – all by using the tools listed above.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand what you need to produce music</strong></h3>
<p>There are three parts to music production:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition and arrangement</li>
<li>Sound synthesis and design</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these should be self-explanatory, but I’ll break them down further for the beginners reading this.</p>
<p><strong>Composition and arrangement&nbsp;</strong>is the process of creating a piece of music and organizing different musical elements (i.e. “arranging”) to achieve a particular effect. If you write an original song on your guitar, that song would be called your “composition”.</p>
<p>Depending on your preferences, you can play this song in different styles (rock, pop, punk, etc.) – this is called “arrangement”.</p>
<p>In music production software, composition and arrangement usually happens on a timeline view. You can add/remove different musical elements at different to create a song. The timeline is typically divided into seconds and bars.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the timeline view in Ableton Live of one of my tracks:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4225" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4225"><img src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="559" srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" data-srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" data-src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4225">The Ableton timeline view makes it possible to create complex compositions and arrangements</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Sound synthesis and design&nbsp;</strong>is the process of manipulating a sound or a signal to produce a desired effect. Add a distortion pedal to your electric guitar, and you’re essentially “designing” your own sound.</p>
<p>There are several approach to sound design and synthesis. You can take an audio clip (called a “sample”) and turn it into a sound via a “sampler”. Or you can use a synthesizer to manipulate a simple audio signal (such as a sine wave) into your desired sound. You can further modulate this sound using various effects like reverb, delay, etc. Add a reverb, for instance, and the sound will feel wider and roomier.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a screenshot from one of the sounds I created in Serum, one of the most popular software synthesizers around.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4227"><img src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="600" srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg 721w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" data-srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg 721w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum-300x250.jpg 300w" data-src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4227">Serum is a popular virtual synth that can help you create complex sounds</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Mixing and mastering&nbsp;</strong>is the process of adjusting volume, effects, equalization, compression, etc. to create a track that sounds good on different speakers/headphones. A “good” mix is a balanced mix. Mixing and mastering is usually done by audio engineers who carefully adjust EQ, …</p></div></div></article></div>

To that end, the following is a compilation of some of the most well-adapted, <strong>commonly-used symbols</strong> in mathematics.</p><p>Moreover, these symbols are further categorized by their <strong>function</strong>&nbsp;into tables.

<p>Last night, I started a college class for the first time since I graduated in 2017. The weekend prior, I was accepted to Stanford. Well, not exactly. I was accepted to an experimental online class from Stanford called Code in Place which is based on the school’s well-regarded CS106A Programming Methodology course. </p>



<p>After being rejected by Stanford twice, once for undergraduate coming out of my gap year in 2013 and a second time for their Deferred Enrollment MBA program in 2017, it was nice to finally get some good news back from the Silicon Valley school where Google was born and <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/13/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech-2005/">Steve Jobs spoke</a>.</p>



<p>For the record, I consider myself very fortunate to have received both of those rejections because, without them, everything afterwards would have changed. I choose to appreciate everything about my past because I do not see much benefit in wondering how things could have gone differently or wishing for ways in which they could have.</p>



<p>Anyway, a combination of discovering this course from Stanford one day, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being">a class from Yale </a>the next day, and <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/catalog/free">a number of classes from Harvard</a> the day after that made me realize that the coming shift in higher education has already begun.</p>



<p>Before speculating upon what that shift may look like, it is important to acknowledge that one of two things is likely to happen, and they represent very different scenarios. The first scenario is easier to imagine but harder for me to believe which is that universities will open up again next fall as if it is business, or rather, education as usual. This seems unlikely to me, but with an accelerated path to an effective vaccine or the introduction of some other unforeseen factor, I am hesitant to count it out completely while it still remains within the realm of possibility from my perspective. The second scenario which I believe is much more likely is that we will not go back to education as usual in the fall. Instead, education will continue to be online as it has been for the last few weeks under the guise of a temporary solution to be relied on only during this thought to be relatively short-lived shelter-in-place period. This shift to online education is somewhat obvious and predictable if in fact circumstances remain several months from now so that live in-person classes in the physical world will no longer be feasible, practical, or responsible, and it is important to remember that if any institution is going to risk lives and people’s health, liberal arts colleges are probably the least likely of them all to do so. What is not as obvious or easily predictable from my perspective is how the new digital format for classes will change countless other aspects of higher education and society at large.</p>



<p>Scott Galloway had an excellent monologue on this subject in the most recent episode of his eponymous podcast, The Prof G Show. (For those who read <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/30/the-weekend-miscellaneous-7-six-easy-pieces-burn-after-reading-bedminster-pizza-ttyl-bombshell/">a previous post in which I tried to use the word eponymous but somewhat forced it</a>, hopefully we can agree this usage was much cleaner and closer to correct.) In his monologue, Scott talks about how elite universities have become the ultimate luxury brands by rejecting over 90% of their prospective customers otherwise known as students unlike even the most luxurious brands in the world like Rolex or Louis Vuitton or Rolls Royce would ever consider doing. He talks about how the value-add of universities lies as much or more in the certification than in the education and how higher education is ripe for disruption based on what he calls a disruptability index which he defines as “a function of your ability to increase prices faster than inflation without having any underlying increase in productivity of the product.” I liked that straight forward definition. Lastly, Scott talks about how schools will still want to make money and says that they will need to accept many more students in order to maintain revenues because their excessive prices, which have already garnered plenty of attention but which to date have been unrelenting due to continued demand, will now become much more egregiously apparent to even the wealthiest of parents who will have no choice but to ask why they are paying $50,000 a year for their child to join 3 or 4, 20- or 200- person Zoom classes per day, five or even only four or three days per week, taught by someone who seems less effective at online education than the people who teach the free Khan Academy videos. The college price tag that used to be justified by not only the certification but the overall experience and the access to resources and the dining hall and the dorms and the people to meet and the lifelong relationships to form, in addition to the hopefully premium version of an actual education which I am by no means discounting but simply pales in comparison to the monetary value that the word Wharton on a resume affords an individual to more easily earn over their lifetime compared to another individual with the word of a university that you or I and therefore most employers have never heard of or do not regard as good, let alone great or elite.</p>



<p>So, how will it happen that schools will begin to accept more students from whom they can generate lower revenues per student to equal the same or similar revenues as they are accustomed to? I believe we are seeing the beginning of it now, and if that is any indication of the speed and magnitude of the change, it looks poised to be large and fast.</p>



<p>I never previously had the opportunity to be a student at an Ivy League school. Already I now have the opportunity to become a student at all of them, for free. I think what we are seeing now is a land grab, or in more literal terms, a student grab. I believe the top schools are foreseeing the coming disruption of themselves and others and have come to the same conclusion that they need to expand their student base. Based on what I have seen thus far, it seems to me that they are beginning to test and implement a tried and true strategy that has been successful for so many tech and media companies before them, and that is, the freemium strategy. </p>



<p>Elite universities are now giving away their most basic offerings for free to get as many students on board as they possibly can so that the base is as large as possible for them to upsell once they figure out how exactly they want to do that based on what they believe will be the best way to monetize their student base which will soon be degrees of magnitude larger than ever before for schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and hopefully my alma mater too. I say hopefully because by default the schools that do not grow will shrink, not only in students but in relevance and prominence and therefore in the benefits that graduates will experience by having their schools’ names on their resumes. </p>



<p>Premium products will be varying and virtually limitless and the prices for the very best of them I imagine will be very steep. For example, one may be able to take an intro to macroeconomics class from Harvard for free but the advanced classes as one works his or her way up the chain of prerequisites to the land of advanced electives will cost money, likely more and more of it as the student advances further. Alternatively, I suppose all of those classes could remain free and the approach to charging for premium offerings could be focused more on gaining access to smaller classes or ones with more small group Zoom meetings or ones with better professors with better reviews. Perhaps professors will be paid more like restaurant workers in that they are given a nominal wage in exchange for their work and the opportunity to earn large tips from generous diners for their excellent service, or in this case, ad-hoc income from wealthier students for their one-on-one tutoring sessions or access to office hours. Unlike most restaurant workers, some professors could make an absolute killing this way. </p>



<p>I am not sure exactly how all of this will take shape but I am reasonably confident that if higher education is heading in a digital direction, as it appears to be, then the freemium model will be widely employed. As a result, many more people worldwide will have access to the best schools in the world, which is a good thing, but people will still have to pay potentially steep prices for things like certification which unfortunately are unreasonably valued by top employers making their seemingly unreasonable prices unfortunately reasonable. I’m taking the Code in Place class from Stanford for the next five weeks and I expect to gain the valuable new skill of basic programming for free which is awesome and amazing, but was not surprised when I read in no uncertain terms before applying that I would not be getting any sort of university credit or certification for completing the class. Of course, that would be far too valuable to give away for free. Schools will give away the product but not the certification, because that is the biggest part of what people have been paying for all long. One question I am curious to see answered is what happens when I and the 10,000 other students taking this Code in Place Stanford class with me put it on their resumes anyway? What happens if employers start caring less about where you learned and more about what you know? I suppose as with most things these days, we will just have to do our best to guess, or otherwise wait to find out.</p>

<p>Do you ever get the feeling that there is some universal structure underpinning reality? It is easy when staring at the night sky to feel entwined with the cosmos and the bigger picture. Sometimes it feels as if it is on the tip of our tongues. Very rarely, we are afforded a glimpse into the enigmatic machinery that drives existence.</p>

<p>Recently, I have been exploring the conceptual link between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis" target="_blank">abiogenesis</a> and the notion that sentience and computational structures can arise naturally as a consequence of the logical underpinnings of reality. Following is a roadmap along my journey to this point and the fascinating links between disparate subjects that I have come across as a result. I hope that they might provide a similar amount of excitement to you as they have for me.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/turing_basins/expository/GEB.jpg" alt="GEB"></p>

<p>This semantic journey began back in High School when my friend implored that I pick up a copy of a veritable tome “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach" target="_blank">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>”. I couldn’t have predicted how that book would transform my notion of self or my thoughts towards an existential framework to embed my understanding of life, but it suffices to say that work has shaped the lens which I view most of my philosophy through.</p>

<p>Given the incredibly broad scope of the book, it is difficult to explain, in short at least, what its key message is. GEB is one of those philosophy books that makes an attempt to explain the machinations responsible for sentience, life, and the structure of meaning. It is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology" target="_blank">epistemological</a> journey that weaves the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del" target="_blank">Kurt Gödel</a> (a brilliant mathematician credited for proving the limitations of logic itself), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher" target="_blank">M.C. Escher</a> (a graphic artist with a keen mathematical intuition for recursion and beauty but with no formal training), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach" target="_blank">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> (whose musical compositions and fugues contained intricate recursive structures akin to Escher’s paintings). What makes GEB stand out from a sea of similar spiritual works is the formal treatment of the subjects at hand. Much in the way the abstract nature of Zen abets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan" target="_blank">Kōans</a> to guide personal discovery, GEB leads the reader through many thought experiments that give flashes of insight on the nature of self, biology, semantics, and the recursive nature of being. It is one of those books that you might have to read 20 pages at a time and wait a week or so for the conclusion it was leading you towards to manifest (sometimes suddenly when laying in bed or on a hike). When I explore new topics, I find myself finding the teachings of GEB leaking through the cracks of most concepts. Ever since my encounter with that book, I have been convinced on many occasions that there are easter eggs hidden in our reality waiting for us to find them.</p>

<h2 id="abiogenesis">Abiogenesis</h2>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/turing_basins/expository/kelp.jpg" alt="Kelp"></p>

<p>When discussing the origin of meaning and sentience, the discussion will inevitably drift towards philosophy of creation. There are many hypotheses for how life arose from inorganic material (abiogenesis), but one of my favorite explorations on this topic is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment" target="_blank">Miller-Urey Experiment</a> wherein researchers created a closed-system that contained base elements required for life (Water, Methane, Ammonia, and Hydrogen) and a means of perturbing that solution to see what would happen. The perturbation involved boiling the solution, running the steam through an electric spark gap, condensing the steam, then recirculating the condensate back into the original reservoir.</p>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/turing_basins/expository/Miller_Urey.png" alt="Miller Urey Experiment Setup"></p>

<p>The researchers found that, after a day of operation, 11 out of the 20 essential amino acids that create the building blocks for organic chemistry as we know it were created spontaneously in this closed system. The conclusion was that lightning, geothermal activity, and the presence of these common compounds could have paved the way for the first organisms on Earth.</p>

<p>Several variations of this experiment have been performed since and confirm under multiple chemical scenarios that amino acids essential to organic matter apparate from these stochastic processes that existed early on our planet.</p>

<h2 id="but-why">But Why?</h2>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/turing_basins/expository/cosmic_background_radiation.jpg" alt="Cosmic Background Radiation"></p>

<p>We have established that the building blocks for life are a structure that arise naturally in different chemical scenarios. So what? Even if we have that, why are biological structures the eventual output of the physics that govern our universe? This question is, of course, much harder to answer. The key to understanding this question may come down to one of the most fundamental and brutal laws of our universe: the 2nd law of thermodynamics:</p>

<p>“[T]he total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible.”</p>

<p>For starters, entropy is generally a measure of the amount of states a system can have given a macroscopic state of the system as a whole. For instance, there are billions of ways a small amount of gas might be at a temperature 70 degrees. Entropy is inexorably linked to the concept of energy, and describes how energy is dispersed at a given temperature. The gist of the 2nd law is that entropy is bound to increase in a closed system and everything, including the universe itself, is heading towards a concept known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe" target="_blank">Heat Death</a>. The stars will all eventually burn out, and all matter will eventually decay into its lowest possible energy state. The inevitable conclusion is that matter is heading towards a global average, and structure will eventually decay from existence.</p>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/turing_basins/expository/tangled_headphones.jpg" alt="Tangled Headphones"></p>

<p>But, then, how does that explain life? Life spontaneously organizes into very regular structures. The human body is so complex that we still only have a basic grasp of some of its most fundamental systems. Life is a popular counter-example to the theory of entropy increase, since life inherently produces islands of lower entropy (equated here with complex structure, thus less micro-states explaining the same macro-phenomenon). The key takeaway in this context is that life (while having <em>much</em> lower entropy than its surroundings) is actually very efficient at increasing entropy as a whole. The Earth is far from a closed system, and the vast majority of energy dispersed on Earth comes from the sun. If you were to close off the earth from all external energy sources, you could envision that life would decay quite rapidly and entropy consequently would increase at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>Think, for a moment, that the 2nd law of thermodynamics is a goal of the universe. If the universe were to optimize for this goal, if not only because that is the nature of its reality, then it would make sense that structures efficient at increasing entropy would be a natural “conclusion” of this process.</p>

<p>To make this less hand-wavy, there has been considerable research on this topic. An incredibly useful application of this philosophy is the detection of extra-terrestrial life. One of the main goals of exploring neighboring planets like Mars is to see if life ever existed there, and if so in what form? A sticky topic in this goal is the definition of life. Alternate models for biology have been founded by replacing carbon with silicon, and it is easy to ask the question “what if life elsewhere is nothing like the biology we know here?”. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_and_life" target="_blank">Entropy turns out to be a very useful context</a> in which to frame life as a consumer of negative entropy via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_metabolism" target="_blank">Information Metabolism</a>. It turns out using mathematical techniques like <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/potential-for-detecting-life-as-we-dont-know-it-by-fractal-complexity-analysis/81169D2F63946BCA4BB0DE6548597663" target="_blank">fractal analysis</a> to discover differentials in entropy given an environment, we can detect life without needing to subjectively label something as organic or inorganic.</p>

<h2 id="complexity-and-entropy">Complexity and Entropy</h2>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/turing_basins/expository/complex_wires.jpg" alt="Complex Computer Wires"></p>

<p>You might realize that the term “complexity” is tossed around in concert with entropy. This is where we start to blur the lines between computation, information, physics, and biology. An alternate definition of Entropy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29" target="_blank">Shannon Entropy</a>, which is a “20 Questions” approach to describing the states of a system. Simply put, the Shannon Entropy of a system is the amount of yes/no questions (expressed commonly as “bits”) you have to ask before you are 100% positive you know what is being talked about. The Shannon entropy of a coin-flip is then one bit, 2.58 bits for a six-sided die, and less for a loaded six-sided-die. Another factor worth mentioning is that Shannon Entropy represents the average amount of bits required to describe a system’s state, not just one of its states.</p>

<p>Complexity, on the other hand, is a measure of exactly how much talking you must do in order to describe a given state of a system. In information theory, a common measure of complexity is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" target="_blank">Kolmogorov Complexity</a> which is the length of the shortest computer program that produces the state in question. It is normally framed within the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" target="_blank">Lambda Calculus</a> (which lets you represent computer programs in the most terse and mathematically rigorous form possible). For example, given a picture you took on your phone, the Kolmogorov complexity of that image would be akin to the smallest file you could compress it into without losing any detail.</p>

<p>A fascinating consequence of defining complexity in this way is that, in general, you cannot form a heuristic for finding the Kolmogorov Complexity of arbitrary data. That means that it is impossible to create a program to compute the Kolmogorov Complexity of any string of information. This result is a consequence of many of the same limitations of logic itself that lead to undecidable questions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" target="_blank">The Halting Problem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis" target="_blank">The Continuum Hypothesis</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" target="_blank">Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems</a>.</p>

<p>Under the definition of Shannon Entropy, entropy is the expected value (think of average) of the Kolmogorov Complexity of the system being measured. More simply stated, entropy is a measure of average complexity of a system. This is conceptually sufficient for my diatribe on entropy here, but for further justification there are <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/papers/info.pdf" target="_blank">wonderful papers</a> that have been written on this topic. Thus it makes sense to talk about complexity when speaking of entropy, or vice-versa. It is also important to not conflate the two, as they are describing different …</p></div></div></div>

			<p>A couple of months ago, my friend <a href="https://whoo.ps/">Jonathan</a> introduced me to spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is a method to augment your long-term memory. This is how I have been using it to learn the NATO phonetic alphabet (Alfa, Bravo, Charlie…).</p>

			<p>Spaced repetition (SR) is essentially flashcards that you review at the right time, i.e., when you are about to forget them, to improve long-term retention.</p>
<p><img src="https://gduverger.com/img/email-your-memory/forgetting-curve.png"></p>

<p>The problem is that you don't realize when you are about to forget something. That's where software comes in handy.</p>
<p>After having tried popular SR apps, I believe <strong>email is the simplest, most natural way to implement spaced repetition</strong> for yourself. To test that, I set up an email address and sent it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet">NATO phonetic alphabet</a> (A as in Alfa, B as in Bravo, C as in Charlie…).</p>
<p>The subject of the email is the front of the flashcard and the body is the back. The service emailed me back to review my cards after 3 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, etc. and helped me remember it forever.</p>

<p>It's like emailing your memory. ✉️ ➡️ 🧠</p>
<p>The email address is <a href="mailto:memory@localstorage.io">memory@localstorage.io</a>. It is free and available right now. I'm curious to see what others would use it for. Give it a try, help me test it, and remember anything!</p>

<p>
    At this point, we are not as fond of Facebook as we used to be. We mostly
    are just not that active anymore, abandoned entirely, or even considering
    deleting our accounts. Something is holding us still, though; we have part
    of our history there. On each "status update", we registered a moment, those
    posts add up to document years of our lives.
</p>

<p>
    Even if you want to keep your Facebook account to save these memories,
    they are hidden from you by Facebook's newsfeed algorithm. Facebook
    decides which of your memories to surface, not you, and it is very
    cumbersome to search for them. If you want to move out of Facebook, but
    keep your Facebook history and gain the ability to search your old posts
    quickly, Quid Sentio can solve your problem.
</p>

<h3>Understanding Quid Sentio</h3>
<p>
	If you are not familiar with Quid Sentio yet, it is a digital personal
	journal that you can share with your real friends. Using text, audio, and
	custom tags, you create private entries, with an easy way to filter and
	search, and the ability to share and comment with trusted friends (real
	friends, not the ones that are your "facebook friends").
</p>
<p>
	Quid Sentio has an import tool for Facebook status updates posts. First, you
	have to export and download your data from your Facebook account, then
	upload that file to Quid Sentio, and all your status updates become
	searchable journal entries.
</p>

<h2>How to export your Facebook posts</h2>

<p>
	The first thing to do is to download a file from Facebook with all your posts. Here
	is a step-by-step tutorial on how to do it.
</p>

<p><em>Note: the screenshots presented here are from the new Facebook interface.
If your Facebook still has the old design, it might look different, but
the options are largely the same (or very similar). You should be able to follow
these steps without any issue.</em></p>

<h4>1. Go to your Facebook settings</h4>

<p>At the top right, click on the down arrow to open the menu. Select
<em>"Settings &amp; Privacy"</em> and then again <em>"Settings"</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-menu.png" alt="Facebook menu, Settings &amp; Privacy option">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-menu-2.png" alt="Facebook menu, Settings option"></p><h4>2. Select "Your Facebook Information" and "Download Your Information"</h4>

<p><em>Note: Quid Sentio is prepared to identify the Facebook information structure
when it's written in English. If you use Facebook in another language, I suggest
you change it to English before exporting your posts (it is ok for the posts
themselves to be in another language).</em></p>

<p>
	In the Settings page, select the option
	<em>"Your Facebook Information"</em> on the left side menu.
</p>

<p>
	Then, among the presented options, click on
	<em>"Download Your Information"</em>.
</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-settings.png" alt="Facebook Settings page"></p><h4>3. Choose the format "JSON" and select "Posts" data to download</h4>

<p>You will see a box with download options. You must choose the format
<em>"JSON"</em>, so Quid Sentio can import your posts.</p>

<p>You can also decide which information you want to download. Quid Sentio will only
use <em>"Posts"</em>, but the information will be downloaded in separate files,
so you can choose as many as you want.</p>

<p>After selecting the <em>format: "JSON"</em> and <em>"Posts"</em>, click on the
button <em>"Create File"</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-download-select.png" alt="Facebook Information Download options"></p><h4>4. Wait until your file is available and download it</h4>

<p>You can't download your information immediately; Facebook has to process your
request. You will receive an email informing you that they are processing the
request and another email as soon as the request is processed and ready for
download.
</p>

<p>
    If you selected only the <em>"Posts"</em> type of information, it would
    usually take no more than 5 minutes. It might take longer if you selected more
    types of information.
</p>



<p>Once your file is ready, go back to the same page (<em>Settings &gt; Your
Facebook Information &gt; Download Your Information</em>). There, click on the tab
<em>"Available Copies"</em> and click on the <em>"Download"</em> button of the file
listed there.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-file-ready.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download"></p><p>You will download a compressed ZIP file (ending in <code>.zip</code>) with
separate folders for each type of information that you selected to download. The
file with your posts is usually called <code>your_posts_1.json</code>. Extract this
file from the ZIP file.</p>

<p>Now you have your file with all your Facebook posts downloaded at your
computer. You are ready to import them to your Quid Sentio journal.</p>

<h4>5. Create your Quid Sentio account and upload your posts file</h4>

<p>Now the easy part. Go to <a href="https://www.quidsentio.com/" target="_blank">www.quidsentio.com</a> and Sign Up.</p>

<p>Then click on <em>"Account"</em> at the top right, and you will see the button
to <em>"Upload your posts .json file"</em>. Click on it and select the file you
just downloaded from Facebook with your posts (the one probably called
<code>your_posts_1.json</code>).</p>

<p>You will see how many status updates posts you have and show the button to
<em>"Start import process"</em>. Click on it and see the count of imported posts
going up. Please do not close the site or refresh the page until it finishes its
process.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-account.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download">

<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-import.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download"></p><p>That's it! You have now transformed all your Facebook status updates into
Quid Sentio journal entries. Experiment a little bit searching through your
older updates and explore your past in a way that Facebook never allowed!</p>

<h2><strong>Why</strong> transfer your posts from Facebook to Quid
Sentio?</h2>

<p>You know how to do it, but you might be wondering why do it. Here is a list
of a few advantages of having your Facebook update posts on Quid Sentio:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        You can search and filter your posts.<br>
        Quid Sentio clearly shows all your old posts, with easy ways to filter
        by keywords, also allowing you to add custom tags for future reference.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        You will not be tracked or manipulated to addiction at Quid Sentio.<br>
        Quid Sentio is not supported by ads, so there is no need to track your
        every move nor use every trick in the book to keep you mindlessly
        scrolling. Quid Sentio does not use any third-party client-side tracking.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        You will have better control over your privacy.<br>
        Every entry (including the imported ones) is visible only to you by
        default. You can add real friends to your Quid Sentio network and
        individually decide for each entry who can read it. There
        is no way to search for people at Quid Sentio. You will have only
        the people you manually added as your friends.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>A few disclaimers</h3>

<p>In case you are new to Quid Sentio, there are a few things that are important
for you to know before deciding to import your Facebook posts.</p>

<p>You will only import your Facebook Status updates posts. The downloaded "Posts"
file includes lots of other types of posts that are not status updates. Things
like posts on your friends' timelines, posts on groups, on events. Those things
do not match the format of journal entries, so all of those are ignored. Just
your status updates are imported as Quid Sentio entries.</p>

<p>You will not import your Facebook pictures. While Quid Sentio entries allow for
images, it is a very different experience from Facebook with its
albums. You are better off downloading Facebook pictures and keeping at your
computer or another photo service of your choice.</p>

<p>You will not import your Facebook "friends". Quid Sentio meaning of "friends"
is very different from Facebook's. I believe you should add friends to your Quid
Sentio network very consciously, adding only those you really trust. I designed
Quid Sentio to avoid "contact spam" of any form. So I will not ask or even allow
you to upload your list of friends to Quid Sentio. You have to add them one by
one.</p>

<p>Quid Sentio is a paid service, not supported by ads, but by customers that
pay for it if they find it valuable. While you can create an account for free and
import all your Facebook status posts also for free, after that, you will have
become a Supporter ($19/year) to be able to create more entries.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, you can import your posts and leave them at Quid Sentio for
free. Only if you want to continue to create new entries that you need to become
a paying supporter.</p>

<p>Quid Sentio still does not have an export tool of its own. I do believe
everyone should have control of all the data they update to an online service.
The only reason Quid Sentio does not have this feature is that I am the sole
developer of Quid Sentio, so things are a bit slow to build. The export tool is
on the roadmap, so rest assured that by the time you sign up to Quid Sentio,
create a few entries, and decide to move out to another service and export your
data, it will  be ready.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Visly is a large, complex React app - as you can probably imagine, state management is something we think a lot about. Recently, we decided to move away from using popular community state management frameworks and implement our own solution, named simply <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>. To many this may sound like a bad idea, and to be honest we thought so too at first. But after attempting to solve our problems with existing solutions, nothing was working like we wanted it to, so we decided to give our own a try. We're incredibly happy with the end result. Let me tell you why we built our own solution and how it works!</p><a id="background" href="#background"><h2>Background</h2></a><p>First, I think it’s important to give a quick introduction to the technical architecture of Visly for context.</p><p>Visly is an electron app written in React &amp; Typescript with a background Node process that manages shared state and our code generation pipeline. The frontend itself is split up into many smaller React apps, each running within its own electron renderer instance. This allows tabs in Visly to render independently as they are separate render processes. Each render process (tab) talks to the background process to fetch project data, which in turn is read from the file system. The render processes then cache this data locally to speed up interactions. Mutations, or changes to the data, are synchronized back to the background process and then shared with all other render processes to make sure they also have the latest changes. </p><p>An important thing to note is that the background and render processes operate on the same data models, but keep local copies to stay performant. Also, even though our background process acts as a backend, it runs locally, meaning we don't have the same performance and availability concerns a typical web app may have.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/h56a2v5anqe2/2HJYDGMJylae01yLg8cwKq/d0b65ae0ce848480c92f7bdaba249fa9/excalidraw-202012613850-2.png"></p><a id="the-problem" href="#the-problem"><h2>The problem</h2></a><p>Before migrating to <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>, we were using a mix of <a href="http://apollographql.com/">Apollo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-spring/zustand">Zustand</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html">React context</a>, and unmanaged global object stores to store state in Visly. This led to a ton of problems keeping state between the various stores in sync. While this was mostly a problem of our own creation - we kept adding solutions without going back and cleaning up old solutions - and could have been solved by implementing and sticking with a single solution, the reason we kept adding additional solutions was that nothing we tried solved all our problems. </p><p>The issue with Apollo was not so much Apollo, but rather GraphQL; Visly is just not a great use case for it. In Visly, we need access to all data on every page of the application, while GraphQL is built for apps where every page only uses a subset of the available data. In addition to this, while Apollo does offer subscriptions for live updating data, they aren't designed to be the main delivery mechanism for data, or design for apps where all data is live. We actually ended up writing our own subscription mechanisms as well as disabling the built-in Apollo cache.</p><p>The issue with react context is that it's very hard to enable minimal updates to the component tree when data changes. When data changes in a context, then all subscribers to that context change, whether or not they depend on the specific data that changed.</p><p>The issue with Zustand, Redux, Recoil, and many other existing global state management solutions, which do offer fine-grained control of component re-rendering, was that they were very tightly coupled to the React ecosystem, whereas we wanted to make use of the same functionality across our frontend, backend, and command line tools.</p><p>We wanted a single solution that would solve all these problems and give us the ability to implement cross-process state synchronization, history management, performance debugging, and transaction support on a higher level, outside of product code. So we decided to build <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>.</p><a id="requirements" href="#requirements"><h2>Requirements</h2></a><p>As we were looking to overhaul state management within Visly, we started by taking a step back to identify all our requirements. We then tried to work these into various open source tools such as <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started">redux</a>, <a href="https://mobx.js.org/README.html">mobx</a>, and even new libraries such as <a href="http://recoiljs.org/">Recoil</a>. While we could have gotten them all to work, none of them felt like a natural fit with how we wanted to manage our state, and would have required significant work to build plugins and wrappers around their APIs anyways. So what were we looking for? We wanted a tool that had:</p><div><ul><li index="0">Support for history management (i.e. - undo/redo);</li><li index="1">Minimal re-rendering of React components;</li><li index="2">Support for both React and Node environments;</li><li index="3">Built-in concepts for synchronizing state between different processes;</li><li index="4">Ability to split state between multiple stores and perform mutations across them;</li><li index="5">Plain function mutations &amp; selectors that can easily be tested and reused outside of React;</li><li index="6">Immutable data; and</li><li index="7">Was built for Typescript.</li></ul></div><p>We also plan to implement support for concurrent mode in future - it's something we're super excited to make use of in Visly, and I'm confident that we can implement support for in <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> when it reaches stability.</p><a id="visly-state" href="#visly-state"><h2>visly-state</h2></a><p>Time to take a look at how <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> works and how it solves these problems for us. In its most simple usage, <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> can be used almost exactly as React’s built-in <code value="useState">useState</code>, except that the state is stored in a global store instead of attached directly to a single component instance, meaning the state is shared between all components that read from it.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useVislyState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>const</span> counter <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>function</span> <span><span>Component</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>state<span>,</span> setState<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useVislyState</span><span>(</span>counter<span>)</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>increment</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span> s<span>.</span><span>count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>increment<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Count: </span><span>{</span>state<span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>In practice, this simple usage isn’t very common. We use it mostly for very simple global state, such as our <code value="zoomState">zoomState</code>, which keeps track of how much you have zoomed into the Visly canvas. </p><p>Instead, we make use of <code value="useValue">useValue</code> and <code value="useMutation">useMutation</code> hooks, which take selector and mutation functions respectively. Selectors are functions which, given a piece of state, return some derived state, either a subset of the state or some new state computed from the underlying state object. Mutations functions are what they sound like, function that apply mutations to a state object.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useValue<span>,</span> useMutation <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>As you can see from this example, selector and mutation functions are just plain old Javascript functions and therefore can be shared with code running outside of a React app and can be unit tested very easily.</p><pre><code><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>'count is correctly incremented'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> state <span>=</span> <span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>incrementCount</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span>
    <span>expect</span><span>(</span>state<span>.</span><span>count</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toBe</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Another benefit of using <code value="useValue">useValue</code> with a selector function is that components can subscribe to only a subset of the data in a state object, meaning if you have a large state object and only change a single property, then only components that read that property will update.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useValue<span>,</span> useMutation <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>One thing you’ll notice is how mutations make changes to the state directly instead of returning a new object with the updates included. You may even think that this is a very bad pattern, we shouldn’t be mutating state, state should be immutable! Well it is :) Under the hood <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> uses <a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer">immer</a>, a fantastic javascript library for working with immutable data. Before <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> calls your mutations it will actually create a mutable copy of the state object for you to apply your changes to, it will then use immer to track the changes you have made and use those changes to create a new immutable state object. The benefit of this is that mutations become very simple to write compared to typical reducers which require destructuring many layers of nested properties.</p><h3>Synced state</h3><p>Another benefit we gain from using immer to track changes during mutations is that we can use that change set to efficiently synchronize state with a remote store (for example our background process!). We’ve built this functionality into what we called <code value="syncedState">syncedState</code>. A synced state works just like a number state object except all changes are synchronized via a global <code value="syncAdapter">syncAdapter</code>, this sync adapter can be implemented on both the frontend and backend to enable live sync of state updates.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> syncedState<span>,</span> setSyncAdapter <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>WSSyncAdapter</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/sync/socket'</span>

<span>setSyncAdapter</span><span>(</span><span><span>WSSyncAdapter</span></span><span>(</span><span>'wss://localhost:3000'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

<span>const</span> counter <span>=</span> <span>syncedState</span><span>(</span><span>'CountState'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>That’s all you need to make sure all changed to <code value="counter">counter</code> are synced back to your backend. Your backend will then implement its own sync adapter, which can contain additional logic for reconciling multiple change sets and managing any potential conflicts. As you can see, the only difference from a regular local <code value="state">state</code> here is that we supply what we call a <code value="syncKey">syncKey</code>, which is an …</p></div></div>

		<p>Duncan Hamra has been building businesses with his best friend Tyler since they were in high school. From mowing lawns to a memberships and gated content no-code platform.</p><p>Today we'll talk about <a href="https://formatically.com/">Formatically</a>, an instant citation tool that didn't take off. We'll discuss what went wrong with this project, what were the lessons learned, and how those learnings helped him start Memberstack.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>

</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-background-and-what-are-you-currently-working-on">Can you tell us a bit about your background and what are you currently working on?</h3><p>My name is Duncan Hamra and I’m currently working on <a href="https://www.memberstack.io/">Memberstack</a>. We're making it easier to add user accounts and payments to any website. I'm the co-founder, and I do most of the design work there. I was lucky enough to meet my best friend and my current co-founder in preschool. We've been best friends for a really long time. We're both 25, and we've known each other for pretty much all of our lives. We started our first company together in high school, where we hired some friends, knocked on some neighbor's doors, and started mowing lawns.</p><figure><a href="https://www.memberstack.io/"><div><p>Memberstack - Memberships and Gated content w/out code</p><p>Add free or paid memberships to any website without writing code. Memberstack is the designer-friendly membership platform you can add to the sites you already built.</p><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5bbfaf3252489b4c484ba9b9/5c7477fd5492e1d292630db8_Webclip.png"><span>Memberships and Gated content w/out code</span></p></div><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5bbfaf3252489b4c484ba9b9/5c9bff27182ede1adbb1af9d_OPENGRAPH.png"></p></a></figure><p>We ran that business for three years before we managed to sell it to somebody. We restarted it three times. There were two failed versions before we got to the version that sold and we didn't sell it for a ton of money. We sold the equipment and a contact list of 100 people. We used some of that money from selling the business to start building a website called Formatically.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-come-up-with-the-idea-to-build-formatically-what-was-the-motivation-behind-it"><strong>How did you come up with the idea to build Formatically? What was the motivation behind it?</strong></h3><p>We had the idea while we were in high school. We were making lists of problems we thought would be interesting to solve. The advice we had heard was to find a problem you have yourself, and then figure out how to solve that. We were sitting in English class one day and our teacher mentioned that somebody needs to make it easier to automatically format papers. We had a little bit of money and we learned about <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a> and <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a>. Building a website can't be that hard. We hired someone to do that. It was 2013 and we spent the next five years building different versions of that website, learning how to write code, learning how to design, learning how to hire people only to find out at the end that you have to have an idea that you can relate to and that you can solve well, but also has to be able to make money. It was incredibly valuable and I have no regrets. We had a blast.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-build-formatically">How did you build Formatically?</h3><p>We first got into WordPress. We were listening to a podcast called the <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/listen/">Smart Passive Income</a> and the recommended stack was Bluehost, WordPress, and a virtual assistant. If you needed to build something more complicated, you just hired a virtual assistant or you hired someone on Upwork to build that thing for you. We had not heard anything about any no-code tools, it wasn't being tossed around. We hired a college student in New York. He started with a WordPress app and then built a JavaScript and PHP application. It was pixel perfect from a PowerPoint file that Tyler and I made, which was all boxes and text.

We wrote some comments around the web when people were complaining about different citation tools and formatting tools. The thing that got us most of our traffic was writing articles. We wrote how-to articles where we would first talk about how to format papers. We ended up getting some SEO from that and reaching 260,000 visitors in 6 years. </p><figure><img src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/eJ8sCjfC.png" alt="formatically-analytics" srcset="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/eJ8sCjfC.png 600w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/eJ8sCjfC.png 1000w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/eJ8sCjfC.png 1600w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/eJ8sCjfC.png 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Formatically Analytics</figcaption></figure><h3 id="what-were-your-biggest-challenges-you-had-to-overcome">What were your biggest challenges you had to overcome?</h3><p>The first one was working with an external provider. Because we had somebody else building it for us, we had to learn through that person. We didn't know what we were doing. It was very hard to iterate through those versions. We'd create a version, realize it was terrible. And then we will need to spend another $2,000 to completely rebuild the product. We were not even sure if this new version was going to work.</p><p>We discovered paper prototyping and prototyping tools. I started getting into that. Another big challenge was monetization. We were trying to figure out what does our product offer that people are willing to pay for if there is anything.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-realize-the-project-was-not-going-in-the-right-direction">How did you realize the project was not going in the right direction?</h3><p>The funny thing is, I don't think we ever did. We were both very optimistic. We were determined to get this going and working. We only stopped working on it because we had the idea for MemberStack. We both did a pitch competition where we pitched an entirely different idea because we knew Formatically wouldn't win. We wanted to get the money for Formatically. We won second place and took that money. We ended up getting an office space as part of the winnings. We were sitting in the office space working on Formatically and both of us had the idea for MemberStack. We agreed to not give up on it but to try the new idea for a couple of weeks and see what happened. In the first three days, we managed to get a client. We had pretended to be an agency. Everyone's pretending so we said we were an agency and managed to get a client in the first week. We decided to pursue it and to come back to Formatically eventually. We've been saying that ever since. It still exists. The optimistic part of me still wants to keep it alive so others can do something with it. I don't know if we’re really stubborn, but I'm glad we found MemberStack.</p><figure><img src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/formatically.PNG" alt="formatically-homepage-2020" srcset="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/formatically.PNG 600w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/formatically.PNG 1000w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/formatically.PNG 1600w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/formatically.PNG 1892w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Current Formatically Homepage</figcaption></figure><h3 id="did-you-achieve-any-revenue-in-the-end-how-much-money-did-you-lose">Did you achieve any revenue?

If there was some way we could accelerate that learning, it would be worthwhile. But just knowing where we were at, and what we knew at the time and the information we had, I have no regrets.</p><p>Design is very important, but having something that looks good is at least half the battle. But at the same time, perfection is the enemy. If you're waiting to launch because something needs to be perfect, then you're moving way too slowly.</p><blockquote>It's also really powerful if you're building a web app to be able to build web apps. </blockquote><p>When I think about starting a business, I evaluate it from several perspectives that I didn't before. I use the framework from <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 hours</a>, which isn't a business site, but I like the way they think. When you go to tackle a problem, look at it in three dimensions. How many people have this problem? How important is this problem to them individually? How easy is this to solve? You have to ask yourself how easy is it to solve with the things I have now. How much easier would it be to solve if I utilized all my resources? The vision we had for Formatically required resources that Tyler and I didn't have, we had to learn them.</p><p>Because we were young, we were in a place in our lives where it was normal for us to recognize we needed resources, then go to school, or go get jobs to learn those things. We were missing the ability to design and write code. So let's go learn to do that. I think that was really valuable. I'm not confident we did in the most effective way though. Thanks to no-code tools and coding bootcamps, design schools, companies like <a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=4095934.745a1c&amp;utm_medium=affiliate">Webflow</a>, it makes designing and building quite a bit easier. I say there are definitely more effective ways to get there than we did.</p><h3 id="from-all-your-takeaways-you-learned-from-this-experience-what-advice-do-you-have-for-other-entrepreneurs-who-want-to-get-started-or-are-just-starting-out">From all your takeaways you learned from this experience, what advice do you have for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?</h3><p>Get feedback on everything you're doing.

Don't be afraid to reach out to people. </blockquote><p>One place to start is other people who are starting businesses, but the best people you can talk to are your actual customers. If you struggle to find real customers to talk to, that's a very uncomfortable realization, but it's a helpful realization that the thing you're solving doesn't have many people who need it, or you're not in a good position yet to be able to solve, talk to and interact with those people. The people I've seen who've been the most successful are the ones who have a clear path. They have a clearer understanding of what the problem is and a clear path to the people who are feeling that problem.</p><p>If you have those two things, then you just need to solve the problem.

<p>I’m really interested in building hardware fast. I was reading through Patrick Collison’s <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/fast">list</a> of big projects that were completed quickly when I saw this entry:</p>
<p><strong>iPod</strong>. Tony Fadell was hired to create the iPod in late January 2001. Steve Jobs greenlit the project in March 2001. They hired a contract manufacturer in April 2001, announced the product in October 2001, and shipped the first production iPod to customers in November 2001, around 290 days after getting started.&nbsp;<em>Source: Tony Fadell</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s the detailed timeline according to Tony Fadell:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jan (1st week) – First phone call with Apple<br>Jan (3rd week) – First meeting with Apple<br>Jan (4th week) – Become a consultant leading iPod investigation, “what is possible?”. There’s no team, prototype, designs, nothing.<br>May (3rd week) – Pitch to Steve Jobs, project greenlit at the end of the meeting<br>April (2nd week) – Become full time employee<br>April (3rd week) – Find contract manufacturer somewhere in Taiwan/HKG/Korea<br>May (2nd week) – Hired first employee on team<br>October (4th week) – Launched iPod to the world<br>November (1st week) – Shipped first iPods to customers</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple sold approximately 125,000 iPods by December 2001. How on earth did they go from hiring the first employee to work on it in May to shipping in November? This is an almost unheard of timeline for consumer hardware, especially given the volume. The answer: this timeline is highly misleading. But it still contains great lessons in fast hardware development.</p>
<p>Apple had been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47bNpIbCaL8&amp;t=28m27s">investigating</a> the possibility of an mp3 player since as early as 2000, but hadn’t been able to find the right components to make something really compelling. Then Toshiba showed them a new 1.8″ hard drive. Jon Rubinstein, an Apple hardware executive, immediately recognized that this was the missing piece needed to make an iPod. Apple signed a purchase order for $10M and negotiated exclusive use.</p>
<p>Soon after, Rubinstein hired Tony Fadell to lead the iPod program. A handful of engineers were hired to design the architecture of the device and select the major components. One of the first things Fadell did was partner with PortalPlayer, a startup that made processors specifically for mp3 players. PortalPlayer had a reference design for an mp3 player based on their chip. Copying this existing reference design immediately got Apple about 80% of the way to the final iPod electronics. But Apple wasn’t the only company working on an mp3 player using PortalPlayer chips. In fact, there were 11 or 12 other companies also working on their own versions. But Fadell managed to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=o4hZIF0Uz44C&amp;pg=PT44&amp;lpg=PT44&amp;dq=portalplayer%2Breference%2Bdesign&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o6WbUxwK6l&amp;sig=ACfU3U1O3s7QHkqrHd4vpDGjIas5jwfIbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijuMKv_5DnAhXbJDQIHaX8BW4Q6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=portalplayer%20reference%20design&amp;f=false">convince</a> PortalPlayer to stop supporting all of their other clients and focus 100% of their effort on helping Apple. About 280 employees at PortalPlayer dropped everything to develop the iPod. Apple requested support for things like larger playlists, AAC files, and an equalizer, and PortalPlayer implemented them. </p>
<p>The higher level software came from another startup called Pixio. Their OS was tweaked to become the iPod GUI. The rest of the electronics, like the power supply and the display driver, were based on previous designs Apple had used in other products. </p>
<p>But what about the iconic form factor? Contrary to popular belief, it was not summoned from the ether by Jony Ive. The basic shape was defined by the size of the hard drive. Phil Schiller, Apple’s head of marketing, was actually the one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47bNpIbCaL8&amp;t=32m20s">who came up with the iconic scroll wheel</a>. He <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3016910/apples-inspiration-for-the-ipod-bang-olufsen-not-dieter-rams">stole the idea</a> from his home phone, made by a company called B&amp;O. Apple immediately patented this “idea”, and later ended up licensing that patent back to B&amp;O!</p>
<p>I don’t care how amazing your resources are, getting a product from an idea to putting 125,000 of them on shelves in 290 days is a major achievement. And it’s clear what laid at the heart of Apple’s engineering success: design re-use. Practically every part of the system was already de-risked. Apple could have started with a general purpose processor and written all the code needed to make an mp3 player, but instead they found a purpose-built part that they knew already worked. On top of that, they copied the application note! To some engineers, this might sound like cheating. “I’m not doing anything clever! This is someone else’s design!” they will say. That’s true, and that’s good. Because the end result for Apple was the iPod, done, in 6 months. And remember: design re-use doesn’t make building the product automatically trivial. The engineers that worked on the iPod worked extremely long hours and had no work-life balance. But no matter how hard they worked, they wouldn’t have been able to ship so quickly without relying on designs from PortalPlayer and Pixio.</p>
<p>Stop trying to re-invent everything. Use known working blocks from previous designs, and use application notes and reference designs. This will often result in designs that aren’t at their peak performance. In fact, the iPod almost didn’t ship because the battery life was so bad. <em>This </em>is where they applied some “original” engineering and patched the problem so that it was good enough for version one. Peak performance is not the point, especially for the first version. It’s so much more important to get things out the door. Doing this requires humility. </p>

  <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your cell phone (or any display/light).</li>
  <li>
    <p>A polarization sheet such as the one in the link below.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/em_wave.png">
    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjaAxUO6-Uw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Many of you may never have heard of the Java based JSON serialization library called <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson">Fastjson</a>, although it’s quite
an interesting piece of software. Fastjson is an open source project of the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba and has 22’000 stars on GitHub
(and coincidentally 1337 open issues) at the time writing of this blog post.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.alphabot.com/images/blog/fastjson-autotype/fastjson-bypass.png" alt="Fastjson on GitHub with 1337 open issues"></p>

<p>Like Jackson(-Databind) and other JSON serialization libraries Fastjson comes with a so-called AutoType-feature,
which instructs the library to deserialize JSON input using types provided by the JSON (using an extra JSON field called <code>@type</code>).
Now we know at least since <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf">Muñoz/Mirosh’s Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf?raw=true">Bechler’s marshalsec</a>, that deserializing any input where the types can be provided is potentially insecure and dangerous.
And that is especially true if the types can be provided from a remote user (like a <a href="https://www.alphabot.com/security/blog/2017/net/How-to-configure-Json.NET-to-create-a-vulnerable-web-API.html">JSON object</a> or a <a href="https://www.alphabot.com/security/blog/2017/java/Misconfigured-JSF-ViewStates-can-lead-to-severe-RCE-vulnerabilities.html">ViewState</a>).
Now since the Fastjson developers are aware of this, autoType isn’t enabled by default. And even if it is enabled by the developer using this library there is an ever-growing
list of types that are not allowed at play.</p>

<div>
      
      <div>
        <p>Fastjson maintains <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson/blob/92fd0cb92cd876e01384418b6dbcae557a8a630c/src/main/java/com/alibaba/fastjson/parser/ParserConfig.java#L206">deny lists</a>
    to prevent classes that could potentially lead to RCE from being instantiated (so-called gadgets). To achieve this an array called <code>denyHashCodes</code> is maintained containing the hashes of forbidden packages and class names.</p>
		<p>For example, <code>0xC00BE1DEBAF2808BL</code> is the hash for "<code>jdk.internal.</code>".</p>
		<p>The hash function in use (<a href="https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson/blob/master/src/main/java/com/alibaba/fastjson/util/TypeUtils.java#L2922">TypeUtils#fnv1a_64</a>) is a 64 bit flavor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function">FNV-1a</a> non-cryptographic hash function. The reason for this hash-based deny list seems to be some kind of security by obscurity game.</p>
		<p>The unrelated GitHub project called <a href="https://github.com/LeadroyaL/fastjson-blacklist">fastjson-blacklist</a> contains a list with many of the hashes and their effective package or class name and a corresponding <code>BreakerUtil</code>.</p>
		<p>Fun fact: <code>Arrays.binarySearch</code> is used for checking the denyList for the hash of the type name. That list is only programmatically sorted in some cases. This means that the developers of Fastjson have to be extra careful when adding new entries to the denyList, because they could make parts of the <code>denyList</code> useless. (Hint: <code>binarySearch</code> requires arrays to be sorted to work as intended)</p>
      </div>
</div>

<h2 id="typical-fastjson-rces-using-the-autotype-feature">Typical Fastjson RCEs (using the autoType-feature)</h2>

<p>Needless to say that new classes that can cause some kind of RCE are discovered all the time, which then leads to the extension of the deny list and the release of a new version of Fastjson (a similar as path Jackson-databind had taken, before they <a href="https://blog.sonatype.com/jackson-databind-the-end-of-the-blacklist">replaced their deny list with an allow list</a>).</p>

<p>An example of such a gadget would be the JDK class <code>javax.swing.JEditorPane</code>, that worked until Fastjson 1.2.68 (released in March of 2020).
It can be used for remote detection of older Fastjson versions with autoType enbabled or alternatively to exploit a blind SSRF vulnerability.</p>

<p>A simple payload using that gadget would look like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"@type"</span><span>:</span><span>"javax.swing.JEditorPane"</span><span>,</span><span>"page"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"https://sectests.net/canary/sample"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If Fastjson before the version 1.2.69 with autoType enabled is in use and the payload above is parsed it instantiates the JDK class <code>javax.swing.JEditorPane</code> and calls its <code>setPage</code> method, which in turn makes a simple HTTP <code>GET</code> request to the URL specified. (As said before this gadget is mostly interesting for the remote detection of a vulnerable application using Fastjson.)</p>

<h2 id="now-it-gets-interesting">Now it gets interesting…</h2>

<p>Most people that know of the dangers of deserialization vulnerabilities won’t be surprised so far. However, while looking at the library I found some interesting things:</p>

<h3 id="the-global-fastjson-instance">The global Fastjson instance</h3>

<p>One of these interesting things is that there is a global Fastjson instance, that allows to change its serialization settings.
So, it might happen that one developer enables the <code>autoType</code> feature on the global instance for storing some serialized values into a Redis datastore (which in itself is not that dangerous yet):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>ParserConfig</span><span>.</span><span>getGlobalInstance</span><span>().</span><span>setAutoTypeSupport</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Whilst another developer parses JSON from a remote data source in another part of the same codebase, with the same global instance.
So, a new RCE was created:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>payload</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It looks so harmless, doesn’t it?</p>

<h3 id="how-many-autotype-checks">How many autoType checks?</h3>

<p>In Fastjson 1.2.70 the <code>JSONException</code> with the message <code>"autoType is not support."</code>(sic) is thrown at <em>nine</em> different places in the <code>ParserConfig</code> class. One could argue about the reasons why the authors deem this necessary. In my simplified, naïve view of the world I would expect one place of code where such an exception is thrown (“No really, autoType is not supported, we won’t instantiate your stupid class.). End of discussion.
But in this library, there are nine of those autoType checks, enabling people to find all kinds of unintended bypasses.</p>

<h3 id="but-can-you-make-an-exception-instance-please">But can you make an Exception (instance), please?</h3>

<p>So, let’s assume we have autoType disabled. Nine different checks should be enough? Right?</p>

<p>Well…</p>

<p>In Mai of 2020 <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson/wiki/security_update_20200601">someone discovered</a> that despite autoType being disabled it was possible to instance Exceptions…
and leak some data using them. Let’s look at how that was possible:</p>

<p>Just because autoType was not enabled didn’t mean that no classes could be instantiated. It just meant you couldn’t instantiate most classes…</p>

<p><img src="https://www.alphabot.com/images/blog/fastjson-autotype/fastjson-debugger-createexception1.png" alt="Create Exception - Debugger"></p>

<p>So, with a simplified payload like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"@type"</span><span>:</span><span>"java.lang.Exception"</span><span>,</span><span>"@type"</span><span>:</span><span>"java.lang.RuntimeException"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>it was possible to instantiate a simple RuntimeException, despite autoType being disabled.</p>

<p>When we look at what happens after we call <code>parse</code> on the <code>com.alibaba.fastjson.JSON</code> class we see the following behavior:
At one time both our types <code>java.lang.Exception</code> and <code>java.lang.RuntimeException</code> have to go through the <code>checkAutoType</code> in the <code>ParserConfig</code> class, where the over 200(!) lines long <code>checkAutoType</code> method checks following things (excerpt):</p>
<ul>
  <li>whether <code>safeMode</code> is enabled (it is not)</li>
  <li>whether the type name is shorter or equal to 192 chars and at least 3 characters long</li>
  <li>whether the fnv1a_64-hash of our type name is in the <code>INTERNAL_WHITELIST_HASHCODES</code> array  (it is not)</li>
  <li>whether the fnv1a_64-hash of our type name is in  the <code>internalDenyHashCodes</code> array  (it is not)</li>
  <li>Depending on which configuration flags were enabled it would also check against <code>denyHashCodes</code> array</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember: These steps above happen, despite not having <code>autoType</code> enabled.</p>

<p>Going forward the <code>createException</code> method of the <code>ThrowableDeserializer</code> class tries to instantiate the exception using three different constructors in this order:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>causeConstructor</span> <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>Throwable</span><span>)</span> <span>causeConstructor</span><span>.</span><span>newInstance</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>cause</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>messageConstructor</span> <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>Throwable</span><span>)</span> <span>messageConstructor</span><span>.</span><span>newInstance</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>defaultConstructor</span> <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>Throwable</span><span>)</span> <span>defaultConstructor</span><span>.</span><span>newInstance</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At the end with have an instantiated exception on that we can call getters and setters.</p>

<h4 id="the-selenium-gadget">The Selenium gadget</h4>

<p>Another exception gadget <a href="https://github.com/threedr3am/learnjavabug/blob/master/fastjson/src/main/java/com/threedr3am/bug/fastjson/leak/seleniumBypassAutotype1_2_68.java">payload</a>, that can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/threedr3am/learnjavabug">learnjavabug</a> GitHub repository of threedr3am is using the <code>WebDriverException</code> of Selenium.
This payload could be used to leak some system information. But not that easily: First of all, it needs a web application that somehow reflects the input data and secondly it requires Selenium
on the classpath, which should rarely be the case. (Selenium is mostly used for integration tests and should only be on the classpath that is used for testing.)</p>

<p>A simple version of that payload looks like this (note the $ref):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>{</span><span>"content"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"$ref"</span><span>:</span><span>"$x.systemInformation"</span><span>},</span> <span>"x"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"@type"</span><span>:</span><span>"java.lang.Exception"</span><span>,</span><span>"@type"</span><span>:</span><span>"org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException"</span><span>}}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If the web application reflects the value of the <code>content</code> property somewhere, system information such as the following could be “leaked”:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">host: 'detonation-chamber-20', ip: '127.0.1.1', os.name: 'Linux', os.arch: 'amd64', os.version: '5.4.0-40-generic', java.version: '11.0.7'</code></pre></figure>

<p>Not that interesting information to be honest, but might be interesting if you want to detect if older versions of Fastjson are in use (requires the vulnerable web application to have Selenium on their classpath).</p>

<h4 id="searching-for-more-gadgets-using-codeql-and-lgtm">Searching for more gadgets using CodeQL and LGTM</h4>

<p>Instead of searching for vulnerabilities using <a href="https://securitylab.github.com/">GitHub Security Lab’s</a> amazing <a href="https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql">CodeQL</a>, I thought it would be interesting to leverage CodeQL on <a href="https://lgtm.com/">LGTM</a> as a tool to find additional Exception gadgets using a CodeQL query similar to this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>import</span> <span>java</span>

<span>from</span> <span>Class</span> <span>clazz</span><span>,</span> <span>Method</span> <span>method</span>
<span>where</span>
	<span>clazz</span><span>.</span><span>getASourceSupertype</span><span>*</span><span>()</span> <span>instanceof</span> <span>TypeException</span>
	<span>and</span>
	<span>method</span> <span>=</span> <span>clazz</span><span>.</span><span>getAMethod</span><span>()</span> <span>and</span>
	<span>method</span><span>.</span><span>getName</span><span>().</span><span>matches</span><span>(</span><span>"get%"</span><span>)</span>
	<span>//</span> <span>and</span> <span>...</span>
<span>select</span> <span>clazz</span><span>,</span> <span>method</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I ran an extended version of this query against some popular Java libraries, but did not find any interesting gadgets (due to the nature of these gadgets this was expected).
However, CodeQL in combination with LGTM is definitively a comfortable way of searching for gadget candidates.</p>

<h4 id="detection-with-a-simple-gadget">Detection with a simple gadget</h4>

<p>It turns out that for detection it might be enough to misuse the <code>getStackTrace</code> method implemented on <code>Throwable</code>. In that case any Exception that somehow inherits from <code>Throwable</code> would do (e.g. java.lang.RuntimeException):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"content"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>"$ref"</span><span>:</span><span>"$x.stackTrace"</span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>"x"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>"@type"</span><span>:</span><span>"java.lang.Exception"</span><span>,</span><span>"@type"</span><span>:</span><span>"java.lang.RuntimeException"</span><span>}}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This detection method also requires that an attribute (like <code>content</code>) is reflected somewhere.</p>

<h3 id="the-safe-mode">The safe mode</h3>

<p>With version 1.2.68 the Fastjson developers introduced the so-called <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson/wiki/fastjson_safemode">safe mode</a>. One way to turn on safe mode is to call <code>setSafeMode</code> with <code>true</code> on the global config instance:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>ParserConfig</span><span>.</span><span>getGlobalInstance</span><span>().</span><span>setSafeMode</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The check for the safe mode flag takes place almost at the top of the already mentioned <code>checkAutoType</code> method in the <code>ParserConfig</code> class and throws an exception when Fastjson wants to instantiate an arbitrary type.
However, safe mode is not enabled by default…</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>Basically Fastjson looks like a gift to the information security world that will <a href="https://medium.com/@knownsec404team/fastjson-deserialization-vulnerability-history-5206714ceed1">keep on giving</a>…</p>

<p>I didn’t even have the time to look into other interesting features …</p></div></div>

<p><span>I</span>n April 2020, in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown, Ahmed Imran Kabir decided to buy a parrot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After most of the management classes Kabir taught at a university in Dhaka were canceled or moved online, he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project: becoming a part-time bird breeder. Sitting in his three-bedroom apartment one day, Kabir keyed in the phrase “Buy-sell birds Dhaka” on Facebook and joined about half a dozen groups dedicated to avian retail.</p>



<p>“Breeding pair. Age: 20 days. Contact by phone or inbox” read one post, alongside images of a pair of grayish-brown cockatiels. Another seller, located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in Dhaka, posted pictures of yellow-feathered lutino cockatiels, with the Bengali phrase <em>hat bodol hobe — </em>which loosely translates as “to change hands.” The wording was intended to circumvent a Facebook algorithm that, to prevent wildlife trafficking, automatically takes down posts with “buy” or “sell” in the description. If an interested buyer did contact an owner, the next step was to haggle over the price of the bird on Facebook Messenger.</p>



<p>Kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000-person Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/485404175472217/">A.S.ককাটেল পাখি হাত বদল</a> — “A.S. Cockatiel changes hands.” For that purchase, the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them, and Kabir paid in cash. He was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next two weeks, including breeds such as Gouldian finches, Bengalese finches, and crested Bengalese finches. Each pair cost anywhere between $15 and $60, depending upon the breed and its age. “At one point, I started running out of space to accommodate all the birds, and sent about half a dozen Bengalese finches, along with some Gouldians, to my fiancee’s place,” he recalled. Finally, he gave in and bought a large birdcage.</p>



<p>From discovery to delivery, this whole process happened on Facebook.</p>



<p>Kabir’s story is reflective of how the majority of e-commerce now happens in Bangladesh. In the absence of giant online marketplaces like Amazon, thousands of bespoke Facebook pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments, apparel, cosmetics, mobile accessories, and, of course, birds.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/randi-rahbar-shopyobrand-iraq/"><em>“What do I do with a credit card in a country like Iraq?”</em></a></strong></p>



<p>The phenomenon has grown so much over the years that the number of stores on Facebook now eclipse the number of sellers on local e-commerce websites like Evaly, Ajkerdeal, or the Alibaba-acquired <a href="https://www.daraz.com.bd/">Daraz</a>. No one knows exactly how many of these businesses exist, but the most recent estimates suggest that Bangladesh <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">has over 300,000</a>. The low barriers to entry —&nbsp;all an aspiring entrepreneur needs is an internet connection and around $350<strong> </strong>to cover startup costs —&nbsp;present a tremendous opportunity for a generation of young Bangladeshis reeling from mass layoffs and fear of <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/06/28/rise-of-the-educated-unemployed">rising unemployment</a> rates, which are projected to impact at least 15% of the working population. It also has opened other doors: in a country where just over 15 percent of women have mobile internet access, <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">half</a> of Facebook sellers are female.</p>



<p>By and large, these Facebook stores are usually window fronts for click-and-order shopping. Unlike in formal marketplaces, most sellers are not licensed, store their inventory at home, and partner with third-party logistics companies for last-mile delivery. It’s all very simple: after a buyer makes a selection, payments are arranged via off- or online methods, and items are delivered by mail. No equivalent exists in the West, where Facebook’s forays into commerce have been met with a muted response. For a 162-million-strong country struggling with poverty and limited job growth, this new model of business is illustrative of the South Asian concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"><em>jugaad</em></a> — making do with what’s available. And it already has a name: F-commerce.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Nuzhat Akhter has</strong> been selling on Facebook for only six years, but she’s already considered a veteran in the F-commerce sphere. Her site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277430245935147/"><em>Posh World</em></a>, has over 8,000 followers on Facebook, thanks to her carefully cultivated selection of consumer<strong> </strong>goods. From her home in Bangladesh, Akhter sources all kinds of products — helmets, handbags, Ralph Lauren shirts, even branded car parts — and accepts preorders daily. If an item isn’t featured on her site, customers can send links or screenshots of things they want from any co.uk website. Customer service is handled via Messenger and her Facebook page, and Akhter guarantees delivery within two weeks.</p>



<p>The 34-year-old mother set up her Facebook store three months after the birth of her son in 2014 and has built a loyal following over the years. Akhter spends her mornings scouring the<em> </em>British websites of popular brands like The Body Shop, Superdrug, Clarks, and so on, hunting for flash sales or discounts. Once she finds a good deal, she shares the link on her Facebook group with screenshots: “3 hr left flash sale bodyshop 50%.” In June, orders totaled over $800. Akhter’s success is especially notable, as it’s uncommon to see a Bangladeshi woman running her own business. In many traditional South Asian households, women are discouraged from working after marriage.</p>



<p>The reason thousands of Bangladeshis depend on Akhter to do their shopping is that she has access to something very few of them do: a credit card, and an international one at that. “It’s my secret weapon,” Akhter said. To prevent money laundering, Bangladesh has issued roughly <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/banking/credit-card-market-still-untapped-1452808">1.5 million</a> credit cards, and even those cards have a $300 transaction limit for international online purchases. This has created a boom in cross-border F-commerce and turned retail arbitrage into a thriving sector.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce has also inadvertently ushered in more-direct models of customer engagement, moving away from impersonal help pages and suggestion boxes.<strong> </strong>Qazi<strong> </strong>Fahimda Hasan, the 26-year-old founder of an F-commerce business that focuses on beauty and lifestyle products, has made this part of her brand’s identity. Through Facebook Messenger, she shares tips for identifying counterfeit products, such as checking for irregularities in packaging, spotting spelling errors, verifying barcodes, and so on. She also invested in a mini-photography studio to take professional photos and videos of her inventory. The pictures on her Facebook wall act as a real-time bulletin board for her click-and-order store. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, the hottest new trend for online sellers is livestreaming. In China, consumers on Pinduoduo are using it to break into the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3022929/chinas-social-e-commerce-sector-more-double-us185-billion-sales">$200 billion</a> market for impulse and everyday purchases. In the United States, Amazon has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-live-launches-with-live-streamed-shopping-videos/">Amazon Live</a> Creator, which lets merchants set up streams to showcase their products. (So far, it seems to have had little success.) In Bangladesh, sellers go on Facebook Live to promote items, respond to questions, and take instant orders. Some products attract larger crowds than others. </p>



<p>“People simply go crazy for whitening creams,” said Akhter. “I mean, you could have 1,000 or 2,000 people watching a live demo on Facebook.” With little formal regulation, this is all based on trust. Many sellers aren’t concerned with looking glamorous or dressing up for the camera, and at first glance, their streams often come across as an ersatz version of the Home Shopping Network in the U.S.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, a seller who goes by only Sulaiman would spend his evenings holding Facebook livestreams in front of multicolor <em>sarees</em> in his clothing shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/2684482508481909/">Symbol Fashion House</a>, in Dhaka. Then, he was forced to change venues. In a twenty-minute stream from his living room, Sulaiman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/">shows</a> off a variety of clothes on offer, explaining the decorative stones on a <em>salwar </em>and the embroidery on a fabric. “Each of our <em>chunni</em> prints cost 550 taka [6$]. Take a screenshot and inbox the picture if interested,” Sulaiman exhorts viewers. Throughout the livestream, buyers flood the chat, asking to see more colors and sizes. “We started doing Facebook Live only about six months ago,” Sulaiman told <em>Rest of World. </em>Since then, he has averaged about $4,500 a month in online orders.</p>



<p>F-commerce emerged in Bangladesh largely because there was no major e-commerce platform to absorb all the business. But although it’s biggest there, this form of selling isn’t exclusive to the country, or even the region: globally, 160 million small stores operate on Facebook, and in countries like Thailand, almost <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thais-embrace-shopping-via-social-media">half of all online sales</a> happen through social media. Recently, platforms have started to accommodate them. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">features</a> allowing sellers to customize their online shops and made it easier for them to catalogue their goods and process payments.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce is, of course, inextricable from Facebook. As whole sections of Bangladeshi society get online for the first time, many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook. According to one estimate, the social media giant had nearly <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-bangladesh/2020/05">39 million</a> active users in Bangladesh in May<sub> </sub>—&nbsp;23.8% of the population. This widespread use has meant that F-commerce has expanded beyond cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet and pulled new kinds of consumers into online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If Amazon were to enter, they could wipe out the market.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also changed other dynamics. While Bangladeshi F-commerce shops relied on snail mail until just a few years ago, many sellers have hired logistics firms to carry out their quality checks, packaging, and delivery services, as they’ve expanded their businesses. Apart from transporting goods, logistics firms such as <a href="http://ecourierz.com/">eCourierz</a>, <a href="http://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>, …</p></div></div>

<p>Along the way, I will explain at a high-level what each hardware component of a computer does and how I navigated the landscape of selecting parts for a functional build. I’ll also describe how I installed relevant software for the machine and include some benchmarks showing the superior performance of a GPU system over a pure CPU system. </p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: this is a pretty long post that functions as a <strong>complete</strong> tutorial for building a deep learning computer literally from scratch, no assumptions made. </p>
<p>But…since it’s long I highly encourage you to peruse and skip any sections depending on your interest. </p>
<p>Sound good? Let’s get to it.</p>
<h2>A Brief Introduction 📚</h2>
<p>While there are numerous build descriptions out there showing how people constructed their own deep learning rigs, as I went about consulting some of them, I often felt there was some crucial component missing. As you start on your build journey, it’s easy to get mired in the weeds of hardware terminology. </p>
<p>Should I pick an M.2 SSD or will SATA suffice? Can I get away with HDD? How many PCIe x16 slots do I need? Should I pick DDR4-3000 or DDR4-2400 memory? 2080Ti or 1080Ti GPU? All this lingo can be very overwhelming especially for newcomers to hardware. </p>
<p>But before we start shamelessly name-dropping so that we sound smart, let’s go back to the fundamentals. You’re here reading this because you care about deep learning, right? So what is the backbone of any deep learning architecture?</p>
<p>Allow me to drastically oversimplify for a moment. At the core of every deep learning model there is roughly the following loop:</p>
<div>
      <pre><code>dataset = TrickyDataset()
model = AwesomeModel()
for datapoint in dataset:
  processed = process(datapoint)
  loss = model.forward(processed)
  loss.backward()
  model.update()</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>But what about the train dataset and the validation dataset?? What about your number of epochs?! What about your optimization algorithm?!? </p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know. I’m deliberately oversimplifying to illustrate what is at the core of most deep learning models (and in a sense modern AI). Putting aside the fluff for now, as deep learning whisperers the loop above is our bread🍞 and butter🍯. This loop will be our motivation through this post, guiding our discussion.</p>
<p>My goal in this post is certainly to describe what each computer hardware component means and is responsible for. But more importantly, I want to explain how each component fits into the framework of what we really care about building: a functional and efficient system for training diverse models. </p>
<p>Without that context, it’s easy to get lost in the details. Builds bring with them various tradeoffs based on circumstances. Since we are in the business of deep learning, building <em>for</em> deep learning will be our North Star🌟. </p>
<p>With that in mind, we will come back to the simplistic deep learning procedure above often throughout this post.</p>
<h2>A Hardware Odyssey ⛰️</h2>
<p>Now that the intro is out of the way, let’s dive into the first major part of a build: picking the parts. As you read this section, keep in mind that there are <em>many</em> different combinations of parts that could all lead to completely functional and durable builds. This is just one of them.</p>
<p>To a first approximation, many hardware parts are swappable in a typical build which is truly one of the most brilliant features of computer architecture design 🤓. However there are some components that are fairly coupled to each other (more on that later…). To weed out any incompatilities in the parts you pick, I highly recommend browsing and constructing your build via <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a>. </p>
<p>Typically a deep learning build will consist of the following components: CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, disk storage, computer case, power supply, and a CPU (and optionally GPU) cooler. So let’s dive into each of these pieces and learn some terminology along the way!</p>
<h3>CPU</h3>
<p>The CPU or central processing unit (also referred to as a <em>processor</em>) is one of the compute workhorses of any machine. In fact, it is one of the <em>central</em> components (…yes names make sense some times). </p>
<p>A computer can exist and function perfectly well without a GPU. In fact, most common consumer machines do. However, a machine <strong>can not</strong> exist without its CPU. You can play sports without chiselled abs, but you can’t play without a heart!</p>
<p>At its core, the CPU is responsible for taking instructions from an application and performing computations. These instructions are typically fetched from a computer’s RAM.</p>
<p>You’ll often see the performance of a CPU measured in terms of its clock speed which is the 2.4GHz (or whatever) you’ll see on a CPU’s product specification. This roughly determines the number of instructions the CPU can process per second. </p>
<p>Nowadays most modern CPUs have been built to contain multiple of what are called <em>cores</em>. A core effectively is a self-contained processing unit within a CPU that can handle an independent task. Thus if you have 4 cores, your CPU can in principle handle 4 independent tasks simultaneously which clearly can speed up its computing output.</p>
<p>Another neat bit of technology that can also speed up your CPU is <em>threading</em>. This refers to the process of taking a physical core and breaking it up into a certain number of virtual cores. Thus a  4 core system might have support enabled for 8 threads, which allow it to boost the number of simultaneous operations it can perform every second. </p>
<p>While threads give your computer’s operating system the <em>illusion</em> of multiple logical cores for a single core, in practice this is just a product of clever software and you are still bounded by the physical limitation of how many cores you actually have. Thus, the speedups from additional threads don’t scale as linearly as additional physical cores in a CPU do.</p>
<p>Here we encounter our first fork in the road🍴. In CPU-world the rough equivalent of the Window-Mac split is choosing between an Intel or an AMD processor. Serious computer enthusiasts will go to war for their choices, but I’m going to be annoyingly simplistic in my generalization 🤫.</p>
<p>For a long time, Intel dominated the CPU market offering higher-quality, more performant chips. Nowadays, with the introduction of AMD’s Ryzen and Threadripper series of chips, the playing field is a lot more level. In general, today the consensus is that AMD offers comparable CPUs to Intel for cheaper. As a comparison, the AMD Threadripper 1920x is a 3.6GHz/12-core processor going for $250 while an Intel i9-9900K is a 3.6GHz/8-core going for ~$490.</p>
<p>But we’re getting a bit lost in details. Let’s bring it back to what we care about again. </p>
<p>In the deep learning loop above, the CPU will be the main driving force behind any data preprocessing (tokenization of text, manipulating raw image data, etc.) in the <code>processed = process(datapoint)</code> line. So if you want snappy preprocessing that can feed data to your GPU to munch on, you’ll want a solid CPU. </p>
<p>This is especially important to ensure that your GPU utilization is as high as it can be, namely so that there aren’t any periods of time where the GPU is waiting idly for some compute tasks to show up as its doorstep from the CPU. </p>
<p>The number of cores ends up being crucial here as well, as if you are processing a particularly large dataset you will want to be able to parallelize these operations, since there’s only so much gain to be had from higher clock speeds. </p>
<p>Now, with all that in mind, how did that manifest itself in the decision-making process for my machine? I ended up opting for the AMD Threadripper 1920x which seemed like a good bang-for-your-buck choice, with many favorable reviews online. It has a base clock rate of 3.5GHz and can go up to 4.0GHz. Additionally at 12 cores and 24 threads supported, it offers plenty of opportunity for massively parallel data processing. Also its name is particularly cool! 😎</p>
<h3>RAM</h3>
<p>Let’s now discuss RAM (Random Access Memory), or <em>main memory</em> as it is often called. RAM is the address space your computer uses for all the tasks it is actively running. So while you are reading this post in a browser, the application responsible for running the browser is being held in RAM. The same goes for when you are listening to Spotify, working on an Excel spreadsheet, or loading up data for processing. </p>
<p>Reading something from RAM is significantly faster than reading it from disk (described in the next section). By <a href="https://www.directionsmag.com/article/3794">some benchmarks</a>, RAM data access is on the order of nanoseconds (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><msup><mn>0</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>9</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{-9}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) while disk access is measured in milliseconds (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><msup><mn>0</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{-3}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>)! </p>
<p>So RAM seems like the bomb-dot-com right? Well yes it is, but RAM brings with it a few major caveats. </p>
<p>First off, RAM is substantially more expensive than disk per unit volume. Secondly, RAM must always be connected to power to retain its data (referred to as <em>volatility</em>). This means when you turn off your computer, everything stored in RAM is lost, which is not the case for disk. This means that RAM is not a good medium for persistent storage. </p>
<p>What does the modern-day market look like for picking RAM? The most recent incarnation of RAM that people use is called <em>DDR4</em>. It now holds the throne, having usurped it from its ancestor DDR3. DDR4 boasts higher data transfer rates at lower voltages. </p>
<p>RAM is typically named in terms of its clock cycle rating. For example, when you are purchasing DDR4 RAM, you might see it annotated as DDDR-2400 which is simply a frequency value indicating that it performs 2.4 billion cycles per second. A higher frequency value allows for faster data access and writes when the memory is interacting with the CPU. </p>
<p>Bringing it back to our topic of interest, RAM is important in the deep learning capacity for two reasons. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article"><p>Today it's almost obvious to state that good written communication creates a business advantage.</p>
<p>I've probably read more articles on written communication in the workplace in the last two months than over the last 10 years. </p>
<p>Most of these essays gave tips on how to become better writers.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but notice that many (if not all) of them questioned the same thing: the prose.</p>
<p>Everyone advised to keep sentences short and to the point, use active voice and not passive&nbsp;voice, use fewer commas and more periods, avoid acronyms, etc.</p>
<p>Let's be clear: none of these are mistaken or wrong by any means. But this made me realize how huge the misconceptions are on what good business writing actually means.</p>
<p>In fact, what separates most people from good writing has very little to do with style, grammar, local sentences structure, word selection, or even content per se.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people can't write well because they don't know how to control the logical sequence in which they present their ideas.</p>
<p>And that is the single most important act necessary to clear writing.</p>
<p>In this essay we're going to dig into how you can effectively share written ideas in a way that value time and effort for others.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="understanding-how-we-think"><a href="#understanding-how-we-think" aria-label="understanding how we think permalink"></a>Understanding How We Think</h2>
<p>Writing an idea is always the result of two macro-steps. First, decide the point that we want want to make, and then put into words.</p>
<p>To understand how we can effectively share written ideas, we need to understand first how we formulate them in the first place.</p>
<p>Deciding the point you want to make is the result of a 5-step process.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unbundling</em> a concept</li>
<li><em>Noticing</em> something</li>
<li><em>Articulating</em>/<em>Developing</em> an idea</li>
<li><em>Re-Bundling</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Reframing</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/generate-idea-thinking-process.png" alt="State diagram to share the 5-step process one use to generate an idea."></p>
<h3 id="unbundling-a-concept"><a href="#unbundling-a-concept" aria-label="unbundling a concept permalink"></a>Unbundling A Concept</h3>
<p>Every idea begins with an unbundling process. Unbundling is an act of exploration that leads to the decoupling of all the individual items of a certain subject.</p>
<p>Unbundling something doesn't imply a deep understanding of it. It's more a perception of full awareness.</p>
<p>In fact, you might not even know how every individual piece works, but you know they all exist in separate forms. No hidden parts.</p>
<h3 id="noticing-something"><a href="#noticing-something" aria-label="noticing something permalink"></a>Noticing Something</h3>
<p>Unbundling enhances our ability to observe, and this can lead us to noticing something. This can be a pattern, an insight, a novelty, or even a minor detail.</p>
<p>If <em>unbundling</em> is the flint, <em>noticing</em> is the spark that really makes the fire.</p>
<h3 id="articulatingdeveloping-an-idea"><a href="#articulatingdeveloping-an-idea" aria-label="articulatingdeveloping an idea permalink"></a>Articulating/Developing An Idea</h3>
<p>Only when we notice something can we start developing an idea. That's where the creative part begins. That's where you try to develop your initial cue into a fully formed idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if you noticed that something was unnecessary or too complicated, you might run a simplification process. If you noticed something was missing, you go through an addition or reinforcement process.</p>
<h3 id="re-bundling-and-reframing"><a href="#re-bundling-and-reframing" aria-label="re bundling and reframing permalink"></a>Re-bundling And Reframing</h3>
<p>Once you finish including your idea, you go through re-bundling. This is a reconstruction process. This is where you try to recompose a world that now contemplates your newly inserted idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bundling is a fundamental part because it's where you can verify if the your new world still holds up. If not, that's a signal you need to put more work in the articulation phase or what you noticed didn't lead to anything meaningful at all.</p>
<p>If at the end of the re-bundling process your world does hold up, you go through a reframing process.</p>
<p>On paper, this seems to be a very logical and clear process, but in reality it's much more complicated as you constantly repeat these steps of of unbundling, editing your idea, and re-bundling until you find a viable path.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/generate-idea-complexity.png" alt="The complex process of idea generation"></p>
<p>Now that you have an idea, you need to decide how to put it into words that you can share with others.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-how-we-write"><a href="#understanding-how-we-write" aria-label="understanding how we write permalink"></a>Understanding How We Write</h2>
<p>From a broader point, the single goal of writing is to get some information into someone's head.</p>
<p>Think about it. It's almost a simulation act.</p>
<p>You need to reproduce your reader's thinking process using your brain. And know how to build up your information in a way that feels logical and makes sense to them.</p>
<p>This process has very little to do with what you went through when you came up with the idea in the first place. In fact, forcing the reader through the exact same original path you took will have the opposite effect and create more confusion.</p>
<p>Here's how it often goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have an idea <em>x</em></li>
<li>You write down a set of words <em>m</em> that lead you to <em>x</em></li>
<li>Because of the pre-existing narrative that led you to the idea, you associate <em>m -&gt; x</em></li>
<li>When you proofread it, you mentally get it. Not because <em>m -&gt; x</em> but because of all the pre-existing associations.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how most people write. And it's exactly why most people's writing sucks.</p>
<p>Not because they use too many passive forms or weak verbs (that doesn't help either), but because they aren't able to write from the reader's perspective. Most writings lacks the basic logical order and structure.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-good-business-writing"><a href="#what-is-good-business-writing" aria-label="what is good business writing permalink"></a>What is Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Good business writing is a combination of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information Context</li>
<li>Information Resolution</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework"><a href="#how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework" aria-label="how to build context the scqa framework permalink"></a>How to build Context: The SCQA Framework</h3>
<p>Context is the "<em>you're here</em>" red arrow that you can see on almost any maps. Good information context helps the reader set the frame to understand what they're about to read next.</p>
<p>Shared context helps the participants make judgments calls using the same pair of lenses.</p>
<p>A lack of a shared understanding on the basic principles can easily result in a partial understanding or conflict on what follows.</p>
<p>What's the best way to build information context?</p>
<p>Barbara Minto, a McKinsey consultant in the 70s, solved this problem with what she called the <em>SCQA framework</em>.</p>
<p>She named this framework the <em>Situation — Complication — Question — Answer</em> framework. You can unpack more on this topic in her book “The Pyramid Principle”.</p>
<p>According to Minto, context is the result of these four sub-ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Situation,</li>
<li>A Complication,</li>
<li>A Question,</li>
<li>... and an Answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Situation</strong> is a non-controversial statement on a subject that you know the reader will agree because it's something he already knows. By summarizing what he already knows, the situation establishes the relevance of the questions that your document is going to answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Complication</strong> describes an alteration of a stable situation. Keep in mind, this alteration is purely fact-based. The Situation-Complication combination should lead the reader to an immediate question.</p>
<p>The <strong>Question</strong> represents an intuitive response to the complication. The best Situation-Complication scenario makes the question sound totally superfluous to state. The best questions aren't posed, they emerge.</p>
<p>The <strong>Answer</strong> is the summary of your main idea. Beware, it's the solution, not the explanation of it. Good answers are typically represented by 3/4 bullet points. No more.</p>
<p>If you squint at it, you realise that the SCQA framework turned out initial schema upside down.</p>
<p>Ideas comes up in a bottom-up fashion, but they need to be told top-down.</p>
<p>This is not how we think. But it's how we should write.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/scqa-reversed-thinking-frmework.png" alt="SCQA reversed thinking framework"></p>
<p>Another interesting benefit of building information context using the SCQA framework is that once you've gotten the initial part out of the way, you can focus all your energy on making and supporting the case for why it's true.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues"><a href="#how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues" aria-label="how to increase resolution whyhow dialogues permalink"></a>How to increase Resolution: Why/How Dialogues</h3>
<p>Ensuring you and your reader are in the same place before you lead him through your thinking is a necessary but non-sufficient condition. </p>
<p>Once he's aware of the gist of your main idea (Answer), you need to argue and support it. That's when you need to focus on information resolution.</p>
<p>Think of <em>information resolution</em> as the density level of details that you're able to provide to the reader. The bolder the answer, the higher resolution levels it requires.</p>
<p>If you gloss over key important passages, people will not follow your thinking and might have a partial understanding of the message.</p>
<p>How do you increase information resolution?</p>
<p>You support your initial <em>Answer</em> using the form of Why/How dialogues. Making an initial statement that the reader doesn't know will automatically raise a logical question in his mind. <em>How is that possible?</em> <em>Why do you say that?</em> In your following answers, you're likely to tell him other details he doesn't know and this will raise further questions that you're going to answer. And so on.</p>
<p>The author will continue to write, raising and answering questions, until he reaches a point at which he judges the reader will have no more logical questions.</p>
<p>The vertical relationship of a why/how dialogue helps capture the reader's attention. It permits you, as an author, to establish an inner dialog that will pull him with great interest through your reasoning. The reader will be forced to respond logically to your ideas.</p>
<p>As you can see we've not made a full circle. We're now in the (previously discussed) unbundling part.</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-good-business-writing"><a href="#examples-of-good-business-writing" aria-label="examples of good business writing permalink"></a>Examples of Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Armed with our SCQA framework and the Why/How vertical development, let's look at the skeleton of some real examples.</p>

<p>It's one of the most common examples. common examples. A salesperson, after speaking with a customers, irrupts in the #product or #engineering Slack channels requesting the implementation of a given feature.</p>
<p>If you've been in this position, here's how you can Minto-ize an internal feature request for your product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>
We have never allowed customers to customize XYZ in order to keep complexity low.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
However, competitor X has now shipped such a customization feature, and we’ve been losing deals because of that.</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em>
We now need to decide whether we want to allow some kind of customization as well.</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Directives are the most common internal memo. Executives write them to request something of someone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>&nbsp;
As you know we're repositioning product <em>x</em> for mid-sized enterprise. We need to teach you how to see <em>x</em> for organizations between 100 and 200 employees.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
We've never sold to this type of customer before. Hence, we need to construct a new customer profile from scratch</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em> (How can we do the profile?)</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
We're going to host:</p>

                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>If you are desperate for 6% smaller Go binaries, this blog post is for you. (I did this experiment to help out <a href="https://www.tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. Disclosure: I'm an investor.) If binary size doesn't worry you, well, maybe you'll find it entertaining.</p>
<p>In order to get example numbers for this post, I grabbed a random item from my GOPATH. All the hard numbers in this blog post are for <code>github.com/mvdan/sh/cmd/shfmt</code>. From a bit of experimenting, they seem fairly representative.</p>
<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9d812cfa5c">commit 9d812cfa5c</a> of the Go toolchain as my base commit. This is the <code>master</code> branch as of April 29, 2020; it will probably be similar to the Go 1.15beta1 release. I'm using it rather than Go 1.14 because it contains several binary size reductions, including <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/230544">one in particular</a> that you'll definitely want if you're concerned about binary sizes.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are lots of ways to shrink a binary. Removing extraneous dependencies is probably the best way. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/210284">Avoiding global maps through judicious use of sync.Once</a> can help. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/228111">Keeping separable code separate by indirection</a> can help. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz/status/1255704982893912064">suppress equality algorithm generation</a> (ick…until you really need it). You can usually save double-digit percentages by stripping debugging information: pass <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38777"><code>-ldflags=-w</code> to <code>go build</code></a>.</p>
<p>Let's assume you've done all that. And you still need to shrink more. And that need is so pressing you're willing to make some sacrifices for it.</p>
<p>Go binaries contain a lot more than just executable code. There are type descriptors that describe the types in a Go program. There are garbage collection data structures. There's debugger information. And there are mappings from PCs to position information. (And there's lots more, too.)</p>
<p>We're going to get rid of the position information.</p>
<hr>
<p>We can't just strip out the position information entirely from the binary. That would break lots of stuff.</p>
<p>But we can make all the line numbers the same. That shouldn't break anything. After all, no one (except gofmt) said we had to put our code on multiple lines.</p>
<p>For example, instead of <a href="https://play.golang.org/">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>We could write <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/skI5nMleZgt">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> ( <span>"fmt"</span> ); <span>func</span> <span>main</span>() { <span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>) }
</code></pre></div><p>The Go compiler and runtime has to be prepared for lots of stuff to be on one line.</p>
<p>We could write a preprocessor, maybe using <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies"><code>-toolexec</code></a> and <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/compile/#hdr-Compiler_Directives"><code>//line</code> directives</a>, but it's easier to just hack the compiler. Fortunately, this is well-factored code, so we only need to touch two little spots.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Every file is now named <code>x.go</code>, and every source position has line 1 and column 1. (Columns don't actually matter for binary size, once you've stripped DWARF.)</p>
<p>This isn't quite enough. There are two other spots in the toolchain that get unhappy if all code lives at <code>x.go:1:1</code>.</p>
<p>The first is in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38698">constructing DWARF</a>, for debuggers. We can just remove that check: We are already stripping DWARF, so generating invalid DWARF doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The second is in cgo. There are some security checks about where certain cgo pragma can be located. We're going to trust ourselves not to violate them (by ensuring all code keeps building with an unaltered toolchain), and remove that security check.</p>
<p>The full diff is at <a href="https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/1a3e66ceed">https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/1a3e66ceed</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now all code we compile has <code>x.go:1:1</code> as its position.</p>
<p>Our program, compiled with <code>-ldflags=-w</code>, shrinks from 3,126,800 bytes to 2,938,384 bytes, or about 6%.</p>
<p>Most of this is from shrinking the encoding of position information. A little bit of it comes from a compiler optimization.</p>
<p>These two programs compile slightly differently:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>f</span>(<span>x</span> []<span>byte</span>) {
    <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>0</span>]

}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>f</span>(<span>x</span> []<span>byte</span>) {
    <span>_</span>, <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>0</span>], <span>x</span>[<span>1</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>If you run <code>go tool compile -S x.go</code> on each of these files, you'll see that <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/UFf2JL">the first program</a> contains two separate calls to <code>runtime.panicIndex</code>. <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/26rRog">The second program</a> contains only one such call. The reason is that <code>runtime.panicIndex</code> must display a backtrace containing the line number of the line that panicked. In the first program, we need two separate panics, one for each possible panicking line number. In the second program, we don't, so the compiler combines them.</p>
<p>Since we are now putting all code on the same line, the compiler can combine more panics than before.</p>
<hr>
<p>What do we lose by doing this? Anything that needs accurate position information. Panic backtraces will still show you the PC, the function, the arguments, and so on. But all line numbers will be <code>x.go:1</code>. With patience, you could still figure out the line number yourself based on the PC, but it'd take some manual work. Pprof will still be able to analyze performance by function and by instruction, but it'll think everything happens on the same line, which will make analysis by line number useless.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's play around a bit. What if we ditch only filenames, and keep the true line numbers? It saves only 0.9%. And as you'd then expect, keeping only accurate filenames and making all line number 1 saves 5.1%.</p>
<p>So most of the savings are from the line numbers. What if we keep the original filenames, and truncate all line numbers to the nearest multiple of 16? That is, trim our diff down to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go

</span><span></span><span>+func MakePos(base *PosBase, line, col uint) Pos { return Pos{base, sat32(line/16*16 + 1), 1} }
</span></code></pre></div><p>This cuts our binaries by 2.2%. Not bad. What if we divide all line numbers by 16 instead? That preserves exactly the same information as truncating, but we have to multiply by hand to get the “nearby” line number.</p>

<p>Line numbers are stored in the binary using a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/binary/#PutVarint">varint encoding</a> relative to the previous line number. Smaller numbers mean smaller deltas, and can thus be stored more efficiently.</p>

Summary</strong></span></p><h2 id="viewer-1p3ot">1. My Journey</h2><p id="viewer-e80g">I grew up a middle-class kid in Canada. I went to a Canadian college and started my career as an Account Manager at P&amp;G selling soap to restaurants. Somehow I managed to go to a top-tier US business school, get a job at McKinsey and fumble my way to becoming CMO at multiple Private Equity and venture-backed companies. For the last few years of my career, my annual compensation was over $1MM. After my last “exit” I realized our family had enough of a nest egg that I did not need to work again to maintain our relatively modest lifestyle. I went through a bit of an existential crisis trying to figure out how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. Among other other things, I started spending more time writing. I now have a reasonably successful newsletter and a book coming out later this year. I also spend time helping friends and acquaintances manage their careers — especially during times of transition.</p><p id="viewer-1eqa7">This study guide shares my advice on how to pursue an extraordinary marketing career (and hopefully most of these comments can transfer to other careers, as well). The biggest risk from this type of advice is the advisor simply explains how THEY were successful. There are two big problems with that approach:</p><ol><li id="viewer-862ah"><p><strong>What works for one person does not work for all people</strong>. Knowing Einstein worked in a patent office is not going to help you develop the next theory of general relativity.</p></li><li id="viewer-40o1q"><p><strong>Individuals tend to attribute too much of their success to their choices</strong>. Career success (and success in general) is based on a combination of (1) choices, (2) in-born (or long-developed) skills and talents, (3) effort, (4) opportunities, and (5) luck. Humans are primed to see things as cause and effect, and most successful people KNOW they worked hard and BELIEVE they made the right choices. Consciously or unconsciously, then, they underweight the luck and random opportunities that were outside their control. This is NOT to say choices and effort do not matter. It is too easy for people who are NOT as successful as they would like to look at those more successful and attribute it ALL to luck. The truth is it is a mix of all five drivers, but it means you need to look at all advice with a large grain of salt.</p></li></ol><h2 id="viewer-e14t4">2. Why did I write this?</h2><p id="viewer-51klp">I’ve heard many people ask, “Why aren’t there more Ben Thompsons?” (author of Stratechery, and possibly the most successful newsletter written by an individual in the world). Ben writes brilliant analysis. He has accumulated somewhere in the neighbourhood of 60,000 subscribers paying $120/year each. After paying for his expenses and assistant, Ben is likely bringing home more than $7MM/year. Why aren’t more brilliant people following that path? There are 7 billion people in the world. There must be more people with the abilities and mindset of someone like Ben. Why aren’t there more Ben’s?</p><p id="viewer-873id">I think the answer is opportunity cost. If you have the ability to do what Ben did, you also have the ability to advance up most corporate ladders. You do not need to get to the top of the ladder to earn high six figures or even seven figures per year. To leave that a job paying $1MM/year to slowly build an audience feels impossible for anyone who cares about their compensation. As a result, most of the people writing about business on the internet are people who are trying to self-promote their own products (“shucksters” is the less complementary term) or people who have never held senior positions, have much lower opportunity cost, and are writing about business as outsiders.</p><p id="viewer-169i4">Most career management guides that fall into three buckets:</p><ol><li id="viewer-h9v"><p>Guides written by human resources professionals on “how to manage your career”</p></li><li id="viewer-2g9m2"><p>“Get rich” guides written by internet hustlers</p></li><li id="viewer-fs55h"><p>Cynical guides like “Career Warfare” that teach you how to play office politics</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-2tkd7">What is missing is a guide for traditional employees who want to accelerate their career to the executive ranks quickly AND ethically — and then continue to advance once in the executive suite. The people who could have written a book like that are too busy “doing the work” to spend the time and effort to create the guide. They have better things to do with their time.</p><p id="viewer-644ei">I am a sucker for a gap in the marketplace. And it turns out that while I enjoy writing even more than I enjoy growing companies, I somehow managed to grow enough companies well enough for long enough that I have the financial flexibility to walk away from that opportunity cost and spend time doing the things I like. Like writing this document and giving it away for free.</p><p id="viewer-9tosg">I LIKE helping people grow their careers in ethical ways. And I have the financial flexibility now that I can do whatever I like doing. This is it.</p><h2 id="viewer-63bo4">3. Which job do you want?</h2><p id="viewer-8f317">When Charlie Songhurst (former head of strategy for Microsoft) was interviewed on “Invest Like the Best” he described three “vices” and three “virtues” that motivated people in their careers:</p><p id="viewer-52sb5"><strong>Vices:</strong></p><ul><li id="viewer-6k3pc"><p>Money</p></li><li id="viewer-3e0el"><p>Power</p></li><li id="viewer-at8kj"><p>Fame</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-9f52c"><strong>Virtues:</strong></p><ul><li id="viewer-9hdcp"><p>Impact</p></li><li id="viewer-an9k7"><p>Intellectual interest</p></li><li id="viewer-6ot7i"><p>Working with people</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-vf99">Songhurst probes for the true motivations in everyone he interviews and even asks them to “stack rank” their vices. Until these options are articulated, most people tend to assume that other people share their own personal ranking, but different stack ranks naturally lend themselves to different jobs and careers.</p><p id="viewer-fsp7n">There is a type of advice that says, “do what you love and you will never have to work a day in your life,” but advice like that is dangerous. For many people what they LOVE is not going to pay the bills and allow them do to other things that they LIKE (or avoid doing the things they DISLIKE). Taken to the extreme, “doing what you love” may result in someone spending their days painting, but then spending their evenings shovelling manure. To solve this dilemma, other advisors have created Venn diagrams like this:</p><div id="viewer-2urvc"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.marketingbs.com/post/million-compensation" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc1c1f_f7296f1caa7446928792a5f4bdf7c9ae~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1200,h_676,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc1c1f_f7296f1caa7446928792a5f4bdf7c9ae~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-3tfpa">The world would be great if everyone could find their “purpose” or “reason to get up in the morning” (a concept sometimes made more high brow by using the Japanese term “Ikigai”). For most of us, though, there will always be trade offs between the five drivers. And besides: what if you found something you love, that fit your strengths, that impacted the world, but you didn’t really like spending time with the people who were willing to pay you to do it? Or more cynically, what if your driving vices had more to do with power or fame than with money?</p><p id="viewer-2pqgn">Here is my point: you need to decide what is important to you AND understand what the unspoken importance assumptions are for the people you are seeking advice from. If you care about becoming famous it doesn’t help to get advice on how to make more money working in a support role.</p><p id="viewer-1ih94">But I am also not the type to say, “all choices are equally valid.” Let me try and make the case that even if your motivations are the vices of power and fame, along with the virtues of people and impact, you should seriously consider increasing your weighting on the vice of money and the virtue of intellectual stimulation.</p><h3 id="viewer-6m8fc">Why money matters, and not just for the money</h3><p id="viewer-c8omr">I spent four summers in high school working at summer camps. Working at summer camps, even when you are sixteen, is NOT a way to maximize your monetary compensation. I believe in that first summer I was paid $40/week for a 24h/day job overseeing, entertaining and educating young people. After graduating from college, instead of spending a summer touring Europe, I decided I wanted to have one last experience working at a camp. I reached out to dozens of camps in the Northeastern United States looking for roles overseeing activities or running “counselor-in-training” programs. When it came time to commit, I negotiated hard for more money. That may seem like a funny thing to do. The difference between a “highly paid” role at camp and a “lowly paid” role is maybe $1000 over an entire summer, and I was about to enter a full-time professional job where, even at my entry level, I would be making that much in a week. Why argue for more pay?</p><p id="viewer-5cudn">(Aside: for many of you, the idea that I need to articulate the reasons why you should want to be paid more will seem insane. For many, “having more money is better than having less money” is the only reason you need. But, as crazy as it sounds, I think many people UNDERVALUE the benefits that come from having higher compensation)</p><p id="viewer-6iuep">I knew even then that <strong>what an organization was willing to pay for a role is a strong signal of the importance the organization sees for the role</strong>. WITHIN an organization, roles with more responsibility, authority, and opportunity for impact tend to pay more. In my experience, WITHIN an organization, the three vices (and to some extent the three virtues) are CORRELATED. The roles in an organization that are highest paid are also the roles that have the most authority (power), the most visible (fame), the most opportunity to have impact, be intellectually stimulating, …</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

                <p><span>The illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a growing threat to biodiversity. This trade is becoming one of the most valuable illegal trade sectors. IWT threatens biodiversity and can have a negative impact on the economy. Hiding or laundering IWT revenues undermines financial integrity. Financial criminals facilitate money laundering activities by making billions of dollars of illegal trade in rhino horns, ivory, and other similar wildlife products.</span></p><p><span>  It has published a global report on IWT for the first time by assessing the aspects of money laundering (ML) of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) wildlife crimes and how judicial districts should apply FATF standards to combat IWT. </span></p><h2><b>Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT) Relationship With Money Laundering </b></h2><p>   <span>FATF released the June 2020 Money Laundering and the Illegal Wildlife Trade report. The purpose of the <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/Money-laundering-and-illegal-wildlife-trade.pdf">FATF report</a> is to provide guidance on measures that can be taken to combat money laundering from the Illegal Wildlife Trade. The Illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a major organized crime that fuels corruption and threatens biodiversity. According to the 2016 UN World Wildlife Crime report, criminals trade products derived from more than 7,000 wild animal and plant species worldwide. Criminals illegally trade not only iconic mammals but also less well-known species such as bird, amphibian species, corals, reptiles, boney fish. A striking example is illegally hunting criminals to make bags and shoes from the skin of pythons, to consume them as food, and to be used as a traditional medical tool.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>FATF defines illegal wildlife trade as a "global threat", which is also linked to other organized crime such as drug trafficking and arms trade. Criminals abuse the official financial industry to hide illegal revenues from wildlife crimes and money laundering. According to the report, an estimated 7 billion to 23 billion dollars of illegal wildlife trade takes place annually. Although making a profit from illegal wildlife trade is one of the most effective ways of money laundering, there is a deficiency in monitoring the financial flows of wildlife smugglers, this means that countries rarely focused on the financial aspect of this crime. Therefore, the criminals continued to expand their activities in this area.</span><span><br></span></p><h2><b>Methods Used for The Illegal Wildlife Trade  </b></h2><p>   <span>All criminals in IWT often use shells and front companies to hide payments and launder the revenues of their illegal activities. They primarily use shell companies to facilitate the transfer of value among the union members of the criminals, between buyers and sellers, or to hold assets. In addition, criminals often use legitimate frontline companies to hide the transfer of value from IWT. On the other hand, criminals use the import-export industries to legally demonstrate the movement of goods and payments across borders. Some of the vulnerable sectors that criminals use to clear your income are breeding facilities, pet shops, zoos, the decor, and the fashion industry. </span></p><p><span>Simply to explain their process, Illegal funds obtained are transferred to third parties via bank transfers through e-banking platforms, loans or payments, licensed money transfer systems, and banks. Third-party accounts also often use innocent bank mules. Their illegal transactions are not noticeable, and thus money laundering takes place. Furthermore, with the development of online markets and mobile, social media-based payments, The Illegal Wildlife Trading has increased.</span><span> </span></p><h2><b>Cooperation in Financial Crimes Related to The Illegal Wildlife Trade </b></h2><p> <span>According to the FATF Recommendation, all jurisdictions require that Illegal Wildlife Trade identify, assess, and take action to reduce the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. Moreover, As stated in the FATF report, if criminal offenses related to money laundering caused by Illegal Wildlife Trade abroad occurred in another country, this should definitely constitute a crime. As a result, wildlife crime committed abroad as a basis for money laundering should not only be able to provide international cooperation in cases where double criminality is required but also through domestic investigations and prosecutions. </span></p><p><span> On the other side, Cooperation between the public and private sectors is important for the identification and disruption of IWT related financial flows. Especially in jurisdictions with public-private partnerships, there has been an interaction between the public sector and financial institutions in the monitoring of crimes related to IWT. Collaborations include both strategic and operational information exchange. As a result of the survey conducted by FATF, most of the countries' cooperation in combating IWT-related financial crimes is realized within the financial sector and to a lesser extent among non-financial sectors. </span></p><h2><b>FATF Recommendations in Combating IWT </b></h2><p>   <span>To combat money laundering (ML) and Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT), both high-level political commitment and improved operational cooperation are needed. It is very important to work closely with sectors that play a role in combating money laundering with law enforcement officers responsible for wildlife crime. Studies can improve countries and private sector activities. The role of FATF Standards is very important in combating illegal wildlife trade. </span></p><p><span>   Understanding of IWT's threats to non-financial businesses, different geographic country risk profiles for different species, and asset management practices related to illegal wildlife trade are required. FATF encourages strengthening money laundering risk understandings related to such crimes through comprehensive risk assessments and sharing the results of these efforts with all relevant authorities.  </span><span> </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><br></p>

<p>This issue’s featured paper is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mA8fv--nK_bDRST49U-GMvxjLmVEvm6T/view?usp=sharing">Compiler and Runtime Support for Continuation Marks</a>, by Matthew Flatt and Kent Dybvig.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Continuation marks enable dynamic binding and context inspection in a language with proper handling of tail calls and first-class, multi-prompt, delimited continuations. The simplest and most direct use of continuation marks is to implement dynamically scoped variables, such as the current output stream or the current exception handler. Other uses include stack inspection for debugging or security checks, serialization of an in-progress computation, and run-time elision of redundant checks. By exposing continuation marks to users of a programming language, more kinds of language extensions can be implemented as libraries without further changes to the compiler. At the same time, the compiler and runtime system must provide an efficient implementation of continuation marks to ensure that library-implemented language extensions are as effective as changing the compiler. Our implementation of continuation marks for Chez Scheme (in support of Racket) makes dynamic binding and lookup constant-time and fast, preserves the performance of Chez Scheme’s first-class continuations, and imposes negligible overhead on program fragments that do not use first-class continuations or marks.</p></blockquote>

July 21, 2020 | https://thechief.io/c/editorial/top-10-desktop-service-providers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thechief.io/c/editorial/top-10-desktop-service-providers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><section><div><p>DaaS can be implemented quickly by external IT specialists and does not require any long-term commitment. It enables companies to provide remote access to their employees at short notice without endangering their infrastructure's security.</p><p>DaaS is a virtual desktop infrastructure structure solution (VDI) that either an external service provider or the existing IT team with the appropriate expertise can implement quickly, for example, with AWS WorkSpaces or Google Chrome Remote Desktop.</p><p>Each employee is provided with his own virtual Desktop. All virtual desktops are located in the company's own private network (Virtual Private Cloud or VPC) and are therefore entirely isolated from the Internet. These virtual desktops can connect to the company's existing infrastructure via a secure tunnel (IPSec).</p><p>As per the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/desktop-virtualization-market-2020-2025-size-share-growth-trends-and-forecast-imarc-group-2020-06-30?tesla=y">research report from the IMARC Group</a>, the desktop virtualization market grew around 12 percent during 2014-2019. Considering the current pandemic situation and looking forward, the report estimated that the market will grow during the next five years.</p><h2>How does DaaS work?</h2><p>When the world did not have the advantages of cloud computing, and virtual workspaces were not a very big thing, setting up a network of several computers was an ordeal. It required tons of purchase and installation of terminals that would go around from each machine to the server and back. This process was extremely time-consuming and expensive. </p><p>In today's world, this view has changed. Instead of compiling and setting up terminals for hours, we have the technology that enables us to work on laptops connected to a remote server. These servers are not physically connected to the computers but work precisely the way the physical ones do. </p><p>This remote server creates virtual desktops that can be accessed easily by an interface designed especially for this purpose. It is compatible with a variety of devices like laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc. In most cases, DaaS does not even require high data transmission speeds and can work seamlessly even on a regular internet connection!</p><h2>What are the benefits of using Desktop as a Service?</h2><h3>Safety first</h3><p>The data is completely isolated and protected. The user's end device (Desktop, laptop, or tablet) connected to his virtual Desktop has no access to the data. Only an image of the virtual Desktop is transferred to the end devices.</p><p>The most significant advantage of remote desktops than VPNs is that the company data is not stored on the user's device, and the user never has access to the company's internal network. It is advantageous when employees work with a corporate notebook while on the move, and it becomes even more critical when working from their home office with a private device (BYOD). Private or individual devices seldom meet the <a href="https://thechief.io/c/debricked/has-corona-crisis-made-e-commerce-more-vulnerable/?ref=thechiefio">security standards of companies</a>, which is a significant risk.</p><h3>Quickly available, always available</h3><p>Setup by qualified partners for professional services can be done within a few hours. Immediately afterward, companies and their employees can use virtual desktops. The right partner for managed services should also offer 24/7 support. In this way, companies ensure that their employees can concentrate on their business. The partner focuses on its infrastructure (e.g: storage, network) and the provided DaaS plarform.</p><h3>Scalable and flexible</h3><p>Organizations can roll out as many virtual desktops as they need - from a few to hundreds - without changing the infrastructure. You can also choose which operating system and which hardware each user receives. As part of the setup, additional applications can be installed on the virtual desktops according to the company's requirements.</p><p>The solution also supports a hybrid configuration of cloud and on-premises. The virtual desktops (instances) are provided in the cloud and connected to the on-premises infrastructure via a VPN so that companies can continue to use their existing infrastructure. There is no need to just migrate to the cloud to implement your home office.</p><h3>Easier system upgrades</h3><p>Updates performed on the virtual server take changes up very fast and reflect those changes in the terminals in seconds. It saves a lot of time and creates a continuous flow of work output and employee productivity. </p><h2>Here are the top 10 DaaS providers</h2><p>As companies are often dependent on providers in all areas of their business, they should understand their services and products. Here is a list of the top-performing DaaS providers in the Information Technology market:</p><h3>Chrome Remote Desktop</h3><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.chromeremotedesktop&amp;hl=en_IN">Chrome Remote Desktop</a> is one of the most popular Desktop as a Service software that is available for free. If you need to connect with all the devices that you own now and then or help a family member fix their system remotely, this is the perfect option for you. </p><p><b>Advantages: </b></p><ol><li>It is entirely free to use</li><li>Quick setup procedure</li></ol><p><b>Limitations:</b></p><ol><li>No built-in chats</li><li>Cannot reboot machines and reconnect</li></ol><p><b>Note: </b>It is not an open-sourced software</p><p><b>Pricing: </b>Free</p><h3>Red Hat Virtualization</h3><p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/virtualization/enterprise-virtualization">Red Hat Virtualization</a> is another DaaS based infrastructure software that is easy to set up and very easy to use. It serves many requirements that include cross-portfolio and cross-platform integration.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>There's been some Twitter discourse about people working in tech sharing their salaries - it started with <a href="https://twitter.com/ZacSweers/status/1228205724255154177">Zac Sweers</a>, and many other people shared their compensation. As that was happening, there was some backlash<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> , saying that people sharing their salaries is basically just flexing, and instead of bragging on Twitter, people should just go out and do something that actually helps, like unionizing.</p>

<p>While I don't think that the current iteration of people sharing their salaries on Twitter is as useful as it could be, I think that it's incredibly important for people to talk about their pay, and I want to tell you a few stories about why. To start with, we'll have to go back a decade - a group of employees of tech companies including Google, Apple, and Intel filed <a href="https://danluu.com/google-wage-fixing/">a class action lawsuit</a>, stating that their employers colluded in a wage-fixing agreement to keep salaries down.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs was at the source of much of the wage-fixing, becoming angry when companies hired Apple employees - he wrote to Google co-founder Sergey Brin regarding the Safari team:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you hire a single one of these people that means war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a Google employee <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-lawsuit/steve-jobs-told-google-to-stop-poaching-workers-idUSTRE80Q27420120127">referred an Apple employee for a job</a>, Steve Jobs emailed Eric Schmidt, who responded by firing the Google employee who had sent the referral. Google's staffing director saying upon hearing about the situation that the employee "will be terminated within the hour," and to "Please extend my apologies as appropriate to Steve Jobs."</p>

<p>When Palm, Inc refused to participate in the wage-fixing agreement, Steve Jobs wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not satisfactory to Apple.</p>

<p>I'm sure you realize the asymmetry in the financial resources of our respective companies when you say: "we will both just end up paying a lot of lawyers a lot of money."</p>

<p>My advice is to take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a final decision here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Senior Vice President at Google wrote about compensation that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The] long-term ... right approach is not to deal with these situations as one-offs but to have a systematic approach to compensation that makes it very difficult for anyone to get a better offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of driving wages down for more than half a decade, the companies paid out around $3,840 to each affected employee. I'll let you do the math on that one.</p>

<p>So I think that it's obvious that employers have shown in interest in keeping salaries down, and one of the tools that is used to do that is making sure people don't have information about how much their coworkers are being paid. And while tech workers have it pretty good in terms of compensation (at least here in the States), the number of people I know who save their company tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, and as a reward are given raises less than a tenth of a percent of what they saved makes me think that it's worth talking about who's capturing the value of our labour.</p>

<p>But how we talk about our salaries matters - just knowing that other people are out there, making four or five times as much as you are doesn't help your situation much unless you're able to negotiate that raise for yourself.</p>

<p>A friend of mine recently learned that one of his coworkers made around 1.6x what he did. If the story ended there, it wouldn't be too interesting. But instead of just leaving for greener pastures, or negotiating a raise for himself, he started talking to his coworkers about how much they made. As it turned out, everyone except one person all made about the same amount - why was that person's work (doing the same work on the same project team) worth 60% more than everyone else's? Just a couple months after talking frankly about compensation, the highly-paid coworker and my friend negotiated for an extra week of vacation (not just for themselves, but for everyone at the company). And it's not just vacation - collectively, everyone at the company negotiated for oncall compensation as well. After talking to his coworkers about their compensation, and collectively bargaining for fairer compensation, my friend has now gone on to sign an offer at a different company for significantly more money - all because of open conversations about salary and working environments, and collective action to improve that for everyone.</p>

<p>By talking with our coworkers, being open about our salaries, and bargaining collectively, we can not just improve our own conditions, but also lift up everyone around us. People have fought and been killed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_concerted_activity">our right to openly discuss compensation</a>, and I think it's worth exercising that right. So talk to your coworkers, and if you see me around the office or in person, know that I'm happy to talk about how much I'm paid and what I know about salary bands at any place I've worked.</p>

<p>By talking to your coworkers and building solidarity, we can build a fairer and better world together.</p>

Would you be able to afford clothes or electronic devices, considering many clothing and electronic devices are made of plastic?&nbsp;</p><p>A world without plastic is a world constrained by materials and their limitations. A world with plastic is a world constrained by...almost nothing.</p><h3>Invention</h3><p>Before plastic was created, we needed to use materials such as wood, animal fur, plants, or metals to make clothes and tools. Plastic was invented because we were running out of ivory as elephants were going extinct because of our insatiable human demand. Ivory was used for boxes, piano keys, combs, billiard balls, and many other things.</p><p>The legend says that a New York billiard supplier ran a newspaper ad offering “a handsome fortune,” ten thousand dollars in gold, to anyone who could invent an alternative to ivory.</p><p>An audacious entrepreneur, John Wesley Hyatt, a young printer read the ad and decided he could do it. There was a catch for him, though. He had no formal training in chemistry, but he was an inventor at heart, having patented a knife sharpener in his early 20s.&nbsp;</p><p>The entrepreneurial spirit ran through Hyatt and he started experimenting. He began with combinations of solvents and even mixtures of cotton. Little did he know that at his homemade lab, he was building one of the most important innovations in the history of humankind, creating a new era of unlimited materials, no longer would people have to use natural materials that were limited by their quantities and physical limitations.&nbsp;</p><p>After over five years of trial and error, his breakthrough finally came in 1869. He ran an experiment that resulted in a material that had “the consistency of a shoe leather” that could be molded into any shape and was very strong. His marketing-savvy brother named the new material “Celluloid.”</p><p>In Susan Freinkel's <em>Plastic: A Toxic Love Story</em>, she says “Celluloid appeared at a time when the country was changing from an agrarian economy to an industrial one.” She also says that “celluloid was the first of the new materials that would level the playing field for consumption.” Like plastics that were invented later, celluloid allowed manufacturers to keep costs down while keeping up the rising demand for new products from lower and middle classes.</p><p>The plastics industry allowed us to synthesize (create) whatever we wanted or needed. If it seems like we can magically create anything, it’s because we do.&nbsp;</p><p>Making and creating new products is fun, but it’s more fun to sell to them. To do that, consumers might need to spend money that they didn't have, and this is what’s called <strong>credit.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><br>Before &amp; After Credit</h2><p>To illustrate this example, let’s use three examples of common things bought with credit.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>House/Vehicle</p></li><li><p>Education</p></li><li><p>Electronic Devices</p></li></ul><p>Would you have been able to afford your house and vehicle? What about that flashy device or your diploma?</p><p>A world without credit is a world constrained by money and its limitations. A world with credit is a world constrained by...almost nothing.</p><h3>Invention</h3><p>When we talk about credit, we talk about trust. The word “credit” came from French, which translates into “belief, trust.” Over the last few centuries our trust increased, so did credit.&nbsp;</p><p>Money does not have an intrinsic value and its worth isn’t inherent in the paper. Money is a system of mutual trust. We are willing to use money as a medium of exchange because we trust that other people will trust it too.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the modern era, the world was a stagnant place. Everything pretty much stayed the same and economies remained frozen.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, the only way to start a business or enterprise would be to find workers and contractors willing to work today and receive payment a few years later, if and when the business or enterprise makes money.&nbsp;</p><p>Only in the modern era did a new system based on trust in the future started working. The way it worked was people agreed to represent goods that do not exist in the present with a special kind of money called ‘credit.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Credit is the most essential part to the modern economy</strong>.<br></p><p>It’s both the biggest and most volatile part. Credit can help both lenders and borrowers get what they want. Lenders usually want to make more money, and borrowers usually want to buy something they can’t afford, like a house or a car, or even a business.&nbsp;</p><p>When borrowers promise to repay, and the lenders believe them. Credit is created. How is it created? Any two people can create credit out of thin air. Yes! It’s that simple, here's where it gets tricky. Credit can have multiple names. In <em>How The Economic Machine Works</em>, Ray Dalio says that “As soon as credit is created, it immediately turns into debt. Debt is both an asset to the lender and a liability to the borrower.”</p><p>Dalio also emphasizes why credit is so important in the economy and how it causes more growth. He says, “When a borrower receives credit, he is able to increase his spending, and remember, spending drives the economy. This is because one person’s spending is another person’s income. Think about it, every dollar you spend, someone else earns and every dollar you earn, someone else’s spend. So when you spend more, someone else earns more.”</p><p>Credit allows us to build the present at the expense of the future based on the assumption the future will be better and more abundant than our present resources. We can build and create anything we want. Opportunities are endless if we can build things and create things in the present using future income.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s unclear when credit (as we know it today) was first used or invented. Throughout history, there was always some type of borrowing or credit arrangement, but most people didn’t take advantage of credit because they didn’t trust the future would be better than the present. They generally believed that the past had been better than their own times.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world without credit, people believed that wealth was limited or even decreasing. The pie was limited. If the pie was limited, for your future to be better you’d need to assume that your kingdom, the entire world, and your life would be better and that it would produce more wealth at the expense of other people.</p><p>In <em>Sapiens, </em>Yuval Noah Harari explains, “That's why many cultures concluded that making bundles of money was sinful. As Jesus said, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God" (Matthew 19:24). If the pie is static, and I have a big part of it, then I must have taken somebody else's slice.”&nbsp;</p><p>That’s one of the big differences in our times. For me to thrive does not mean you could not thrive. The chances for you to thrive are higher if I thrive</p><h2>A World Without Credit &amp; Plastic</h2><p>We don’t understand the difficulties and hardships people had before the invention of credit and plastic. We’ve never lived in that world.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine living without credit and plastic.</p><p>What would that look like?&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll use the examples I used before for both plastic and credit.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start with <strong>plastic</strong>. I mentioned plastic containers for food storage, clothing, and electronic devices (i.e. computers, phones). Without plastic, your food would be hard to carry around and store, and it would go bad quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>You would also have very limited clothing and the clothes that you'd be able to buy would not be of good quality because you wouldn't be able to afford the good quality clothing because it’s ridiculously expensive and reserved for country leaders and billionaires.&nbsp;</p><p>And don’t forget your phone/computer because without plastic they would be more expensive, and you wouldn’t be able to access the opportunities and connectivity that they provide.&nbsp;</p><p>A <strong>creditless</strong> world is even more annoying. I mentioned house/vehicle, education, electronic devices. If you wanted to buy a house or a car, you would need to have the full amount or a very high down-payment, making it impossible to afford it.</p><p>What about your college degree? If you didn’t have money to pay, you couldn’t go to college. Period. No student loans, no debt, and no education. <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/02/the_student_loan-landscape.html#.VOYcC2R4r5K" target="_blank">Studies</a> have found that college graduates earn nearly as twice as much as their peers without college degrees. What about that fancy electronic device you’re paying monthly? Without credit, you would’ve had to pay it outright. If you didn’t have the full amount. It’s simple, no phone or laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not that people didn’t have credit in the past to buy higher purchases such as home. However, they still had to pay most of it. For instance, the down-payment for a home would be at least fifty percent, making it almost impossible to buy a house for a middle class worker.&nbsp;</p><h2>Credit &amp; Plastic: Economic Growth</h2><p>Two of the most essential human inventions that led to our great modern times of economic growth and standard of living could be attributed to credit and plastic.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the widespread use of credit and the invention of plastic, economies in Europe did not really grow. From 1300 to about 1550, most of their economies were stagnant.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594561275519_7180"><div><p>Then, from 1600 until 1800 we saw an increase in their GDP per capita. We can see that countries like Holland exploded economically as they created the stock exchange (a way to use credit) to fund expeditions …</p></div></div></div>

      I bought my first PC in the Spring of 1993.  It was not the first 
      computer I bought, but it was the first useful one.  Between contract 
      engineering jobs at the time, I wanted to spend my time 
      productively by learning the increasingly-popular C++ computer 
      language.  So, I responded to a want-ad placed in the local 
      newspaper by an individual selling a several-year-old 
      personal computer clone with an 80286 CPU.</p>

   <p>Sometime in the late 1970's, the phrase "personal computer" began to 
      supersede "microcomputer" as the generic term for a computer marketed 
      to individuals.  I and many others were annoyed when IBM hijacked 
      "personal computer" and used it as the brand name of their 
      computer, as if no 
      other personal computers had existed before they created the first.  
      Today, almost all desktop and laptop personal computers are PC clones, 
      and no one has used the term "microcomputer" in decades.</p>

   <p>I drove my beaten-up Toyota pickup 20 miles North to the seller's 
      tract home in a suburb of the city.  On his dining room 
      table sat a computer in a tan rectangular metal case.  In those days, 
      computers were all about the technology, not the looks.  Just about 
      the only computers not in tan rectangular metal cases were Apple 
      computers, and they were not much more attractive.  I think the seller 
      sold computers as a side business, because I saw a couple of them 
      lined up against the wall.  The computer that I had come to buy only had 
      512 KB of memory, but I explained to the seller that I needed more to 
      run Turbo C++.  So, he opened the case and added an ISA card with six 
      more 256 KB simms of RAM.  I handed him $240 in twenty-dollar bills 
      and walked out with the computer, DOS 4.01 on 5.25 inch floppies, and 
      a monochrome amber monitor.</p>

   <p>In 1993 the sum of $240 seemed like a lot to pay for a computer that 
      old.  Younger readers must understand that, at a time when 
      CPU's were doubling in power about every 18 months, a computer that 
      was a few years old was viewed as not much more than junk.  In 
      hindsight, this was one of the best purchases I have ever made, 
      because that PC started me down a road that changed my attitude about 
      computers.  At this point in my life, computers had become headaches 
      that I was forced to endure in my job as an engineer.  Owning a PC that 
      I could use for my own purposes changed that paradigm for me and put 
      me on the road to loving computers.  My emotional attachment to 
      computers is actually more complicated than simple love.  Perhaps not 
      what I would call a love/hate relationship.  More like being in love 
      with someone with bipolar disorder.  Buying my first PC all those 
      years ago put me on the path that has ultimately led to the creation 
      of the Cheapskate's Guide website.</p>

   <p>After I brought my PC home, I went to a local bookstore and bought 
      a book called <i>Object-Oriented Programming in Turbo C++</i> by 
      Robert Lafore.  Then, I purchased a Borland Turbo C++ compiler for 
      $90 and went to work learning how to write C++ code.  I read through 
      the thick, Turbo C++ manual that came with the compiler and Lafore's 
      book and tried many of the programming problems.  A few months later, 
      I was ready for the next step.</p>

   <p>I knew the best way to learn to write code was to pick a project that 
      would take a few months to complete.  I also knew the project had to 
      be both fun and challenging enough to motivate me to stick with it.  
      So, I decided to write a graphical flight simulator.  I immediately 
      realized that I would have to upgrade my PC.</p>

   <p>To give younger readers an idea of how slow computers were in those 
      days, the ISA bus that was connected to the RAM card in my first PC 
      ran at 8 MHz.  Today's DDR4 memory runs at well over a gigahertz and 
      makes two memory transfers per clock cycle.  So, today's newer 
      computers access RAM in the neighborhood of 300 times faster than my 
      first PC.  The fastest modern CPU's are around 
      <a href="http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/linpack%20results.htm">four 
      orders of magnitude</a> faster than the 286.  Even the CPU in a 
      Raspberry Pi 3 is around three orders of magnitude faster than a 286.</p>

   <p>I had difficulty finding a 386-compatible motherboard with eight, 
      30-pin simm slots that would allow me to avoid buying new RAM.  By the 
      time 386 CPU's came out, the computer industry had begun transitioning 
      from 30 and 32-pin simms to 72-pin simms.  I finally found a local 
      computer business willing to sell me a used motherboard with the simm 
      slots I needed and a 386 SX-25 CPU for $35.  The problem of shifting 
      technologies and standards was huge, even back then, because it meant 
      that upgrading a desktop computer not only meant replacing the CPU, 
      motherboard, and RAM.  It sometimes meant buying a new hard drive, 
      internal cards, monitor, and other peripherals.</p>

   <p>Not until I removed the RAM from the 286 motherboard did I discover 
      that I had another problem.  The RAM slots on the new motherboard had two 
      banks of four simm slots each.  If I could not fill the second bank of 
      four completely, it would not work.  Unfortunately the two simms that 
      were attached directly to the 286 motherboard had actual pins soldered 
      to their contacts that fit into holes in connectors on the 286 
      motherboard.  Without those two simms, I would only be able to fill 
      one bank of simm slots on the new motherboard, resulting in only half 
      as much memory, not enough to run Turbo C++.  So, I would have to 
      de-solder the pins on those two simms before I could transfer them to 
      slots on the new motherboard.  Since I was new to computers in those 
      days, I was not 100% sure the simms would be compatible with the 386
      motherboard.  Even if they were, I assumed that I would damage them in 
      some way during the de-soldering process.  So, I was shocked when the new 
      motherboard booted up successfully and recognized all eight simms.</p>

   <p>By today's standards, my first PC had an impossibly stingy 20 MB, 
      5.25" hard drive.  I remember replacing it with a used 80 MB hard 
      drive that I bought for $85 at a local store that sold mostly used 
      computers and parts.  I was happy with that purchase, because 80 
      megabytes of space felt so roomy compared to my old hard drive.</p>

   <p>Walking along the isles of that particular computer store was like 
      panning for gold.  I never knew what treasures I might discover.  Old 
      and in some cases very old desktop computers lined bottom shelves all 
      over the store.  Today those old Vic-20's, Commodor 64's, TI-99/4A's, 
      TRS-80's, TRS-80 Color Computers, and a few that were so old that I 
      could not even identify them would be called Vintage.  But in the mid 
      1990's, they were one step away from the land-fill, too old to be 
      useful, even to me.  Used laptop computers were stacked on eye-level 
      shelves above the desktop computers.  Large cardboard boxes filled 
      with motherboards, sound cards, video cards, and other parts pulled 
      from old computers occupied the bottom shelf of one isle of the 
      store.  A shelf close to the ceiling on the east wall held a row of 
      assorted used monochrome and color CRT monitors.  The wide adoption 
      of LCD monitors by consumers was, I believe, still another five or 
      more years away.  I chose my first color VGA monitor from that shelf.  
      Its resolution was only 640x480, but that was sufficient for my needs 
      at the time.  If I remember correctly, I paid about $100 for that 
      monitor, which is coincidentally about what I paid for the 23" IPS 
      monitor that I bought from Best Buy three years ago.  I found an ISA 
      video card to interface with the VGA monitor in one of the large 
      cardboard boxes of video cards.</p>

   <p>As my flight simulator progressed, my 386 computer quickly 
      became unbearably slow.  The graphics capability of the combination 
      of the 386 CPU and ISA video card was not fast enough to produce more 
      than one or two frames per second.  I was forced to upgrade again.  
      This time, I went with a Trident PCI video card and a motherboard 
      with a 486 DX-66 CPU, which forced me to buy new 72-pin RAM.</p>

   <p>I spent a total of six months writing my flight simulator during two 
      periods of unemployment.  It went surprising well, and I learned much 
      about C++ coding, computer memory models, video memory, and 
      hardware interrupts.  Soon, I found myself looking for 
      intermediate-level C++ books, and not finding many.</p>

   <p>To make a long story short, I kept the case and power supply of my 
      first PC for 13 years as I upgraded through 4 motherboards, DOS 5.0, 
      DOS 6.11, Windows 95, and Windows 98.  Eventually, I grew tired of 
      lugging the heavy case around the country as I moved from job to job, 
      and I let go of the case and power supply.  However, I held on to the 
      original 8, 256 KB simms of RAM.  You can see them in the picture at 
      the top of this article.  Sometimes, I wish I still had that case and 
      power supply for nostalgic reasons, but as with most material things 
      that have outlived their usefulness, I could not justify keeping 
      them around.  Luckily, websites have no weight and never outlive their 
      usefulness, because they are infinitely upgradable.</p>

          <p>Modern application requirements have pushed beyond the limitations of DBMS (relational database management systems). NoSQL databases play an important role in cloud software applications, they store data in a format other than relational tables that does not require a fixed schema, they come in a variety of types based on their data model.</p>

<p>There are four main types of databases in the NoSQL (stands for “Not Only SQL” or “Not SQL.”):  key-value pair based, wide column, document-oriented and graph-based.</p>

<p>Both TerminusDB and MongoDB are NoSQL databases, both store data as documents, both have a flexible data model, that means that the database schema is flexible and can evolve in the time when the user exigences change, both databases support a rich query language, but TerminusDB is a <strong>version control document system</strong> and a <strong>graph database</strong> as well.</p>

<p>Now let’s see the main differences between TerminusDB and MongoDB in practice.</p>

<p>if you have never used TerminusDB before, this article includes everything you need to get started with TerminusDB.
<a href="https://terminusdb.com/2020/01/14/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data/">My First TerminusDB Graph Visualisation — Bike Share Data</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note: We are assuming that you already are familiar with MongoDB.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h2>

<p>First look at our dataset, which data we need to store and how this data is related to each other.</p>

<p>In our examples we use the collection of data about the bike journeys between stations in Washington D.C., USA.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/bike_table.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The CSV data used this tutorial is available at <a href="https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv">https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="query-language">Query language</h2>

<p>MongoDB uses the MongoDB Query Language (<strong>MQL</strong>) for accessing the documents.</p>

<p>In TerminusDB we use <a href="https://terminusdb.com/docs/woql"><strong>WOQL</strong> (Web Object Query Language)</a>. It is a unified model query language, WOQL’s primary syntax and interchange format is in JSON-LD.
All our example are writing using woql.js a javascript layer that help you to compose WOQL query.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="create-schema">Create Schema</h2>

<p>MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents support embedded fields, so documents can store related information (data or list of data) together, fields can vary from document to document.</p>

<p>You can insert a document in the collection and MongoDB creates that collection on the fly or maybe you can create a collection with a schema validation before .</p>

<p>Let’s see how to create a new collection with specified validation rules. Here a fragment 
for mongoshell:</p>

            <span>...............................</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>}}})</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We have created our <strong>journey</strong> collection with embedded  the <strong>start_station</strong> and <strong>end_station</strong> data entities (station_number,address) in the journey collection data. For many use cases in MongoDB, the denormalized data model is optimal.</p>

<p>In TerminusDB we have documents as well, so for our dataset we prefer to create three different documents: Station, Journey and Bicycle, every document has a label and a description and is identified by an unique URL. In our documents we have properties to describe the type of data and the documents are related to each other.  Following the link between the documents we can track the relationship between connected data for example <strong>Station</strong> - <em>many</em> - <strong>Journey</strong>.</p>

<p>An example of relationship between documents written in woql.js</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>WOQL</span><span>.</span><span>when</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>).</span><span>and</span><span>(</span>

       <span>.</span><span>description</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>A station where bicycles are deposited</span><span>"</span><span>),</span>        
   <span>WOQL</span><span>.</span><span>doctype</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Bicycle</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span>…</span><span>...)</span>         

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In the <strong>Journey</strong> document the range data type of the <strong>start_station</strong> and <strong>end_station</strong> properties (ObjectProperty) are the <strong>Station</strong> document.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="load-data">Load Data</h2>

<p>In MongoDB you can’t import a csv file in the journey collection directly. 
We could use mongoimport.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
mongoimport <span>--db</span><span>=</span>mybike <span>--collection</span><span>=</span>journey <span>--type</span><span>=</span>csv  <span>--ignoreBlanks</span> <span>--headerline</span> <span>--file</span><span>=</span><span>"./bike_tutorial.csv"</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the result will be a different collection schema</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>
</span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"_id"</span><span>:</span><span>"ObjectId(5f05f055c74146b286a61cf0)"</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Duration"</span><span>:</span><span>831</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Start date"</span><span>:</span><span>"2018-12-01 00:06:00"</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"End date"</span><span>:</span><span>"2018-12-01 00:19:52"</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Start station number"</span><span>:</span><span>31202</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Start station"</span><span>:</span><span>"14th &amp; R St NW"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>........</span><span>}</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>if you like to create the documents from the csv file inside the collection <strong>journey</strong> you have to implement your custom solution, maybe you could using javascript for import the data from the csv file ( csvtojson is a node.js library) and <strong>mongodb</strong> the official MongoDB driver for Node.js to insert the data into the collection.</p>

<p>Here one example to insert a document inside the journey collection using <em>mongoshell</em>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>

<p>In TerminusDB we have a very cleaner solution to import csv files into the database, with a data integrity check for any newly imported records. We use the woql.js layer for write the query statement to load the data from the csv file.</p>

<p>We cast (WOQL.typecast(a,b,c) method) the variable <strong>v:Start_Station</strong> as string (“xsd:string”) and refer it in a new variable <strong>v:SS_Label</strong></p>

<p>With WOQL.idgen(a,b,c) we create an unique id for every document. Example for <em>doc:Station</em> document we create an id from the <em>v:Start_ID</em> and refer it in the <em>v:Start_Station_URL</em></p>

<p>With WOQL.insert() we insert  the data inside our database. We create a <strong>Station</strong> document for every <strong>v:Start_station_URL</strong> and <strong>v:End_station_URL</strong> value and we link this value inside the <strong>start_station</strong> and <strong>end_station</strong> properties in the Journey document. The relationship between journey document and station document  has been created. The relationship allows TerminusDB to normalize the data across multiple documents.❗

<h2 id="query-the-data">Query the Data</h2>

<p>Here is an example of query operations using the db.collection.find() method in mongoshell, we select from the <strong>journey</strong> collection all documents where the status <strong>bike_id</strong> equals <strong>W21477</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/query-mongo.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The following example selects all the <strong>journey</strong> documents where the <strong>journey_bicycle</strong> property is linked at the <strong>bike</strong> document <strong>W21477</strong></p>

<p>Remember that TerminusDB is a graph-database, this means that TerminusDB
creates relationships between the documents and properties inside documents.
TerminusDB can analyze and traverse complex relationships between connected data structures. Let’s keep to practise❗</p>

<h2 id="so-what-s-a-regular-expression-">So, what's a Regular Expression?</h2>
<p><em>A regular expression (shortened as <strong>regex</strong> or <strong>regexp</strong>) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.</em> (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>So, basically, a regular expression is made up of a series of characters (be it special characters like <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>*</code>, alphabets and numbers) that defines a pattern. This pattern is usually used for finding text, and for validating input values. Here are two scenarios where you'd need a regular expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You have a very long string in which you want to check if any e-mail addresses exist. You couldn't use any ordinary address because you don't know which address may be in the string. You just want to know if there's any e-mail address at all in the string. How do you do that? You simply create a regular expression defining the pattern which all e-mail addresses follow, and then check if there's any match in the string.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A user enters a name in an input field you provided. As a front-end developer your job is to validate the data on the client-side before the server also does it. Regular expressions provide a way to check if the data entered by the user is exact, or follows the pattern of data that's required. For instance, an input field that expects a name of a person shouldn't contain digits or special characters apart from a hyphen.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Regular expressions can be defined in two ways: using the built-in <code>RegExp</code> constructor, or defining it as a literal value with double forward slashes - <code>//</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Option 1: <code>new RegExp()</code></li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span>let</span> regex = <span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span>(<span>"pattern"</span>, <span>"flags"</span>);
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Option 2: using forward slashes - <code>//</code></li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span>let</span> regex = <span>/pattern/</span>flags;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Where <code>pattern</code> is the pattern you intend to find;</li>
<li>and <code>flags</code> are optional tokens that add more functionality when finding the pattern you're trying to match. </li>
</ul>
<p>We'll cover flags in a bit, but for now, let's understand some fundamentals of creating patterns.</p>

<p>We're going to play with some regular expressions and learn how to use the <code>str.match()</code> and <code>regexp.test()</code> methods to determine whether or not a string matches a pattern. Here's our first example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello world!"</span>;



<span>let</span> rgxp1 = <span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span>(<span>"Hello"</span>);
<span>let</span> rgxp2 = <span>/Hello/</span>;


<span>console</span>.log(string.match(rgxp1));




<span>console</span>.log(rgxp2.test(string));


</code></pre>
<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>We defined two different regular expressions with different syntaxes but with the same pattern. You realised that the <code>flags</code> part was omitted in both expressions. It's optional; we only include it when we need special functionality, which we'll discuss in a second. 😉</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>str.match()</code> method accepts a regular expression as an argument. This is possible because regular expressions are integrated with string methods. So, you invoke the <code>match()</code> method on the string on which you want to run the pattern search; in our case, the <code>string</code> variable. You then pass the regular expression, which defines the pattern you want to search, as an argument to the <code>match()</code> method. If there's a match, it returns an array of substrings which matched the pattern; else, if there isn't a match, the method returns <code>null</code>. But in our example, the sub-string "Hello" in the string "Hello world!" is matched. There are additional properties attached to the returned array: <code>index</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>groups</code>. The <code>index</code> property holds the index in the target string where a pattern match was obtained; the <code>input</code> property holds a copy of the target string itself, thus <code>"Hello world!"</code>; the <code>groups</code> property hold <strong>groups</strong> captured in the regular expression, which, in our our case, is <code>undefined</code> because we didn't define any groups in the expression. Don't worry, we'll discuss groups too. 😃 So, with this result, it's clear that the <code>str.match()</code> method returns detailed description of the pattern search.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>regexp.test()</code> method, however, is invoked on the regular expression which defines the pattern, and the target string is rather passed as an argument to it. Unlike the <code>str.match()</code> method which returns a detailed information about the search, the <code>regexp.test()</code> method returns a Boolean: <code>true</code> if the pattern was found in the string; <code>false</code> if not. In our case, <code>true</code> was returned because obviously <code>Hello</code> can be found in the string "Hello world!".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The text <code>Hello</code> in between the forward slashes <code>//</code>, and string "Hello" passed to the <code>RegExp</code> constructor as an argument, are all simple examples of patterns in a regular expression. If you want to find a string which has the word "metal", you could define your pattern as <code>/metal/</code> or <code>new RegExp("metal")</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what if we run the search on the string <code>"hello world!"</code> instead of <code>"Hello world!"</code> (Notice the uppercase "H")?</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"hello world!"</span>;

<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/</span>;


<span>console</span>.log(rgxp.test(string));


</code></pre>
<p>Wait, what? 😕🤔 We had no match! That's because regular expressions, by default, are case sensitive. Meaning, an uppercase "H" is not the same as a lowercase "h".</p>
<p>And what if we run the search on the string <code>"Hello Hello world!"</code>? It should match it twice right? Let's find out:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello Hello world!"</span>;

<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/</span>;



<span>console</span>.log(string.match(rgxp));


</code></pre>
<p>Oops! The same result. Notice it matched at the <code>index</code> of <code>0</code>; meaning it matched only the first <code>Hello</code> and then it stopped searching.</p>
<p>Let's modify these behaviours with <strong>Flags</strong>. 😉</p>

<p>Flags, in regular expressions, are tokens that modify the searching behaviour of the regular expression. Flags are optional, as mentioned earlier, and they make it possible to alter the default behaviour of regular expressions. For instance, by default regular expressions are case sensitive. Meaning the pattern <code>/Abc/</code> will not match the string <code>"abc"</code>. </p>
<p>There are only six flags in JavaScript and they're denoted by single alphabets. Here they are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Flag</td><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>i</strong></td><td>Ignore case</td><td>Makes the expression search case-insensitively.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>g</strong></td><td>Global</td><td>Makes the expression search globally in the string, matching not only the first pattern, but all patterns in the string.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>s</strong></td><td>Dot All</td><td>Ensures the special character <code>.</code> matches newlines.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>m</strong></td><td>Multiline</td><td>Ensures the boundary characters <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> match the beginning and ending of every single line instead of the beginning and ending of the whole string.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>y</strong></td><td>Sticky</td><td>Makes the expression start its searching from the index indicated in its <code>lastIndex</code> property.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>u</strong></td><td>Unicode</td><td>Enables support for unicode.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="the-i-flag">The <code>i</code> Flag</h2>
<p>Using this flag on a regular expression changes its default case-sensitive behaviour to case-insensitive.</p>
<p>Now, let's match the string <code>"hello world!"</code> even though our pattern is defined with an uppercase "H":</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"hello world!"</span>;



<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/i</span>;



<span>console</span>.log(rgxp.test(string));


</code></pre>
<p>With the <strong><code>i</code></strong> flag, the pattern <code>/AbC/i</code> will match the string <code>"abc"</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-g-flag">The <code>g</code> Flag</h2>
<p>In our previous example where we tried matching the pattern <code>/Hello/</code> on the string <code>"Hello Hello world!"</code>, we only got one match, which is the first in the string. With the <strong><code>g</code></strong> flag, we can match all patterns in the string and not only the first:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello Hello world!"</span>;

<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/g</span>;





<span>console</span>.log(string.match(rgxp));


</code></pre>
<p>Note that, with the <strong><code>g</code></strong> flag, we don't get the additional properties <code>index</code>, <code>input</code>, and <code>groups</code>.</p>
<p>You can use several flags at the same time, too:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello hello world!"</span>;



<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/gi</span>;



<span>console</span>.log(rgxp.test(string)); 
</code></pre>

<p>Sets and Ranges provide a way to determine whether or not a character, from a <em>set of characters</em>, is matched at a given position.</p>
<h2 id="sets">Sets</h2>
<p><strong>Character sets</strong> are used to match one from several characters at a give position in a pattern.</p>
<p>Say you want to match these words: "sell", "tell", "fell", "yell". The words may be more than 4; but let's assume they have the same pattern; like with the 4 words above, they all end with "ell". The only thing different is their initial character. With <strong>character sets</strong>, we can define a <em>set</em> of these initial characters at the <em>position</em> where only a single one of them is needed, and then add the remaining parts of the pattern that's static.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To define a set of characters in a regular expression, enclose those characters in brackets <code>[]</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
<p>So, for the four words "sell", "tell", "fell", "yell", we define the set of their initials as <code>[stfy]</code>, followed by their last characters <code>ell</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> expr = <span>/[stfy]ell/i</span>;

<span>let</span> words = [<span>"sell"</span>, <span>"tell"</span>, <span>"fell"</span>, <span>"yell"</span>, <span>"bell"</span>, <span>"well"</span>];


<span>for</span> (<span>let</span> word <span>of</span> words) {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Matched "<span>${word}</span>" :::: `</span>, expr.test(word));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code><span>Matched</span> <span>"sell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"tell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"fell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"yell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"bell"</span> ::::  <span>false</span>
Matched <span>"well"</span> ::::  <span>false</span>
</code></pre><p>It is observed that, the first four strings in the array are perfect matches, but the last two aren't. That's because the last two have their initials to be <code>b</code> and <code>w</code>, which were not defined in the character set.</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
<p>Let's match either "odd" or "add". Both words end with "dd", but they both begin with different characters, "o" and "a".</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> expr = <span>/[oa]dd/i</span>;

<span>let</span> strings = [<span>"Odd"</span>, <span>"Let's add 2 and 3."</span>];


<span>for</span> (<span>let</span> string <span>of</span> strings) {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Matched "<span>${string}</span>" :::: `</span>, expr.test(string));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code><span>Matched</span> <span>"Odd"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Service ownership is becoming a best practice for teams looking to innovate while maintaining the level of reliability that customers expect. Service ownership means seeing the service through its entire lifecycle. In short, it means you build it, you run it. You’ll be responsible for the service’s security, reliability, performance, and quality.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This doesn’t mean you won’t have help from SREs to optimize or automate toil. It does mean that, as a developer, you need to build with quality in mind as you’ll be on call if your code breaks.</p><p>Service ownership comes with many benefits to the team as well as the organization. Service ownership is crucial because, as <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/ama-dustin-pearce">Instacart’s VP of Infrastructure Dustin Pearce</a> notes, “The decoupling of the people who are creating and the people who are owning creates problems, both in the software and in the process. The quality goes down.”<br></p><p>But it can be difficult to know where to begin, which is where <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">service level objectives (SLOs)</a> can make a big difference. SLOs can help teams by:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Abstracting complexity and creating a shared language around service metrics (as in this case study from <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slo-adoption-twitter">Twitter</a>)</li><li>Helping teams prioritize key user journeys&nbsp;</li><li>Unifying incentives across stakeholders (product, engineering, ops)</li><li>Providing data to justify where to focus engineering efforts&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Using metrics to learn about service health</h3><p>Teams who are new to service ownership may feel daunted, as it does come with significant responsibilities. On-call burden can become a nightmare if teams are constantly getting paged on low-signal alerts or false positives. As such, the first step is to identify what makes for a healthy system. This helps ensure that the team is oriented around the signals that matter. As engineers aren’t in direct contact with customers, it can be difficult to measure their experience. SLOs can provide crucial context for this.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As Dustin said, “Looking for those reliability or service level indicators, and defining some objectives for how you measure reliability or availability or correctness, has long been around. It's not like we're inventing signals here. The key is how do we pull those signals together in a cohesive view.”<br></p><p>An SLO, in other words, is a temperature check for your customers’ happiness, to help prevent the gnarly consequences of breaching your SLA. So, you should make sure that the metrics you’re measuring matter to your users.<br></p><p>Take the time to walk through your user journey and determine <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs your customers care about</a>. Then, optimize for those pain points. Checkout page loading too slowly? Service not available during peak hours of demand? Focus on those metrics for your SLOs, and set alerts to make sure that potential error budget violations bubble up early.</p><h3>Unifying incentives and getting buy-in&nbsp;</h3><p>Another benefit of service ownership is getting all stakeholders on the same page. To make sure this happens, everyone will need to be on board, from developers to C-levels. All parties will need to agree on the SLOs, escalation policies, and proposed customer impact, which again, is <em>very</em> challenging but will reap outsized benefits if done right. This agreement will become your error budget policy: a process that codifies what happens when SLOs are breached.<br></p><p>This can’t be a mandate from execs that engineering must obey. While successful implementation of SLOs requires cultural transformation and top-down support, the creation of SLOs should stem from grassroots efforts with leadership allowing engineers to drive adoption. In an article on <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey">Twitter’s reliability journey</a>, SREs Brian, Zac, and JP point to <strong><em>leadership support</em></strong> as essential to making reliability a first-class priority, which helped catalyze initiatives and hiring to support reliability.</p><p>To get alignment, hold team meetings first to determine what matters most to the customer and set SLOs. Then, talk to management. Share how SLOs can help save time and avoid incidents. Next, take it to the <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/sre-buy-in-c-levels-error-budgets-slos">executive level</a> and explain the positive business impact SLOs can offer.</p><p>Once everyone is on the same page on goal-able metrics, teams will feel more confident about service ownership.<br></p><h3>Balancing innovation and reliability</h3><p>SLOs also help teams point to data to make difficult but essential tradeoffs between innovation and reliability. In today’s fast-paced SaaS world, that balance is crucial. As Dustin said, “You've got to move. You've got to innovate. You've got to capture marketing growth fast, because if you don't, somebody's going to blow by you. It's the way it is. The machinery and the opportunity to start a company and go far with three human beings and a laptop is absurd.”<br></p><p>If you fail to innovate quickly enough, your customer will move to shinier products. But if you run too fast and pile on the tech debt, you could face a code freeze, giving competitors the opportunity to surpass you. To date, making decisions on where to invest has been largely political, or simply guesswork. This balance becomes easier to strike using SLOs.<br></p><p>SLOs and their corresponding error budgets give teams guidelines for when to ship. If your error budget has lots of wiggle room at the end of the window, ship away! If you're breaching SLOs too often, it's time to slow down and shore up reliability. After all, the most important feature is knowing ‘it just works.’ This helps keep the product roadmap centered around the needs of the customer.</p><h3>SLOs and service ownership unite</h3><p>While service ownership can be a daunting task, SLOs are a good place to start.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Dustin had some inspiring words of advice to keep service ownership teams ahead of the game: “The idea that you are vigorously prioritizing and always challenging your assumptions and never sitting on your laurels is important. Most leadership teams all agree that is the kind of thing that connects us.”<br></p><p>With SLOs, you’ll be able to run fast without sacrificing quality, and ensure the metrics you monitor both reflect customer needs while improving signal:noise for your on-call team. All these things are hallmarks of exceptional service ownership.<br></p><p>If you liked this article, check these out:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/ama-dustin-pearce">Leadership and Innovation with Instacart's VP of Infrastructure</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">What Are Service-Level Objectives?

    <div>

		
<p>Just under two months ago <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/introducing-opennebula-enterprise-edition/" target="_blank">we announced the Enterprise Edition</a> of the OpenNebula software bringing a more tested, hardened, and production-ready version of OpenNebula for enterprise use—by OpenNebula Systems. And quickly following that, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/ee-maintenance-release-v-5-12-1-is-available/" target="_blank">first maintenance version</a> of the 5.12 Enterprise Edition was released just a month later.</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-1024x646.png" alt="" data-id="26003" data-full-url="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1.png" data-link="https://opennebula.io/?attachment_id=26003" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-1024x646.png 1024w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-300x189.png 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-768x484.png 768w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-1536x969.png 1536w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></li></ul></figure>







<p>Today, we are glad to announce an additional development in our enterprise product release cycle: the introduction of new <strong>LTS versions</strong> to reduce the risk, expense, and disruption of software deployment. Approximately every 6 months, each OpenNebula major or minor version will be either LTS (Long Term Support) or STS (Short Term Support).</p>



<p>Customers can choose to use LTS or STS releases according to their discretion:</p>



<ul><li>An <strong>STS version</strong> will be maintained and technically supported for a period of <strong>7 months</strong>. This incorporates the 6 months until the next main version (LTS or STS) is available, plus an additional month thereafter. These are production-quality releases that serve as a proving ground for new capabilities by customers interested in adopting new major features and are able to perform upgrades multiple times a year.</li><li>An <strong>LTS version</strong> will be maintained and technically supported for a period of <strong>at least 27 months</strong>. This incorporates the time until the next LTS is available (which is at least for 18 months, but could be for longer), plus an additional 9 months thereafter. LTS releases are the “enterprise grade” releases of OpenNebula and are intended to be utilized primarily in production environments by customers interested in a release family with an extended support cycle.</li></ul>



<p>From its 7th month, the LTS releases enter into “Maintenance Support” in which they will receive only critical and compatible fixes throughout their lifecycle, (no additional minor enhancements). And the last 3 months of an LTS release support overlaps with the beginning of “Maintenance Support” for the subsequent LTS release. This provides a simple way for customers who are averse to too many changes to remain in the maintenance and extended support phases with no minor features across two LTS releases.</p>



<p>The newly-released <a href="http://opennebula.org/firework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework”</a> is our first LTS version with an expected EOL of <strong>September 15, 2022</strong>. The EOL of the 5.10 version will be September 15, 2020, which is in alignment with the former policy. And for those customers that have the need to maintain support for a version beyond the EOL date, we offer an “Extended Life Support” extension to do just that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This advancement in our Release Life Cycle Policy will provide users of the Enterprise Edition more flexibility in their software maintenance planning.</p>

                            <p>I have recently decided to reboot the blog. I am sure a lot of us working from home right now are thinking about using those two extra hours of commute time to do something productive. Get that blog setup, start writing, learn something and maybe, just maybe, make a few extra dollars.</p><p>In many ways creating a newsletter and building an audience is turning out to be the gateway drug to entrepreneurship for a lot of people. The formula most are using seems to be simple get an audience together, ask them what they want, go build that for them or use the audience to get your business going.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rise of the self educated newsletter as source of livelihood <a href="https://t.co/oRFEzRTkTx">https://t.co/oRFEzRTkTx</a></p>— Elad Gil (@eladgil) <a href="https://twitter.com/eladgil/status/1281591465034932224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The setup I had while blogging was painfully bad. With that in mind, it led me down a quest to evaluate of the options going forward. I could use Medium, substack, roll my own (this is especially true for those of us that are engineers or technical) but there are options for even those that aren’t so technical as well such as WordPress or the Ghost blogging platform.</p><p><br>I’ve written some posts on Medium in the past and substack is gaining a ton of popularity as a way to own your own audience and monetize an email newsletter. However, with both of those platforms, the engineer in me is incredibly bothered by not having control. Not controlling the domain name, customizing everything about the way the content is read, and being able to dig into the code if I want to.</p><p><br>A lot of people are getting into writing their own newsletters recently too. It is a great way to monetize your writing. Surprisingly people on the internet want to support independent writers and thinkers too. However, the problem we all have is we are all employees of the platforms we use. If they don’t like what we write their algorithms can deprioritize our content and not put it in front of anyone, they can outright take down our content, this is why in 2020 more than ever I feel it’s important to have control. With that in mind I would like to discuss the different options I evaluated and why I landed where I did.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Having a website with articles you've published is like having a personal agent who finds career opportunities for you 24/7</p>— David Perell (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1280676512857853953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><hr><h2 id="substack">substack</h2><p>While I admire what Substack has done, glued stripe to a great writing platform, which may sound like a subtle thing it should not be underestimated as an amazing innovation that is unleashing a wealth creative independent ideas and a renaissance in newsletter email and blogging. Subtle tweaks are sometimes the most innovative of them all, it can be the difference between an ordinary phone line and a phone line that connects you to a vast network of machines, subtle but massive. The first is a regular phone, the second is the internet.</p><p>Writing on substack is perfectly fine but the issue is the control and customization. For more on this please read <a href="https://www.kevin-indig.com/why-i-left-substack-and-the-email-renaissance/">Kevin Indig's post on why he migrated off substack right after he joined it.</a> It was a huge influence on my decision not to use substack.</p><p>In the post he explains that</p><blockquote>2 years ago, I started a newsletter on Mailchimp called Tech Bound and built it out to +3,000 subscribers. 3 months ago, I decided to migrate to Substack. One week ago, I went from Substack to publishing on my own site. In this post, I explain why, what my current stack looks like, and a larger trend that has been in full swing for 2 years.</blockquote><p>Substack has a lot of welcome features over something like Medium, for one you can keep your audience, which is a huge deal in this day and age. They let you collect emails in your newsletter and keep all of those. They let you export that later if you want to move off too. They also let you charge for content and keep 10% plus the stripe fees for themselves, which is much better than the Medium models that kicks back a few pennies per read</p><hr><h2 id="medium">Medium</h2><p>The best way to describe medium is as the YouTube red version of writing online. They own everything, except your content, you are an employee to their platform and get paid a cut based on reads if you choose to participate in their partner program. They own the audience, the readers pay them a membership fee. You are given a small cut of that based on reading time and you cant customize anything meaningful.</p><p>I have published on large Medium publications such as Hackernoon and that publication relationship has gone south fast with Hackernoon moving off the platform to get more control. You can read more about that relationship between H<a href="https://hackernoon.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-hacker-noon-vs-medium-t0fg3zz4">ackernoon and Medium here, hint it didn't end well</a>. This is all because everything that is true about substack not letting you do, medium is 10x worse. </p><p>While true that you have absolutely no control on Medium, what they do give you is some eyeballs and a little reach if they choose to feature your story. </p><p>Medium might make sense as a passive way for certain types of articles. Also as a way to write certain viral type of content and drive the audience to your personal blog that you own. I certainly cannot recommend it as the main platform as a writer if you are serious about building an audience.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>:</p><p><a href="https://hulry.com/medium-vs-own-blog/">Here is a another great post on why you should <strong>not </strong>use Medium by Rahul Chowdhury</a> titled "Why Medium is Not the Home for Your Ideas".</p><p>The post goes into more depth about how to take advantage of some the eyeballs medium provides while still owning the content yourself, basically by cross posting to Medium after you've posted on your own blog.</p><hr><h2 id="ghost-and-wordpress-">Ghost (and WordPress)</h2><p>If you have not heard about Ghost, <a href="https://ghost.org/">go look it up</a>, it is an open source platform that competes with all of the top blogging platforms. A lot of what is true about Ghost is also true about WordPress but WordPress has evolved to do much more than writing and that has sort of become its Achilles heel. </p><p> Ghost offer a fully managed service you can pay a small fee for that gives you full control and where you own everything, more customization than medium, substack, and everyone else out there. For those of us that are a little more technical it allows us to run a blogging platform ourselves. That is because they open source the code base for modification and there are some great docker images from Bitnami to run it yourself, this is similar to WordPress but again unlike WordPress the whole thing is on Node and JavaScript and much lighter weight and made to do one thing great, write.</p><p>Here is a breakdown of the features Ghost has over the other serious contender out there:</p><figure><img src="https://louiebacaj.com/content/images/2020/07/xghostvssubstack.PNG.pagespeed.ic.NMo_cW3hTc.png" alt="" srcset="https://louiebacaj.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/xghostvssubstack.PNG.pagespeed.ic.b8txcl7_QL.png 600w, https://louiebacaj.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/xghostvssubstack.PNG.pagespeed.ic.b8txcl7_QL.png 1000w, https://louiebacaj.com/content/images/2020/07/xghostvssubstack.PNG.pagespeed.ic.NMo_cW3hTc.png 1129w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><hr><p>This is a tough decision because anyone whose thinking about writing at the end of the day wants to spend most of the time writing not choosing platforms. Nobody wants to spend time switching back and fourth, God forbid. We want to pick a great one and ride the wave. </p><p>Some of the most important considerations for me when picking a platform to reboot the blog were:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>A relationship, and ownership, of my readers and audience</li>
<li>Control and customizations</li>
<li>Readers that the platform will bring in</li>
<li>Monetization</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>With those factors in mind here is how I ranked my options:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table>
	<tbody><tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Ease of Use</th>
        <th>Audience Ownership</th>
        <th>Customization</th>
        <th>Platform Readers</th>
        <th>Monetization</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>substack</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Medium</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
   <tr>
        <td>Ghost</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>5</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>On a scale of 0-5, where 5 is best, when we rate these platforms on the above criteria, again this is my opinion, we can see that when we total this all up Ghost scores the highest by far.</p><p>While all of the platforms are easy to use, a big reason they are on my list, they start to differ greatly when it comes to who owns the audience and how much customization and control you have. They all differ significantly when it comes to monetization as well with Medium taking the biggest cut. </p><p>In terms of bringing eye balls to your blog this for me is a non quantifiable, not easily measurable thing that is technically the strength of the platforms. For most of us the likelihood that they will promote our posts and put in front of people is very low. Almost all my readership on medium has come via SEO and other channels. You've got to be in the very top of writers on both Medium and substack for them to feature you and if you are at the very top then why not just do it yourself and have full control?</p><p>In the end I had to go with Ghost and I have to say that I love ghost for blogging and highly recommend it, even if your an engineer and could build your own, and even if your not and could roll WordPress or something like that, I still highly recommend Ghost. I can’t quite put my finger on it but it feels like a platform that was made with love and more specifically the love of one thing and that’s writing. This is a big reason I chose to reboot my blog onto the latest version of Ghost rather than some of the other options out there.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Challenge accepted, look at the ghost blogging platform integrated with stripe out of the box. Custom domains, all the features of Substack plus more.</p><p>Once people see that payments page and it looks the same as every other “platforms” payment page (Stripe) you know it’s safe.</p></div>— Louie Bacaj (@LBacaj) <a href="https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1281438113907314688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2020</a></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/software-engineering-kpis-how-to-choose-the-best-fitting-metrics" data-title="Software Engineering KPIs: how to choose the best fitting metrics"><p>Software Engineering KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are measurable values that indicate the progress of engineering teams’ performance towards business objectives. Therefore, they need to be consistent, broad enough to consider everyone’s effort, and, most importantly, measurable.</p>
<p>As they should represent the team’s or area’s work, it’s crucial to pick the right metrics to measure. Otherwise, metrics are<span> useless.</span><span></span></p>
<p>It’s a common mistake I’ve seen in the industry to measure productivity by the number of lines of code (LOC), the number of commits, or even the number of deploys. Don’t get me wrong, measuring the number of deploys may be a good fit, but it should fulfill a purpose (which may not relate to productivity).</p>
<p>Usually, blog posts about KPIs concentrate lots of metrics, but few of those correlate the metrics with real objectives. So, in this article, I tried something different. I selected 5 Engineering KPIs metrics and then listed candidate objectives for them.</p>
<h2>Time from Commit to Deploy</h2>
<p>Finding the elapsed time from an engineer’s first commit in a branch to when that very same commit reaches production is the easiest way to measure the whole development flow. It’s easy because it can be automated by looking to git’s commits history.</p>
<p>Many managers look for User Story Lead Time, which means they look for the time spent from adding a card to the “backlog” to the time the card reached “done.”</p>
<p>Besides, just because a card is in the “backlog” column of a Kanban board doesn’t mean it’s ready for development. It may miss requirements, layout specifications, and test instructions, for instance.</p>
<p>That’s why they give you an overview of the product’s flow. But, as engineers, we are usually more concerned about improving the development flow, which starts in “doing” and ends in “done” (deployed in production).</p>
<p>So, this metric can relate to many objectives, here I name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the time to market of new features</li>
<li>Reduce waste and rework</li>
<li>Reduce the Cost of Delay</li>
<li>Maximize engineering efficiency</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deploy Frequency</h2>
<p>The deployment step is at the end of the value perceived by the customer (be it an internal ). So, it is indeed related to productivity, as each release concludes a job.</p>
<p>However, the number of delivered features doesn’t relate precisely with business objectives. The goals established for a quarter are usually more abstract, for instance, reducing the time to market for new features.</p>
<p>That said, instead of using Deploy Frequency for measuring the team’s productivity, it could take part in measuring objectives as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the time to market of new features</li>
<li>Improve the responsiveness to failures and outages due to bugs</li>
<li>Mitigate security issues</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code Coverage</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">Code Coverage</a> measures the portion of code sustained under automated tests. The higher the coverage, the better.</p>
<p>It is an excellent tool for indicating the code’s quality. Also, it could report the progress of the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the product/platform stability</li>
<li>Reduce churn (in case there is evidence churn relates to a buggy product)</li>
<li>Scale the technology area</li>
<li>Reduce the time to market (as performing manual tests take more time)</li>
<li>Reduce costs in the long run</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pull Request metrics</h2>
<p>Collaborations review the code of their peer before it gets merged into the main branch. The conversation ignited by this practice is a piece of vital information for measuring collaboration and engagement.</p>
<p><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/pull-requests-checklists-metrics-and-best-practices-a-definitive-guide">Pull Request metrics</a> are a set of measurements extracted from pull requests. Below I picked a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to Review: how much time do engineers take to open and merge a pull request?</li>
<li>Time to First Comment: how much time do pull requests take to receive the first comment?</li>
<li>Number of Comments: how many comments do pull requests receive?</li>
<li>Cross Team Collaboration: do teams review other team’s pull requests?</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is a list of objectives pull request metrics can assist in measuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread knowledge through the team</li>
<li>Introduce a Code Ownership Culture</li>
<li>Lessen the ramp-up curve for junior engineers</li>
<li>Create a harmonious and ever-learning environment</li>
</ul>
<h2>Focus on urgent bugs</h2>
<p>I’ve seen many companies implementing the objective of achieving “zero bugs” for the next quarter. The KPI would be the number of bugs found in production (by the team or by the end-user).</p>
<p>This approach is flawed, first of all, because it’s near impossible to eliminate all bugs. We’re humans, and bugs happen. Secondly, we can’t compare a cosmetic bug with a bug preventing the user from paying an order. In third place, if you only measure the number of bugs quantitatively, people tend not to register them. No bugs filled means goal achieved.</p>
<p>Measuring if the focus is on working on critical bugs <span>can prevent such misunderstandings</span><span>. For that purpose, you can combine metrics, like the number of urgent bugs (that are more severe and impactful than an agreed level), the time the team took to fix, and if the fix was definitive.</span><span></span></p>
<p>Of course, you can add more metrics. I strongly suggest having complementary metrics to ensure that the team takes no shortcuts to mask metrics values.</p>
<p>Some objectives focus on bugs benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the product value perception by the final-user</li>
<li>Reduce cost by focusing on adding more features (instead of fixing cosmetic or banal bugs)</li>
<li>Foster a harmonious and effective culture</li>
<li>Foster a collaborative culture between engineers and Quality Assurance personnel</li>
</ul>
<h2>In short</h2>
<p>There are plenty of articles out there that list relevant Engineering KPIs with metrics. However, it’s prevalent to see managers picking the wrong <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/pull-requests-checklists-metrics-and-best-practices-a-definitive-guide">engineering metrics</a>, which ends up in an undesired behavior of the team members.</p>
<p>That’s why Engineering KPIs must align with business goals. It gives direction to the team to game on it. So, managers must wisely choose which of the KPI measurements make sense for the context of their team.</p>
<p>In practice, managers define KPIs for already-established objectives. In this article, I listed possible objectives for each KPI metric to <span>exercise in the opposite direction. </span></p>
<p>The idea behind the article is to help you to check whether a KPI measurement is a good fit or not.</p>
<p>This practice is particularly useful while reading an article with lots of Engineering KPIs metrics. It helps me a lot, and I hope It can help you as well.</p>

July 21, 2020 | https://www.pauldowman.com/posts/signing-git-commits-with-gpg | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pauldowman.com/posts/signing-git-commits-with-gpg">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A Git commit’s author might not be who you think it is.</p>
<p>I’m old enough to remember when it was easy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack">spoof</a> the email sender (send fake email that appears to come from someone else). In the early days of the Internet most people didn’t even realize it was possible, so they were easy victims. </p>
<p>Email is delivered by SMTP, an open protocol, which is what has allowed it to flourish as a global, distributed system. But it was also designed without built-in cryptographic verification of the sender (in fact it was illegal to export cryptography from the US until 1992!). Now we have protection against this, such as SPF and DKIM, and most email services will warn you if the sender isn’t verified (or at least that it doesn’t come from the domain that it claims to).</p>
<p>But today <strong>a Git commit author is just as easily spoofed as email was in the 90s</strong>. Like email, Git is a global, distributed system, and by default it also doesn’t have built-in cryptographic verification of the author’s identity.</p>
<p>So how can you be sure that all commits are really from the author that you think they’re from? GitHub accounts can be compromised and malicious code can be hidden in pull requests (e.g. malicious packages added in hidden lockfile diffs, homoglyph changes to package names or domain names, changes in binaries if you have any in your repo, or maybe just a malicious change that you didn’t notice). </p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>Git supports signing tags and individual commits, and the GitHub UI shows a “verified” label on signed commits:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.pauldowman.com/static/8905b3b65f65e07e9409f3c0db06fa7f/0ad97/verified.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="verified" title="verified" src="https://www.pauldowman.com/static/8905b3b65f65e07e9409f3c0db06fa7f/fcda8/verified.png" srcset="https://www.pauldowman.com/static/8905b3b65f65e07e9409f3c0db06fa7f/12f09/verified.png 148w,
https://www.pauldowman.com/static/8905b3b65f65e07e9409f3c0db06fa7f/e4a3f/verified.png 295w,
https://www.pauldowman.com/static/8905b3b65f65e07e9409f3c0db06fa7f/fcda8/verified.png 590w,
https://www.pauldowman.com/static/8905b3b65f65e07e9409f3c0db06fa7f/0ad97/verified.png 717w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" loading="lazy">
  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Being sure of commit authors lets you focus more attention on less trusted contributions and it makes incident response a lot easier.</p>
<p>Git also supports rejecting unsigned commits.</p>
<h3>How to</h3>
<p>Here are a few options for setup guides:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would generally follow this <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification">guide from GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re using OS X <a href="https://gist.github.com/troyfontaine/18c9146295168ee9ca2b30c00bd1b41e">this guide</a> covers installing GPG and includes setting up <code>pinentry-mac</code> for a passphrase entry dialog.</li>
<li>There’s also <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work">the Git docs</a>.</li>
</ul></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The first commercial version of <a href="https://curious-expedition.com/">Curious Expedition</a> was released at the end of 2014. In this blog post I will give you the complete overview of all the sales numbers of these first six years. How many units we sold, when we sold them, in which territories, on which platforms. I will also tell how it felt to tank with our game and how we were able to eventually turn it into a bigger success than we ever imagined.</p>
<p>In case you never heard about it: Curious Expedition is a roguelike expedition game in which you explore uncharted lands, fight dangerous beasts and encounter unknown tribes, all while trying to not go insane or getting forsaken by your own trek members. It is the first game by  <a href="http://maschinen-mensch.com/" target="_blank">Maschinen-Mensch</a>.</p>

<p>Over time, it was released on all major store fronts: Steam, GOG, HumbleStore and itch.io. We recently released console versions for Xbox, PS and Nintendo Switch, but that happened after the initial five years and will not be covered here.</p>

<h3 id="the-big-picture">The big picture</h3>
<p>I’ll give you the grand yearly numbers right away. For NDA reasons I can’t go into specific details about how much we sold on each distribution platform, but will instead lump all our digital sales together. All of this units are gross value, that means before tax, distribution rev share and charge backs (usually around 5-15%).</p>


<p>As you can see Curious Expedition had its <strong>most successful years two full years after releasing the first version</strong>. If you’re interested in how we managed to do that just keep reading the detailed history below:</p>
<h2 id="year-1-2014---alpha">Year 1 (2014) - Alpha</h2>
<h3 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h3>
<p>Johannes and I met at Berlin AAA developer <a href="https://www.yager.de/" target="_blank">Yager</a> where we both worked on the war/anti-war game Spec Ops: The Line. We decided to start working on a hobby project around 2012, with the grand dream of potentially going indie with it. Curious Expedition (or Terra Incognita as it was called back then) was the first game that we both agreed on. The idea came to me when I browsed a National Geographic magazine in the waiting room of my dentist.</p>
<p>During this hobbyist phase we struggled quite a bit with the game. Our interest in the premise never waned, but we went through dozens of game mechanics without really being able to nail down the core loop concept. During that time we met multiple times with the intention of quitting the game, only to give it two more months over and over again. We made a leap of faith when we decided to quit our AAA jobs in the beginning of 2014.</p>
<p>The birth of our company Maschinen-Mensch (at some point we had called ourselves Hic Sunt Leones) was eased by a <strong>€50,000 grant from <a href="https://www.medienboard.de/" target="_blank">Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg</a></strong>. Thankfully we also had a bit of personal savings that helped us survive the initial months since the grant is only allowed to cover 50% of the project costs.</p>
<p>The first thing we did when finally started working full-time on the game, was completely ripping it apart and disabling all features until nothing but a simplistic movement prototype remained. From here we rebuilt all the aspects of the game. Our hope that we finally were onto something was kindled by the positive feedback from our small game designer meetup that we started around the same time.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014 we pushed ourselves to finally release the painfully barebone initial alpha of the game. Complete sections of the game were still missing: when you ran into combat a text message would tell you that we basically didn’t get to that part yet. But we had no choice: our money was running out at this point.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-editions">Alpha Editions</h3>
<p>We released the first buyable version of Curious Expedition on our own homepage where we sold it via the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/developer/widget" target="_blank">Humble Widget</a>. We took some inspiration from all the new Kickstarter projects that were created in 2014 and showed that players appreciated different pricing and feature options for purchasing games.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of all editions we started with:</p>

<h3 id="day-1-sales">Day 1 sales</h3>
<p>Our first release date was November 18th 2014 and we sold in total <em>drum rolls</em>.. <strong>61 copies for a total revenue of $1,203</strong>. Not exactly dream numbers when you just quit your high profile AAA job and spent all your savings on creating this indie game, which has to work out for you to be able to remain an indie game dev.</p>
<p>Here’s a break-down of the unit types sold on that first day:</p>
<div><h4>Launch Day (November 18th 2014)</h4></div>
<h3 id="back-to-work">Back to work</h3>
<p>After pushing the big frightening release button, I remember that we went to a coincidental drink out with some friends from the game dev scene. I still remember how they asked curiously how much we had already sold. I felt bad about telling them that this great indie game experiment we had launched had pretty much tanked at this point. But there was no point in giving up now, so on Monday we got back into the office (which was my living room) and just started working on our next big alpha update.</p>
<p>I turned my old iPad into a live sales metrics board showing the current sales in the style of an airport destinations board and we hooked up to a hefty cash register sound whenever somebody bought a copy of our game. I remember with joy the small moments of celebration when during work the sound would come up and how we high-fived. I also remember those stretches of hours when there was no single sound being played though and we were checking if our metrics were broken, before realizing once again that this was just the state of affairs.</p>
<p>In 2014 we sold in total <strong>793</strong> units for a revenue of <strong>$10,965</strong> with an average price point of <strong>$13.83</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="year-2-2015---early-access">Year 2 (2015) - Early Access</h2>
<p>In 2015 we pushed hard on extending Curious Expedition 1. Despite the slow start we were nowhere done and set our hopes into appearing in digital storefronts. So far we had tried to bring people to our small website, but since the players didn’t come to the game, it was time to bring the game to the players.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-videos">Alpha Videos</h3>
<p>Up to this point we had mostly relied on twitter to attract players to our homepage. Today we’re close to 6,000 followers on twitter, but back then we were struggling for a long time to even get to 500 followers.</p>
<p>To build up visibility and hopefully share our excitement about our game, we started recording videos for the numerous alpha updates that we did. Looking at them now, they are a crazy trip down the memory lane to our past selves. Here’s the one for Alpha 4, which is special since it is the alpha in which we added combat for the first time.</p>

          <p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0KRUAeg79E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
          </p>
          
<p>For each alpha update we announced the release day weeks in advance and approached it like a mini-release with marketing material and a strong theme for each of these updates. We made sure to have at least one highly visible “hero feature” per alpha release.</p>
<p>For this update our main focus were our dice challenges. We had been working on combat prototypes for over a year at this point, but as we added more and more combat features, we realized that it became a big centerpiece and we were over-scoping heavily, so we made the hard decision to completely remove combat and make a game that would work solely based on the merits of its unique travel gameplay first.</p>
<p>We did this even though we felt that we had stumbled into an interesting spin on combat: a 1-dimensional dungeon crawler, where instead of on a grid your character and the enemies would be laid out on a line.</p>
<h3 id="free-weekend">Free weekend!</h3>
<p>Before going to stores, we decided to try our luck on drawing more people to our website one last time and did a free weekend! Players could play the game right from their web browser without having to download anything. This was not only nice for lowering entry barriers but also made it very easy for us to revoke access to the game after the weekend was done.</p>
<p>We expected to have fewer sales during the free weekend with an uptick in sales afterwards from players who wanted to play more. To our surprise we had the highest sales during the time when the game was free. Afterwards the sales normalized pretty quickly again.</p>
<div><h4>Sales before and after the free weekend (Feb 2015)</h4></div>
<h3 id="storefront">Storefront!</h3>
<p>On May 19th we finally entered Early Access on Steam as our first store front and this is when Curious Expedition finally changed trajectory to become a success. We still sold the extra editions through our own homepage but the vast majority of sales now happened on the digital storefronts.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-strategy">Pricing Strategy</h3>
<p>We increased our price from <strong>$12</strong> to <strong>$15</strong> as we released the Early Access version. We felt it was fair enough since we had spent many months adding additional content to the game. The following chart shows the average price point per year.</p>
<div><h4>Average Price per Year (2015-2019)</h4></div>
<p>We also decided to be as timid as possible regarding sales. Until we reached the 1.0 phase we decided to not do any sales that went beyond 20%. You can see a timeline of our general sale price reductions here.</p>
<div><h4>On-Sale Reduction (2015-2019)</h4></div>
<p>In 2015 we sold in total <strong>21,266</strong> units for a revenue of <strong>$302,534</strong> with an average price point of <strong>$14.23</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="year-3-2016---gold-release">Year 3 (2016) - Gold Release</h2>
<h3 id="going-gold">Going Gold</h3>
<p>This is the year that we released the 1.0 version of Curious Expedition after over a year of Early Access. We also landed in more online stores: getting a presence in the HumbleStore and being lucky enough to be chosen by GOG as one of the very few games that they chose for their Games in Production program.</p>
<p>We read that you only get one big push in your game’s lifetime: either your Kickstarter campaign or your early access release or your full release. Luckily for us this turned out to not be the case. Not only did the game keep selling well in 2016, the release of the 1.0 version even surpassed our sales records until that point and pushed the game to sell more units than it had in 2015. After the gold release we started applying more sales and going beyond 20%. We were still extremely conservative for a game that had been released for two years now.</p>

<p>This year we also started working with the Goethe Institute, a non-profit German cultural …</p></div></div></div>

July 21, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="react-as-a-framework">React as a framework<a href="#react-as-a-framework" aria-label="react as a framework permalink"></a></h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now. Its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones. I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance. Most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2 id="1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed">1. Using useState when no rerender is needed<a href="#1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed" aria-label="1 using usestate when no rerender is needed permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components. Which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At first sight, you might ask what exactly is the problem with that? Isn't that what state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will never be a problem with that. However in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children. But in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>

<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is a huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should, where possible, be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2 id="3-handling-actions-via-useeffect">3. Handling actions via useEffect<a href="#3-handling-actions-via-useeffect" aria-label="3 handling actions via useeffect permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Makes sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. There is no guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2 id="4-single-responsibility-components">4. Single responsibility components<a href="#4-single-responsibility-components" aria-label="4 single responsibility components permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even harder to test or to reuse the component in other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="5-single-responsibility-useeffects">5. Single responsibility useEffects<a href="#5-single-responsibility-useeffects" aria-label="5 single responsibility useeffects permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Remember the times when we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p>

<p>2020-06-21</p>

<p>This is the only old machine that I have kept around. It’s from around
1995, I don’t remember exactly. Despite it’s old age, it’s relatively
powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Pentium with 133 MHz, well, it could be worse.</li>
<li>64 MB RAM. It came with 32 MB and was upgraded later on.</li>
<li>8 GB hard disk.</li>
<li>Behold: An Ethernet adapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is slow by today’s standards, but the RAM and the NIC make it
surprisingly useful. 8 GB for a disk is also more than you might think.
It’s one “generation” after DOS (think 8 to 25 MHz, 70 MB disk tops, 4
MB RAM, something like that), it came with Windows 95, and was blazingly
fast back then. It was the first time ever that I saw a <em>video</em> playing
on a computer, while other programs could be run in parallel.</p>
<p>I installed OpenBSD 5.7 a few years ago. Time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Originally, I expected this to be a very long blog post with a lot of
nasty details. There are some obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The machine does not have USB, yet.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support PXE boot, either.</li>
<li>I don’t own any blank CD-R anymore, so I can’t burn a CD.</li>
<li>It’s 2020 and Coronavirus is all over the place, so I don’t want to
    go out to try to find some place where I can buy CDs or other stuff.
    I can only use what I happen to have lying around.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how on earth would I be able to update that system?</p>
<p>What I did have lying around were some old 3.5" floppy disks. And much
to my surprise, OpenBSD 6.7 offers a floppy image. I copied it to the
floppy, booted, and … it just worked. It detected the NIC, requested an
IP via DHCP, and then the installer was able to install a brand new
OpenBSD via HTTP.</p>
<p>Holy cow.</p>
<p>What a humbling experience. On one 1.44 MB floppy disk, they have a
working kernel, enough drivers to support my hardware, a working
userland including a DHCP client, and a working installer. In 2020,
where a simple “hello world” in Golang needs over 2 MB of disk space,
this is absolutely mind blowing. Even when compared to other operating
systems from the 1990ies, I feel like this is pretty impressive, because
IBM PC-DOS came on what, 5 floppys? With no notion of networking
whatsoever and virtually zero drivers? But to be honest, that’s so long
ago, I can barely remember anymore what a vanilla PC-DOS felt like and
which features it had, so I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Since there are virtually no technical details to blog about, here are
some photos from the installation process. One of the last ones being me
writing this blog post in X11. And the very last one? That’s <a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/git/katriawm">katriawm</a>,
<a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/git/bevelbar">bevelbar</a>, and (invisible but running) <a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/git/nhkd">nhkd</a>. Whoa.</p>
<p>After the photos, I’ll put some quick configuration notes.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s a GNU Gnu. Deal with it.</p>
<h2>Configuration notes</h2>
<p>OpenBSD creates a unique <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=149887978201230">randomized kernel</a> on each boot. On that
old machine, this takes literally an hour. I have disabled both KARL and
library relinking in <code>/etc/rc</code>. This should be done using <code>ed(1)</code>
directly after the installer has finished: It offers you to open a shell
and the filesystem on which you installed is still mounted.</p>
<p>The system has neither USB nor PS/2. I can only attach a serial mouse.
It doesn’t get detected automatically, so I have to create an
<code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Section "ServerFlags"
    Option "AutoAddDevices" "False"
    Option "AllowEmptyInput" "False"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Mouse0"
    Driver      "mouse"
    Option      "Protocol" "Microsoft"
    Option      "Device" "/dev/tty00"
    Option      "ZAxisMapping" "4 5 6 7"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Keyboard0"
    Driver      "kbd"
    Option      "XkbLayout" "de"
EndSection
</code></pre>
<p><code>wsmoused</code> works too (but must not be running when X does), it
needs these flags:</p>
<pre><code>-p /dev/cua00 -t microsoft
</code></pre>

				  <p>Sales and customer data provide important insight for companies. Analytics has today an important role in providing data about sales trends, customer profiles, warnings about (un)profitable products, sales volume forecasts and stock supply as well as personalizing customer relationships and giving product recommendations. All this information needs to be delivered in time, preferably in a (semi)automated fashion.<br></p>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/published/big-data-dashboard.jpg?1592856241" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <div><p><span size="3">Photo by Stephen Dawson on Unsplash</span></p></div>  <div><p>These data can become large to the point that analytical tools and software have performance issues. For example, many businesses embrace spreadsheet software like Excel for understandable reasons, but it would breakdown with large data. Many data scientist work with Python/R, but modules like Pandas would become slow and run out of memory with large data as well.</p><p>Apache Spark enables large and big data analyses. It does this by using parallel processing using different threads and cores optimally. It can therefore improve performance on a cluster but also on a single machine </p><p><span color="#5040ae">[1]</span>. It can do this for (i) unstructured data such as text or for (ii) structured data such as DataFrames arranged in columns. Spark does not require loading all data into memory before processing and it is faster than for example Hadoop.<br>Spark is a multi-language tool. Interfaces exist for Scala, Java, Python and R users, and it can be used in the cloud. These and other features make it a suitable platform for large scale data analyses. Google trends suggests that PySpark - Spark with a Python interface - enjoys increasing popularity.<br></p></div>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/google-trends_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p><span size="3"><span><span>Data source: <strong>Google Trends</strong> (https://www.<strong>google</strong>.com/<strong>trends</strong>).</span></span></span><br></p>  <div><p>The following blog shows a detailed short example using PySpark in the context of the Online retail sales data <span color="#5040ae">[2]</span>. These are data that are arranged in column format, containing for example invoice number, invoice dates, quantity, price and product description. The chosen data serve as an example and the size would still work in Pandas for most single machine users, even though it would be slower.</p><p>The current blog does not provide a benchmark as done previously </p><p><span color="#5040ae">[1]</span>. It rather gives hands-on analytical steps with code (i.e., concatenate data, removal of data records, renaming columns, replacing strings, casting data types, creation of new features, filtering data). It therefore allows a first glimpse into the world of PySpark.<br></p></div>  <div id="863076632288984095"><div><p id="element-4a5854cd-f009-4c87-9cfd-85ac90227db3" data-platform-element-id="919380649307043755-1.0.0">
	

<h2>START PYSPARK &amp; IMPORT MODULES</h2>
</p>
</div></div>  <p>The Jupyter notebook file <em>PySpark-retaildata.ipynb</em>&nbsp; can be found at GitHub <span color="#5040ae">[3]</span>.<br>The notebook can be run in Google Colab. To install PySpark, type in the first cell <span color="#8d7824">!pip install pyspark</span> .<br></p>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/pyspark-install_orig.gif" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>An alternative is starting a Docker PySpark notebook <span color="#5040ae">[4]</span>.<br>After PySpark is installed and the Jupyter notebook is up and running, we first need to import the modules and create a Spark session:<br></p>      <p>Note that the Spark version used here is 2.4.5, which can be found by the command <span color="#8d7824">spark.version</span>. At the writing of this text, 3.0.0. is being released.<br></p>  <div id="540407624244840880"><div><p id="element-a3066edb-d72c-4553-8b52-740aa3d2f79d" data-platform-element-id="919380649307043755-1.0.0">
	

<h2>LOADING AND DISPLAYING THE DATA</h2>
</p>
</div></div>  <p>The Online retail data can be downloaded from the UCI machine learning repository <span color="#5040ae">[5]</span>. The data sheets should be converted to <em>online1.csv</em> and <em>online2.csv</em> to facilitate loading from disk. The command <span color="#8d7824">pwd</span> or <span color="#8d7824">os.getcwd()</span> can be used to find the current directory from which PySpark will load the files. Below it can be seen that PySpark only takes a couple of seconds whereas Pandas would take a couple of minutes on the same machine.<br></p>      <p><span size="2">Duration: 4.93 seconds</span><br></p>    <p><span size="2">Duration: 1.75 seconds</span><br></p>  <p>Size of the DataFrames (or shapes in terms of Pandas) can be obtained with the following code:<br></p>    <p>To have all the data together in one DataFrame, <em>df1</em> and <em>df2</em> will be concatenated vertically.<br></p>    <p>The following displays the first 5 rows. The command <span color="#8d7824">.limit(5)</span> will be used frequently throughout the text, which is comparable to the equivalent <span color="#8d7824">.head(5)</span> in Pandas, to set the number of rows that is displayed.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f1_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>This is the traditional Spark DataFrame output. By using the following setting we will get from now on a Pandas-like output.<br></p>    <p>A number of descriptive statistics can be obtained, like count, standard deviation, mean, minimum and maximum.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f2a_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>The table column <em>count</em> suggests that there are missing values in <em>Description</em> and <em>Customer ID</em>.

<h2>CHANGING NAME AND DATA TYPE</h2>
</p>
</div></div>  <p>The column name <em>Customer ID</em> contains an annoying white space that under certain circumstances can cause problems. So we should better rename that.<br></p>    <p>Further, the <em>Country</em> EIRE can be replaced by Ireland. The result can be verified by <span color="#8d7824">df.filter(df.Country == "Ireland").limit(5)</span><br></p>    <p>Information about the column type can be obtained. If you want some supplementary information,<span color="#8d7824"><span color="#2a2a2a"> an alternative command is</span></span> <span color="#8d7824">df.explain(df) </span>.<br></p>    <p><span size="2">StructType(List(StructField(Invoice,StringType,true),StructField(StockCode,StringType,true),StructField(Description,StringType,true),StructField(Quantity,IntegerType,true),StructField(InvoiceDate,StringType,true),StructField(Price,DoubleType,true),StructField(CustomerID,IntegerType,true),StructField(Country,StringType,true)))</span><br></p>  <p>Knowing the column types, we could now cast the column <em>Quantity</em> from integer to float.<br></p>    <p>The <em>InvoiceDate</em> shows up as a string. In order to exploit the time-related information, it would be best to convert it to date type. We will do this by creating a new column <em>n_InvoiceDate</em>.<br></p>    <p>Sorting the new dates, we can now display the number of records (rows) as a function of date and time.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f4_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>It is also possible to display a range of dates. The following spots all sales at&nbsp;15 Jan 2010 from 8 till 10 o'clock.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f5_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>    <p>Time-serie analyses often require different units, like seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. For example, if we would like to display the sales per week, we could use the function <span color="#8d7824">weekofyear</span> that translates the date to week.<br></p>    <p>Multiple columns can be used in a computation. The total <em>Amount</em> a customer spent can be computed by multiplication of the <em>Price</em> of a single product with its <em>Quantity</em>.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f6_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>    <p>How to select rows with specific products? We can use the command <span color="#8d7824">isin</span>, which is very similar to the Pandas isin function:<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f7_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>If we want to search our data by key word, we would use the command <span color="#8d7824">like</span>.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f8_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>To find big buyers, probably organizational customers, select rows where <em>Quantity</em> is larger than 50000. Note that <span color="#8d7824">df.where(df.Quantity &gt; 50000)</span> would give a similar result.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f9_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Let us count the number of data records per country and sort the output, which shows that UK is clearly leading the list.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f10_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p><span color="#8d7824">Sort</span> can be used for <em>InvoiceDate</em> as well. This can show which hours customers purchase preferentially.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f11_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>    <p>Luckily, Spark supports SQL - Structured Query Language - which traditionally has an important role in managing relational databases. Using for example SQL queries, a subset of the data can be exported to CRM and KPI sales software. This offers a lot of flexibility for data analyses. Let us experiment with some very useful SQL queries, such as select and filter. We first need to register the DataFrame as a temporary table in the SQLContext. <br></p>    <p>We first select a couple of columns, for example <em>Description</em> and <em>Quantity</em>. If you want to select all columns, simply use the star: <span color="#8d7824">spark.sql("select * from df").show(5)</span><br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f12_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Select the columns <em>Description</em> and <em>Quantity</em> and only those rows where <em>Quantity</em> has value = 6<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f13_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Select the columns <em>Description</em>, <em>Quantity</em>, and <em>Country</em> where <em>Quantity</em> has value = 6 and <em>country</em> is United Kingdom.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f14_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>SQL can also be used to show distinct (unique) values in a column. To limit space, only five are displayed here.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f15_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>And we can count the number of distinct values, that is how many countries are in total in the data.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f16_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Using SQL we can also exclude certain values. For example, exclude all records with United Kingdom.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f17_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>It would be possible to add a new column that categorizes UK (1) or not-UK (0). You could then use <span color="#8d7824">df.filter(df.Country == "United Kingdom").limit(5)</span> and <span color="#8d7824">filter(df.Country == "France").limit(5)</span> to check if the column is correctly coding UK versus not-UK.<br></p>    <p>Next, we could count UK versus not-UK using the new column <em>Country_UK</em>.<br></p>    <p>And compute mean <em>Amount</em> and summed <em>Quantity</em>.<br></p>      <div><p>That is it for now! In the current blog I have chosen to write out the code line by line. The code can of course be wrapped in several functions with the advantage that it can be used as a pre-processing script for different datasets, where you can set your own parameters. Further, smaller subsets of data can easily be exported and visualized in for ex. Plotly.</p><p>There are many other exciting features and developments in Spark:<br>1. Koalas is a Pandas API in Apache Spark, with similar capabilities but in a big data environment. This is particularly good news for people who already work in Pandas and need a quick translation to PySpark of their code.<br>2. Pandas UDF is a new feature that allows parallel processing on Pandas DataFrames.<br>3. There are excellent solutions using PySpark in the cloud. For example, AWS has big data platforms such as Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) that support PySpark.<br>4. Spark streaming allows real-time data analysis.<br>5.

July 21, 2020 | https://free.cofree.io/2020/07/20/perform-io/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://free.cofree.io/2020/07/20/perform-io/">archive.org</a>

        <p>Side effects break referential transparency. If you have a function <code>f</code> which has a pure type but performs
side effects behind closed doors (e.g., <code>f x = unsafePerformIO ...</code>), you’d have to be careful when refactoring the
code. You may want to, for instance, avoid changing <code>f x + f x</code> into <code>let y = f x in y + y</code>.</p>

<p>But even if you never make such substitutions yourself, the compiler may decide to step in and
do it for you. This post summarizes circumstances in which GHC may perform
optimizations that could change the behavior of your program, in the presence of non-referentially transparent
functions like <code>unsafePerformIO</code>, <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code>, and <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code>. Hopefully this
helps you understand how to safely use them if you absolutely must do so.</p>

<p>By the way, the reason the title specifically features <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is twofold:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is the least safe of the three. Therefore, most if not all what
 I’m about to say that applies to <code>unsafePerformIO</code> and <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> is also applicable to <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code>.</li>
  <li><code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is such a priceless name and I just couldn’t help myself.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here’s some useful background before we dive into the details. Some of the things GHC can do that alter the behaviors of
side-effectful functions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Common subexpression elimination (CSE). CSE rewrites <code>f x + f x</code> into <code>let y = f x in y + y</code>, which may decrease
the number of times side effects are performed. CSE is turned on by default when compiling with <code>-O</code> and <code>-O2</code>, and can be
disabled with the <code>-fno-cse</code> flag.</li>
  <li>Full laziness optimization. The definition of full laziness is “every expression is evaluated at most once after the variables in
it have been bound”. This is achieved by floating bindings out of lambdas, for example, <code>f x = let y = g 42 in x + y</code>
is rewritten into <code>y = g 42; f x = x + y</code>. By floating <code>y = g 42</code> out of <code>f</code>, <code>g 42</code> is evaluated
at most once, which may also decrease the number of times side effects are performed. The original definition, on the other
hand, would evaluate <code>g 42</code> every time <code>f</code> is applied to an <code>x</code>. Full laziness is also turned on when compiling with <code>-O</code> and <code>-O2</code>, and can be
disabled with the <code>-fno-full-laziness</code> flag.</li>
  <li>Inlining. This has the opposite outcome with respect to side effects: inlining a side-effectful definition may cause
the side effect to be performed more times compared to not inlining it.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth mentioning that these three things don’t act independently, but are related and sometimes interact with one another
in ways that can be really subtle, as the examples that follow shall demonstrate.</p>

<p>About the three unsafe functions covered in this post:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>unsafePerformIO</code> is the most well-known, and is relatively the safest, but the slowest of the three.</li>
  <li><code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> is faster but also less safe, in the sense that it provides
no guarantee that an <code>IO</code> action won’t be performed simultaneously by multiple threads.</li>
  <li><code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> (from the <code>bytestring</code> package) is even faster but much less safe. Not
only does it not check for duplicates, but it inlines everything, which makes CSE a lot more likely to
be triggered. It used to be called <code>inlinePerformIO</code>, but <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is an undeniably more
advisable name.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the following examples assume GHC 8.10.1 and <code>-O2</code>.</p>



<p>Let’s start with something simple:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>x</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>hasSideEffect 0</code> is obviously a common subexpression in the body of <code>main</code>. It would be factored out if CSE
is turned on, meaning “side effect!” would only be printed once. Passing <code>-fno-cse</code> to GHC makes it print twice.</p>

<p>Note that it doesn’t matter if <code>hasSideEffect</code> is inlined or not. <code>hasSideEffect 0</code> is a common subexpression
in either case.</p>



<p>The following example demonstrates the effect of the full laziness optimization:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>x</span>

<span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>f</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>g</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>let</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span>
             <span>in</span> <span>if</span> <span>y</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>0</span> <span>else</span> <span>g</span> <span>(</span><span>y</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span>
   <span>in</span> <span>g</span> <span>5</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The full laziness optimization causes “side effect!” to be only printed once. Although the value of
<code>n = hasSideEffect x</code> is used five times when evaluating <code>g 5</code>, <code>n</code> is only evaluated once, because
it is floated out of the body of <code>g</code>. If we disable full-laziness by passing <code>-fno-full-laziness</code>, you’d
see “side effect!” printed five times.</p>

<p>In this example there’s no common subexpression to eliminate, so disabling CSE has no effect.</p>



<p>Inlining, on the contrary, can increase the number of times a side effect is performed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>42</span>
<span>{-# NOINLINE hasSideEffect #-}</span>

<span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>y</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program prints “side effect!” once, which is usually what you want for having a constant value defined using <code>unsafePerformIO</code>.
Turning off CSE and/or full laziness does not change the behavior. If you change <code>{-# NOINLINE hasSideEffect #-}</code> to
<code>{-# INLINE hasSideEffect #-}</code>, then “side effect!” would be printed twice: once when evaluating <code>x</code> and once for <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>When there is neither an <code>INLINE</code> nor a <code>NOINLINE</code> pragma, GHC doesn’t seem to like inlining constants. It is, however, free
to do so. For constants that contain side effects, such as <code>hasSideEffect</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in the above example, it is
therefore almost always advisable to apply the <code>NOINLINE</code> pragma. In fact, HLint warns
against missing <code>NOINLINE</code> pragmas for constants defined using <code>unsafePerformIO</code>s. This advice, of course, isn’t
applicable to functions with <code>unsafePerformIO</code>s in their bodies. For a function like <code>f x = unsafePerformIO (... x ...)</code>, the
side effect needs to be performed whenever <code>f</code> is applied to an <code>x</code>, so it may as well be inlined.</p>



<p>Consider this program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>x</span>

<span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>f</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>g</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>y</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span>
      <span>{-# INLINE g #-}</span>
   <span>in</span> <span>g</span> <span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>g</span> <span>1</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program prints “side effect!” just once, whether <code>g</code> is inlined or not inlined. In order to make “side effect!”
print twice, you need to disable CSE if <code>g</code> is inlined, but disable
full laziness if <code>g</code> is not inlined. Let’s study why this is the case.</p>

<p>If <code>g</code> is inlined, <code>g 0 + g 1</code> becomes</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>hasSideEffect x</code> is a common subexpression, so it is factored out by CSE, causing “side effect!” to be printed
just once. In this case the inlining happened in a simplifier pass before the full laziness pass (which can be
observed from the output of <code>-dshow-passes</code>), and therefore, the full laziness pass didn’t have the opportunity
to float <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code> out of <code>g</code> before <code>g</code> was inlined. This is why turning off
full laziness has no effect, but turning off CSE does.</p>

<p>If <code>g</code> is not inlined, on the other hand, there would be no common subexpression to eliminate.
Instead, the full laziness pass would float <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code> out of <code>g</code>. This is why turning off
CSE has no effect, but turning off full laziness does.</p>

<p>It is also possible to make it so that <em>both</em> <code>-fno-cse</code> and <code>-fno-full-laziness</code> are needed in order for
“side effect!” to be printed twice. For example, try <code>{-# NOINLINE [2] g #-}</code>. This is because</p>
<ul>
  <li>If full-laziness is turned on, <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code> would be floated out of <code>g</code> <em>before</em> inlining (because we told
GHC to avoid inlining until after phase 2, which comes after the full laziness pass). After <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code>
is floated out, it would <em>not</em> subsequently be inlined, and therefore “side effect!” is only printed once.</li>
  <li>If CSE is turned on, it would happen <em>after</em> inlining. Since inlining enables CSE to “see” the common
subexpression <code>hasSideEffect x</code>, it is factored out, and therefore “side effect!” is only printed once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simply put, in this case inlining happens after the full-laziness pass but before the CSE pass, and this means
you need to turn them both off for the side effect to be performed twice.</p>

<p>This example shows that the interaction between CSE, full-laziness and inlining can be subtle. If your
program uses <code>unsafePerformIO</code> or similar unsafe functions, the simplest way to ensure that the behavior is easily predictable
is to either <code>NOINLINE</code> everything and turn off both CSE and full-laziness, or compile the program with <code>-O0</code>.
You don’t really want to do either of them because they both kill performance, so it really pays to understand the nuances so that you lose as little performance as possible while ensuring the program behaves as expected.</p>



<p>Using <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> instead of <code>unsafePerformIO</code> is another way to potentially make an IO action
perform more times than intended. This is slightly off topic since it is about concurrency rather than GHC modifying
your program, but since <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> falls in between the relatively safe <code>unsafePerformIO</code> and the
extremely unsafe <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code>, I reckon it is worth mentioning.</p>

<p>A thunk is usually evaluated only once. When a thread attempts to force a thunk, and that thunk is already being
evaluated by another thread, the first thread would usually block rather than evaluating the thunk again. This is
achieved using a technique called <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/2005-haskell.pdf">blackholing</a>.
Blackholing is by default lazy, but an eager option is possible via flag <code>-feager-blackholing</code>, which guarantees
that no thunk is evaluated more than once (with a slight performance penalty).</p>

<p>If a thunk is built using <code>unsafePerformIO</code>, then even if the thunk is evaluated by more than one thread
in parallel, the IO …</p></div></div>

GPT-3 is a natural language model that, given some examples, tries to predict appropriate text output for a given text input. Since code is just text, there's the question of whether it can be used to produce code based only on a description of what the code should do. And, amazing world that we live in, there are already some early<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 49 --> <!-- /react-text --><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" data-reactid="50">tech demos</a><!-- react-text: 51 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 52 -->of exactly that.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="54">A common off-the-cuff reaction to such demos is that this sort of technology will inevitably make Software Engineers obsolete, because if an AI can produce more or less what they produce, then seemingly we won't need to pay them to do it anymore.</p><p data-reactid="55">The reasoning for these kinds of claims is understandable. If your premise is that a Software Engineer's job is to take a description of what some software should do, and write code to implement that, then it makes sense to view technology like this as a drop-in replacement.</p><p data-reactid="56">But that's not right. What a Software Engineer really does is build software solutions to solve problems appropriately. That seems like a subtle distinction, but it's a really important one. Code is not the solution, it's the implementation of a solution. The solution certainly requires that code be written, hence the ability to write code. But going the other direction, the ability to write code does not imply the ability to create appropriate solutions to problems.</p><p data-reactid="57">I think because writing code is intrinsically a difficult skill which is opaque and unfamiliar to outsiders, it appears like the hard part of building software is in fact writing code. But it really isn't, and that's the point. The hard part is solving the problem appropriately. Implementing that solution in code once you have it is comparatively easy.</p><p data-reactid="58">This is counter-intuitive, and I don't think it's something that can be fully appreciated without having gone through the process of building software yourself. Without this insight, it does indeed seem like an AI writing code opens up the possibility of generalists building software, just by describing their ideas. But that's no more true than saying that hiring a skilled ghost writer opens up the possibility for anybody with a story idea to write a great novel.</p><p data-reactid="60">So, I understand the basis of these claims from an outsider's perspective. They are reasonable given the premises they're based on. What does surprise me a bit, though, is the common rebuttals that seem to come up from insiders - Software Engineers themselves.</p><p data-reactid="61">There are two main forms. The first is "this will never work": pointing out all the technical difficulties of such a thing in practice. The other is "it's all just code anyway": the notion that the natural language description of any software past a certain point of complexity would have to be structured and formalised to the extent that it basically becomes code.</p><p data-reactid="62"><!-- react-text: 63 -->I find these rebuttals surprising not because they're necessarily wrong. They're actually very practical - the thing has to basically work before the rest of the conversation is relevant, after all, and we're still a very long way from that. I find them surprising more just because they meet the claims at their own level, seeming to implicitly accept their premise. They say "this is wrong because AI won't be able to meaningfully write code" rather than "this is wrong because when AI<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 64 --> <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="65">can</span><!-- react-text: 66 --> meaningfully write code, far from making Software Engineers obsolete, it will help them".<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="67">The reason I'd expect more Software Engineers to hold the latter view is because there's really nothing new here. I guess using AI to produce code looks like some giant leap at first glance, but it's really more a linear progression of something that's been happening in the software industry since day one - using software to automate writing software. Tools and frameworks that improve efficiency in building software by automating more and more of the heavy lifting are something that every Software Engineer is familiar with, and it's understood that they're unequivocally a good thing. Why should an AI writing code be any different?</p><p data-reactid="68">Furthermore, it's established at this point that such tools do not lead to less need for Software Engineers, because there is not a fixed limit of demand for software to be built. Rather, they allow more and better software to be built faster, opening new opportunities to apply software solutions where they weren't previously economical, growing the software industry and actually increasing the value of the skillset needed to build software, which again, is not the same thing as the ability to write code.</p><p data-reactid="70">Software Engineers should welcome every advancement that brings forward AI tools that assist in writing larger and more meaningful parts of our code. This isn't something to resist, but something to push forward, because far from making Software Engineers obsolete, these tools will further leverage the skills they have that are most valuable.</p><p data-reactid="71">And come on, who likes typing anyway?</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

        <p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/create-word-document-in-r.png?w=640" alt="create word document in r" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>



<h2><strong>Reading and creating word documents in R</strong></h2>
<p>In this post we’ll talk about how to use R to read and create word files.  We’ll primarily be using R’s <strong>officer</strong> package.  <a href="http://theautomatic.net/2019/10/14/how-to-read-word-documents-with-python/">For reading data from Word Documents with Python, click here.</a></p>
<h2><strong>Creating Word reports with the officer package</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to install the <strong>officer</strong> package.</p>
<pre title="">
install.packages("officer")

</pre>
<p>We’ll also be using the <strong>dplyr</strong> package, so you’ll need to install that the same way if you don’t have it already.  Next, let’s load each of these packages.</p>
<pre title="">
library(officer)
library(dplyr)

</pre>
<p>Now, we’ll get started creating a report!  First, we will use the <strong>read_docx</strong> function to create an empty Word file.</p>
<pre title="">
# create empty Word file
sample_doc &lt;- read_docx()

</pre>
<h3><strong>Adding paragraphs</strong></h3>
<p>Next, let’s add a few sample paragraphs.  We can do that using the <strong>body_add_par</strong> function like below.  The syntax is similar to that of the <strong>tidyverse</strong>.</p>
<pre title="">
sample_doc &lt;- sample_doc %&gt;% body_add_par("This is the first paragraph") 
sample_doc &lt;- sample_doc %&gt;% body_add_par("This is the second paragraph")
sample_doc &lt;- sample_doc %&gt;% body_add_par("This is the third paragraph")

</pre>
<p>Now, we can add a table to our document using the <strong>body_add_table</strong> function.  Before we do that, we just need to have a data frame ready, so we’ll create a sample one like below.</p>
<pre title="">
# create sample data frame
df &lt;- data.frame(a = 1:10, b = 11:20, c= 21:30)

# add table containing the data frame's contents
sample_doc &lt;- sample_doc %&gt;% body_add_table(df, style = "table_template")

</pre>
<h3><strong>Adding images to the document</strong></h3>
<p>We can also add images to our Word Document.  This is done by creating a temp file with an R plot and then adding the image to our document object. Though we’re using base R for plotting here, <strong>ggplot</strong> could also be used.</p>
<pre title="">
set.seed(0)

# create a temp file
src &lt;- tempfile(fileext = ".png")

# create PNG object
png(filename = src, width = 4, height = 4, units = 'in', res = 400)

# create plot
plot(sample(100, 10))

# save PNG file
dev.off()

# add PNG image to Word document
sample_doc &lt;- sample_doc %&gt;% body_add_img(src = src, width = 4, height = 4, style = "centered")

</pre>
<p>Lastly, we can save our Word Document using <strong>print</strong>.</p>
<pre title="">
print(sample_doc, target = "sample_file.docx")

</pre>
<h3><strong>How to modify existing Word Documents</strong></h3>
<p>To modify existing Word Documents, all we need to change is to input the filename into <strong>read_docx</strong>.  Then, we can continue modifying our Word Document object like we were previously.</p>
<pre title="">
sample_doc &lt;- read_docx("sample_file.docx")

# add another paragraph
sample_doc &lt;- sample_doc %&gt;% body_add_par("This is another paragraph")

</pre>
<h2><strong>How to read Word Documents with R</strong></h2>
<p>What if we want to read in the Word Document we just created?  We can do that using the same <strong>read_docx</strong> function like we did above to modify an existing file.  Secondly, we use the <strong>docx_summary</strong> with this object to get the content within the file.</p>
<pre title="">
sample_data &lt;- read_docx("sample_file.docx")

content &lt;- docx_summary(sample_data)

</pre>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/read-word-document-in-r.png?w=640" alt="read word file in r" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><strong>docx_summary</strong> returns a dataframe with the content in the Word file, as can be seen above.  For example, to get the text in the paragraph of the document, we just need to filter the content_type field on “paragraph”, like below:</p>
<pre title="">
paragraphs &lt;- content %&gt;% filter(content_type == "paragraph")
paragraphs$text

</pre>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/docx_summary-in-r.png?w=640" alt="docx_summary function in r" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h3><strong>Extracting tables from Word Documents</strong></h3>
<p>Now, let’s extract the table from our document.  We can do this similarly to the above in that we just need to filter content_type for “table cell”:</p>
<pre title="">
content %&gt;% filter(content_type == "table cell")

</pre>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/extract-table-from-word-document-in-r.png?w=640" alt="read table from word document with r" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>As you can see, the table’s columns are stacked in a single column.  We need to do a little transformation to get this result into the needed format.</p>
<pre title="">

table_cells &lt;- content %&gt;% filter(content_type == "table cell")
table_data &lt;- table_cells %&gt;% filter(!is_header) %&gt;% select(row_id, cell_id, text)

# split data into individual columns
splits &lt;- split(table_data, table_data$cell_id)
splits &lt;- lapply(splits, function(x) x$text)

# combine columns back together in wide format
table_result &lt;- bind_cols(splits)

  <p>Instead of using Docker CLI commands - we can communicate with Docker registry with GET/POST methods of Docker Registry HTTP API.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most harmful behaviors I’ve observed in ineffective leadership is a tendency to add chaos when one enters a room. Chaos comes in many flavors: A decision was reached about an important architecture question weeks ago, but someone suddenly insists that you revisit the project’s fundamental goals at the 11th hour. An executive insists that their project is most important, and pushes it onto the roadmap. Or maybe you leave a productive meeting without concrete next steps, and are right back where you started in a week.</p>

<h3 id="great-leaders-vacuum-up-chaos">Great leaders vacuum up chaos</h3>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/chaos/tasmanian-devil.jpg" alt="Tasmanian devil going crazy">
Nobody is excited when this guy enters the room</p>

<p>My litmus test for effective leadership: any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. Good leaders can walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and get everyone aligned on a clear path forward. They remove unimportant details, distill complex situations to their essence, and get the right decision-maker to make a call – even if it’s not them. They’re able to not only stop bad plans before it’s too late, but get them moving again in the right direction.</p>

<p>Usually, chaos-causing behavior is unintentional and comes from a good place. Often people are just missing context, or haven’t developed a rhythm for making sure that projects and plans stay organized. In rare cases, it can arise for less savory reasons: someone wants to flex on others by diverting a conversation to a favorite topic or forcing a change of plans.</p>

<h3 id="be-a-source-of-stability">Be a source of stability</h3>

<p>I’ve been guilty of causing my share of unnecessary chaos, and have always regretted it. However, I was fortunate enough to also have a number of teammates who weren’t shy about calling me out for this over the years. I’ve since built a grab bag of practices on how to be better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strive for measurable outcomes, and frequently reinforce the goals of what you’re working on even if it’s repetitive. For example, if you’re trying to increase conversions from your login page, be clear about why this is important and how you’ll measure success.</li>
  <li><a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/05/05/Running-Meetings.html">Insist that all meetings have agendas</a>. Don’t overthink this – a single bullet like “decide what color to make the login button” is fine. A shocking proportion of seemingly simple meetings will wander without this, and it only takes 30 seconds. Don’t let people waste your time, or their own.</li>
  <li>Confirm in-person decisions that were complicated, non-intuitive, or contentious in writing: “We decided the login button should be neon pink so that it really stands out from the blue page background.”</li>
  <li>Use documents for complex decisions. It’s easier to catch when a document is off-track, because unlike a conversation you can see the entire arc of the discussion at once. The decision to make the login button pink should live in a document or ticket.</li>
  <li>When in doubt, over-communicate. Say what you’re planning to do next, so that work doesn’t get duplicated: “I’m going to add this decision on the login button to our design document.” If you’re not going to do something, confirm that as well: “I’m not going to update our design mockups, so if anyone thinks that we’ll need that, speak up now.”</li>
  <li>Avoid using power or appeals to authority to sidestep teams’ processes for prioritization. This is important for teams that you manage, and especially important when working with other teams. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Good lightweight processes</a> are one of the best ways to add efficiency to a team, and breaking them is akin to removing the oil from your car. If you must break processes, make sure to explain why.</li>
  <li>If a plan seems strange, ask questions to understand “why” before asking anyone to change the course of action. If you think that you’re going to need to ask someone to change plans, try to ask at least one extra clarifying question or wait 5 minutes longer in the conversation before reacting.</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly: <em>The fancier your title, the more you must avoid causing chaos</em>. If Bob the Intern frantically flip-flops on the plan for his summer project, people will patiently help him towards a good path and perhaps make sure he has less caffeine tomorrow. If Bob the CEO flip-flops on his strategy, people will capsize the ship trying to enact his will. Remove chaos and you and your team will be happier and more successful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/all%20together%20now_wide.jpg" alt="Grafana, InfluxDB and CollectD"></p><h4 id="for-some-companies-infrastructure-is-the-heart-of-its-business-specifically-i-am-referring-to-those-companies-which-need-to-manage-data-and-applications-located-on-more-than-one-server">For some companies, infrastructure is the heart of its business. Specifically, I am referring to those companies which need to manage data and applications located on more than one server.</h4><p>It is essential for a company to monitor its infrastructure nodes, especially if the company does not have on-site access to intervene when issues arise. In fact, the intensive use of some resources can be an indication of malfunctioning or overcrowding. However, in addition to prevention, monitoring could be used to assess possible implications of new software in the production environment. Currently, there are several “ready-to-use” solutions on the market to keep track of all the resources consumed. These solutions, which appear reasonable, present two key problems: the high price of setup and security issues related to third parties.</p><p>The first problem is related to cost. Prices vary from 10 euros per month up to thousands depending on how many hosts you need to monitor — with the former being consumer pricing and the latter being enterprise pricing. So, for example, let’s imagine that I have three nodes to monitor during the course of a year. At 10 euros per month, I would spend 120 euros. For smaller enterprises, where the price can range between 10,000 and 20,000 euro per year, such an expense can bloat its underlying cost structure and become financially untenable.</p><p>The second problem is third party risk. Typically, infrastructure data must pass through a third party company in order to be seen and analysed for the customer — whether that be an individual consumer or an enterprise. How does the third party company capture the data and then present it to the customer? Simply put, the third party company often collects data through a custom agent that is installed onto a node and monitored. Quite often is it found that this installation is not up-to-date and compatible with operating systems. Previous work has been done by security researchers who cast light upon problems with <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/misc/nagios_nrpe_arguments">“proprietary collectors”</a>. Would you trust them? I would not.</p><p>In keeping nodes for both <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide">Tor</a> and some <a href="https://getmonero.org/">cryptocurrencies</a>, I prefer to opt for a cost free, easy to configure, and open-source alternative. Here, we will use the triad: Grafana, InfluxDB, and CollectD.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-graphs.png" alt="An example of a Grafana dashboard"></p><h2 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h2><p>In order to be able to analyse every metric of our infrastructure, it is necessary to use a program capable of capturing statistics on the machines we want to monitor. In this regard, <a href="https://collectd.org/">CollectD</a> comes to your aid: it is a daemon that groups and collects (hence the name) all the parameters that can be stored on disk or sent over the network.</p><p>The data will be transmitted to an instance of <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>: a particular time series database that associates to each data the time (coded in UNIX timestamp) in which the server received it. In this way, the data sent by CollectD will already be set in a temporal way, as a succession of events.</p><p>Finally, you will use <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> which will connect to InfluxDB to create flashy dashboards to display the data in a user-friendly way. Through histograms and graphs of every kind, it will be possible to observe in real time all the data related to CPU, RAM, etc.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-diagram.png" alt="Grafana infrastructure"></p><h2 id="influxdb">InfluxDB</h2><picture>

InfluxDB is a time series database <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb">open-source</a> developed in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> to store data as a sequence of events.</p><p>Each time data is added, it is linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">a UNIX timestamp</a> by default. This allows enormous flexibility for the user who no longer has to worry about saving, as an example, the “time” variable, which is sometimes cumbersome to configure. Let’s imagine we have several machines located in a number of continents. How do we manage the “time” variable? Do we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">Greenwich</a> meridian for all the data? Or do we set a different time zone for each node? If data is saved on different time zones, how can we accurately display the graphs? As you can see, this can be very complicated.</p><p>As a time-aware database that automatically timestamps any data point, InfluxDB has the advantage of simultaneously being able to write to a certain database. This is why we often imagine InfluxDB as a timeline. Writing data does not affect the performance of the database (as sometimes happens in MySQL), since writing is simply the addition of a certain event to the timeline. The name of the program derives precisely from the conception of time as an infinite and indefinite “flow” that flows.</p><h3 id="installation-and-configuration">Installation and configuration</h3><p>Another advantage of InflxuDB is the <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/introduction/install/">ease of installation</a> and the extensive <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/">documentation</a> provided by the community that widely supports the project. It has two types of interfaces: via <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/tools/shell/">Command Line</a> (which is powerful and flexible for developers, but poorly prepared to see large amounts of data) and an <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/guides/write_data/#sidebar">HTTP API</a> that allows direct communication with the database.</p><p>InfluxDB can be downloaded not only from the official website, but also from the package manager of the distribution (in this example we use a Debian system). It is advisable to check the package via GPG before installation, so (below) we import the keys of the InfluxDB package:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="24564b4b50644a4b4041">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -

InfluxDB uses a particular query language called <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/">“InfluxQL”</a>, similar to SQL, which allows you to interact with the database. To create a new entry, we use the query <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/authentication_and_authorization/#user-management-commands"><code>CREATE USER</code></a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="a8dac7c7dce8c6c7cccd">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: influx

You also need to download and place the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collectd/collectd/master/src/types.db">types.db</a> file in <code>/usr/share/collectd/</code> (or any other folder) to define the data that <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/supported_protocols/collectd/">CollectD sends in native format</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d2a0bdbda692bcbdb6b7">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: nano /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf

By default, CollectD captures metrics on CPU, RAM, memory (on disk), network interfaces, processes, etc. The potential of the program is endless, given that it can be extended with a preinstalled <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins">plugin enablement</a> or through the <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Roadmap#Wishlist_.2F_Ideas">creation of new ones</a>.</p><p>As you can see, installing CollectD is simple:</p><p>In a simplistic manner, let’s illustrate how CollectD works. Suppose that I want to check how many processes my node has. In doing so, CollectD does nothing more than make an API call to get the number of processes per time unit (defined as 5000 ms, by default). Once captured, the data will be sent to InfluxDB via a module (called “Network”) to be configured.</p><p>Open the file <code>/etc/collectd.conf</code> with our editor, scroll to find the <code>Network</code> section, and edit as written in the following snippet. Be sure to specify the IP where the interface of InfluxDB (<code>INFLUXDB_IP</code>) is located.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d9abb6b6ad99b7b6bdbc">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: nano /etc/collectd.conf

  &lt;Server <span>"INFLUXDB_IP"</span> <span>"24589"</span>&gt;
  &lt;/Server&gt;
  ReportStats true
&lt;/Plugin&gt;
    ...</code></pre></div><p>My suggestion is to modify, within the configuration, the hostname that is sent to InfluxDB (which in our infrastructure is a “centralized” database, since it resides on a single node). In doing so, the data will not be redundant and there is no risk that other nodes will overwrite the information.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/tres_caballeros.jpg" alt="Three daemon"></p><h2 id="grafana">Grafana</h2><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana_alone.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>A graph is worth thousand of images</p></blockquote><p>In remembrance of this famous “quote”, observing the infrastructure metrics live through graphs and tables enables us to act in an efficient and timely manner. To create and configure the dashboard, we will use Grafana.</p><p>Grafana is an open-source tool, compatible with a wide range of databases (including InfluxDB), that presents a graphical representation of metrics and allows a user to create alerts if a particular piece of data meets a condition. For example, if your CPU reaches high peaks, you can be notified on Slack, Mattermost, by email, etc. In fact, I have personally configured an alert every time someone enters SSH, so I can actively monitor who “enters” my infrastructure.</p><p>Grafana does not require any special settings: once again, it is InfluxDB that “scans” the “time” variable. The integration is simple. Let’s start by import the public key to add the package from the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/download">Grafana official website</a> (it depends on the OS you are using):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="84f6ebebf0c4eaebe0e1">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

<div><p>A command pattern that I’ve used in multiple projects is an event-loop sidecar. The sidecar runs on it’s own thread and
does asynchronous IO; thereby increasing the responsiveness of the system which could be doing IO/CPU bound work. The
application (running on the main thread) interfaces with the sidecar through a synchronous API.</p><p>
There are multiple caveats to this pattern. With python’s GIL, the sidecar should strictly be doing I/O to ensure that
the pattern has the desired effects. If you have a CPU bound sidecar, you’ll end up with an architecture which performs
worse than a single threaded job.</p><p>
Setting up such a sidecar takes some time to get used to, but is easier in python 3.7+:</p></div>

<p>The code takes getting used to. Hopefully the comments help in exposition. To be honest, in an earlier version,
we just let the application crash on socket errors without cleaning up. This led to gnarly memory issues, especially if
you have a long running job which reintializes this pattern. This <code>exit protocol</code> to close the resource properly took
multiple iterations, but now has been perfected:</p>

<p>Every article on <code>asyncio</code> will advice you to close the thread and clean up pending tasks. But not article will tell you
that closing the thread will almost never work and end up with hard to debug errors. It took me a lot of head wrangling
to figure out the right protocol to correctly close a sidecar thread which uses an event loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop processing new messages on the sidecar.</li>
<li>Close the websocket connection, you will have to busy loop in order to do so.</li>
<li>Close the loop and clear pending tasks.</li>
<li>Join with the sidecar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Missing any one of these steps is a path to an endless pit of <em>wats</em>. Especially the first two steps, which are taken
granted in languages which support such idioms out of the box like Java.</p>

<p>Either you’ve already heard of <code>pandoc</code> or if you have searched online for <code>markdown</code> to <code>pdf</code> or similar, you are sure to come across <code>pandoc</code>. This tutorial will help you use <code>pandoc</code> to generate <code>pdf</code> and <code>epub</code> from a <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub style markdown</a> file. The main motivation for this blog post is to highlight what customizations I did to generate <code>pdf</code> and <code>epub</code> versions for <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/books/">self-publishing my ebooks</a>. It wasn’t easy to arrive at the set-up I ended up with, so I hope this will be useful for those looking to use <code>pandoc</code> to generate <code>pdf</code> and <code>epub</code> formats. This guide is specifically aimed at technical books that has code snippets.</p>



<h2 id="installation"><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>

<p>I use Ubuntu, as far as I remember, the below steps are enough to work for the demos in this tutorial. If you get an error or warning, search that issue online and you’ll likely find what else has to be installed.</p>

<p>I first downloaded <code>deb</code> file from <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases">pandoc: releases</a> and installed it. Followed by packages needed for <code>pdf</code> generation.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span># latest pandoc version as of 21 July 2010 is 2.10</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>gdebi ~/Downloads/pandoc-2.10-1-amd64.deb

<span>$ </span><span># note that download size is 750+ MB</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>texlive-xetex
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>librsvg2-bin
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>texlive-math-extra
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more details and guide for other OS, refer to <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">pandoc: installation</a></p>



<h2 id="minimal-example"><a name="minimal-example"></a>Minimal example</h2>

<p>Once <code>pandoc</code> is working on your system, try generating a sample <code>pdf</code> without any customization.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/learnbyexample.github.io/tree/master/files/pandoc_pdf">learnbyexample.github.io repo</a> for all the input and output files referred in this tutorial.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pandoc sample_1.md <span>-f</span> gfm <span>-o</span> sample_1.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here <code>sample_1.md</code> is input markdown file and <code>-f</code> is used to specify that the input format is GitHub style markdown. The <code>-o</code> option specifies the output file type based on extension. The default output is probably good enough. But I wished to customize hyperlinks, inline code style, add page breaks between chapters, etc. This blog post will discuss these customizations one by one.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> <code>pandoc</code> has its own flavor of <code>markdown</code> with many useful extensions — see <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">pandoc: pandocs-markdown</a> for details. GitHub style markdown is recommended if you wish to use the same source (or with minor changes) in multiple places.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> It is advised to use <code>markdown</code> headers in order without skipping — for example, <code>H1</code> for chapter heading and <code>H2</code> for chapter sub-section, etc is fine. <code>H1</code> for chapter heading and <code>H3</code> for sub-section is not. Using the former can give automatic index navigation on ebook readers.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Evince</a> reader, the index navigation for above sample looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/chapter_index.png" alt="Chapter Index"></p>



<h2 id="chapter-breaks"><a name="chapter-breaks"></a>Chapter breaks</h2>

<p>As observed from previous demo, by default there are no chapter breaks. Searching for a <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/601469/getting-chapters-to-start-on-a-new-page-in-a-pandoc-generated-pdf">solution online</a>, I got this piece of <code>tex</code> code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>sectsty<span>}</span>
<span>\sectionfont</span><span>{</span><span>\clearpage</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be added using <code>-H</code> option. From <code>pandoc</code> manual,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-H FILE, –include-in-header=FILE</p>

  <p>Include  contents  of FILE, verbatim, at the end of the header.  This
can be used, for example, to include special  CSS  or  JavaScript  in
HTML documents.  This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple
files in the header.  They will be included in the  order  specified.
Implies –standalone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>pandoc</code> invocation now looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pandoc sample_1.md <span>-f</span> gfm <span>-H</span> chapter_break.tex <span>-o</span> sample_1_chapter_break.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can add further customization to headings, for example use <code>\sectionfont{\underline\clearpage}</code> to underline chapter names or <code>\sectionfont{\LARGE\clearpage}</code> to allow chapter names to get even bigger. Here’s some more links to read about various customizations:</p>

<ul>

</ul>



<h2 id="changing-settings-via--v-option"><a name="changing-settings-via--v-option"></a>Changing settings via -V option</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>-V KEY[=VAL], –variable=KEY[:VAL]</p>

  <p>Set the template variable KEY to the value  VAL  when  rendering  the
document  in standalone mode.  This is generally only useful when the
–template option is used to specify a custom template, since  pandoc
automatically  sets  the variables used in the default templates.  If
no VAL is specified, the key will be given the value true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>-V</code> option allows to change variable values to customize settings like page size, font, link color, etc. As more settings are changed, better to use a simple script to call <code>pandoc</code> instead of typing the whole command on terminal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

pandoc <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-f</span> gfm <span>\</span>
    <span>--include-in-header</span> chapter_break.tex <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> linkcolor:blue <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> geometry:a4paper <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> geometry:margin<span>=</span>2cm <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> <span>mainfont</span><span>=</span><span>"DejaVu Serif"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> <span>monofont</span><span>=</span><span>"DejaVu Sans Mono"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--pdf-engine</span><span>=</span>xelatex <span>\</span>
    <span>-o</span> <span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>mainfont</code> is for normal text</li>
  <li><code>monofont</code> is for code snippets</li>
  <li><code>geometry</code> for page size and margins</li>
  <li><code>linkcolor</code> to set hyperlink color</li>
  <li>to increase default <strong>font size</strong>, use <code>-V fontsize=12pt</code>
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23811002/from-markdown-to-pdf-how-to-change-the-font-size-with-pandoc">stackoverflow: change font size</a> if you need even bigger size options</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using <code>xelatex</code> as the <code>pdf-engine</code> allows to use any font installed in the system. One reason I chose <code>DejaVu</code> was because it supported <strong>Greek</strong> and other Unicode characters that were causing error with other fonts. See <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/21736/using-xelatex-instead-of-pdflatex">tex.stackexchange: Using XeLaTeX instead of pdfLaTeX</a> for some more details.</p>

<p>The <code>pandoc</code> invocation is now through a script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>chmod</span> +x md2pdf.sh
<span>$ </span>./md2pdf.sh sample_1.md sample_1_settings.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Do compare the pdf generated side by side with previous output before proceeding.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/warning.svg" alt="warning"> On my system, <code>DejaVu Serif</code> did not have <em>italic</em> variation installed, so I had to use <code>sudo apt install ttf-dejavu-extra</code> to get it.</p>



<h2 id="syntax-highlighting"><a name="syntax-highlighting"></a>Syntax highlighting</h2>

<p>One option to customize syntax highlighting for code snippets is to save one of the <code>pandoc</code> themes and editing it. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30880200/pandoc-what-are-the-available-syntax-highlighters/47876166#47876166">stackoverflow: What are the available syntax highlighters?</a> for available themes and more details (as a good practice on stackoverflow, go through all answers and comments — the linked/related sections on sidebar are useful as well).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pandoc <span>--print-highlight-style</span><span>=</span>pygments <span>&gt;</span> pygments.theme
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Edit the above file to customize the theme. Use sites like <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/">colorhexa</a> to help with color choices, hex values, etc. For this demo, the below settings are changed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># by default, background is same as normal text
# change it to a shade of gray to easily distinguish code and text
"background-color": "#f8f8f8",

# change italic to false, messes up comments with slashes
# change comment text-color to yet another shade of gray
"Comment": {
    "text-color": "#9c9c9c",
    "background-color": null,
    "bold": false,
    "italic": false,
    "underline": false
},
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Inline code</strong></p>

<p>Similar to changing background color for code snippets, I found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40975004/pandoc-latex-change-backtick-highlight">solution online</a> to change background color for inline code snippets.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>fancyvrb,newverbs,xcolor<span>}</span>

<span>\definecolor</span><span>{</span>Light<span>}{</span>HTML<span>}{</span>F4F4F4<span>}</span>

<span>\let\oldtexttt\texttt</span>
<span>\renewcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\texttt</span><span>}</span>[1]<span>{</span>
  <span>\colorbox</span><span>{</span>Light<span>}{</span><span>\oldtexttt</span><span>{</span>#1<span>}}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add <code>--highlight-style pygments.theme</code> and <code>--include-in-header inline_code.tex</code> to the script and generate the <code>pdf</code> again.</p>

<p>With <code>pandoc sample_2.md -f gfm -o sample_2.pdf</code> the output would be:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/default_syn.png" alt="Default syntax highlighting"></p>

<p>With <code>./md2pdf_syn.sh sample_2.md sample_2_syn.pdf</code> the output is:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/customized_syn.png" alt="Customized syntax highlighting"></p>



<p>For my <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions">Python re(gex)?</a> book, by chance I found that using <code>ruby</code> instead of <code>python</code> for REPL code snippets syntax highlighting was better. Snapshot from <code>./md2pdf_syn.sh sample_3.md sample_3.pdf</code> result is shown below. For <code>python</code> directive, string output gets treated as a comment and color for boolean values isn’t easy to distinguish from string values. The <code>ruby</code> directive treats string value as expected and boolean values are easier to spot.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/python_vs_ruby_syn.png" alt="REPL syntax highlighting"></p>



<h2 id="bullet-styling"><a name="bullet-styling"></a>Bullet styling</h2>

<h2 id="adding-table-of-contents"><a name="adding-table-of-contents"></a>Adding table of contents</h2>

<p>There’s a handy option <code>--toc</code> to automatically include table of contents at top of the generated <code>pdf</code>. You can control number of levels using <code>--toc-depth</code> option, the default is 3 levels. You can also change the default string <code>Contents</code> to something else using <code>-V toc-title</code> option.</p>

<p><code>./md2pdf_syn_bullet_prop_toc.sh sample_1.md sample_1_toc.pdf</code> gives:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/table_of_contents.png" alt="table of contents"></p>



<h2 id="adding-cover-image"><a name="adding-cover-image"></a>Adding cover image</h2>

<p>To add something prior to table of contents, cover image for example, you can use a <code>tex</code> file and include it verbatim. Create a <code>tex</code> file (named as <code>cover.tex</code> here) with content as shown below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\includegraphics</span><span>{</span>cover.png<span>}</span>
<span>\thispagestyle</span><span>{</span>empty<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, modify the previous script <code>md2pdf_syn_bullet_prop_toc.sh</code> by adding <code>--include-before-body cover.tex</code> and tada — you get the cover image before table of contents. <code>\thispagestyle{empty}</code> helps to avoid page number on the cover page, see also <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/360739/what-is-the-use-of-clearpage-thispagestyleempty-cleardoublepage">tex.stackexchange: clear page</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>bash</code> script invocation is now <code>./md2pdf_syn_bullet_prop_toc_cover.sh sample_5.md sample_5.pdf</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/warning.svg" alt="warning"> You’ll need at least one image in input markdown file, otherwise settings won’t apply to the cover image and you may end up with weird output. <code>sample_5.md</code> used in the command above includes an image. And be careful to use escapes if the image path can contain <code>tex</code> metacharacters.</p>



<h2 id="stylish-blockquote"><a name="stylish-blockquote"></a>Stylish blockquote</h2>

<p>By default, blockquotes (lines starting with <code>&gt;</code> in markdown) are just indented in the <code>pdf</code> output. To make them standout, <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/154528/how-to-change-the-background-color-and-border-of-a-pandoc-generated-blockquote">tex.stackexchange: change the background color and border of blockquote</a> helped.</p>

    <p>Mailinator started 17 years ago as a weekend project to define the idea of “Free, Disposable, Email”. Back then, it ran on a single server with only a single developer. Over time, it’s popularity has exploded in terms of both incoming email and active users. As you might guess when you go from thousands of emails-per-day to <strong>thousands of emails-per-second</strong>, the behind-the-scenes technical stack needs to evolve - and Mailinator’s stack has had a quite a technical journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://manybrain.github.io/m8r_blog/img/2020/07/image1.png" alt="Slide showing beginning and end tech evolution for Mailinator.com"></p>
<p>Today Mailinator still provides free, disposable, email - but also serves thousands of daily corporate users in testing their Email and SMS Workflows with an API, Webhooks, and Private Domains. Website owners quickly realized that having an infinite number of inboxes “on tap” was incredibly useful for testing things their like their Signup system, Marketing email systems, and more. Quality Assurance teams found it to be an invaluable tool.</p>
<p>In February 2020, Mailinator’s creator Paul Tyma gave a talk on the “Technical Evolution of Mailinator.com”. Below you can find a link to the slides and watch the video. The talk explores the site’s journey from a “Free, Disposable, Email” to a becoming SaaS service helping thousands of companies test their Email and SMS Workflows (and of course, scaling a system to tens of millions of emails per day).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you have a landing page or website created in Webflow, chances are you added some sort of contact form to reach interested users or prospects. Nothing gives your site more validation than people leaving their contact information, so you'll probably want to use that to make the most out of your site's traffic.</p><p>In this short article we'll show you how to send automated <strong>emails when someone submits a Webflow form</strong> using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.palabra.io/">Palabra</a>.</p><p>But why send just one email? We'll show you how to set up an entire automated sequence to welcome and engage your prospects using a no-code tool in just 5 minutes.</p><p><em>Note: Pretty obvious, but you need to have an existing Webflow site including a form to use this guide. You can learn how to do that <a href="https://university.webflow.com/article/intro-to-forms">here</a>.</em></p><h3>Step 1: Create an email trigger from a Webflow form</h3><p>To start, create a trigger and add a condition. Select "User submitted a form on Webflow" to set up the integration.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="1.png" title="1.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/7d769/1.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/5243c/1.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/ab158/1.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/7d769/1.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/b43a1/1.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><h3>Step 2: Connect your Webflow site to Palabra</h3><p>After you select the trigger, click on the card and give Palabra access to your Webflow website. Then pick from the list the website where you have the form you want to connect:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="2.png" title="2.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/7d769/2.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/5243c/2.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/ab158/2.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/7d769/2.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/2b72d/2.png 980w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>You'll need your Webflow form to include an email input to trigger the sequence. If you don't have one, just add it to your Webflow site and then select "Test connection again".</p><h3>Step 3: Select your email sequence</h3><p>In the "Tasks" column, you can add an email from the template list, or add a specific action, like wait some time.</p><p>Here you can select different actions and set up a whole sequence. For this example I created a simple welcoming sequence for a Webflow landing page to a community:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="3.png" title="3.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/7d769/3.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/5243c/3.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/ab158/3.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/7d769/3.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/b1884/3.png 994w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>In this example I would be welcoming prospects to my community, sending them some resources the next day, and then waiting a few days to ask for feedback.</p><p>You can easily edit any template by clicking on each card. It will save automatically.</p><h3>Step 4: Start sending automated emails</h3><p>This step is really really short. Once you are ready, just click "Start actions" and wait for Palabra to do the work for you.</p><p>And that's it. You already automated a welcoming sequence. Congratulations.</p><h4>Pro tip: Try out different sequences</h4><p>Once you get your sequence going, you will find a third column with your sequence's performance. You'll get a full list of contacts that received each email, and stats to know who opened them and who clicked on your call to action:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="4.png" title="4.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/96430/4.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/5243c/4.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/ab158/4.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/96430/4.png 933w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Try out changing your templates or the order in which emails get sent to see if your open ratio improves.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this tutorial!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It must have been about a year ago, just after I moved from San Francisco here to New York. I was having steaks with my good friend and soon to be business partner, Kyle. Kyle and I transferred to Vanderbilt at the same time, were placed a few doors down from each other in an awful, mold-ridden dorm which we would both soon move out of (and which was knocked down by the time we graduated), and spent our first night on campus drinking whiskey together with another future friend of ours. Over the next few years, Kyle and I hung out a lot, studied together often and discussed a lot of business and investing ideas while procrastinating from said studies. This past year, a few months after the aforementioned dinner, we bought in 50/50 on a real estate investment, a multi-family duplex in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. I never imagined that I would become a Kentucky homeowner, but because of Kyle, now I am. Our investment is going very well so far and I am confident that Kyle and I will be doing a lot more together in the future, real estate or otherwise.</p>



<p>Going back to that dinner, over my ribeye and glass of wine and his filet and Coca-Cola, Kyle and I discussed where each of us were and where we wanted to be headed, in terms of our careers mostly as the majority time consumers of our lives in general. I was working as many hours as ever in investment banking and he had recently moved on from banking and into equity research. In discussing his decision to make the transition, he made a somewhat obvious point that I think tends to get overlooked and underestimated nonetheless, which is why I am choosing to write about it today. That is, he pointed out that we should be thinking about the value of our time in terms of hours rather than years.</p>



<p>Most career-oriented jobs advertise salary to their prospective applicants. I used to think of my income in investment banking as a combination of salary and bonus because the latter comprises an unusually large percentage of most people’s overall annual income in the industry (i.e. the end of year bonuses are often more or less equal to annual salaries for top performers).</p>



<p>After Kyle’s comment, I started to think about income more often in terms of dollars per hour. Think about the following hypothetical. All other things equal, would you rather work 80 hours per week for $100,000 or 40 hours per week for $75,000? The former pays $24 / hour and the latter pays $36 / hour. Most logical people would opt for the latter as the difference in the hourly rate is just too great. The decision would be more difficult however if the 40 hours per week job only paid $60,000. In that case, the income per hour of the 40 hours per week job ($29) would still be greater than that of the 80 hours per week job ($24), but the larger difference in annual salary becomes a bit more difficult of a pill to swallow ($100,000 – $60,000 = $40,000). I am not advocating for choosing one job over the other, even in this idealistic situation where everything else was somehow exactly equal, which of course in real life it would never be. I am simply advocating for people to more deliberately consider the time they expect to give in exchange for a salary when considering an offer.</p>



<p>Further on the hypothetical situation above, even if you were to take the 40 hour per week job at a salary of $75,000 and you are one of the increasingly popular breed of millennials who wants to work 80 hours per week still, that is totally fine. You can spend your time working on things that you are interested in and passionate about, invest your time in learning new skills and/or subjects, or if short-term income is your primary focus, get another part-time job or create your own side hustle for evenings and/or weekends. If you make more than $12 / hour for 40 additional hours of work, you would make more annually than the 80 hour per week job that paid $100,000.&nbsp; For comparison’s sake, the much debated minimum wage for food service workers in New York City is $15 / hour…</p>



<p>Moreover, as with most other things, when it comes to your free time, or disposable time as I prefer to call it, scarcity increases value. The less disposable time you have, the more precious it becomes, the more valuable it becomes. Think about it in extremes. If you had no disposable time (free time to do with what you wish), you would not be able to sleep at your own discretion (this is unfortunately a reality for some people who work long hour jobs or multiple jobs including night shifts). As such, most people would demand more money in exchange for working their 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hour of the day than the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup>. They probably have at least six hours set aside to work anyway and will take what they can get in terms of income in exchange for that time. The 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hours on the other hand cut into the human necessity of sleep and for that reason they are very valuable. The same goes for the less extreme hours in between. There must be a gradual increase in the value of every hour between those two ranges of hours. The less disposable time you have, the more important are the things you have to cut for work such as time for meals with family or friends, time to go to the gym, time to read a book or watch TV, and time to just relax or enjoy your weekends.</p>



<p>Of course, this point about considering income per hour rather than annual salary cannot be considered in a vacuum because there are a host of other related factors that are also important in making decisions around what to do for money. For example, if the day to day composition of your work includes a number of tasks, practices and activities that you like or even love doing or that you might be doing anyway if you had the freedom to choose what to do with your time, then you should be willing to accept less income in exchange for your time because there is less of a difference in the enjoyment or utility of what you have to do for that income versus what you might otherwise be doing.</p>



<p>Once in a while you hear people who love their jobs say things like “I feel like I have never worked a day in my life” or “If money was not a thing, I would be doing exactly the same work that I am doing now”. Those people are mostly outliers and exceptions for now, but the optimist in me convinces the pragmatist that one day in the not too distant future it will become much more common as more menial tasks become automated and some form(s) of universal basic income increasingly provides people with more disposable income/time to live their lives as they please. In the meantime, most of us will continue to feel that we have to make some sort of trade off involving time for money. I suggest that we think about that trade-off in terms of hours as opposed to years. Forget salary.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Anything worth doing, is worth doing well.</li>
                <li><i>Everything</i> that gets added to your product should be considered.</li>
                <li>There is never a time when you should be O.K to just “add a button”. Someone in the process should have thought deeply about it, or you should have. It’s the only way to create lasting products.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you agree with the above, let’s continue on this journey. If not <a href="https://twitter.com/philipardeljan">tweet me</a> or comment below :)</p>

            <p>Doing lots of things quickly feels good. It's human nature. Cranking out work gives an outward semblance of progress. In the context of product design however, an expression comes to mind:</p>

            <blockquote><h3>"Quiet, calm deliberation disentangles every knot"</h3></blockquote>
            <blockquote><small>Gilbert and Sullivan</small></blockquote>

            <p>As product designers, we are tasked with solving difficult problems. To solve these problems our initial inclination can be to design a fancy new interface. At times, the result of good design can be making no change at all or even removing something entirely.</p>

            <p>The main challenge with adding things to a product is that after some time, people expect it to always be there. There is so much inertia once something is in place and is being used. You can’t remove it easily. This is why adding something in the first place is such an important decision. With user interface design, quality is better than quantity. You can only fit so much onto a screen at any given time so difficult decisions need to be made.</p>

            <blockquote><h3>"Just add in this button"</h3></blockquote>
            <blockquote><small>A co-worker, probably</small></blockquote>

            <p>Sometimes I think about a small piece of UI for a long time. And a lot of the time it feels unproductive. It feels so weird to spend half a day thinking deeply about a button. But the presence of <i>one more button</i> within a user interface could make or break it.</p>

            <h3>UI scenario: Add a button to this screen to let users do (x).</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Does this button need to exist in the UI? (despite being mandated I always consider this first. As an interface designer, you are responsible to ensure the interface works for users first.)</li>
                <li>Do all users need to see it, or just a subset or users?</li>
                <li>Does the button have more or less importance than the elements around it?</li>
                <li>Does adding this button distract too much from the existing functions?</li>
                <li>With all of this in mind, have I struck the right balance?</li>
                <li>How does the information architecture hold up?</li>
                <li>What existing UI patterns do we have for this button (if any)?</li>
                <li>Does this button need to persist after being actioned once/twice/etc?</li>
                <li>Does this button have multiple states? If so, what are they?</li>
                <li>Does it need to be touch friendly and have a big tap target?</li>
                <li>Will this element animate? Where from/to? Why?</li>
                <li>and so on…</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is a considered approach to UI design. It will ensure that the user always has the best experience when using your product. The compounding effects of strong design decisions quickly stack up. Kind of like compounding interest.</p>

            <h3>UX scenario: The user should be able to do (x).</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How does the user currently do (x)? </li>
                <li>Is the user having to use a workaround to do (x)?</li>
                <li>By allowing the user to do (x) are we creating future problems?</li>
                <li>Does (x) align with our wider product strategy?</li>
                <li>How should we test our design of (x) with users?</li>
                <li>Do we already have anything in the roadmap that will solve (x)?</li>
                <li>Will we need to re-work our solution to (x) in the short/medium term?</li>
                <li>Do we have competitors that allow users to do (x)? If so, how do they do it?</li>
                <li>and so on…</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are some of the questions I ask myself when adding elements to an existing interface. When designing an entirely new user interface there are many more considerations I take into account. Maybe for another blog post :)</p>

            <p>So what are the takeaways? If you want to kill your product, make lots of design decisions really quickly. And do that for a sustained period of time.</p>

            <p>If you want a well designed product that is both a joy to use and to work on, go slow to go fast. Good design is like slow cooked food, the process is long but the outcome is always worth it. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>This is a tutorial to guide you through the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2017/02/introducing-pkg_comp-2.0.html">shiny new pkg_comp 2.0</a> on NetBSD.</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong> to use pkg_comp 2.0 to build a binary repository of all the packages you are interested in; to keep the repository fresh on a daily basis; and to use that repository with pkgin to maintain your NetBSD system up-to-date and secure.</p>

<p>This tutorial is specifically targeted at NetBSD but should work on other platforms with some small changes.  Expect, at the very least, a macOS-specific tutorial as soon as I create a pkg_comp standalone installer for that platform.</p>



<p>First install the <code>sysutils/sysbuild-user</code> package and trigger a full build of NetBSD so that you get usable release sets for pkg_comp.  See <code>sysbuild(1)</code> and <code>pkg_info sysbuild-user</code> for details on how to do so.  Alternatively, <a href="https://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/">download release sets from the FTP site</a> and later tell pkg_comp where they are.</p>

<p>Then install the <code>pkgtools/pkg_comp-cron</code> package.  The rest of this tutorial assumes you have done so.</p>



<p>To use pkg_comp for periodic builds, you’ll need to do some minimal edits to the default configuration files.  The files can be found directly under <code>/var/pkg_comp/</code>, which is <code>pkg_comp-cron</code>’s “home”:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf</code>: This is pkg_comp’s own configuration file and the defaults installed by <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> should be good to go.</p>

<p>The contents here are divided in three major sections: declaration on how to download pkgsrc, definition of the file system layout on the host machine, and definition of the file system layout for the built packages.</p>

<p>You may want to customize the target system paths, such as <code>LOCALBASE</code> or <code>SYSCONFDIR</code>, but you should not have to customize the host system paths.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/sandbox.conf</code>: This is the configuration file for sandboxctl.  The default settings installed by <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> <em>should</em> suffice if you used the <code>sysutils/sysbuild-user</code> package as recommended; otherwise tweak the <code>NETBSD_NATIVE_RELEASEDIR</code> and <code>NETBSD_SETS_RELEASEDIR</code> variables to point to where the downloaded release sets are.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/extra.mk.conf</code>: This is pkgsrc’s own configuration file.  In here, you should configure things like the licenses that are acceptable to you and the package-specific options you’d like to set.  You should <em>not</em> configure the layout of the installed files (e.g. <code>LOCALBASE</code>) because that’s handled internally by pkg_comp as specified in <code>pkg_comp.conf</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/list.txt</code>: This determines the set of packages you want to build in your periodic cron job.  The builds will fail unless you list at least one package.</p>

<p>WARNING: Make sure to include <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> and <code>pkgin</code> in this list so that your binary kit includes these essential package management tools.  Otherwise you’ll have to deal with some minor annoyances after rebootstrapping your system.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, review root’s <code>crontab</code> to ensure the job specification for pkg_comp is sane.  On slow machines, or if you are building many packages, you will probably want to decrease the build frequency from <code>@daily</code> to <code>@weekly</code>.</p>



<p>Here is what the configuration looks like on my NetBSD development machine as dumped by the <code>config</code> subcommand.  Use this output to get an idea of what to expect.  I’ll be using the values shown here in the rest of the tutorial:</p>

<pre><code># pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf config
AUTO_PACKAGES = autoconf automake bash colordiff dash emacs-nox11 git-base git-docs gmake gnuls lua52 mozilla-rootcerts pdksh pkg_comp-cron pkg_developer pkgin sqlite3 sudo sysbuild sysbuild-user sysupgrade tmux vim zsh
CVS_ROOT = :ext:anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot
CVS_TAG is undefined
DISTDIR = /var/pkg_comp/distfiles
EXTRA_MKCONF = /var/pkg_comp/extra.mk.conf
FETCH_VCS = cvs
GIT_BRANCH = trunk
GIT_URL = https://github.com/jsonn/pkgsrc.git
LOCALBASE = /usr/pkg
NJOBS = 2
PACKAGES = /var/pkg_comp/packages
PBULK_PACKAGES = /var/pkg_comp/pbulk-packages
PKG_DBDIR = /usr/pkg/libdata/pkgdb
PKGSRCDIR = /var/pkg_comp/pkgsrc
SANDBOX_CONFFILE = /var/pkg_comp/sandbox.conf
SYSCONFDIR = /etc
UPDATE_SOURCES = true
VARBASE = /var

NETBSD_NATIVE_RELEASEDIR = /home/sysbuild/release/amd64
NETBSD_RELEASE_RELEASEDIR = /home/sysbuild/release/amd64
NETBSD_RELEASE_SETS is undefined
SANDBOX_ROOT = /var/pkg_comp/sandbox
SANDBOX_TYPE = netbsd-release
</code></pre>



<p>Now that you are fully installed and configured, you’ll build some stuff by hand to ensure the setup works before the cron job comes in.</p>

<p>The simplest usage form, which involves full automation, is something like this:</p>

<pre><code># pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf auto
</code></pre>

<p>This trivially-looking command will:</p>

<ol>
<li>checkout or update your copy of pkgsrc;</li>
<li>create the sandbox;</li>
<li>bootstrap pkgsrc and pbulk;</li>
<li>use pbulk to build the given packages; and</li>
<li>destroy the sandbox.</li>
</ol>

<p>After a successful invocation, you’ll be left with a collection of packages in the directory you set in <code>PACKAGES</code>, which in the default <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> installation is <code>/var/pkg_comp/packages/</code>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to restrict the set of packages to build during a manually-triggered build, provide those as arguments to <code>auto</code>.  This will override the contents of <code>AUTO_PACKAGES</code> (which was derived from your <code>list.txt</code> file).</p>

<p>But what if you wanted to invoke all stages separately, bypassing <code>auto</code>?  The command above would be equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code># pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf fetch
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf sandbox-create
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf bootstrap
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf build &lt;package names here&gt;
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf sandbox-destroy
</code></pre>

<p>Go ahead and play with these.  You can also use the <code>sandbox-shell</code> command to interactively enter the sandbox.  See <code>pkg_comp(8)</code> for more details.</p>

<p>Lastly note that the root user will receive email messages if the periodic pkg_comp cron job fails, but only if it fails.  That said, you can find the full logs for all builds, successful or not, under <code>/var/pkg_comp/log/</code>.</p>



<p>Now that you have built your first set of packages, you will want to install them.  On NetBSD, the default <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> configuration produces a set of packages for <code>/usr/pkg</code> so you have to wipe your existing packages first to avoid build mismatches.</p>

<p>WARNING: Yes, you really have to wipe your packages.  pkg_comp currently does not recognize the package tools that ship with the NetBSD base system (i.e. it bootstraps pkgsrc unconditionally, including <code>bmake</code>), which means that the newly-built packages won’t be compatible with the ones you already have.  Avoid any trouble by starting afresh.</p>

<p>To clean your system, do something like this:</p>

<pre><code># ... ensure your login shell lives in /bin! ...
# pkg_delete -r -R "*"
# mv /usr/pkg/etc /root/etc.old  # Backup any modified files.
# rm -rf /usr/pkg /var/db/pkg*
</code></pre>

<p>Now, rebootstrap pkgsrc and reinstall any packages you previously had:</p>

<pre><code># cd /
# tar xzvpf /var/pkg_comp/packages/bootstrap.tgz
# echo "pkg_admin=/usr/pkg/sbin/pkg_admin" &gt;&gt;/etc/pkgpath.conf
# echo "pkg_info=/usr/pkg/sbin/pkg_info" &gt;&gt;/etc/pkgpath.conf
# export PATH=/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/pkg/sbin:${PATH}
# export PKG_PATH=file:///var/pkg_comp/packages/All
# pkg_add pkgin pkg_comp-cron &lt;other package names&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, reconfigure any packages where you had have previously made custom edits.  Use the backup in <code>/root/etc.old</code> to properly update the corresponding files in <code>/etc</code>.  I doubt you made a ton of edits so this should be easy.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Note that the last command in this example includes <code>pkgin</code> and <code>pkg_comp-cron</code>.  You should install these first to ensure you can continue with the next steps in this tutorial.</p>



<p>If you paid attention when you installed the <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> package, you should have noticed that this configured a cron job to run pkg_comp daily.  This means that your packages repository under <code>/var/pkg_comp/packages/</code> will always be up-to-date so you can use that to quickly upgrade your system with minimal downtime.</p>

<p>Assuming you are going to use <code>pkgtools/pkgin</code> (and why not?), configure your local repository:</p>

<pre><code># echo 'file:///var/pkg_comp/packages/All' &gt;&gt;/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf
</code></pre>

<p>And, from now on, all it takes to upgrade your system is:</p>

<pre><code># pkgin update
# pkgin upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>Enjoy!</p></article>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNtacp8-GoI" width="320" youtube-src-id="kNtacp8-GoI"></iframe></p><p>Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</h3><p>Nintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example. If Phil Spencer and co show off a lot of gameplay for <i>Halo: Infinite</i> and other first party games, this could turn out to be an incredible event.&nbsp; Microsoft's Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart is supposedly going to be unveiled in August, adding even more impetus.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Sony released more information to combat the impact of Microsoft's event, perhaps even the price and launch date.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can Nintendo do to get the buzz going again?</h3><div><ul><li>Mario games in celebration of the 35th anniversary.</li><li>Announce <i>Breath of the Wild 2</i>.</li><li>Nintendo 64 games coming to the Switch.</li><li>New [insert old IP] here - imagine the reaction if a new <i>Wave Race</i> or <i>F-Zero </i>was announced?</li><li>Announce a Game Boy Classic.</li><li>Announce<i> GoldenEye 007</i> coming to the Switch.</li><li>Say "<a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/what-next-for-nintendo.html" target="_blank">Switch Pro</a> - coming 2021"</li></ul><p>What about Todd Howard showing a video of him playing <i>Fallout 3</i> (or 4) on the Switch? That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think? Is Nintendo on the right track or should it do more to get everyone talking about the Switch and their games?</p><h2>If you liked reading this post, please check out some of my others</h2>

						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Yepp, more things I wish I'd known when I started, 6th edition.</p>
<p><em>You can find the first article in the series <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-to-program/">here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="donttrytopredictthefuture">Don't try to predict the future</h2>
<p>We suck at predicting the future.</p>
<p>Every time you make an architectural/design decision, you close options in your design and constrain your program’s options for change. Designing is balancing the current needs (requirements) with possible future change requests.</p>
<p>Your main goal is to satisfy the current requirements and leaving as many open options as possible to accommodate future changes. If you get a hunch that in the future you will get a request for X feature and design to accommodate that, two things can happen:</p>
<p>1- The request comes, and hurray! you can easily sneak it in.</p>
<p>2- The request never came, and you end up with a subpar design that doesn’t relate to your current requirements, shame on you.</p>
<p>Because the second thing is more likely to happen, you avoid making the rookie mistake of designing for things you are not sure will come later.</p>
<p>Design is about balancing two things: satisfying current requirements and leaving open as many options as possible. You want to keep flexibility, and designing for hunches poses unnecessary constraints in your program.</p>
<p>So go for designs that are easy to extend and don't build towards a feature that might never come.</p>
<h2 id="communicatewiththeusersofyoursoftware">Communicate with the users of your software</h2>
<p>In a previous article in this series, we talked about our role as software developers. Our job, above writing code, is to provide value.</p>
<p>The most important prerequisites for being able to provide value is to know what our users need. Communication with end-users is important because as the creators of the software, we tend to have skewed ideas about the products we make.</p>
<p>There are many features and usability aspects that are obvious for us, but not for the users. Things that for us seem clear and intuitive can be difficult for people who... well, who didn't create the product. Communicating with users and understanding what they love and what they hate about our products is an important part of crafting the right solution.</p>
<p>It's true that we don't have those many chances to do this, but if there is a situation where you can talk to a user go for it. If it's not possible at all, become best buddies with your product owner and get regular feedback.</p>
<p>Remember that there are few things as sad as building a great product that solves the wrong problem.</p>
<h2 id="dontbeatechnomartyr">Don't be a technomartyr</h2>
<p>Career is important, but so is your private life.</p>
<p>I know this might not apply to you, but our profession is full of people who work a ton of extra hours. Neglecting family, friends and personal life in order to ship that extra feature is quite common among software developers.</p>
<p>I know you might need to stay in the office for a couple of extra hours on special occasions, it happens to everyone. But continuous neglect of other aspects of your life is impossible to sustain in the long term.</p>
<p>We are human beings, and the need to cultivate relationships and hobbies is an integral part of who we are. Having a network of healthy relationships around us not only makes us happier, but it also helps us produce better quality work. A happy and well-rested person with other interests tends to fare better in the long run.</p>
<p>It's not that extreme sacrifices will make you a star employee forever. Sooner or later you will burn out and your relationships will deteriorate, something that will ultimately impact your productivity if that's the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>So, spend time nourishing what matters. Your job will still be there later, and you will probably switch jobs several times in the following decades. Bet for sustainable growth and nourish all the aspects of your life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to Wikipedia, <em>Data-Driven Testing(DDT) is a software testing methodology that is used in the testing of computer software to describe testing done using a table of conditions directly as test inputs and verifiable outputs as well as the process where test environment settings and control are not hard-coded.</em></p>



<p><em> In the simplest form, the tester supplies the inputs from a row in the table and expects the outputs which occur in the same row. The table typically contains values which correspond to boundary or partition input spaces.”</em><br></p>



<p>If done manually, the process of data-driven testing is really time-consuming. It is usually used for regression testing or with test cases where the same test scripts are run by providing huge test data as input, sequentially. </p>



<p>Therefore, the requirement of automating the process of data-driven testing arose and today we have several automation-testing tools and automation testing frameworks for this purpose.</p>



<h2><strong>What is data-driven automation testing</strong>?</h2>



<p>In data-driven automation testing, the test-script/ test case code is kept separate from the test data set. This separation is usually made by storing them at different locations and by having no dependency on each other. Test scripts and test data both are independent of each other and can be stored, modified, added and deleted without any implications on each other.</p>



<p><strong>The order of actions in a DDT (Data-Driven testing) process is as below</strong>–</p>



<p><strong>1.</strong> Read the input data from the data source, using parameterised variables in the automation test script.</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> Fill in the input test data in the AUT(application under test).</p>



<p><strong>3.</strong> Perform the action according to the test script</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong> Compare the expected and actual output</p>



<p><strong>5.</strong> Mark the test case pass or fail</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong> Continue the above steps with the next input test data from the data source.</p>



<p>The expected output is also entered in the test data sheet or file. So that the automation script reads the expected output, compares it with the actual output and accordingly marks the test case – Pass or Fail.</p>



<p><strong>Test data storage can be achieved by any of the below options-</strong></p>



<p><strong>1.</strong> Excel files</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> CSV files</p>



<p><strong>3.</strong> XML files</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong> Database tables</p>



<p><strong>5.</strong> Arrays</p>



<p><strong>6. </strong> Text files</p>



<p><strong>Tools/ frameworks for data-driven automation testing-</strong></p>



<p><strong>1.</strong> Selenium, TestNG, Apache POI (for reading and writing in Excel sheet)</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> QTP</p>



<p><strong>3.</strong> Testsigma</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong> Katalon Studio</p>



<p><strong>5.</strong> TestComplete</p>



<h2><strong>Advantages of data-driven automation testing</strong></h2>



<p>Let us discuss the top benefits of using a data-driven automation testing framework or any DDT tool.</p>



<p><strong>1. Reusability</strong></p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Once we have test scripts ready, the same test script can take any number of test input, present in the files as test data. There is no need to make any changes to the script since it will just read the test data from the file and execute the test case. Whereas, if the test data is hardcoded in the test scripts, the lines of code increase tremendously and such coding practices compromise on the reusability of the program.</p>



<p><strong>2. Enhanced clarity</strong></p>



<p>Since there are separate folders/locations of the test data and test scripts, there is clarity in the development and maintenance of both. If test data needs any changes then it can be done easily without referring to the testing scripts and vice-versa.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SvRcQMx99B8R3EZNq3GqkqaRFTdi7ruUfQsaa8fTYqt1cp7_9zdyvrEnj5rxRSm4KkKWcnRpycJYzLTZdNHu4hYLLHcSX4_xN1ehGmY5YCYuiORc0U-pJdw6QJDuTbaHYpAUf9m8" alt=""></figure>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Image shows separate Test Data and Test Scripts.</strong></p>



<p><strong>3. Maintainability</strong></p>



<p>If there is any update required either in test scripts or test data, it is hassle-free because both test data and test scripts are placed separately with no dependency on each other. While the automation test engineer is working on the test scripts, any team member with knowledge of AUT can maintain and update the test data file without any dependency on the test scripts.</p>



<p><strong>4. Broader test-coverage</strong></p>



<p>With high-quality test data which perfectly reflects the real production data, we can achieve a very good test-coverage. This helps in achieving high quality and better stability of the application. The result will be a very few defects in the production environment because all the possible data is already tested and issues have been fixed accordingly.</p>



<p><strong>5. Time-efficient</strong></p>



<p>The automated test-run can be set up for a nightly run when there is no one working. The results can be verified in the morning, and hence a great amount of time can be saved in the testing activities. Also, if compared with manual testing, data-driven automation testing is faster because all the benefits of automation testing are underlying.</p>



<p><strong>6. Reduced manual error</strong></p>



<p>Unlike, manual testing the test-data is read from the files and not manually entered in the application. Human error is unavoidable when a large amount of data is being entered. Data-driven automation testing reduces the chance of manual error to a great extent and a high-quality product is a result.</p>



<p><strong>7. Reduced test scripts</strong></p>



<p>Because we are not hard coding the test data in the script logic, the size of the code written is reduced considerably. The same test script can be used for a huge set of test data.<br></p>



<p><strong>8. Better use of human skills</strong></p>



<p>The redundant work of manually entering the test data is monotonous and time-consuming. Human skills can be used for better purposes like exploratory testing when data-driven automation testing is in place.</p>



<p><strong>9. Faster decision making</strong></p>



<p>Due to the faster speed of automation and quick execution of a broader data set, the management and defect-related decisions could be concluded faster. In the Agile and DevOps environment, shorter development cycles need quick decisions and quick resolution of issues. The data-driven automation testing aids the Agile and DevOps intricacies to a great extent.</p>



<p><strong>10. Independent of application development</strong></p>



<p>The data-driven automation testing framework can be developed in parallel or before the actual application development. Since, we will be dealing with parameterised variables, independent test data sheets or files and separate test scripts. </p>



<p>The framework development is independent of the actual AUT. If an automation tool like testsigma is being used for the DDT, this process becomes easier. To create test scripts for reading/writing test data from files and scripts of test functions need expertise and effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>11. Minimum technical knowledge required for test data creation</strong></p>



<p>We have separated the test scripts and the test data in the data-driven automation testing process. The scripting part requires expertise and technical knowledge; however, the test data creation does not require any technical expertise. A person who has knowledge of the AUT and domain would be able to fill in the test data values in the sheet/file.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>As the name suggests, data-driven testing (DDT) means testing which is driven by data. Data is of the extreme importance here in data-driven automation testing. A judicious selection of the test data thus becomes imperative in this case. </p>



<p>Simply running the automation scripts on a massive test data set, without a proper vision is such a waste of time, effort and resources. A proper understanding of the AUT and a very good domain knowledge prepares the background for a great test data set.</p>



<p>In current times data is everything- Big Data, AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine learning) endorse this fact with the highest splendour.</p>



<p>Testing can not be any different, to cover a broader spectrum of scenarios in the software testing – a diligent selection of test data is needed. So that any possible defect is already taken care of during testing and the risk of any potential defect in production is minimised.</p>

              <p>Computer vision is one of the hottest subfields of AI at the moment. Its applications extend far beyond driverless cars and unmanned drones.<br></p><p>Computer vision has the potential to transform diverse industries, from medical diagnostics to fraud detection in the retail and banking sectors. So, how does computer vision work? <br></p><p>It all starts with annotation.<br></p><p>For a computer to perceive, process, and respond to its surroundings, it needs training data. That’s where computer vision annotation tools come in. These tools—whether it’s a bounding box or a polygon annotation tool—transform raw image data into labeled images, known as training data, for machine learning models. <br></p><p>Computer vision annotation tools help self-driving cars recognize—and avoid—pedestrians, traffic cones, and other vehicles on the road. But not all annotation tools are right for the job. Let’s talk about why polygon annotation may or may not be suitable for your next computer vision project.</p><h2 id="how-does-polygon-annotation-for-computer-vision-ai-image-recognition-work">How Does Polygon Annotation for Computer Vision AI Image Recognition Work?<br></h2><p>Bounding boxes are quick and easy to use—but they fall short when it comes to irregular shapes. And when we’re talking about real-world environments, irregular shapes are much more common than their regular counterparts. <br></p><p>Unlike bounding boxes, which are restricted to rectangles and squares, polygon annotation captures more lines and more angles. In practice, this means clicking at specific points to plot vertices. With polygon annotation, annotators have the freedom to change direction whenever necessary to best represent an object’s true shape. <br></p><p>Once an object is mapped with a polygon annotation tool, the annotator tags it with a descriptive label. This label is essential as it tells the machine what is found within the polygon annotation. If an image or video isn’t labeled properly, it often leads to inaccurate data.</p><h2 id="polygon-annotation-in-action-use-cases">Polygon Annotation in Action: Use Cases</h2><p>Data annotation allows warehouse robots to differentiate stock and delivery drones to pinpoint addresses. So, what role does polygon annotation have to play in supporting computer vision?</p><h3 id="1-autonomous-driving-semantic-segmentation-for-asymmetrical-objects">1. Autonomous Driving: Semantic Segmentation for Asymmetrical Objects</h3><p>Polygon annotation is regularly used for <a href="https://keymakr.com/blog/instance-vs-semantic-segmentation/">semantic and instance segmentation</a>. Irregular shapes—such as pedestrians or bikes in a street scene—require a more precise tool than a bounding box. Polygon annotation is a useful technique for <a href="https://keymakr.com/autonomous-vehicle.php">autonomous driving</a> as it allows annotators to define the sides of a road, sidewalks, define objects that are obstructed, and more.<br></p><p>In the world of data annotation, precision is critical for the accuracy of your autonomous machine. In many cases, datasets with polygon annotation are the best way to ensure pixel-perfect precision.</p><h3 id="2-drones-and-satellites-aerial-object-localization">2. Drones and Satellites: Aerial Object Localization</h3><p>Drones and satellites must recognize irregular shapes from above, from rooftops and chimneys to trees and swimming pools. <br></p><p><a href="https://keymakr.com/aerial.php">Aerial view imagery</a> relies on contours. Here, too, precision becomes all-important. That’s where polygon annotation comes in.</p><h3 id="3-agriculture-using-computer-vision-to-detect-patterns">3. Agriculture: Using Computer Vision to Detect Patterns</h3><p>Polygon annotation enables computer vision across its diverse applications. Polygonal shapes are everywhere, and capturing them in detail means using the appropriate tool. <br></p><p>In <a href="https://keymakr.com/agriculture.php">agriculture</a>, polygon annotation is a useful tool that allows annotators to define important features like crop rows, tracking insect leg positions, and other details that are difficult to capture with a bounding box.<br></p><p>When it comes to polygon annotation for computer vision, having the right tools and trained staff is essential to the quality of your training datasets. Polygon annotation tools should have features like zooming, panning, and the ability to add comments.</p><h2 id="professional-data-annotation-services-for-your-next-computer-vision-project">Professional Data Annotation Services for Your Next Computer Vision Project</h2><p>While self-driving cars, medical imaging, and face recognition may all fall under the same category of computer vision, the reality is, they’re quite different. It’s not surprising that each of these machine learning models require different data annotation techniques. <br></p><p>Computer vision has limitless potential.

<p>How do you think about how many people in the world use the internet every day? You may be surprised, but this is about 4 billion users. Therefore, it is safe to say that today people are connected to the World Wide Web as never before.</p>



<p>On the one hand, that’s good. More than half of humanity has open access to information and new technologies. So, they can communicate with each other quickly and easily. However, there is a negative side to this: cybercrime, which is growing every year.</p>



<p>After all, as the internet spreads to an increasing number of daily users, cybercriminals aim to get the data of as many users as possible, not just millionaires and celebrities.</p>



<p><em>If you remember, we’ve already talked about cybercrime in article </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/security/cyber-threats/"><em>6 Common Types Of Cyber Threats</em></a><em>. There we’ve listed the main types and consequences of cyber threats.</em></p>



<p>However, we have only superficially studied the issue of protecting our data in the global internet space.</p>



<p>To not leave gaps in knowledge, we’ve decided to analyze the question of how to stay safe online in detail.&nbsp; We summarize all the basic tips to stay safe online that we‘ll discuss in this article.</p>



<h3>Why is it essential to stay save online?</h3>



<p>It is pointless to compare today’s internet with what it was 15 years ago. There were almost no cyber threats in the past since the internet was presented as something technological and new. Something that will be popular in the future, but not now. Therefore, it was easier to stay save online using it.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/save-online.jpg.webp" alt="Stay safe online rules" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/save-online.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/save-online-300x200.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/save-online-768x512.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>Today, the situation has changed. Along with the popularization of the internet around the world, various cyber threats cases are also increasing. Hackers develop new tactics and strategies that allow them to get all the necessary information in the shortest time.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/gdpr-policy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.securitymagazine.com%2Farticles%2F87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to statistics</a>, every 39 seconds, there is one cyberattack in the world. Is there a guarantee that hackers won’t break into your data in the next 39 seconds?</p>



<p><em>You can read more in the article </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/security/why-do-cyber-criminals-want-to-get-into-your-inbox/"><em>Why Do Cybercriminals Want To Get Into Your Inbox</em></a><em> and protect your data.</em></p>



<p>In addition, there is a threat of total cyberattacks on ordinary users. News about various cyberattacks and leaks of user information began to appear more often.</p>



<p>Most recently, we’ve written about <a href="https://utopia.fans/privacy/data-leak-of-telegram-user-base/">the massive data leak of Telegram users</a> and revealed the truth about the popular <a href="https://utopia.fans/privacy/tiktok-collects-users-data-delete-it-right-now/">TikTok app</a>, which collects almost all its users’ data.</p>



<p>Therefore, it is important to stay safe online. For this purpose, there are several rules and methods. In order not to overload you with information, we will focus on the most reliable of them.</p>



<h3>Stay safe online rules</h3>



<p><em>How can I stay safe online?</em></p>



<p>Don’t worry about that. Today, there are many ways to stay save online. We’ve collected 5 the most reliable and protected ways to fight against cyber threats. You can find them below.</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Don’t use public Wi-Fi</strong><strong></strong></li></ol>



<p>We agree that there are situations when you need to use public Wi-Fi. It opens access to the internet in any place. However, such access comes at a cost—you endanger your data.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://securelist.com/research-on-unsecured-wi-fi-networks-across-the-world/76733/" target="_blank">According to statistics</a>, 24% of public Wi-Fi points do not use any encryption at all. If there are about 430 million Wi-Fi hotspots globally, about 100 of them are unsafe. It is quite a large amount.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/statistics.jpg.webp" alt="Tips to stay safe online" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/statistics.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/statistics-300x200.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/statistics-768x512.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>Here is a list of data that becomes available to any hacker, if you still use a public Wi-Fi:</p>



<ul><li>Bank account details</li><li>Credit card numbers</li><li>Login credentials</li></ul>



<p>Therefore, use a public point only as a last resort. Don’t use it to check your email, bank account, or social media profile. If you really need to do this, use your data plan instead.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Use “forget used Wi-Fi network” feature</strong><strong></strong></li></ul>



<p>You probably know that many phones have a built-in memory function for previously used Wi-Fi networks. If you use a Wi-Fi access point of your friend, then the next time, your phone will automatically connect to this point.</p>



<p>This is certainly convenient, but at the same time, dangerous. Why? Because cybercriminals can set up fake Wi-Fi networks to hack into your device.</p>



<p>Or, for example, you used free Wi-Fi in a café. While you are in the café, your device automatically connects to the access point and broadcasts a signal that asks nearby Wi-Fi networks if they have the same SSID (Wi-Fi network name) as the access point.</p>



<p>In this case, the cybercriminals use a device that can scan the SSIDs broadcast by your device and then retransmit them as their own—effectively making your device believe that the hacker’s fake network is legitimate.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Choose private tools</strong><strong></strong></li></ul>



<p>One of the most important rules is to use reliable tools for safe surfing and communicating on the internet. These tools will help you to protect your private chats, hide your search history, etc. These tools usually block malware, cookies, viruses, and even ads.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://u.is/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Utopia P2P ecosystem</a> uses multi-level data encryption that protects all users’ data. In addition, the ecosystem is anonymous and free of charge. It includes an instant messenger, email, browser, crypto wallet, and many built-in games.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Use strong passwords</strong><strong></strong></li></ul>



<p>We will not surprise you if we tell that it is important to have a strong password for your social networks and devices. Why? <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.troyhunt.com/86-of-passwords-are-terrible-and-other-statistics/" target="_blank">According to statistics</a>, 86% of passwords are weak. Anyone, even a novice hacker can hack them in a matter of seconds. Therefore, you need to come up with long passwords that will combine numbers and letters of different sizes.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/strong-passwords.jpg.webp" alt="How to stay safe online" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/strong-passwords.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/strong-passwords-300x200.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/strong-passwords-768x512.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p><em>We have already written about </em><a href="https://utopia.fans/humour/funny-passwords-ever-hacked/"><em>Funny Passwords</em></a><em> that users use in different social networks and devices. To avoid being the victim of a hacker attack, think over your passwords as carefully as possible.</em></p>



<p>Also, use different passwords for each account, device, and social network. This way, you can minimize the chance that your data will be stolen by third parties. In case a hacker breaks into one of your accounts, they will only get some information. But when you use a single password for all accounts, you really risk losing all your information.</p>



<p><em>*Change your passwords about once a month.</em></p>



<ul><li><strong>Turn off Bluetooth function</strong></li></ul>



<p>Undoubtedly, in 2020, only a few people use such a built-in feature as Bluetooth. However, as practice shows, many mistakenly turn it on and do not even notice it. Since if you turn on your Bluetooth for all day, you will risk exposing your data to a cyberattack on the internet.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16294904/bluetooth-hack-exploit-android-linux-blueborne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Back in 2017</a>, it was proven that cybercriminals use Bluetooth to hack internet users’ mobile devices.</p>



<h3>What to do to protect yourself?</h3>



<p>If you really want to stay save online around the clock, you should learn by heart the golden rule: <em>only you can protect yourself in the global internet space</em>.</p>



<p>Therefore, choose only reliable internet assistants, and don’t put too much your private information in the public domain.</p>

Stick to one or two product offerings at the beginning to test what works and the reception from the people.&nbsp;Keep in mind that this doesn't mean you can't have all your products as a subscription, if you are a company that sells more than 1 product or that plans to expand). Start with the one that will be the most suitable for the audience you try to convince. This could be your most popular product or a new product that you are trying to test in the market.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li>Once you pick a product to sell as a subscription, you'll need a tool to manage your sales and operations since doing the process manually can get messy when you have a handful of customers. As you scale, you need to manage your subscribers; otherwise, it can become unmanageable.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li>Billing is one of the most complex aspects, especially if you offer different product variations such as <a href="https://fabfitfun.com/get-the-box/?step=getbox&amp;#plan=fffvip">Fat Fit Fun</a>, with the ability to choose what goes on the box or specific customer needs.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="4" role="list"><li>Give customers a try-before you buy option. Aren't your customers ready to subscribe? Ask them to buy for one month so they can try it and see if they like it.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="5" role="list"><li>Ensure customers have an option to suggest your product to friends. From the very beginning of your subscription business think of a strategy so customers can refer you to other people.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="6" role="list"><li>Another option is to send a special discount with the product if they refer more people or suggest your product to their friends. This is valuable if you are trying to scale fast. It would give you a network effect that can help you promote your product and ultimately grow.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="7" role="list"><li>Make sure all product items are clear. If you deliver on the 11th of every month, can a subscriber get your product if they sign up on the 9th? If a customer travels, can they change their address or pause their subscription? Take this into consideration and communicate it with customers so they can better understand how your subscription works.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>What is a subscription management software, and what has to do with subscription products?&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>If you are thinking of offering a product as a subscription, you should make sure some aspects are covered before starting.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Some of the aspects to consider when starting your product as a subscription are; your <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/the-product-as-a-service-business-case-calculator">customer lifecycles</a>, trials, credit checks, operations, refunds, logistics, and subscription changes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A subscription management software oversees the interaction between your business and the customers, which is more complete and different from just recurring billing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Subscription management software helps you update your customers' information, upgrade/downgrade subscriptions, perform customer-oriented tasks, customer communications, and dunning management.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Meanwhile, recurring billing helps you only generate an invoice (including location-based taxes), tracking payments, and safely storing payment information.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>8 ways in which a subscription management tool or software can help you with your subscription product:&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><ol role="list"><li>Easily track changes from the customer, such as; <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/how-to-reduce-subscriber-churn-5-helpful-tips-to-try">credit card expiration</a>, contact information updates, and the possibility of upgrading or downgrading their subscription.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li>Instantly access the historical data from your customer: view invoices, cancelations, deliveries, and much more.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li>Have a self-service portal where customers can find all the necessary information for their product subscription.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="4" role="list"><li>Communication with subscribers is key: Subscription management improves your overall customer's experience by enhancing communication with your subscribers.<br></li></ol><ol start="5" role="list"><li>Dunning management helps you set pre-determined communications to reach out to customers throughout their lifecycle.<br></li></ol><ol start="6" role="list"><li>Ensure revenue recovery and communicate when a payment or a transaction fails.

<h2>The challenge</h2>
<p>You are given three piles of casino chips: white, green and black chips:</p>
<ul><li>the first pile contains only white chips</li><li>the second pile contains only green chips</li><li>the third pile contains only black chips</li></ul>
<p>Each day you take exactly two chips of different colors and head to the casino. You can chose any color, but you are not allowed to take two chips of the same color in a day.</p>
<p>You will be given an array representing the number of chips of each color and your task is to return the maximum number of days you can pick the chips. Each day you need to take exactly two chips.</p>
<pre title="">solve([1,1,1]) = 1, 
because after you pick on day one, there will be only one chip left

solve([1,2,1] = 2, 
you can pick twice; you pick two chips on day one then on day two

solve([4,1,1]) = 2
</pre>
<p><strong>N.B</strong> Brute force is not the way to go here. Look for a simplifying mathematical approach.</p>
<h2>Test cases</h2>
<pre title="">@test.describe('Fixed Tests')
def fixed_tests():
    @test.it('Basic Test Cases')
    def basic_tests():        
        test.assert_equals(solve([1,1,1]), 1)
        test.assert_equals(solve([1,2,1]), 2)
        test.assert_equals(solve([4,1,1]), 2)
        test.assert_equals(solve([8,2,8]), 9)
        test.assert_equals(solve([8,1,4]), 5)
        test.assert_equals(solve([7,4,10]), 10) 
        test.assert_equals(solve([12,12,12]), 18) 
        test.assert_equals(solve([1,23,2]), 3)
</pre>
<h2>A brute force solution in Python</h2>
<pre title="">def solve(arr):
    # start by creating a new list,
    # that is sorted in reverse (big to small)
    sorted_chips = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    
    # we will return this after incrementing it
    days = 0
    
    # create a copy to work on
    chips = sorted_chips[:]
    
    # loop until we kill
    while True:
        # move through the chips
        for i in range(len(chips)):
            # if the first and next have chips
            if chips[0]&gt;0 and chips[1]&gt;0:
                # increment days
                days += 1
                # decrement chips
                chips[0] -= 1
                chips[1] -= 1
                # re-sort the chips list
                chips = sorted(chips, reverse=True)
            else:
                # return if we've hit a limit
                return days
    
    # fail-safe return
    return days

</pre>
<p>While this works, it is quite slow when we have larger test cases, such as the following:</p>
<pre title="">test.assert_equals(solve([5000000,5000000,10000000]), 10000000)
</pre>
<h2>Revised test cases</h2>
<pre title="">@test.describe('Fixed Tests')
def fixed_tests():
    @test.it('Basic Test Cases')
    def basic_tests():        
        test.assert_equals(solve([1,1,1]), 1)
        test.assert_equals(solve([1,2,1]), 2)
        test.assert_equals(solve([4,1,1]), 2)
        test.assert_equals(solve([8,2,8]), 9)
        test.assert_equals(solve([8,1,4]), 5)
        test.assert_equals(solve([7,4,10]), 10) 
        test.assert_equals(solve([12,12,12]), 18) 
        test.assert_equals(solve([1,23,2]), 3)
        test.assert_equals(solve([5000000,5000000,10000000]), 10000000)
</pre>
<h2>An optimal solution in Python</h2>
<pre title="">def solve(arr):
    # create easiest variables to use below
    a, b, c = arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]
    
    # import `math` package so we can use `floor`
    import math
    
    # return the floor of the minimum values
    return math.floor(min( a+b, b+c, c+a, math.floor(a+b+c)/2 ))

<![CDATA[Scaling Relational SQL Databases]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainContentOfPage">
		
<p>Many applications today still rely on traditional SQL databases like MySQL, MariaDb or PostgreSQL for data storage and data processing. With the growing amount of data and new workloads that are made with this database systems, we often find ourselves in situations where we need to think about scaling such systems.</p>



<p>When it comes to scaling, we might need to think about:</p>



<ul><li>data storage, if we store more and more data and it becomes expensive or slow working with them</li><li>fast INSERTs and UPDATES for write-heavy workloads</li><li>making SELECT queries faster because of their complexity or because they need to query huge amounts of data</li><li>concurrency if we have many clients interacting with the database</li></ul>



<p>In this article, I will present some basic ideas and starting points on scaling traditional SQL databases.</p>



<h3>Update the database</h3>



<p>Newer versions of MySQL, PostgreSQL and other traditional SQL databases typically come with performance improvements. Even if the newer database system is not faster as a direct replacement, there might be new features available that we can take advantage of. Keeping our database system up to date expands our options on what we can do with our data and gives us the best out of the box performance. It is a basic enabler for scaling.</p>



<h3>Scale vertically</h3>



<p>The most intuitive idea of scaling is to use better hardware to scale vertically (on one database server). When it comes to hardware we typically look at CPUs, disk and RAM:</p>



<ul><li>The number of CPUs affects how many queries the database can run and therefore how many clients can be served</li><li>The size of RAM gives us space for indexes, temporary tables and caches the database can store in a fast memory which makes our system faster due to minimizing IO access to disk</li><li>Disk IO speed highly affects the query times, especially for full scan reads (when indexes cannot be used) or for write-heavy systems</li><li>Disk size allows us to store more data</li></ul>



<h3>Leverage application cache</h3>



<p>If the application’s code is in our control we can cache data in a memory store like <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> or <a href="https://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> to avoid querying the database. We don’t have to just cache database reads, but we can also use such systems as buffers for writes, e.g. when we are collecting analytical data and a possible delay is not a problem.</p>



<h3>Use efficient data types</h3>



<p>When it comes to data, it all starts with data types, in other words how individual pieces of information are physically stored in memory. Choosing appropriate data types is always a balance between efficiency and functionality, affecting the required memory, query performance and number of operations we can do with the specific data type.</p>



<p>There are two basic ways to think about optimal data types:</p>



<ul><li>logical: how to store general information like a telephone number or an IP address; for instance we can store color as a string, enum or as a collection of RGB integers and we can store IP address as a string or as bytes</li><li>physical: what specific data types we choose for strings, integers or time since we typically have multiple options; e.g. date and time can be typically stored as a timestamp (faster but with limited date range and functionality) or as a more complex datetime which is more developer friendly and flexible, allowing to store timezone etc.</li></ul>



<p>Using an appropriate type for a database column is especially important when we want to index the column, use it in the WHERE clause, use it for joins or when we have a lot of data.</p>



<h3>Data normalization and denormalization</h3>



<p>We are often trained to normalize data for relational databases in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. While this is generally useful, we might want to reconsider it for some of our data when it comes to scaling.</p>



<p>Generally speaking the simpler we make our data to be retrieved or saved, the more of it we can have.</p>



<h3>Precompute data</h3>



<p>A lot of SELECT queries can be optimized by having the data already in the requested form. This can be handy for analyzing large amounts of data. For instance, instead of aggregating data every time, we can aggregate them beforehand. Of course this isn’t always possible, e.g. we cannot aggregate other average aggregates because we would lose precision.</p>



<h3>Leverage materialized views</h3>



<p>Materialized views are continuously updated data that are updated on write operations or on scheduled time and can be seen as an extension of the previous point. Unlike classic views, materialized views are physically stored and don’t need to be computed when needed. This is useful for situations where a SELECT query would take a long time to produce the result.</p>



<p>As an example, look at <a href="https://www.pipelinedb.com/">PipelineDB</a> extension for PostgreSQL that produces aggregates on real-time data, allowing us to keep aggregated statistics on a write-heavy systems.</p>



<h3>Use proper indexes</h3>



<p>Using the right indexes on tables can be a huge performance changer. Typically, we should index the columns by which we want to query the data or which we want to use to perform joins. However, adding indexes can also reduce performance for write-heavy workloads, since indexes have to be updated on every INSERT and UPDATE. Also it doesn’t make sense to use indexes on some data types. So it is all about finding the right balance.</p>



<h3>Leverage the execution plan for query optimization</h3>



<p>For optimizing reads we need to know how the database query planner will execute our queries. We can use EXPLAIN statement to obtain the execution plan that the SQL server will use for our query.</p>



<p>Here we should look if the database plans to use any of the existing indexes on the tables or plans to make a full table scan. It can give us hints whether we should change the structure of our data, add indexes or rewrite the query in a different way. Please note however that full table scan can be also faster or necessary for some queries so it is not a black and white situation.</p>



<h3>Choose correct transaction isolation level</h3>



<p>The most common relational databases use multi-version concurrency control and make locking very granular (instead of locking the whole table, like MyISAM storage engine does). However, we still need to tell the database how exactly should the concurrency control behave and we can do so by setting appropriate transaction isolation level. There are 4 basic isolation levels in SQL:1992 standard and they will greatly affect how our database system behaves.</p>



<h3>Bulk INSERTs and UPDATEs</h3>



<p>Writing or updating individual rows in a table is not efficient, but databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL have ways to insert or modify data in bulk. We should leverage this every time we can.</p>



<h3>Compress data for storage</h3>



<p>Many times we don’t need to query the data by all the columns in a table. If this is the case, we can further optimize the storage size by storing some of the columns in a compressed form. This is especially useful for strings or some types of binary data.</p>



<p>Some databases or their extensions might be already compressing data under the hood so it always makes sense to look first how the data are stored and whether adding compression on the application layer would bring the desired benefit.</p>



<h3>Make ALTER TABLEs work</h3>



<p>When the amount of data or the workload grows we will experience slower and slower ALTER TABLEs to the point where some of them might not finish in a reasonable time. The first important thing to know is that there are typically two ways of changing the structure of the database tables. One is INPLACE, modifying the original table and the other one is COPY, creating a new table and moving the data afterwards. Databases typically try to modify tables INPLACE if possible, but it might make sense sometimes to explicitly ask for the COPY operation.</p>



<p>When adding a new column, it is better to add it at the end of the table, since inserting a column at a specific place is slow.</p>



<p>When changing existing column it might be a good idea to create a new column first, copy the data and remove the column afterwards.</p>



<p>If the write operations on the table make it difficult to perform ALTER TABLE, it makes sense to stop clients from writing into the table first. This is not always possible, but e.g. collection of analytical data can be postponed using an ingestion buffer in front of the database or we can temporarily pause our ETL jobs working with the table.</p>



<p>The last resort is to simply not do any ALTER TABLEs on large and write-heavy tables, opting for creating a new table to store the new data instead.</p>



<h3>Manage concurrent connections</h3>



<p>Every database server comes with some basic configuration on the maximum number of concurrent connections. When we need more, we typically need to reconfigure this value. Just increasing the value is not enough though – we need to make sure that our system can actually run well with our desired number of connections.</p>



<h3>Add read replicas</h3>



<p>Traditional SQL databases can’t typically scale horizontally for write operations by adding more servers, but we can still add other machines in the form of read-only replicas. The way this works is that all write operations are done on the main server and propagated to other machines using Write Ahead Log. All the replicas will therefore apply the same operations in the same order to the underlying storage as the main server. This ensures that the data will be in sync.</p>



<p>Replicas can be then used for scaling the number of read queries and number of connected clients if they only need read operations.</p>



<h3>Disk partitioning</h3>



<p>Partitioning allows us to distribute one single table across the filesystem and store individual partitions based on some specific rules. When such rules are chosen well, SQL queries don’t have to query all partitions but can limit their search only to a subset of them. This will cut the time the query will run since not the whole database table needs to be looked into.</p>

Using this, you don’t have to take care of functionalities such as email verification, forgot password, resetting passwords, and so on.</p><p id="033b">In this tutorial, we’ll implement a basic Google sign-in provider that works with React Native applications by using the module <code>@react-native-community/google-signin</code>.</p><p id="03e0">Here’s what you are going to build in this tutorial.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/676/1*bG2--jA3moIAMyL4eAuQNw.gif" width="338" height="719" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*bG2--jA3moIAMyL4eAuQNw.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/676/1*bG2--jA3moIAMyL4eAuQNw.gif 338w" sizes="338px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/28/1*bG2--jA3moIAMyL4eAuQNw.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><ul><li id="bc42">Install dependencies</li><li id="5579">Configure a new Firebase project</li><li id="8233">Enable Google Sign-in from Firebase</li><li id="797b">Set up the Google Sign-in library</li><li id="981c">Add a login functionality</li><li id="17e8">Add a Google sign-in button</li><li id="2425">Check a user’s logged-in state</li><li id="2529">Display a user’s information</li><li id="61d1">Conclusion</li></ul><p id="cedd">Before getting started, please make sure you have access to the following in your local development environment:</p><ul><li id="7944"><a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node.js</a> version equal to or above <code>12.x.x</code></li><li id="4f7f">JavaScript/ES6 basics</li><li id="207d"><a href="https://facebook.github.io/watchman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watchman</a>, the file watching service</li><li id="fff0"><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react-native-cli</a> either installed as global dependency or access via npx</li><li id="d43c">a <a href="http://console.firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase</a> project (<em>free tier aka Spark plan</em>)</li></ul><p id="c335">Do note that, in the post, I’m using React Native version <code>0.62.x</code>.</p><p id="ce0e">Start by creating a new React Native project.

You can now start working on adding the login functionality.</p><p id="f209">Let’s complete the app and build the Login screen component. It’s going to handle the communication with the Google Sign-in community module. To test it out, you’re going to need a real Google account ID.</p><p id="d225">In the snippet below, <code>WEB_CLIENT_ID</code> is what you saved from Firebase Google Sign in panel in the previous section.</p><p id="c528">Open the <code>App.js</code> file and import the statements as shown below:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="a1e0">The <code>google-signin</code> library provides some ready-to-use helper functions and a functional UI login button, such that you don’t have to create one from scratch. This UI button component is called <code>GoogleSigninButton</code>.</p><p id="0561"><code>GoogleSignin</code> gives access to the Public API for the module. This object contains many helper methods such as <code>signIn</code>, <code>signOut</code>, and, more importantly, configures to check whether the web client ID being used is correct or not. The <code>statusCodes</code> imported are useful when determining which kind of error has occurred during the sign-in process.</p><p id="aa5c">Now, in the same file, define the following state variables using the React hook <code>useState()</code>.</p><ul><li id="2bf5"><code>userInfo</code> for the user information after a successful login. Initially, it's going to be <code>null</code>.</li><li id="aca9"><code>isLoggedIn</code> to check whether the user is logged in or not. Initially, it's going to be <code>false</code>.</li><li id="b526"><code>error</code> is going to be for <code>statusCodes</code>. Initially, it's going to be <code>null</code>.</li></ul><figure><div></div></figure><p id="b8e8">Next, it is mandatory to call the <code>GoogleSignin.configure()</code> method before attempting to invoke <code>signIn()</code>. That said, this method has to be called whenever the app renders for the first time, so it’s better to call this method in a <code>useEffect</code> hook inside the <code>App</code> component after you’ve defined the state variables:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2899">Next, define a method called <code>signIn</code> inside the <code>App</code> component. It’s going to be an asynchronous function responsible for prompting a modal view to let the user sign into the application.</p><p id="76e3">On success, inside this method you’re going to update the <code>userInfo</code> using <code>setUserInfo</code> and also display some common errors using the <code>Alert</code> component from React Native. On an error, there are a number of different scenarios that are essential to handle using <code>statusCodes</code>, as shown below:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="8d8f">Another asynchronous method is going to be a <code>signOut()</code> method. It has only one functionality to perform—to sign users out from the app.</p><p id="7d7f">This is done in two steps. First, calling the <code>revokeAccess()</code> method from Google Sign in. It removes the React Native application from the user's authorized application. The <code>signOut</code> method removes the user's session from the device.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="825c">Next, create another asynchronously-invoked helper method called <code>getCurrentUserInfo()</code>. This method is going to return the current user.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="d654">The <code>setIsLoggedIn</code> update method is used to update a boolean value of whether the user is logged in or not. This method is useful to check when the user is already signed in.</p><p id="d1f0">The app currently renders nothing on the screen. In this section, let’s add some UI. Create a sign-in button by adding the following UI components and return the JSX from the <code>App</code> component.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="4e2b">Also, add the corresponding <code>StyleSheet</code> object.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="a69d">You have to build the iOS app first—to do so, run the command <code>npx react-native run-ios</code>. After building the app, it’s going to trigger a metro bundler service.</p><p id="e73c">Once this process is finished, here’s how the app looks in an iOS simulator:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*aRaOrOgftUmDAgIIV_eK0Q.png" width="300" height="557" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*aRaOrOgftUmDAgIIV_eK0Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*aRaOrOgftUmDAgIIV_eK0Q.png 300w" sizes="300px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/32/1*aRaOrOgftUmDAgIIV_eK0Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="b316">In this section, let’s configure the screen to check whether a user is logged in or not after the Sign-in button gets pressed. We’ll do this with the help of the <code>isLoggedIn</code> state variable. Add the following snippet to the render method after the Google Sign-in button display.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="286a">Update the <code>StyleSheet</code> object with the following styles:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="4740">If the user is logged in, the message will be replaced by a sign out button that can be pressed to trigger the <code>signOut</code> method.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*4PPI-T9YIQafThj6Mf-L3A.png" width="300" height="557" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*4PPI-T9YIQafThj6Mf-L3A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*4PPI-T9YIQafThj6Mf-L3A.png 300w" sizes="300px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/32/1*4PPI-T9YIQafThj6Mf-L3A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="b459">Let’s try to sign into the app.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/676/1*_QwpsBpS9zvupKC_gq1UoQ.gif" width="338" height="719" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*_QwpsBpS9zvupKC_gq1UoQ.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/676/1*_QwpsBpS9zvupKC_gq1UoQ.gif 338w" sizes="338px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/28/1*_QwpsBpS9zvupKC_gq1UoQ.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="443d">This will open a modal view where the user is going to add the credentials—their Google ID email and the password associated with it.

                    <blockquote>man muss immer umkehren - Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi</blockquote><p>(loosely translated - Invert, always, invert)</p><p>Today, we will look at one of my favourite mental models called - The<strong><em> Inversion principle</em></strong>. <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/#what_are_mental_models">Mental models</a> are a set of simple, abstract but useful principles that help us make sense of the world around us.</p><p>I came across the Inversion principle on the <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/">Farnam Street blog</a>. It is also a favourite of Charlie Munger (Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffets mate) - "...it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward", he pontificates.</p><p>In another interview, he recalls how, as an Air Force meteorologist during World War II, instead of asking what would keep pilots safe, he asked what would kill them and focussed all his efforts "on trying to predict snow, ice or fog—and to ignore pretty much everything else.".</p><p>I could write a book on all the other cool stuff Charlie Munger has said so I'll stop here.</p><h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3><p>Inversion is based on the maxim - invert, always, invert. It is about considering an inverse (usually a negative) outcome and listing the reasons for these. It forces you to either stop doing certain things or avoid the actions that lead to the negative outcomes. It gives us <em><em>new possibilities</em> and capabilities</em> that we might not have considered otherwise.</p><p>The algorithm for inversion is very simple:</p><ul><li><strong>Define the problem</strong> - what is it that &nbsp;you're trying to achieve?</li><li><strong>Invert it </strong>- what would guarantee the failure to achieve this outcome?</li><li>Finally, <strong>consider solutions to avoid this failure</strong></li></ul><p>This is very abstract and vague, so let's look at a few examples:</p><ol><li>Instead of asking how do we increase the adoption of a product or feature? You could instead consider - what are some of things preventing adoption? This would lead to a list like this that you could potentially fix:</li></ol><ul><li>Slow load time i.e. performance issues</li><li>Not enough marketing, or marketing on the platform, or to the wrong audience</li><li>The user guide instructions are not clear ... you get the idea</li></ul><p>2. &nbsp;Following the inversion principle it is <em>better to ask</em> what is preventing me from reading all the unread books on my kindle/bookshelf, instead of asking how can i read more books? Possible reasons and something you could give up:</p><ul><li>I spend a lot of time on social media</li><li>I watch too many shows on Netflix or Disney +</li><li>Spend a lot of time on reddit or browsing hacker news</li></ul><p>3. Instead of wondering how do I always choose a winning stock during investing, ask yourself how do you prevent losses in the long term?</p><ul><li>Am I diversifying enough to prevent long term loss?</li><li>Am I investing &nbsp;based on sound principles, or am I speculating? </li></ul><p>Hopefully this &nbsp;gives you a flavour of how powerful inversion is as a mental model. I should add that it is NOT a silver bullet and it won't always give you concrete answers, but it will act as a forcing function to avoid obvious lapses in judgment. I'll leave you with another one of my favourite quotes about Inversion from Charlie.</p><blockquote>"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."</blockquote><hr><p>Further reading:</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://fs.blog/2014/06/avoiding-stupidity/">Avoiding Stupidity is Easier than Seeking Brilliance</a></blockquote>
</figure><figure><a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/putting-mental-models-to-practice-part-3-better-trial-and-error/"><div><p>Putting Mental Models to Practice Part 3: Better Trial and Error</p><p>Instrumental rationality is the sort of thinking that allows you to achieve your goals. We take a closer look at what decision science says is the ‘best’ way to pursue this purpose.</p><p><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/favicon.png"><span>Commonplace - The Commoncog Blog</span></p></div><p><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2018/12/burst-530182-unsplash--1-.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>Thanks for taking the time to read this post, if you found it useful and if you have any comments or more tips, please hit me up on twitter (@<a href="https://twitter.com/anup">anup</a>).</p>

Because, as soon as your changes are indexed, you can see an effect in Google's search results.</p><p>You either moved up a bit or down. So you learn if Google liked your changes or not.</p><p>With this learning you can apply more changes, get them indexed again and work your way steadily up the SERPs.</p><p>Nice - but there is one challenge.</p><p>For keyword optimization in a foreign country, you will need a VPN to see the local SERP exactly the way it would look like in that country.</p><p>So I did that for a while, but it turned out to be too cumbersome.</p><p>I had to change my IP manually each time and then count through the results. It took a lot of time, so I needed a better solution.</p><p>My keyword rank tracker would only give me data that was from 12 to 48 hours ago, so that was no solution either. I wanted to know my rankings now and if possible for free.</p><p>Recently, I had a look at some <strong>SEO API</strong> services and noticed that many had a free tier included.</p><p>Shortly after, I also stumbled upon Google Colab to write and easily share Python scripts and enjoyed the development experience right from the beginning.</p><p>Hence, I built an SEO rank checker script in Python that would instantly check a keyword ranking. It works directly from Google Colab, so no setup-hassle.</p><p>This is how it looks like, when you fetch a SERP for a keyword in the UK:</p><video autoplay="" loop="" controls=""><source src="https://bluerivermountains.com/video/instant-serp-checker.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>You can use the code too if you follow below steps.</p><h2>How to get started</h2><ol><li>Sign up for the free tier on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://serpstack.com/?fpr=instant-serp-checker">Serpstat.com</a> - The free tier allows for <strong>100 requests</strong> per month.

There are two primary types of broadband competition – competition by price or performance. Cable companies have largely won the broadband battle in cities and suburbs and I’ve been thinking about the competition that cable companies might see from 5G.</p>
<p>Cable broadband is an interesting product. In most cities and suburbs today, the basic broadband product has a download speed between 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps with upload speeds in the range of 10 Mbps to 15 Mbps. The cable companies decided over a decade ago that they were going to stay in front of market demand and have periodically increased speeds, with the most recent speed increases introduced around two years ago. Cable systems can offer speeds up to a gigabit, but the ugly secret that cable companies don’t want to talk about is that it would be incredibly expensive if too many people bought and used gigabit speeds. CCG does market surveys and the primary complaints that customers have about urban cable broadband is inconsistency – networks have periodic slowdowns and outages that customers find frustrating. As much as one third of cable customers also poll as hating the customer service of the larger cable companies.</p>
<p>The biggest weakness of cable broadband is the upload speed. This wasn’t an issue for most homes until the recent pandemic sent students and parents home. Many homes that were satisfied with cable broadband have found that the upload streams are inadequate to allow multiple people in a home to connect to servers and video conferencing services. Cable companies can probably tweak upload speeds upward by 50% more, but that will still feel slow to many homes. Cable companies are faced with an expensive upload to DOCSIS 4.0 to create symmetrical speeds.</p>
<p>There are two products being marketed as 5G. The first is Verizon’s fixed wireless access product. This is not 5G and is best described as fiber-to-the-curb, because it requires a fiber network built close to homes to provide this product. This is a fiber technology that happens to use a wireless drop. As such, it is technologically superior to cable broadband in that speeds can be symmetrical. Verizon says speeds can be as fast as a gigabit, but speeds will vary by customer and will likely slow down during heavy rain or get slower in summer when shrubs and trees are in full leaf. From a price perspective, Verizon is using this product to reduce cellular churn and is pricing it at $50 for a Verizon wireless customer and $70 for everybody else. &nbsp;The $70 price is not going to push Comcast and Charter to lower prices, but it might force them to hesitate with future rate increases for neighborhoods that are competing with the Verizon product.</p>
<p>The FCC and the industry have implied for years that 5G cellular will be a competitor for landline broadband. I still can’t see many homes accepting 5G cellular as a replacement for landline broadband. I can think of a number of important ways to compare and contrast the two broadband products:</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>. Forget the millimeter-wave product that cellular companies are touting as delivering cellular speeds over a gigabit. It’s a gimmick product used &nbsp;to try to promote the idea that 5G is fast. The millimeter-wave technology is only good outdoors, and even then only travels a few hundred feet from a cell site. It delivers gigabit speeds to cellphones – when cellphones aren’t designed to run multiple apps that require fast broadband. The 5G download speeds on regular cellphones should creep up 100 Mbps over the next 5 to 7 years, and would rival the base speeds on cable company networks – but by that time the cable companies are likely to upgrade all of their customers to 250 Mbps. Cellular upload speeds don’t matter, because no family is going to conduct multiple upload sessions over a single cellphone.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Capacity</strong>. Cellular networks today carry less than 5% of all US broadband. Even the majority of data passed through cellphones is handed off to landline networks through WiFi. In North America this year, Cisco predicts that in 2020 there will be 77 exabytes per month carried by landline networks compared to 3.4 exabytes carried by cellular networks. By 2022 that will grow to 109 exabytes for landline networks and 6 exabytes for cellular networks – the gap between the two technologies is rapidly widening. There is no scenario where cellular networks can somehow steal away a lot of the traffic carried by landlines. When cellular companies make this claim they are arguing against the realities of physics.</p>
<p><strong>Household Usage</strong>. Household usage of broadband has exploded. In the first quarter of 2018, the average US home used 215 gigabytes of data per month. At the end of the recent first quarter of 2020 that had grown to over 400 gigabytes per month. By 2024 the average home might be using more than 700 gigabytes per month.</p>
<p><strong>Data Caps</strong>. The above statistics show the absurdity of the claim that cellular will somehow overtake landline broadband. Even the ‘unlimited’ cellular data plans today are capped or heavily throttled after 20 or so gigabytes of data used in a month. Cellular companies are not likely to raise the data caps much because they don’t want heavy data users sucking all of the capacity out of the cellular networks.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>. US cellular data is the most expensive broadband in developed countries. For 5G to compete with landline broadband, the cellular companies would have to kill the paradigm of selling an extra gigabyte of data for $10.&nbsp;5G can only compete with landline broadband if the cellular carriers can increase wireless network capacity by a factor of ten and are willing to lower prices by more than a factor of ten. The first is not possible due to the limitations of physics and there are no indications that cellular carriers are willing to consider the second.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Feature stores are the new cool kids in the neighbourhood of Data engineering and AI (artificial intelligence). Hyperscale&nbsp; AI companies (such as Uber, Netflix) have <a href="http://www.featurestore.org/">built their own feature stores</a> to solve the problems of reusing, governing and securing access to features (data for AI) in a shared platform. Hopsworks is a modular open-source platform, developed by Logical Clocks, for managing data for AI (a standalone Feature Store), computing features (Spark, Python), and training models. In this post, we introduce the project-based multi-tenancy security model in Hopsworks for users, data, and programs. We describe how our project-based multi-tenant security model is, in effect, a form of dynamic role-based access control with zero performance overhead.</p><figure id="w-node-591b61e7aa1b-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f10585a943c7738c589d3c5_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.38.14.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/introducing-hopsworks-ai">Hopsworks.ai</a> is a SaaS version of Hopsworks, currently available on AWS. Hopsworks clusters can be run with an IAM profile, providing them with an identity in AWS with permission policies that capture what operations the Hopsworks cluster is authorized to perform in AWS - such as read/write data in S3 buckets. Hopsworks can also be used from Data Science and Feature Engineering platforms (Databricks, Sagemaker, KubeFlow, EMR) using API keys exported from Hopsworks.</p><p>This post is concerned primarily with the internal security model in Hopsworks that enables you to host sensitive data in a shared cluster, providing powerful access control and self-service capabilities. The benefit of Hopsworks project-based multi-tenancy model is that you can host many users and feature stores (and other projects) on a single cluster, with self-service access to different feature stores. The advantage of our security model is that you can host production, staging, and development feature stores in a single cluster - you do not need to manage and pay for separate clusters.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control#:~:text=Role%2Dbased%20access%20control%20(RBAC)%20is%20a%20policy%2D,simple%20to%20perform%20user%20assignments.">Role-based access control</a> (RBAC) is a well-known security model that enables administrators to give a group of users the same access rights to selected resources. With roles, an administrator at a company could define a single security policy and apply it to all members of a department. But individuals may be members of multiple departments, so a user might be given multiple roles. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85776-1_17">Dynamic role-based access control</a> means that, based on some other policy, you can change the set of roles a user can hold at a given time. For example, if a user has two different roles - one for accessing banking data and another one for accessing trading data, with dynamic RBAC, you could restrict the user to only allow her to hold one of those roles at a given time. The policy for deciding which role the user holds could, for example, depend on what VPN (virtual private network) the user is logged in to or what building the user is present in. In effect, dynamic roles would allow to hold only one of the roles at a time and sandbox her inside one of the domains - banking or trading. It would prevent her from cross-linking or copying data between the different trading and banking domains.</p><p>Hopsworks implements a dynamic role-based access control model through a project-based <strong>multi-tenant security model. </strong>Inspired by GDPR, in Hopsworks a <em>Project </em>is a sandboxed set of users, data, and programs (where data can be shared in a controlled manner between projects). Every Project has an <strong>owner</strong> with full read-write privileges and zero or more <strong>members</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>A project owner may invite other users to his/her project as either a <strong>Data Scientist </strong>(read-only privileges and run jobs privileges) or <strong>Data Owner</strong> (full privileges). Users can be members of (or own) multiple Projects, but inside each project, each member (user) has a unique identity - we call it a <em>project-user identity</em>.&nbsp; For example, user <em>Alice</em> in <em>Project A</em> is different from user <em>Alice </em>in <em>Project B - </em>(in fact, the system-wide (project-user) identities are <strong><em>ProjectA__Alice</em></strong> and <strong><em>ProjectB__Alice</em></strong>, respectively)<em>. </em>As such, each project-user identity is effectively a role with the project-level privileges to access data and run programs inside that project. If a user is a member of multiple projects, she has, in effect, multiple possible roles, but only one role can be active at a time when performing an action inside Hopsworks. When a user performs an action (for example, runs a program) it will be executed with the project-user identity. That is, the action will only have the privileges associated with that project. The figure below illustrates how Alice has a different identity for each of the two projects (A and B) that she is a member of. Each project contains its own separate private assets. Alice can use only one identity at a time which guarantees that she can’t access assets from both projects at the same time.<br></p><figure id="w-node-20ac5438fa1d-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f1058b3943c77358489d4b1_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.39.44.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>An <strong>important </strong>aspect of Project based multi-tenancy is that assets can be shared between projects - sharing does not mean that data is duplicated. The current assets that can be shared between projects are: files/directories in HopsFS, Hive databases, feature stores, and Kafka topics. For example, in the figure below there are three users (User1, User2, and User3)&nbsp; and two projects (A and B). User1 is a member of project A, while User2 and User3 are members of project B. All three users (User1, User2, User3) can access the assets shared between project A and project B. As sharing does not mean copying, the access control rules for the asset are updated to give users in the other project read or write permissions on the shared asset.</p><figure id="w-node-7c5391a82675-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f1059150895622a73e57f16_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.40.47.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As we will see later on, <em>project-user identity</em> is based on a X.509 certificate issued internally by Hopsworks. Access control policies, however, are implemented by the platform services:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>files/directories permissions for HopsFS, Hive (storage-based security policy), and the offline Feature Store;</li><li>Kafka ACLs using a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-kafka-authorizer">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>;</li><li>Elasticsearch Open Distro permissions using a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/elasticsearch-chef">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>.</li></ul><h3>User Identity in Hopsworks</h3><p>When a user authenticates with Hopsworks, they are logged into the platform with a <em>Hopsworks user identity</em>. This user identity is needed to be able to construct the project-user identity - it is the “user” part of the project-user identity. In Hopsworks, a user-identity is mapped to a global Hopsworks role (independent of project membership) - a <strong>normal</strong> user or an <strong>administrator</strong>. A normal user can search for assets, update her profile, generate API keys, and change to/from projects. Administrators have access to user, project, storage, and application management pages, system monitoring and maintenance services. They can activate or block users, delete Projects, manage Project quotas, promote normal users to administrators, and so on. It’s important to mention here that a Hopsworks administrator <strong>cannot</strong> view the data&nbsp; inside a project - even if they are allowed to delete a project.<br></p><p>A user interacts with Hopsworks through the web application and they don’t necessarily realize that the web application is a facade to a modular distributed system. In the background we run <strong>HopsFS</strong> - our next-generation HDFS-on-S3 filesystem, <strong>HopsYARN</strong> - a cluster management system and scheduler, Apache Hive, Elasticsearch, (optionally Kafka and Airflow), and other logging and monitoring services.</p><p>A fundamental principle in every distributed system is that processes exchange messages over the network or through shared state (such as a filesystem or database). When communication is performed by message passing, it is imperative that we protect the messages from adversaries reading or modifying their content and validate the identity of the caller. Traditionally in Hadoop, they use Kerberos and GSSAPI to authenticate and authorize users and encrypt data in-transit. While Kerberos (Active Directory) is widely adopted by big organizations, the administration of users and services is a painful process and the system does not scale. On top of that Kerberos APIs are so complicated that <a href="https://apachebigdata2015.sched.com/event/3zv3/hadoop-and-kerberos-the-madness-beyond-the-gate-steve-loughran-hortonworks">programming against them can be really challenging</a>.</p><p>To avoid the pain of Kerberos (and be able to natively integrate with platforms like Kubernetes), we completely <a href="https://github.com/hopshadoop/hops">re-designed the security model for HopsFS and YARN to use certificates</a>. We replaced Kerberos with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with X.509 certificates to authenticate and authorize users. Certificates enabled us to also use the well established TLS protocol to provide confidentiality and data integrity. Every user and every service in a Hopsworks cluster has a private key and an X.509 certificate.</p><figure id="w-node-daa745592959-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f105955f5d5389cb463a175_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.42.26.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>TLS-Based Multi-Tenant Services</h3><p>Hopsworks supports a number of stateful and compute services that use X.509 certificates to authenticate users, applications, and services: HopsFS, HiveServer2, Kafka, YARN. These services all provide their own authorization schemes. We unified HopsFS and Hive’s authorization models by providing 2-way TLS in HiveServer2 and <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Storage+Based+Authorization+in+the+Metastore+Server">storage based authorization for the Hive metastore</a>, that we <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hive">ported to Hive 3.X</a>, to delegate access control decisions for Hive to HopsFS. In Hive, tables and databases store their data files inside directories on HopsFS, so HopsFS&nbsp; ACLs (access control lists) authorize file system operations by Hive (read from tables, write to tables). The easy-to-understand ACLs that we expose in Hopsworks (for Hive, and datasets in HopsFS) are captured in two roles: Data Scientists can read, Data Owners can read/write. HopsFS ACLs can be customized directly in Hopsworks from version 1.4.</p><p>For Kafka, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-kafka-authorizer">Hopsworks Authorizer plugin</a> that authorizes operations on Kafka topics by extracting the <em>project-user identity </em>from the client supplied X.509 certificate. The Hopsworks Kafka Authorizer then validates that the user is a member of the project that has permissions to perform the requested action on the Kafka topic.&nbsp;</p><p>HopsYARN uses X.509 certificates to identify users. HopsYARN also creates and manages (including renewal) application certificates for YARN applications (such as Spark jobs). Application certificates in HopsYARN are a key feature missing …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<tt>{philw,rob}@plan9.bell-labs.com</tt><h2>Abstract</h2>
Virtual machines are an important component of modern portable environments such as Inferno and Java because they provide an architecture-independent representation of executable code.  Their performance is critical to the success of such environments, but they are difficult to design well because they are subject to conflicting goals.  On the one hand, they offer a way to hide the differences between instruction architectures; on the other, they must be implemented efficiently on a variety of underlying machines.  A comparison of the engineering and evolution of the Inferno and Java virtual machines provides insight into the tradeoffs in their design and implementation.  We argue that the design of virtual machines should be rooted in the nature of modern processors, not language interpreters, with an eye towards on-the-fly compilation rather than interpretation or special-purpose silicon.<h2>Dis, the Inferno Virtual Machine</h2>
In early 1995, we set out to apply the ideas of the Plan 9 operating system [1] to a wider range of devices and networks.  The resulting system, Inferno [2], is a small operating system and execution environment that supports application portability across a wide variety of processors and operating systems.  Unaware of the contemporary work to establish Java [3] from the technology of the Oak project, we independently concluded that a virtual machine (VM) was a necessary component of such a system [4].  Because of improvements in processor speed and the feasibility of on-the-fly compilers, a VM can execute quickly enough to be economically viable.<p>
The Inferno virtual machine, called Dis, has several unusual aspects to its design: the instruction set, the module system, and the garbage collector.</p><p>
The Dis instruction set provides a close match to the architecture of existing processors.  Instructions are of the form</p><pre>	<i>OP    src1</i><tt>,</tt><i> src2</i><tt>,</tt><i> dst</i></pre><p>
The <i>src1</i> and <i>dst</i> operands specify general addresses or arbitrary-sized constants, while the <i>src2</i> operand is restricted to smaller constants and stack offsets to reduce code space.  Each operand specifies an address either in the stack frame of the executing procedure or in the global data of its module.</p><p>
The types of operands are set by the instructions.  Basic types are <tt>word</tt> (32-bit signed), <tt>big</tt> (64-bit signed), <tt>byte</tt> (8-bit unsigned), <tt>real</tt> (64-bit IEEE floating point), and pointer (implementation-dependent).  The instruction set follows the example of CISC processors, providing three-operand memory-to-memory operations for arithmetic, data motion, and so on.  It also has instructions to allocate memory, to load modules, and to create, synchronize, and communicate between processes.</p><p>
A module is the unit of dynamically loaded code and data.  Modules are loaded by a VM instruction that returns a pointer to a method table for the module.  That pointer is managed by the VM's garbage collector, so code and data for the module are garbage collected like any other memory.  Type safety is preserved by checking method types at module load time using an MD5 signature of the type.   </p><p>
Memory management is intimately tied to the instruction set of the VM.  Dis uses a hybrid garbage collection scheme: most garbage is collected by simple reference counting, while a real-time coloring collector gathers cyclic data.  Because reference counting is an exact rather than conservative form of garbage collection, the type of all data items must be known to the VM run-time system.  For this reason, the language-to-VM compiler generates a type descriptor for all compound types.  This descriptor reports the location of all pointers within the type, allowing the VM to track references as items are copied.</p><h2>Garbage collection</h2>
Memory dominates the cost of small systems, so the VM should be designed to keep memory usage as small as possible.  Through reference-counted garbage collection, Dis reclaims memory the moment it becomes unused.  Reference counting also eliminates the need for a large arena as required for efficient mark-and-sweep collection.  Both these results reduce the memory requirements of the VM and its applications.<p>
Compare this to the Java VM, whose instruction set makes it difficult to track references as objects are copied.  This biases against reference counting, so JVM implementations choose lazier techniques such as mark-and-sweep, inducing a larger arena and delayed collection, both of which increase the memory use and therefore the cost of the overall system.</p><h2>Issues in compiling</h2>
It is easy to interpret the individual instructions of a stack-based virtual machine (SM) such as the Java virtual machine (JVM), because most operands are implicit.  However, a high-level language implementation of the interpreter generates more memory traffic than the equivalent set of instructions in a memory transfer machine (MM) such as Dis.  Consider the code to execute<pre>	<tt>c = a + b;</tt></pre><p>
An SM would execute this by a code burst such as this, which we have annotated with its memory traffic using L for load and S for store:</p><pre>	<tt>push  a      # </tt>LS<tt>
	push  b      # </tt>LS<tt>
	add          # </tt>LLS<tt>
	store c      # </tt>LS</pre><p>
The corresponding MM code burst would be the plain three-operand instruction</p><pre>	<tt>add   a,b,c  # </tt>LLS</pre><p>
When interpreting, the extra memory traffic of the SM is masked by the time saved by not decoding any operand fields.   The operand fields are implicit in the SM instructions, while the MM they are explicit: three operand fields must be decoded in every instruction, even those without operands.</p><p>
When compiling, the tradeoffs are different.  Clearly, either design can produce the same native instructions from its just-in-time compiler (JIT), but in the SM case most of the work must be done in the JIT, whereas in the MM design the front end has done most of the work and the JIT can be substantially simpler and faster.</p><p>
A JIT for an SM is forced to do most of the work of register allocation in the JIT itself.  Because the types of stack cells change as the program executes, the JIT must track their types as it compiles.  In an MM, however, the architecture maps well to native instructions.  This produces a continuum of register allocation strategies from none, to simple mapping of known cells to registers, to flow-based register allocation.  Most of the work of any of these strategies can be done in the language-to-VM compiler.  It can generate code for an infinite-register machine, and the JIT can then allocate as many as are available in the native architecture.  Again, this distribution of work keeps the JIT simple.  </p><h2>Processors</h2>
The same issues that face the JIT writer also face the designer of special-purpose processors to support a VM.  Register allocation in the JIT is analogous to register relabeling in silicon, and an SM design adds unnecessary complexity to an already difficult problem.  One might argue that a stack-based processor design would mitigate the difficulties, but our experience with the implementation of a stack machine in the AT&amp;T Crisp microprocessor [5] leads us to believe that stack architectures are inherently slower than register-based machines.  Their design lengthens the critical path by replacing simple registers with a complex stack cache mechanism.<p>
In other words, it is a better idea to match the design of the VM to the processor than the other way around.</p><p>
Dis fits this criterion better, but we do not plan to implement Dis in silicon.  The idea of a VM is to be architecture-independent; offering a special processor to run it negates the original goal by favoring one instruction set.  Ignoring that for the moment, though, there could still be two reasons to consider designing silicon for Dis: performance and cost.</p><p>
On performance, history shows that language-specific CPUs are not competitive.  The investment in the special design takes energy away from the systems issues that ultimately dominate performance.   Performance gains realized through language-specific support tend to be offset by parallel improvements in general-purpose processors during the life cycle of the CPU.</p><p>
Dis compiles quickly into native code that runs only 30-50% slower than native C.  At the current rate of processor improvement, that is only a few months of processor design time.  It is wiser to focus on improving execution on commodity, general purpose processors than on inventing a new architecture.</p><p>
The issue of cost is more subtle.  Dis is close enough to familiar architectures that a special chip with high integration of systems facilities could be cost-effective on small platforms.  The real reason for that, though, is that the memory management design of the virtual machine makes it easy to implement Dis in small memory.  By contrast, whatever cost gains an integrated Java processor might realize will likely be lost in the extra memory required by its conservative garbage collection scheme [6].</p><h2>References</h2>

        <p>Welcome to the second post from my collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismattman">@chrismattman</a>.  We
were both intrigued when Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/">announced</a> a significant upgrade to their search algorithm in late 2019.  The technique
is super cool, inspired by the human brain, redefining how we search
for text, images, music, and more.</p>

<p>Here’s one example from Google’s post. Let’s say we’re wondering whether we can pick up medicine
for a friend, who may be sick and cannot enter a pharmacy due to Covid19
restrictions.  We Google it:</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image5.jpg"></p>

<p>Before this upgrade, Google would show us information about prescriptions on the
left.  Old Google would see high overlap between our keywords “get, pharmacy,
medicine” and the top blog post.  Statistically, these keywords are the meaty,
distinguishing topic of our inquiry.  The rest of the words are quite common,
such as “can, you,” and “for”.   Articles that only include those wouldn’t do us
much good.  Google would seek keyword overlap, finding the most authoritative
and relevant answer.  This is how search has worked for decades, which we call
syntactic search, based on the written syntax of human language.</p>

<p>The new Google thinks differently.  The new Google thinks like Bert with
tensors, as described in our previous blog post.  Here Google understands that
“can, for, someone” are key to our intent, even though the common words of “for”
and “someone” seem to carry little information by themselves.  These words,
along with the major keywords of “get, pharmacy, medicine” better define our
intent, encoded as a tensor.  Sure enough, today’s new Google finds a better
article on the right.  Note that the article talks of “prescription” when we
stated “medicine,” though these are clearly related, even though they don’t
match.  This new approach is called semantic search and it’s here and widely
available and easily implemented because of Bert.</p>

<p>Semantic search is cool.  It’s all the rage in the scientific community.  We
have high hopes that this tensor technique will allow us to better search
through our overfull inboxes, that pile of PDFs waiting to be read, or the
thousands of customer comments we’d like to process.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h3>

<p>Semantic search is a three-step process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Encode content as tensors</li>
  <li>Encode a query as a tensor</li>
  <li>Find tensors that match</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="encoding-content">Encoding content</h3>

<p>We need a tool for turning content into tensors in <em>bulk</em>.  Currently this remains
the realm of research, though we suspect this capability will soon be
commercially available.   Please, are you listening, product people?   Bueller?
Has anyone seen Bueller?</p>

<p>We have two current favorites, one for scale, one for play.</p>

<h3 id="bert-as-a-service-for-scale">Bert as a Service, for scale.</h3>

<p>Han Xiao (<a href="https://twitter.com/hxiao0">@hxiao</a>) released an open source package in 2019 which takes the
latest, published version of Bert and encapsulates it in a web service.  Han was
recently a CTO at TenCent, now building a promising new company
(<a href="https://jina.ai/">Jina.ai</a>) for semantic search.</p>

<p>Han applied hardcore, distributed systems engineering and optimizations which
allows us to turn 256 sentence fragments into embeddings with a single call,
automatically and elegantly handled by a powerful cluster of energy-chomping,
GPU-enhanced, computational beasts.  We extended his code to run Bert on Google
Cloud in a public <a href="https://github.com/scottspace/bert-as-service">Github repository</a>; 
feel free to use it!</p>

<p>We use Bert as a Service in our applied AI work at Google and NASA, as it scales
nicely to handle millions of sentences.   If you’ve ever written a function in
Microsoft Excel, say, for taking the <code>@sum()</code> of a column, you now have what it
takes to use Bert!</p>

<p>Thanks to Bert as a Service, here’s how we turn three sentences about “apples”
into tensors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>apple1 = bertify("Apple shares rose on the news.") 
apple2 = bertify("Apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter.") 
apple3 = bertify("Apple pie is delicious.")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The values “apple1, apple2,” and “apple3” are 768-dimensional vectors
representing the BERT tensors.  We can execute these in parallel too, up to 256
at a time.  These are sent to a cloud service that can use your own, private
cluster of high-end, GPU-stuffed machines:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>apples = bertify(["Apple shares rose on the news.",
                "Apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter.",
                 "Apple pie is delicious."])
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="spacy-for-play">Spacy, for play.</h3>

<p>Ines Montani (<a href="https://twitter.com/inesmontani">@_inesmontani</a>) and her co-founder started
<a href="https://twitter.com/explosion_ai">explosion.ai</a> in 2016 to
make tools for processing human language.  This kick-ass AI leader and her tiny
German company are having an outsized impact by focusing on simple, easy to use
tools that have immediate, practical value.  They contribute some of  their best
work to open source, as part of the “<a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>” toolset.</p>

<p>Spacy provides tools for running Bert on your own, personal machine.  With 2-3
lines of code, you can be up and running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>!pip -q install -U spacy download spacy-transformers 
!pip -q install -U en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg

import spacy 
import en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg

nlp = en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg.load() 
apple1 = nlp("Apple shares rose on the news.") 
apple2 = nlp("Apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter.") 
apple3 = nlp("Apple pie is delicious.")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The values “apple1, apple2,” and “apple3” are objects where you can directly
access their BERT .tensor values.  We find this helpful in our personal and
exploratory research, where encoding a few thousand sentences is sufficient.
Again, it’s no more difficult than a one-line script in Excel!</p>

<p>We realize there are numerous other packages and research papers on how to use
Bert and its derivatives.  We like things simple and believe that’s the way
forward for mere mortals and also for your favorite blog authors trying to get
out a blog every few weeks.  If you’re not mentioned here, it’s because we find
it too hard to use or, frankly, are naively unaware.  Please keep pushing and
sharing!  The world needs your contributions to make AI simpler for all.</p>

<p>Our projects use these one-line interfaces to turn large quantities of raw text
into large quantities of tensors.  For now, we store these tensors and their
original text in cloud databases such as BigQuery or cloud storage such as GCS.
Absent those excellent databases, Pandas also works fine locally.</p>

<p>What we really want is a tensor store, optimized for storing, searching and
retrieving billions of high-dimensional tensors.  <a href="http://featurestore.org/">Feature stores</a> are a step in
the right direction, though they’re optimized for smaller vector sizes from
hand-built statistical features.  True tensor stores don’t yet exist.</p>

<h3 id="encoding-query">Encoding query</h3>

<p>The simplest approach encodes our query with a single call, as shown above.
This yields a single, 768-dimensional tensor to represent our search phrase.</p>

<p>In Spacy,</p>

<div><div><pre><code>query = nlp("Can you get medicine for someone pharmacy")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Bert as a Service,</p>

<div><div><pre><code>query = bertify("Can you get medicine for someone pharmacy")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sophisticated, production systems like Google extend our initial query with
similar words to account for mis-spellings, synonyms, and omissions. This
produces not one but a set of tensors to represent our search.  One shot becomes
buckshot.  Throw more at the wall and see what sticks. Yes, even AI uses
techniques from the era of cave dwellers and knuckle draggers.</p>

<h3 id="finding-tensors-that-match">Finding tensors that match</h3>

<p>Remember the neural science that inspired Bert?  We humans encode language in
the brain’s neocortex, a three-dimensional space.  MRI scans revealed that
similar language terms (such as “medical” and “pharmacy”) often land on the same
3D spots of the brain.  Thus, when we ask you for the first word that comes to
mind in a matching game, chances are you’re using the same part of your brain!</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image4.gif"></p>

<p>Tensors encode language in a space, too.  Computers aren’t limited to 3D; the
Bert algorithm reasons in a 768-D space.  Similar concepts are stored close
together, much like the neocortex.  We want our search engine to show us the
exact match, if it exists, followed by closely related text.</p>

<p>Here’s a plot taken from Bert answering a query, simplified to 3D.  Our query’s
the pale blue dot.  The closest tensors in the tensor universe are displayed in
colors, varying in intensity based on distance to our blue query.  This is how
Bert searches, as well as how NASA searches for exoplanets and extraterrestrial
life (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star/">true story</a>!).</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image8.png"></p>

<p>Computer scientists call this the nearest neighbor problem.</p>

<p>Given an input tensor T<sub>0</sub>, find the k nearest, neighboring tensors from a larger
set of tensors T.  T<sub>0</sub> is blue in the figure above, along with the 1000 closest
tensors (k=1000).  “Nearest” is defined as the shortest line you could draw –
in 768D – from one tensor to another.   There’s a bit of math involved to
calculate this distance, often taking a dozen instructions on a modern computer.
That normally wouldn’t be bad, except for scale and impatience.</p>

<p>The set T of tensors is often massive, on the order of billions of tensors for a
typical enterprise, trillions for the Internet.  Imagine encoding all social
media posts, or all documents in your enterprise, all email words and sentences.
Please stay away from Chris’s posts because that’s scale. We mean nearly 43K
posts of scale:</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image12.png"></p>

<p>Impatience is about the speed of business.  We’re accustomed to Google searches
returning in under a second, from billions of web pages.  We expect and want the
same from semantic search.  This is impatience.</p>

<p>Comparing the distance from our query to every tensor could take minutes on
modern distributed computers.  This ensures perfect recall but seemingly takes
forever in a world expecting instant results.</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image6.jpg"></p>

<p>You’re probably scowling right now, as Claude Shannon was in this cropped photo
from Wikipedia.  Claude was the father of modern <em>information theory</em> which became
the mathematical backbone to cracking cryptographic codes in World Wars, to
building the first computers, to deploying the first cell phones, and more
recently to developing the first vaccines for Covid19.</p>

<p>Claude formalized the idea of a “bit” of information, the smallest glimmer of
information we can understand from any source.   These bits were …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

		<p><strong>Pomperipossa&nbsp;in Monismania</strong></p>
<p>The most beloved Swedish author of books for children, Astrid Lindgren, most famous for her Pippi Longstocking (Pippi Långstrump) books which have been translated into 70 languages and made into several movies and picture books, penned this opus. Her books were so beloved that they caused her a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p>In the form of a fairy tale she described how it came to be, that as a Sole Proprietor she was forced to pay a tax of 102% of her income.</p>
<p>What follows is a free translation of the famous publication, which was published <a href="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pomperipossa.jpeg" rel="attachment wp-att-4202"><img data-attachment-id="4202" data-permalink="https://lenbilen.com/2012/01/24/pomperipossa-in-monismania/pomperipossa/" data-orig-file="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pomperipossa.jpeg" data-orig-size="302,167" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pomperipossa" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pomperipossa.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pomperipossa.jpeg?w=302" src="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pomperipossa.jpeg?w=660" alt="pomperipossa" srcset="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pomperipossa.jpeg 302w, https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pomperipossa.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px"></a>in the Swedish evening tabloid&nbsp; <em>Expressen</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;on March 3, 1976. (For the purpose of comparison, one 1976 Monismania monetary unit is roughly equivalent to one 2018 U.S. Dollar)</p>
<p>The translation has many deliberate style breaks from child literature to bureaucratese, all in concordance with the original Swedish.</p>
<p><strong>I am going to tell &nbsp;</strong>you a fairy tale. It is of a woman; let us call her Pomperipossa, which is a good name to call someone in fairy tales. She lived in a land that we call Monismania, for we have to name it something.</p>

And even the wise men that ruled the country, oh, she thought they were so wise, and because of that she voted faithfully for them every time there was an election to decide who should rule Monismania. Those that had decided everything for more than 40 years had made such a good community, she thought. No one in the land needed to be poor, everyone got a piece of the welfare cake, and Pomperipossa&nbsp;was full of joy that she had been able to contribute&nbsp;a good portion&nbsp;of the cake as they baked it and spread the wealth around. Oh the sweet aroma from a well baked cake!</p>

It meant that the more money you earned, more of that money would go to the head tax master, so he could make a bigger welfare cake. But he would not take more than 80 to 83% from anybody; no he wanted to be reasonable. “Dear Pomperipossa,” he said, “you can keep around 17 to 20% for yourself and use whichever way you want.” And Pomperipossa was filled with joy and kept skipping down the road of life. There were though many unsatisfied people in the land who beat their shields and wailed about<strong> “the oppressive taxes”</strong>&nbsp;as they used to call it. Pomperipossa&nbsp;never did that, nobody in all of Monismania&nbsp;had ever heard even a sigh from her about her contributions to the welfare cake. On the contrary, she thought it was altogether good and fair so she had set her mind to keep giving her vote to the wise men so they could keep on doing the best for her dear Monismania.</p>
<p><strong>This Pomperipossa</strong>,&nbsp; she wrote books for children. She did it for the pure joy and pleasure of doing so, just to have a little fun here in her earthly life. She thought to herself: “Who knows, other children may be almost as childish as I am, maybe they too will read about these my marvelous imaginations?” It turned out that this they really wanted. Not only the children of Monismania&nbsp;but also in lands far, far away, both in the east and the west. People could hardly believe it, but there sat innocent little children in all corners of the world, and they read and read over-abundantly, without end! This led to Pomperipossa’s great misfortune, indeed, the more they read, the more money kept flowing to poor Pomperipossa. “Poor”, why poor? Wait till you hear this!</p>

Well, it wasn’t really a castle, more like a mansion that the King had used in previous centuries as a summer place so he could take walks in the beautiful gardens and listen to music played in the long northern summer evenings, all while the birds sang and the flowers flowered. Times had changed and the King could no longer afford the place, so he gave it to the wise men to take care of. The wise men liked to feel like the King used to, so they loved to gather there. But it was still winter, so they stayed inside. It must have been on a coffee break (the hallowed tradition of that <a href="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kanel.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="19" data-permalink="https://lenbilen.com/2012/01/24/pomperipossa-in-monismania/kanel/" data-orig-file="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kanel.jpg" data-orig-size="495,280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Kanel" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kanel.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kanel.jpg?w=495" title="Kanel" src="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kanel.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kanel.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kanel.jpg?w=150&amp;h=85 150w, https://lenbilen.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/kanel.jpg 495w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>country that nobody could think ill of, for there are both cinnamon buns and cookies and tarts served with real strong coffee), so they didn’t have the time to check even once after they made the list of new rules. They decided on strange new rules that made life puzzling to say the least, not only for Pomperipossa, but also for many other Monismaniacs. But of that Pomperipossa had no idea at first. Not until a good friend suddenly asked her:</p>
<p>“Are you aware of the fact that your marginal tax rate this year is 102%?”</p>
<p>“You are talking nonsense”, Pomperipossa said. “That many percent does not exist!”</p>
<p>For she was not particularly familiar with Higher Mathematics.</p>
<p>Oh yes, she was told, in Monismania&nbsp;there were percents&nbsp;without end, and if one put together the income taxes and the social employer fees that Pomperipossa&nbsp;had to pay, since she was a small business owner, it came to 102%, so Pomperipossa&nbsp;could say what she wanted! Poor, poor Pomperipossa, she just sat there and wrote early and often and did not even know that she was a small business owner. She really should have been proud: “Ah, I am a Small Business Owner, who could have thought?” But after she had counted the numbers for a while she found out slowly but surely that to be a Small Business Owner in Monismania was sure death warmed over.</p>
<p><strong>Thus she thought</strong> &nbsp;and thus she counted:</p>
<p>These terrible little children that are sitting in all the nooks and crannies of the world, reading together money for me, how much money will their disastrous eagerness to read bring me this year? Best case maybe only a million. Worst case two million. (Since the money came dribbling in from the four corners of the world, she never knew before it happened how much money she would get. Big fat checks could mercilessly attack her when she least suspected it.) Let us think the worst, Pomperipossa thought. Two million!</p>
<p>Then the taxes will be like this:</p>
<p>Of the first 150 000 the rascals are reading together for you, you get to keep, so they say, 42 000 kronor. The rest of the 150 000 = 108 000 is going to the</p>
<p>Welfare cake…… 108 000</p>
<p>100% of what is more than that… 1 850 000</p>
<p>And then the additional&nbsp;2 %, that you in your simple-mindedness did not think could be…… 37 000</p>
<p>Total for the Welfare cake…… 1 995 000</p>
<p>Left for Pomperipossa…… 5 000</p>
<p><strong>Having come thus far</strong>&nbsp;she said to herself: “My dear old woman, you have never been good at the third R! There are decimal points and all those things, surely you have counted wrong, surely there must be 50 000 left for you.” She started over, but the result did not change one bit – if you made two million, you got to keep 5000 – to live on!</p>
<p>Pomperipossa&nbsp;was worried, it can’t be denied, so she said to herself:”Not that you are a particularly big eater, but yet! 5 000 kronor – when the salted herring, that yesteryear was poor man’s food is priced sky high, and all other prices have followed.” Now she got really scared, and she jumped out screaming to herald friends and acquaintances her distress. But they did not want to believe her. “5 000 kronor, don’t you try that on me!” When she finally managed to convince them they said helplessly: “But you must have a lot of deductions?” What deductions? Pomperipossa wondered. Deductions are money you have paid out. You can’t eat them like salted herrings.</p>
<p><strong>Without finding</strong>&nbsp;any consolation, Pomperipossa&nbsp;went home and sat down in a dark corner to think and to brood. How will I get this day my daily bread? she thought. Maybe there are some poorhouses left, so I can beg a meal here and there? Maybe if I seek the wise men and knock on their doors, then maybe, just maybe they will show mercy and give me a bowl of soup every now and then, they can take a little of the 1 995 000 kronor, it could even be quite&nbsp;a full bodied soup, maybe they will even put a little piece of sausage in it?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;But not even the thought</strong>&nbsp;of sausage helped. Pomperipossa’s countenance grew darker and darker. She now understood that it was something dirty and shameful to write books, since it was punished so severely. How is it in other lands? she pondered. Well, she knew something about that, for she had just met a kind little Russian, and he was an author. His books were selling off the shelves, and he paid 13% in taxes. (Pomperipossa&nbsp;told him about her 102%, and then he fell of his chair. But as soon as he got off the floor he took a beeline home to tell everybody about this in his land.) Pomperipossa had also heard that in Ireland they cherished their authors very much, so much so that they didn’t take any tax at all from the income from their books. But that must be a lie, Pomperipossa thought.</p>
<p><strong>There was a lot of thinking</strong>&nbsp;done as she was sitting in her cranny. There were many other self-employed people in Monismania, not just herself. There were, for instance, doctors and dentists – and even lawyers in Monismania, and they had perhaps quickly figured out that the more you worked, the less you made, and had therefore decided to totally ignore the acute cholecystitis&nbsp;and impacted&nbsp;third molars and divorces and real estate transactions of all the Monismaniacs, at least one, two, three, four, or five days a week. This must be the reason that the monismaniacs&nbsp;were now in a real pickle when they got gallstones or aching wisdom teeth or needed a lawyer to buy an old house with a lot of debt, which was the best way, so Pomperipossa had heard, if one wanted to lower the 102 percent down to almost nothing. Even the chief tax master had done that, and he was glad he did.</p>
<p><strong>Having come thus far</strong>&nbsp; in her thoughts, Pomperipossa sighed. Why, oh why did she not have any debt at all, sitting in an apartment all her life? Oh, my dear parents, why did you teach me that debt is evil, something to be …</p></div></div>

<p>Clojure is one of the most interesting new languages targeting the JVM. Initially only the JVM, in the meantime it is also available for JavaScript. Essentially, you can write Clojure and either execute it as Java program or JavaScript program, of course each flavor has its unique features as well.</p>

<p>Clojure is a Lisp, thus the syntax may be foreign, but it is really, really easy since there are very few syntactic variations. The language “Lisp” is very lean and usually easily learned.</p>

<p>In this post, we’re going to create a complete REST application from scratch. There are already some (very) good tutorials available, but some are not quite up to date (see <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-web-application">Heroku’s Devcenter</a> or Mark McGranaghan for good ones). Clojure itself is still a young language, Lisp of course has a lot of history.</p>

<p>Our application should allow creating, listing, fetching, updating, and deleting of documents.</p>

<p>A document looks like this (JSON encoded):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
      <span>"id"</span> : <span>"some id"</span>,
      <span>"title"</span> : <span>"some title"</span>
      <span>"text"</span> : <span>"some text"</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>A GET call to /documents should return a list of these documents.</li>
<li>A POST call to /documents with a documents as body shall create a new document, assigning a new id (ignoreing the posted one).</li>
<li>A GET to /documents/[ID] should return the document with the given id, or 404 if the document does not exist.</li>
<li>A PUT to /documents/[ID] should update the document with the given id and replace title and text with those from the document in the uploaded body.</li>
<li>A DELETE to /documents/[ID] should delete the document with the given id and return 204 (NO CONTENT) in any case.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="creating-the-project-scaffolding">Creating the project scaffolding</h2>

<p>We’re going to use <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>, the defacto build system and dependency manager for Clojure projects. Download and install it, then execute:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">lein new compojure clojure-rest</code></pre></div>
<p>We’re creating a new <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki">Compojure</a> project called clojure-rest. Compojure is the library that maps URLs to functions in our program. Compojure (and our project) builds on Ring is the basic Server API. To start the new project run:</p>

<p>This starts the server on localhost:3000 and automatically restarts the server if any of the project files change. Thus, you can leave it running while we develop our application.</p>

<p>The <code>new</code> command generates two very important files for us:</p>

<p><code>project.clj</code> is the project configuration. It states dependencies, the entry point etc. (read the whole documentation on <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen.org</a>, and <code>src/clojure_rest/handler.clj</code> which contains a starting point for our application.</p>

<h2 id="project-configuration-project-clj">Project configuration (project.clj)</h2>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defproject </span>clojure-rest <span>"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"</span>
      <span>:description</span> <span>"FIXME: write description"</span>
      <span>:url</span> <span>"http://example.com/FIXME"</span>

      <span>:profiles</span>
      {<span>:dev</span> {<span>:dependencies</span> [[ring-mock <span>"0.1.3"</span>]]}})
Update the file to look like this<span>:</span>

(<span>defproject </span>clojure-rest <span>"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"</span>
      <span>:description</span> <span>"REST service for documents"</span>

                     [compojure <span>"1.1.1"</span>]
                     [ring/ring-json <span>"0.1.2"</span>]
                     [c3p0/c3p0 <span>"0.9.1.2"</span>]
                     [org.clojure/java.jdbc <span>"0.2.3"</span>]
                     [com.h2database/h2 <span>"1.3.168"</span>]
                     [cheshire <span>"4.0.3"</span>]]
      <span>:plugins</span> [[lein-ring <span>"0.7.3"</span>]]
      <span>:ring</span> {<span>:handler</span> clojure-rest.handler/app}
      <span>:profiles</span>
      {<span>:dev</span> {<span>:dependencies</span> [[ring-mock <span>"0.1.3"</span>]]}})</code></pre></div>
<p>Besides the JSON parsing library <a href="https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire">Cheshire</a>, we added the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c3p0/">C3P0 Connection Pool</a>, the <a href="https://h2database.com/">H2 Database</a> JDBC driver and Clojure’s <a href="https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc">java.jdbc</a> contrib-library.</p>

<p>I also updated the <code>:url</code> and <code>:description</code> fields.</p>

<h2 id="the-request-handler-handler-clj">The request handler (handler.clj)</h2>

<p>Next let’s have a look at the generated request handler <code>src/clojure_rest/handler.clj</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>ns </span>clojure-rest.handler
      (<span>:use</span> compojure.core)
      (<span>:require</span> [compojure.handler <span>:as</span> handler]
                [compojure.route <span>:as</span> route]))

    (<span>defroutes</span> app-routes
      (<span>GET</span> <span>"/"</span> [] <span>"Hello World"</span>)
      (<span>route/not-found</span> <span>"Not Found"</span>))

    (<span>def </span>app
      (<span>handler/site</span> app-routes))</code></pre></div>
<p>The route <code>GET "/" [] "Hello World"</code> is responsible for our result we saw in the browser. It maps all GET requests to / without parameters to “Hello World”. The (<code>def app (handler/site app-routes)</code>) part configures our application (registering the routes).</p>

<p>Our first step is to update the configuration. We’re going to work with JSON, so let’s include some Ring middlewares to setup response headers (wrap-json-response) and parse request bodies (<code>wrap-json-body</code>) for us. A middleware is just a wrapper around a handler, thus it can pre- and post-process the whole request/response cycle.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>def </span>app
      (-&gt; (<span>handler/api</span> app-routes)
        (<span>middleware/wrap-json-body</span>)
        (<span>middleware/wrap-json-response</span>)))</code></pre></div>
<p>We switched also from the <code>handler/site</code> template to <code>handler/api</code> which is more appropriate for REST APIs (<a href="https://weavejester.github.com/compojure/compojure.handler.html">documentation</a>).</p>

<p>Next let’s define the routes for our application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defroutes</span> app-routes
      (<span>context</span> <span>"/documents"</span> [] (<span>defroutes</span> documents-routes
        (<span>GET</span>  <span>"/"</span> [] (<span>get-all-documents</span>))
        (<span>POST</span> <span>"/"</span> {body <span>:body</span>} (<span>create-new-document</span> body))
        (<span>context</span> <span>"/:id"</span> [id] (<span>defroutes</span> document-routes
          (<span>GET</span>    <span>"/"</span> [] (<span>get-document</span> id))
          (<span>PUT</span>    <span>"/"</span> {body <span>:body</span>} (<span>update-document</span> id body))
          (<span>DELETE</span> <span>"/"</span> [] (<span>delete-document</span> id))))))
      (<span>route/not-found</span> <span>"Not Found"</span>))</code></pre></div>
<p>We define GET and POST for the context “/documents, and GET, PUT, DELETE for the context “:id” on top of that. :id is a placeholder and can then be injected into our parameter vector. The POST and PUT request have a special parameter body for the parsed body (this parameter is provided by the wrap-json-body middleware. For more on routes, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Routes-In-Detail">Compojure’s documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Before we define the functions to carry out the requests, let’s fix the imports and open a pool of database connections to work with.</p>

<p>The namespace declaration is used to define which namespaces shall be made available by Clojure.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>ns </span>clojure-rest.handler
      (<span>:import</span> com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource)
      (<span>:use</span> compojure.core)
      (<span>:use</span> cheshire.core)
      (<span>:use</span> ring.util.response)
      (<span>:require</span> [compojure.handler <span>:as</span> handler]
                [ring.middleware.json <span>:as</span> middleware]
                [clojure.java.jdbc <span>:as</span> sql]
                [compojure.route <span>:as</span> route]))</code></pre></div>
<p>We import C3P0’s <code>ComboPooledDataSource</code>, a plain Java class. Next, we fetch the functions defined in <code>compojure.core</code>, <code>cheshire.core</code>, and <code>ring.util.response</code> into our namespace, they can be used without qualifying. Finally we require some more libraries, this time with a qualifier to prevent name clashes or to support nicer separation. I’m not sure when to make the cut between <code>:use</code> and <code>:require</code> yet, so the cut is abitrary.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>def </span>db-config
      {<span>:classname</span> <span>"org.h2.Driver"</span>
       <span>:subprotocol</span> <span>"h2"</span>
       <span>:subname</span> <span>"mem:documents"</span>
       <span>:user</span> <span>""</span>
       <span>:password</span> <span>""</span>})</code></pre></div>
<p>Note, we use a in-memory database. If you’d like to keep your database between restarts, you could use <code>:subname "/tmp/documents"</code> for example.</p>

<p>Next we open a pool of connections. C3P0 has no Clojure wrapper, so we deal with Java classes and objects directly (hence a bit more code).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>pool
      [config]
      (<span>let </span>[cpds (doto (<span>ComboPooledDataSource.</span>)
                   (<span>.setDriverClass</span> (<span>:classname</span> config))
                   (<span>.setJdbcUrl</span> (str <span>"jdbc:"</span> (<span>:subprotocol</span> config) <span>":"</span> (<span>:subname</span> config)))
                   (<span>.setUser</span> (<span>:user</span> config))
                   (<span>.setPassword</span> (<span>:password</span> config))
                   (<span>.setMaxPoolSize</span> <span>6</span>)
                   (<span>.setMinPoolSize</span> <span>1</span>)
                   (<span>.setInitialPoolSize</span> <span>1</span>))]
        {<span>:datasource</span> cpds}))

    (<span>def </span>pooled-db (<span>delay</span> (<span>pool</span> db-config)))

    (<span>defn </span>db-connection [] <span>@</span>pooled-db)</code></pre></div>
<p>Since we deal with a in-memory database, we need to create our table now.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>sql/with-connection</span> (<span>db-connection</span>)
      (<span>sql/create-table</span> <span>:documents</span> [<span>:id</span> <span>"varchar(256)"</span> <span>"primary key"</span>]
                                   [<span>:title</span> <span>"varchar(1024)"</span>]
                                   [<span>:text</span> <span>:varchar</span>]))</code></pre></div>
<p>The intent should be easy to understand, for the details take a look at the <a href="https://clojure.github.com/java.jdbc/">java.jdbc documentation</a>. We create a table documents with a :id, :title, and :text column. Note that the database column is called id, not :id.</p>

<p>The only thing missing are the functions to actually perform the actions requested by our clients.</p>

<p>To return a single document with a given id, we could come up with this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>get-document [id]
      (<span>sql/with-connection</span> (<span>db-connection</span>)
        (<span>sql/with-query-results</span> results
          [<span>"select * from documents where id = ?"</span> id]
          (<span>cond</span>
            (<span>empty?</span> results) {<span>:status</span> <span>404</span>}
            <span>:else</span> (<span>response</span> (first results))))))</code></pre></div>
<p>It reads like this: when called with an id, open a database connection, perform <code>select * from documents where id = ?</code> with the given id as parameter. If the result is empty, return 404, otherwise return the first (and only) document as response.</p>

<p>The response call will convert the document into JSON, this functionality is provided by wrap-json-response, which also sets the correct Content-Type etc.</p>

<p>Another nice one is the creation of new documents:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>uuid [] (str (<span>java.util.UUID/randomUUID</span>)))

    (<span>defn </span>create-new-document [doc]
      (<span>let </span>[id (<span>uuid</span>)]
        (<span>sql/with-connection</span> (<span>db-connection</span>)
          (<span>let </span>[document (assoc doc <span>"id"</span> id)]
            (<span>sql/insert-record</span> <span>:documents</span> document)))
        (<span>get-document</span> id)))</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we use Java’s UUID generator (without import, hence the full package name) to generate a new id for each document created. The second let statement is responsible to replace the user-provided id (if any) with our generated one. Remember that Clojure’s datastructures are immutable, so we need to use the document variable thereafter, instead of the doc which still contains the old (or no) id.</p>

            <p>Posted on July 20, 2020 by K³</p>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>In August 2019, Ian Beer and Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero published a comprehensive <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html">article series</a> about several exploit chains of a professional threat actor who targets iOS users. As it describes the full details of all such exploit chains, the series is a good starting point for writing a custom exploit for the mentioned vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Writing a full exploit without experience on iOS can be an overwhelming task, though. While the actual vulnerabilities are well described, there are many obstacles in the way. For example, how exactly can the vulnerable functions be triggered? Or even, how to deploy and debug the exploit code? Moreover, not only the described vulnerabilities have to be exploited, but several techniques need to be chained together in order to get full access to the system.</p>
<p>The required information for the iOS exploit developer aspirant is scattered over many articles, books and presentations. Therefore, the aim of this blog post is to take one of the described kernel vulnerabilities, write an exploit from scratch for it and collect all background information of the development process in a cohesive article such that it could act as a reference for beginners. The article will be structured as follows:</p>
<p>In a very first step, the steps required to set up a test environment will be outlined.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the vulnerability itself and the trigger will be analysed in detail. This also includes a short introduction to IOKit drivers along with the accompanying reverse engineering process.</p>
<p>After that, an initial trigger for the vulnerability is described. The remainder of the article shows how to develop a full exploit using common techniques used in iOS exploits, step-by-step.</p>
<p>In particular, this article will investigate chain #3 of the original article series with a focus on the kernel exploit. The vulnerability was introduced in iOS 11 and was mitigated in iOS 11.4.1, the last version of this release. Also, as it is a double-free vulnerability, it seems like a good choice to get in first contact with iOS without knowing to much details of the several subsystems.</p>
<p>The sandbox escape of the original chain is not investigated. Instead, the exploit uses a technique that was revealed recently by Siguza<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Moreover, it should be noted that this is neither a full jailbreak nor does it implement the post-exploitation techniques of the in-the-wild exploit chain.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of this article - discussing an exploit already described by Ian Beer - some content will be overlapping with the original articles. However, the intention of this article is to fill possible potential gaps that might occur to exploit developers who are new to iOS.</p>
<p>Many of the described techniques should be applicable to current iOS versions as well with some being mitigated currently, though. We hope that this article is a good starting point for other iOS exploit developer aspirants nevertheless.</p>
<p>You can find the source code <a href="https://secfault-security.com/stuff/chain3.tar.xz">here</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/raymontag/chain3">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>One last thing before diving into the exploit: if you enjoy stuff like this, you might want to check our <a href="https://secfault-security.com/jobs.html">jobs</a> page. At the time of publishing this, we’re hiring ;)</p>
<h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2>
<p>Researching iOS requires the XNU open source part of the kernel as well as the iOS kernelcaches. The former is found at <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/">https://opensource.apple.com/</a> while the latter could be found at <a href="https://ipsw.me/">https://ipsw.me/</a>.</p>
<p>For the development of this exploit an iPhone 5S with iOS 11.2.5 was used. Any iPhone using the vulnerable driver and an iOS version below 11.4.1 should work.</p>
<p>It is suggested to use a Mac with Xcode installed as a build system. In Xcode, a free signing identity for iPhone development is needed. Execute <code>security find-identity</code> in a terminal and find the fingerprint of that identity. Copy the fingerprint into <code>Makefile</code> as the value for the variable <code>SIGNING_ID</code>.</p>
<p>It is possible to use a jailbroken iPhone<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> for development, but this is not a strict requirement. A jailbroken has the advantage that no sandbox escape is needed.</p>
<p>In order to run the exploit code delivered with this article, simple remove the application overhead and turn the function <code>exploit()</code> in the source code to the <code>main()</code> function. Copy the correct entitlements via <code>ldid</code> to the binary on the iPhone and copy the binary to <code>/Applications/</code>. Start the app via SSH.</p>
<p>If no jailbreak is available, the following approach may be used: Export your certificate identities to a file that can be read with <code>openssl</code>, using the following commands on a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>security export -t identities -f pkcs12 -o certs -k login.keychain
openssl pkcs12 -in certs</code></pre>
<p>Search for your iPhone development certificate and copy the value of <code>OU</code>. This is the team identifier. Copy that value to all <code>XXX</code> in the file <code>entitlements.plist</code>. The file has already the format that is needed to exploit Siguza’s sandbox escape<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The exploit is now ready for building and installation.</p>
<p>Build the exploit with <code>make</code> and install it with <code>ideviceinstaller -i chain3.ipa</code> from the same directory. In case this fails, you might want to build and install some demo application via Xcode and trust the developer certificate via the <code>Settings</code> app of the iPhone. Then it should be possible to install the exploit application as well.</p>
<p>To run and debug it, the device support files for the correct iOS version are needed. These can be found for instance on Github<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. After obtaining the files, open up two terminal windows. In the first window run <code>idevicesyslog | grep chain3</code>. This command will print the debug messages of the exploit. In the second window run <code>ideviceimagemounter DeveloperDiskImage.dmg</code> and then <code>idevicedebug -d foxhound.chain3</code>. The exploit should start on the iPhone and debug messages should appear in the first terminal windows.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Bug Analysis</h2>
<p>As already described in the introduction, Ian Beer covered all important details of the bug in depth in his article series. However, someone new to iOS exploit development might have several questions about the actual reverse engineering and exploitation process of this vulnerability.</p>
<p>As the aim of this post is to explain the exploit development process from scratch, this section of the article not only addresses the kernel vulnerability itself but also covers several fundamentals that are important.</p>
<h3 id="iokit">IOKit</h3>
<p>The vulnerability is present in an IOKit driver. IOKit is a collection of several resources such as frameworks and libraries to streamline the process of device driver development. IOKit drivers are developed in a subset of C++. This complicates the reverse engineering process but leads to specific vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, too.</p>
<p>IOKit drivers are so-called kernel extensions to the iOS kernel itself. They are prelinked in the kernelcache binary<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Information about these extensions is available in the <code>__PRELINK_INFO</code> segment of the kernelcache. Modern disassemblers like IDA Pro and Ghidra are aware of this.</p>
<p>For this article, the important aspect is that an IOKit driver gives the attacker an interface to the kernel space. Every IOKit driver provides one ore more so-called user clients, which provide external methods for user space processes, comparable to system calls. It seems natural to research these drivers in order to exploit the kernel as many researchers did in the past.</p>
<p>There is a snag to it, though. Many user clients are not accessible from a sandboxed process. Hence, some kind of sandbox escape is often required first. This is true for the bug exploited in this article as well. Ian Beer’s write-up discusses an escape that leverages a vulnerability accessible from the web browser’s process. As already mentioned in the introduction, the exploit described in this blog post will utilise a technique published by Siguza later on<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<h3 id="reversing-iokit-drivers">Reversing IOKit Drivers</h3>
<p>Before the bug itself can be discussed, it has to be identified in the kernelcache. Ian Beer used a kernelcache image of iOS 12 Beta 1 that is not available to the public anymore. Because Apple incidentally published a fully symbolized kernelcache (which actually should have the symbols stripped), they removed the download completely. Therefore, this article will give a short introduction about manually reversing IOKit drivers.</p>
<p>Like it was stated in the previous section, IOKit user clients provide external methods for user space processes. Comparable to C++ vtables, function pointers to these methods are defined in a table in the <code>__const</code> section of the <code>__TEXT</code> segment. This table is not just an array of function pointers, though, but of <code>IOExternalMethodDispatch</code> structs. This struct is defined in <code>IOUserClient.h</code> of the <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-4903.270.47/iokit/IOKit/IOUserClient.h.auto.html">open-sourced XNU kernel</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> IOExternalMethodDispatch {
	IOExternalMethodAction function;
	<span>uint32_t</span>               checkScalarInputCount;
	<span>uint32_t</span>               checkStructureInputSize;
	<span>uint32_t</span>               checkScalarOutputCount;
	<span>uint32_t</span>               checkStructureOutputSize;
};</code></pre></div>
<p>Besides the actual function pointer <code>IOExternalMethodAction function</code>, there are several size fields in this struct. These size fields serve the purpose of describing the sizes of input and output values of the respective <code>IOExternalMethodAction</code>. A more in-depth description of these values will be provided later on in this article.</p>
<p>In order to identify externals methods of an IOKit driver, one can use the following approach: Every user client implements the virtual method <code>externalMethod()</code>, which will take the function pointer from the table and call the actual method via a dispatch method. Because the external method table is stored in the <code>__const</code> section, <code>externalMethod()</code> contains a hard-coded pointer to the table. Therefore, the aim is to first identify the <code>externalMethod()</code> implementation of the respective IOKit driver and from there to inspect the external method table.</p>
<p>Actually, it is possible to reconstruct the complete IOKit user client tree as is described in the “iOS Hacker’s Handbook” or in a <a href="https://papers.put.as/papers/ios/2011/SyScanTaipei2011_StefanEsser_iOS_Kernel_Exploitation_IOKit_Edition.pdf">presentation by Stefan Esser</a>. …</p></div></div></div>

<p>One of the biggest misconceptions about Serverless is that it cannot support stateful applications. We have<a href="https://talkingserverless.com/2020/05/26/stateful-apps-with-serverless/"> already pointed</a> out that the new breed of Functions as a Service (FaaS) offerings support stateful applications. In this post, we will go a bit deeper on the topic and break the myth that Serverless is fit only for stateless applications. While we should not have any confusion about the constraints imposed by the FaaS abstraction, they are also good for most of the stateful applications. We will first look at the conventional wisdom about Serverless platforms and then talk about why it is wrong.</p>







<p>FaaS was originally built as a platform that deploys functions that takes the input and transforms into an output. This required an architectural rethink that componentizes a large application into smaller chunks. The constraints imposed by FaaS was a result of a newer business model that could offer compute capabilities for pennies. While the virtual machines in the cloud had ephemeral storage that required developers to rethink how they architect their applications, FaaS has made even compute ephemeral. This put severe constraints on the architecture and limited the kind of applications that can be deployed using FaaS. These constraints made people think that FaaS is only suitable for stateless applications.</p>



<p>Let us not delude ourselves here by thinking that deploying stateful applications with FaaS is easy. Even with virtual machines and containers on the cloud, there is operational overhead for developers to deploy stateful applications. FaaS abstraction is at a higher level where the developers need not worry about the underlying infrastructure, including both containers and virtual machines. This makes handling state a more difficult task for developers unless the FaaS providers offer a more seamless way to persist state.</p>



<p>Beyond the storage volume, FaaS has other constraints that make it difficult to handle stateful applications.</p>



<ul><li>Many FaaS providers offer severe constraints on the execution time. This is how FaaS providers can offer services for cheap. Persisting states with short-lived code execution are not easy</li><li>Early day FaaS offerings had the cold start problem that made it difficult to handle state persistence. Today, we have FaaS providers managing the cold start issues much better and some FaaS offerings don’t even have a cold start problem</li><li>Early day FaaS offerings didn’t make it easy to ensure that the state from one function execution is available to another execution of the same function. There is no way for two executions to share the state stored in the associated ephemeral storage. The only way to handle state is by storing in externalized storage which came with even higher operational overhead than handling external storage for virtual machines and containers, defeating the very advantage of FaaS</li></ul>



<p>Such constraints forced developers to focus mainly on stateless applications and, hence, had lead to the myth that FaaS is suitable only for stateless applications.</p>







<p>In spite of the constraints imposed by FaaS providers, it is possible to deploy stateful applications and persist state across multiple invocations. There are a few ways in which stateful applications can be deployed with FaaS:</p>



<ul><li>Connecting to the database directly. Except in the case of some serverless databases that scale seamlessly, developers need to ensure that the database can handle the load and scale properly. If done wrong, the costs could run high</li><li>Use a Backend as a Service (BaaS) offering which can abstract away the complexity in managing the data store and remove some of the operational overhead that comes with connecting directly to the databases</li></ul>



<p>As mentioned earlier, connecting to a database in a service like AWS Lambda adds some operational overhead to the developers. Also, If the database or BaaS is in a different Zone or Region, there is a latency that will impact the applications. However, a new breed of FaaS offerings like <a href="https://go.zoho.com/yIl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalyst</a>, Nimbella, etc. offer an integrated BaaS or data store, which usually is available in the same zone as the compute, and these services reduce the latency impact and remove any additional operational overhead for the developer. If you are looking for deploying stateful applications on FaaS, be sure to pick a provider like <a href="https://go.zoho.com/yIl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalyst</a> that can seamlessly support these applications.</p>



<p>Also, Azure Functions now offers <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=csharp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Durable Functions</a> that allow chaining of functions, opening up another opportunity for long-running applications that can handle the state better. Even though early day FaaS offerings made it easy to deploy stateless applications, newer offerings are explicitly supporting stateful applications in their platform. It is time for the developer community to look beyond stateless applications when it comes to use cases supported by FaaS. With the right platform, many stateful applications can be deployed but you may have to re-architect the application into a more modular architecture.</p>

	<p><small>July 20, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Many languages start running your program by calling a function of
yours that must have a specific name. In C (and many C derived
languages), this is just called <code>main()</code>; in Go, it's <code>main.main()</code>
(the <code>main()</code> function in the <code>main</code> package). Python famously
doesn't require any such function, and won't automatically call a
function called <code>main()</code> even if you create it. Recently I read
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">Why doesnâ€™t Python have a main function?</a>
(<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function">via</a>),
which puts forward one discussion for why this is so. However, I have
a somewhat different way of explaining this situation.</p>

<p>The core reason that Python doesn't require a <code>main()</code> function is a
combination of its execution model (specifically for what happens when
you import something) and that under normal circumstances you start
Python programs by (implicitly) importing a single file of Python code.
So let's look at each of these parts.</p>

<p>In many languages things like functions, classes, and so on are
created (defined) by the interpreter or compiler as it parses the
source file. In Python, this is not quite the case; instead, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/FunctionDefinitionOrder"><code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> are executable statements</a>,
and they define classes and functions when they execute (among other
things, this is part of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/WhyMetaclassesWork">why metaclasses work</a>).
When Python imports something, it simply executes everything in the
file (or the import more generally). When what's executed is <code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> statements, you get functions and classes. When what's
executed is regular code, you get more complicated things happening,
including conditional imports or calling functions on the fly under
the right conditions. Or you can write an entire program that just
runs inline, as the file is imported.</p>

<p>(This has some interesting consequences, including <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ReloadRealBehavior">what reloading
a Python module really does</a>.)</p>

<p>However, Python is not quite as unique here as it might look. Many
languages have some facility to run arbitrary code early on as the
program is 'loading', before the program starts normal execution
(Go has <code>init()</code> functions, for example). Where Python is different
from these languages is that Python normally starts a program by
loading and executing a specific single file. Because Python is
only executing a single file, it's unambiguous what code is run in
what order and it's straightforward for the code in that file to
control what happens. In a sense, rather than picking an arbitrarily
named function for where execution (nominally) starts, Python is
able to sneakily pick an arbitrarily named file by having you provide
it.</p>

<p>(Compiled languages traditionally have a model where code from a bunch
of separate files is all sort of piled up together. In Python, you can't
really aggregate multiple files together into a shared namespace this
way; one way or another, you have to <code>import</code> them and everything starts
from some initial file.)</p>

<p>Where this nice model breaks down and needs a workaround is if you
run a package with '<code>python -m ...</code>', where Python doesn't really
have a single file that you're executing (or it'd have to make
<code>__init__.py</code> serve double duty). As covered in the official
documentation's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html"><code>__main__</code> â€” Top-level script environment</a> (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function#c_jmer2v">via</a>),
Python adopts the arbitrary convention of loading a <code>__main__.py</code>
file from your package and declaring it more or less the point where
execution starts.</p>

<p>(Under at least some situations, your package's <code>__init__.py</code> may
also be executed.)</p>

<p>PS: contrary to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">the original article's views</a>,
<strong>I strongly suggest that you have a <code>main()</code> function</strong>, because
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ImportableMain">there are significant benefits to keeping your program importable</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. It is also a key basic unit to the quantum computer. Usually it could be visualized using a Bloch sphere.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to derive the connections between qubit and Bloch sphere.</p>

<h3 id="classical-bit">Classical Bit</h3>

<p>A classical bit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional classical system. A classical bit could only be in one state, either $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$. $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ are orthogonal basis. Usually $| 0 \rangle = [1, 0]^{\top}$ and $| 1 \rangle = [0, 1]^{\top}$.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-bit-qubit">Quantum Bit (Qubit)</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. A qubit is a superposition of two basic states, $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>A generic (normalized) qubit is of the form</p>



<p>where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are complex numbers, and $|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 = 1$. After taking the measurement for $| \psi \rangle$, the system would be collapsed to $| 0 \rangle$ with probability $|c_0|^2$ or $| 1 \rangle$ with probability $|c_1|^2$.</p>



<p>A complex number could be described using <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Complex-Number-Representations/">exponential form</a>.</p>



<p>Where $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ are real numbers. Therefore,</p>



<p>We could rewrite $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ using a new parameter $\frac{\theta}{2}$. We would see why we used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ shortly.</p>



<p>We multiple a complex number $e^{-i\theta_0}$ to $| \psi \rangle$.</p>



<p>We define $\varphi = \theta_1 - \theta_0$, we have</p>



<p>As we have discussed early in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-System-States/">quantum system states</a>, quantum system state $| \psi \rangle$ and $c | \psi \rangle$, where $c$ is any non-zero complex number, represent the same quantum system state. Since $e^{-i\theta_0}$ is a non-zero complex number, $| \psi \rangle$ and $e^{-i\theta_0} | \psi \rangle$ represent the same quantum system state. So we have</p>



<p>This means that, with two parameters $\theta$ and $\varphi$, we could determine a qubit state.</p>



<p>The next question is what is the minimum range of $\theta$ and $\varphi$ so that all the possible qubit states, $| \psi \rangle \in \mathbb{C}^2$s, are included? After taking the measurement of the qubit, the probability of observing $| 0 \rangle$ is $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ and the probability of observing $| 1 \rangle$ is $\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$. For different $\theta$s, if $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$s are the same, the qubit states, $| \psi \rangle$s, are also the same. Apparently, $0 \leq \frac{\theta}{2} \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e., $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$. If $\theta$ is out of this range, there is always a way to convert the $\theta$ into the range of $[0, \pi]$ while keeping $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ the same. For $\varphi$, there is not too much to say, $0 \leq \varphi &lt; 2\pi$.</p>



<p>To summarize, a qubit could be described using two independent variables.</p>



<p>Where $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ and $\varphi \in [0, 2\pi)$.</p>

<h3 id="bloch-sphere">Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.</p>



<p>Given the two-variable qubit formulation we derived above, it could perfectly fit into the Bloch sphere.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-14-Qubit-Bloch-Sphere/Bloch_sphere.svg.png">
    <figcaption>Bloch Sphere</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, respectively. Any coordinate, which could be uniquely described using $\theta$ and $\varphi$, on the sphere, represents a unique qubit.</p>



<p>It is also non-trivial to see that all the qubits on the equator, where $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, have equal probability of collapsing to $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, because $p(|0\rangle) = \cos^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $p(|1\rangle) = \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.</p>



<p>In addition, if the qubit is more closer to the north pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |0\rangle $ after taking the measurement. Similarly, if the qubit is more closer to the south pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |1\rangle $ after taking the measurement.</p>



<p>Moreover, an arbitrary pair of orthogonal qubits is mapped to antipodal (opposite) points of the Bloch sphere. This is because, any antipodal qubits have the following representations.</p>



<p>We would like to show that $\langle \psi , \psi^{\prime} \rangle = 0$ so that $| \psi \rangle $ and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$ are orthogonal.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>Last but not least, to answer why we had used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ in the qubit representation, it is because we want to make the qubit representation compatible with the Bloch sphere. If using $\frac{\theta}{2}$, $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the Bloch sphere matches $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the qubit representation.</p>

<h3 id="manipulate-qubit-on-bloch-sphere">Manipulate Qubit on Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>As we have partially shown in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">one of my previous posts</a>, all the classical logical gates could be considered as matrices, and all the classical bit manipulations are matrix multiplications. This also applies to quantum logical gates and qubits. Actually, all the quantum logical gates are unitary matrices. We would take this fact for now and I would probably explain this in my future blog posts.</p>



<p>Matrix $U$ is unitary if and only if</p>



<p>Unitary matrix preserves inner products. If $U$ is unitary, then for any $v, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$, we have $\langle Uv, Uv^{\prime} \rangle = \langle v, v^{\prime} \rangle$.</p>



<p>This could be easily proved by using the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">inner product properties</a>.</p>



<p>This means that unitary matrix $U$ also preserves the norm of any vector $v \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$.</p>



<p>Suppose we have a qubit $| \psi \rangle$ and unitary matrix $U$. Because $| \psi | = 1$, so $| U\psi | = 1$. In addition, given the orthogonal basis $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, because $\langle |0\rangle, |1\rangle \rangle = 1$, so $ \langle U|0\rangle, U |1\rangle \rangle = 1$. This means that $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are a new pair of orthogonal basis.</p>



<p>On the Bloch sphere, applying a unitary matrix $U$ to qubit $| \psi \rangle$ is equivalent to moving the coordinate of the qubit on the Block sphere, since unitary matrix preserves the norm of vector. Apply a unitary matrix $U$ to both $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ is equivalent to rotate the north and south poles, i.e. the coordinate system, accordingly.</p>



<p>If we look into $| U \psi \rangle$ more closely.</p>



<p>Since $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are also orthogonal basis, manipulating qubit is also equivalent to manipulating the entire coordinate system. The coordinates of $| U \psi \rangle$ in the new coordinate system ($U|0\rangle$, $U|1\rangle$) is the same to the coordinates of $| \psi \rangle$ in the old coordinate system ($|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$).</p>

This is a post I've been meaning to write for a while now: one anecdotally
comparing programming languages in the Lisp family. I consider myself to be a
Lisp hacker. Perhaps that much was obvious from the letter λ adorning my
website's header, a reference to the λ-calculus which inspired John McCarthy to
design the first LISP [1]. Yet, "Lisp hacker" likely means little unless you,
too, consider yourself to be a Lisp hacker. Calling yourself one seems carry
some level of unstated meaning. Indeed, some identify with more specific groups.
"Schemer," or "Guiler," or "Racketeer," or "Clojurist." But "Lisp Hackers" ⊇
"Schemers". There is commonality shared among all, or at least most, of these
programming languages, and the Lisp hackers recognize and appreciate that
commonality – the characteristics that make a programming language a Lisp.
Homoiconic syntax, powerful metaprogramming facilities, and editor support that,
in my opinion, is unparalleled. (Yes, I am alluding to GNU Emacs.) This article,
however, is concerned with the differences. In it, I will be considering the
specifics of each dialect, and whether or not those specifics make for a
language I would want to use to develop a new piece of software.
</p><p>
I'm specifically concerned with game development at the time of writing this
article. An idea for a turn-based tactics game came to me and I felt a Lisp
would be the best tool for realizing it, but the decision to use "a Lisp" still
leaves me with several choices. When I enumerate the notable design choices
behind each dialect, and talk about the approaches I prefer, my opinions will
be, in some capacity, framed as partial answers to the question of "will I be
able to comfortably use this to write a video game?" As such, there are a few
things I am specifically interested in:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Ergonomics</b>, or "a measure of the friction [one experiences] when trying to get
things done" [2].</li>
<li><b>Expressiveness</b>, or the ease with which code may be understood by a reader.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>, which is nontrivial to properly quantify [3]. I won't be rigorous
with this; a one-off run with <code>time</code> can give a good idea of the order of
magnitude for execution time.</li>
<li><b>Ease of distribution</b>, which is difficult to define, but with which I associate
platform agnosticism, a runtime that won't bloat my tarballs by several
gigabytes, and a lack of baroque and difficult to obtain dependencies.</li>
<li><b>Ability to interface with other libraries</b>, as I'll want to be able to
draw to the screen, and play sounds, and so on.</li>
</ul><p>
For each dialect, I'm allowing myself to use nonstandard functions. I'm aiming
for an evaluation of the practical aspects of each language, and if you were
writing software, you'd likely be using more than what's included in the R5RS or
ANSI CL standards. Though, if these nonstandard functions are specific to a
single implementation, I will avoid them. SRFI's and QuickLisp are fair game,
but CHICKEN's Eggs are not. Ah, I'm already getting ahead of myself. Yes, I will
be comparing Scheme and Common Lisp. I almost have to – the history of Lisp
tends to be spun as a schism between Common Lisp and Scheme. I will be speaking
of a few others as well. I've mostly chosen dialects for which there exists some
"game engine" type library. For R7RS (CHICKEN), there is <a href="http://alex-charlton.com/projects/Hypergiant/">Hypergiant</a>, for R6RS
(Guile) there is <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html">Chickadee</a>, for Common Lisp there is <a href="http://www.xelf.me/">Xelf</a>, and for Fennel there
is, of course, <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>.

</figure><p>
What follows are my opinions, so I'd like to lead with the background that
motivated them. My earliest "serious" experience with Lisp was with Peter
Seibel's <i>Practical Common Lisp</i>, which I picked up in high school following a
failed attempt at reading <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> The portion of the latter book that I did manage was enough to
convince me that learning <span>a</span> Lisp would be valuable, but that learning Common
Lisp may be more tractable than learning Scheme. The summer following my first
year of university, I taught myself Scheme to do <a href="http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a> for <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>. Guile
quickly grew on me, and I soon began <a href="http://jakob.space/blog/transition-to-haunt.html">using Haunt</a> for my personal website. I've
been unknowingly using Emacs Lisp since much earlier – not in the sense of
writing packages – my old man taught me how to use Emacs when I was nine, but I
was <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html">mostly shielded from having to write <code>setq</code> forms</a>. I've also used <a href="https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/">Hy</a>, <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>,
… well, I'm wildly off track now. Point being, I've used many Lisps, and I've
subconsciously acknowledged the differences between them, but never turned that
acknowledgment into coherent thought.
</p><p>
To aid in the comparison, I've written the same raytracer in several dialects of
Lisp. My reasons for choosing a raytracer are that:
</p><ul>
<li>I'm reasonably familiar with how they work.</li>
<li>Performance matters, and differences in performance is noticeable.</li>
<li>It's nontrivial, but several implementations of a raytracer is also more
tractable than, say, several implementations of a high-performance database.</li>
</ul><p>
Another consideration was the number of advancements in raytracing that build
upon the same basic structure, potentially giving me a way to compare the ease
with which a change to a system can be made, but writing these raytracers took
enough out of me that I didn't want to play with them any more.
</p><p>
This was not nearly as telling of a comparison as I had hoped. Once I'd
completed the first raytracer, everything that followed had the same structure.
Regardless, writing these raytracers gave me an idea of the characteristics I
was interested in, especially performance. For anyone who would like to look at
the code, the implementations are available <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo">here</a>.

<p>
Well, if we're writing a raytracer, then, we had better have some way of seeing
the results. The issue is portability. Ideally, I'd like to be able to run the
raytacers on different implementations of each language, but none of them have
standardized support for drawing graphics. An idea I had was to render the image
to the terminal using ANSI escape sequences, but I thought the resulting images
would be quite shitty. Instead, I decided to go the <a href="https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0-getting-started">route that tinyrenderer
takes</a>, which is to output to an image file. Initially, the image format I went
with was the venerable PNG. This was a mistake. Even if it did lead to a rather
elegant CRC procedure in Scheme.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>chunk-crc</span> bytes)
  (<span>define</span> (<span>process-byte</span> crc byte)
    (bitwise-xor (vector-ref png-crc (bitwise-and #xff (bitwise-xor crc byte)))
                 (arithmetic-shift crc -8)))
  (reduce process-byte bytes #xffffffff))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Realizing PNG was needlessly complex, I went on to write a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo/tree/master/write-bmp.scm">BMP encoder</a>, which
was fine until I came across <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/11/03/">an article</a> from Chris Wellons about rendering video
with C by encoding frames as <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/">Netpbm</a> images. I decided to scrap my BMP encoder
and go with PPM instead. Netpbm is text-based: the issue with a PNG or BMP
encoder in Scheme, for example, is that you're dealing with a binary format.
Glancing over the standards now, it seems there are, indeed, standardized
procedures for dealing with binary data in both R6RS and R7RS. Regardless,
dealing with those binary structures and having to consider endianness is a
pain. PPM is <span>dead</span> simple. In fact, I'd wager that if all you had access to were
the examples on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm">Wikipedia</a> page, you'd be able to write an encoder. Here's
the Scheme implementation:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>write-ppm</span> width height pixels)
  <span>"Encode the WIDTH by HEIGHT image given as PIXELS into the portable pixmap</span>
<span>format (PPM), writing the result to `(current-output-port)'."</span>
  (<span>define</span> (<span>delimit-values</span> values)
    (<span>cond</span> ((null? values)
           (newline))
          ((= 1 (length values))
           (display (car values))
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))
          (<span>else</span>
           (display (car values))
           (display <span>" "</span>)
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"P3"</span>))

  
  (delimit-values (list width height))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"255"</span>))

  
  (<span>for-each</span> delimit-values (vector-&gt;list pixels)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you do away with my nice formatting, that's twelve lines of code, all of
which are R5RS-compatible. We have access to the Netpbm suite, too, so if we
want a PNG, we can always <code>./write-ppm | pnmtopng &gt; test.png</code>. Netpbm is a
real hidden gem. Well, hidden to me, at least.

If you aren't familiar with Scheme, it has somewhat of a self-imposed<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
reputation for appealing to academic types. It's also one of the most
opinionated languages I know of; all the specs of interest lead with an
assertion that "programming languages should be designed not by piling feature
on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary." The way that Scheme embraces purity and
simplicity makes it clear it was designed by math nerds. (Hey, I'm a math nerd,
too. Take it easy.)
</p>

<p>
As I've just mentioned, there are specs. A few, to be sure. The evolution of
Scheme standards begins in a linear fashion: RRS → RRRS → R3RS → R4RS → R5RS. I
like to think of this as "classic Scheme". But when it came time to revise R5RS,
the ratification of the subsequent R6RS caused some controversy. It was
"bloated", or whatever. Something like that. So when it came time to design R7RS
(small), the Scheme Language Steering Committee decided to let the language
fork, beginning with the earlier R5RS as a blank slate [4]. That way, the nerds
that hated everything about R6RS could have their way, and the nerds that liked
R6RS could have their way. Scheme was divided, but at peace. Oh, and nowadays
there's a work-in-progress <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs-wg1-infra/src/default/R7RSHomePage.md">R7RS-large</a>. ಠ_ಠ
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to talk about R7RS-large here. It's just too …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Some abstractions are ticking time bombs, while others help you move fast. How can you tell? What follows is my personal exploration for how I assess abstractions.</p><h2>Problem</h2><p>We add abstractions in our programs to solve problems. So, let’s start with the fundamental value proposition: what problem does our abstraction solve? </p><p>Let’s take a look at one example abstraction:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(...) // =&gt; { intent: "set_alarm", at: "1593538633430" }</code></pre><p>This could be a natural language processing abstraction, which lets us take a piece of text, and extract meaning from it. The inherent problem of natural language processing is pretty darn complex, so an abstraction that helps us solve it would be very valuable. This is a sign of a good abstraction.</p><p>Now let’s compare that to </p><pre><code>StringSplitter.easySplit(str, splitStr)</code></pre><p>Maybe this abstraction, adds a light layer on top of string.split. For example, it may make it so you don’t have to worry about regexes, and can turn common string patterns into regexes. The value of a <code>StringSplitter</code> abstraction is pretty darn low. Maybe  <code>StringSplitter</code> treats <code>splitStr</code> in a way that’s a bit more in-line with the someone’s thinking, but at the end of the day this boils down to an indirection. </p><p>This leads us to the first principle. The more complex the problem it solves for you, the better the abstraction (1).</p><h2>Interface</h2><p>After we’re convinced that the abstraction we are about to add solves a tough problem for us, the next thing to consider is the interface: <em>how</em> do we interact with the abstraction? Imagine if <code>NLP.parse</code> was called like this:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code></pre><p>This is a great interface. It’s small. We don’t need to understand any internals. For the main use-case, all we need to do is to provide language and text. Compare that with</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(
  text,
  lang, 
  strategy,
  shouldUseFlagA,
  ...
  shouldUseFlagZ
)</code></pre><p>In order to use this version, we’d need to deeply understand the internals of NLP.parse. This lowers the value of the abstraction, because we need to do more work to solve the same level of complexity. </p><p>This leads us to the second principle: <strong>great abstractions have small interfaces.</strong></p><h2>Breakthrough Cost</h2><p>Now that we have an abstraction with a simple interface that solves a hard problem, we need to ask a possibly fatal question: what happens when we need to break through the abstraction? </p><p>All abstractions are leaky at some point. What will happen when you need the abstraction to behave differently? What will happen when it doesn’t work as you expect? </p><p>For example, for <code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code>, what if we needed to sort and score the results differently? What if there’s a bug, and we aren’t getting the entity we expect, can we look through and debug?</p><p>Understanding the answer to this, will give us the breakthrough cost. To do this, we need to peak through the code. How is <code>NLP.parse</code> implemented?</p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  return format(scoreEntities(fetchEntities(lang, text)))
}</code></pre><p>In one solution, it could be composed of other abstractions that we can take advantage of. This is a great sign, because we can reuse the underlying abstractions in cases where we need to do something more complicated. Compare that to </p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  internalParse(lang, text, flagA, flagB, ...flagZ)
}</code></pre><p>This feels more dangerous. If these flags all head to the same function, it’s a sign that a bunch of different features are complected together. It’s also worrying: what if one of these flags don’t do what you want? you may have to fork the abstraction.</p><p>This leads us to the third principle: <strong>great abstractions are transparent.</strong> I think this principle is the most overlooked. It’s easy to take the productivity win upfront, but if the abstraction you add can’t be changed, and can’t be introspected, it’s very likely to bite you at some point.</p><h2>Generality</h2><p>The final principle is orthogonal to the last three, but maybe it’s the most important. Hardy said <em>there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics —</em> So it is with abstractions. The beauty in math relates to how “general” and “tight” the solution is. I think this parallels well with abstractions. </p><p>If you use an abstraction that is “essentially” simpler, it’s more likely to last, and it’s likely to be more powerful.</p><p>Consider if the abstraction for <code>NLP</code>, was made up of specific algorithms, <em>just</em> for natural language processing. This would still be very valuable, but what would be <em>even more</em> valuable, is if the abstractions that this library was composed of was more general: if the parts that compose it were deep learning abstractions, you could reuse them for other problems.</p><h2>Fin</h2><p>And we reach the end. To pick great abstractions: pick the ones that solve a complex problem for you. Make sure they have a simple interface, and take a look at the internals, so you’re confident you can jig things up if needed. The more general and simple you can get for the same amount of power, the better. </p><p>Want to see some great abstractions in the wild? First, chances are you are using many of them: TCP, higher order functions like map &amp; filter, React. Some you may not have explored: Go’s CSP, Rich Hickey’s Datomic, or his <code>seq</code> abstraction in Clojure. As you pick up abstractions, I encourage you to run each one as an experiment: ask yourself at the end how things went, discuss them with your friends, and soon you’ll develop a much more nuanced taste.</p><p>(1) The rabbit hole gets deeper. Even if an abstraction solves a complex problem you have, you may need to take a step back and also ask: why do I have this problem? For example, kubernetes may be a great solution to building distributed systems, but why do you have a distributed systems problem? Many times the problem itself can be avoided. For the answer to that, <a href="https://stopa.io/post/241" target="_blank">Hacker’s Paradise</a> tries to covers it.</p><p><em>Thanks to Alex Reichert, Daniel Woelfel, Martin Raison, Sean Grove for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1259084270854905856">link</a> after <a href="https://www.longevity.vc/">link</a> after <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15174-3">link</a> after <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/11/researchers-able-to-improve-reverse-age-related-diseases-in-mice/">link</a> on the topic.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Six years ago, a lifetime in the aging field, the mere suggestion that aging could be reversed was enough to have your colleagues &amp; donors screw up their noses. Tom Rando <a href="https://twitter.com/StanfordMed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StanfordMed</a> deserves a shout out for being brave enough back then to use the word "reversal" openly 6/n</p>— David Sinclair, PhD (@davidasinclair) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1259912936602177536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

					<p>In Unix-like operating systems, the program communicates with the outside world and the operating system through a small set of functions – system calls. So, for debugging purposes, it can be useful to spy on the running processes with system calls. The utility <strong>strace</strong>, to which this article is devoted, helps to keep track of the “intimate life” of programs on Linux.</p>

<p>The main interface between programs and the kernel in Unix is system calls (syscalls), the interaction of programs with the outside world occurs exclusively through them.</p>
<p>In the first public version of Unix (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_6_Unix" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">Version 6 Unix</a>, 1975) there were no convenient ways to track the behavior of user processes. To solve this problem Bell Labs proposed a new system call – <strong>ptrace</strong> in the next version (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">Version 7 Unix</a>, 1979).</p>
<p>ptrace was developed primarily for interactive debuggers, but by the end of the 80s (in the era of the commercial-ready <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V#SVR4" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">System V Release 4</a>) narrowly targeted debuggers – system call tracers – appeared and became widespread on this basis.</p>
<p><a href="https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/eichin/cruft/machine/sun/sun-Strace" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">The first</a> version of strace was published by Paul Cronenburg on the comp.sources.sun mailing list in 1992 as an alternative to Sun’s&nbsp;proprietary utility named trace.&nbsp;Both the clone and the original were intended for SunOS, but by 1994 strace was&nbsp;ported to System V, Solaris, and the increasingly popular Linux.</p>
<p>Today strace only supports Linux and relies on the same ptrace, that has&nbsp;overgrown with many extensions.</p>
<p>A modern (and very active) maintainer of strace is&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ldv-alt" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">Dmitry Levin</a>.&nbsp;Thanks to him, the utility has acquired advanced features such as error injection into system calls, support for a wide range of architectures and, most importantly, a&nbsp;<a href="https://strace.io/Straus.png" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">mascot</a>.&nbsp;Unofficial sources claim that the choice fell on the ostrich because of the consonance of the Russian word “ostrich” and the English word “strace”.</p>
<div><p>It is also important to note that the ptrace system call and tracers were never included in POSIX, despite the long history and implementation in Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and traditional Unix.</p><!-- LSsquareUnit --><br>

<h3>Strace in a nutshell: Piglet Trace</h3>
<blockquote><p>“You are not expected to understand this” (Dennis Richie, Unix Version 6)</p></blockquote>
<p>From early childhood I hate black boxes: I didn’t play with toys, but tried to figure out their structure. Perhaps that is why the informal culture of the first Unix and the modern open-source movement is so close to me.</p>
<p>As part of this article, it is unreasonable to give a walk-through to the source code of strace, which has been racked up over decades. But there should be no secrets for the readers either.&nbsp;Therefore, to show the principle of operation of such strace programs, I will give share a miniature tracer –&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/vkazanov/strace-post/blob/master/examples/piglet-trace.c" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">Piglet Trace</a>(ptr).</p>

Tracee terminated</pre>
<p>Piglet Trace recognizes about a hundred Linux system calls (see <a href="https://github.com/vkazanov/strace-post/blob/master/examples/piglet-trace-syscalls.h" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">table</a>) and only works on x86-64 architecture. For educational purposes this is enough.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the work of our clone. In the case of Linux, the ptrace system call is used for debuggers and tracers, as mentioned above. It works by passing in the first argument the command identifiers, of which we only need PTRACE_TRACEME, PTRACE_SYSCALL and PTRACE_GETREGS.</p>
<p>The tracer starts in the usual Unix style: it fork(2) starts the child process, and that in turn exec(3) starts the program under investigation with the help of the child. The only subtlety here is the call ptrace (PTRACE_TRACEME) before exec, and the child process expects the parent process to track it:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="c">pid_t child_pid = fork();
switch (child_pid) {
case -1:
    err(EXIT_FAILURE, "fork");
case 0:
    /* Child here */
    /* A traced mode has to be enabled. A parent will have to wait(2) for it
     * to happen. */
    ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, NULL, NULL);
    /* Replace itself with a program to be run. */
    execvp(argv[1], argv + 1);
    err(EXIT_FAILURE, "exec");
}
</pre>
<p>The parent process should now call wait(2) in the child process, to make sure that the switch to trace mode has occurred.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="c">/* Parent */

/* First we wait for the child to set the traced mode (see
 * ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME) above) */
if (waitpid(child_pid, NULL, 0) == -1)
    err(EXIT_FAILURE, "traceme -&gt; waitpid");
</pre>
<p>This completes the preparations and you can proceed directly to tracking system calls in an endless loop.</p>
<p>The call ptrace (PTRACE_SYSCALL) ensures that the next waitparent ends either before the system call is made, or immediately after it is completed. Between two calls, you can perform any actions: replace the call with an alternative one, change the arguments, or the return value.</p>
<p>We just need to call the command twice ptrace (PTRACE_GETREGS) to get the state of the register rax before the call (system call number) and immediately after (return value).</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="c">/* A system call tracing loop, one interation per call. */
for (;;) {
    /* A non-portable structure defined for ptrace/GDB/strace usage mostly.
     * It allows to conveniently dump and access register state using
     * ptrace. */
    struct user_regs_struct registers;

    /* Enter syscall: continue execution until the next system call
     * beginning. Stop right before syscall.
     *
     * It's possible to change the system call number, system call
     * arguments, return value or even avoid executing the system call
     * completely. */
  if (ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, child_pid, NULL, NULL) == -1)
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "enter_syscall");
  if (waitpid(child_pid, NULL, 0) == -1)
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "enter_syscall -&gt; waitpid");

  /* According to the x86-64 system call convention on Linux (see man 2
   * syscall) the number identifying a syscall should be put into the rax
   * general purpose register, with the rest of the arguments residing in
   * other general purpose registers (rdi,rsi, rdx, r10, r8, r9). */
  if (ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, child_pid, NULL, &amp;registers) == -1)
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "enter_syscall -&gt; getregs");

  /* Note how orig_rax is used here. That's because on x86-64 rax is used
   * both for executing a syscall, and returning a value from it. To
   * differentiate between the cases both rax and orig_rax are updated on
   * syscall entry/exit, and only rax is updated on exit. */
  print_syscall_enter(registers.orig_rax);

  /* Exit syscall: execute of the syscall, and stop on system
   * call exit.
   *
   * More system call tinkering possible: change the return value, record
   * time it took to finish the system call, etc. */
  if (ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, child_pid, NULL, NULL) == -1)
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "exit_syscall");
  if (waitpid(child_pid, NULL, 0) == -1)
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "exit_syscall -&gt; waitpid");

  /* Retrieve register state again as we want to inspect system call
   * return value. */
  if (ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, child_pid, NULL, &amp;registers) == -1) {
      /* ESRCH is returned when a child terminates using a syscall and no
       * return value is possible, e.g. as a result of exit(2). */
      if (errno == ESRCH) {
          fprintf(stderr, "\nTracee terminated\n");
          break;
      }
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "exit_syscall -&gt; getregs");
  }

  /* Done with this system call, let the next iteration handle the next
   * one */
  print_syscall_exit(registers.rax);
}</pre>
<p>That’s the whole tracer. Now you know where to start with the next port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">DTrace</a> to Linux.</p>
<h3>The basics: running a strace program</h3>
<p>In order not to delve into the endless call list of a typical program, we will refer a <a href="https://github.com/vkazanov/strace-post/blob/master/examples/write-simple.c" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">minimal program</a> around&nbsp;write.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="c">int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char str[] = "write me to stdout\n";
    /* write(2) is a simple wrapper around a syscall so it should be easy to
     * find in the syscall trace. */
    if (sizeof(str) != write(STDOUT_FILENO, str, sizeof(str))){
        perror("write");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>
<p>Let’s build the program and make sure that it works:</p>
<pre>$ gcc examples/write-simple.c -o write-simple
$ ./write-simple
write me to stdout</pre>
<p>Finally, let’s run it with strace:</p>
<pre>$ strace ./write-simple
pexecve("./write", ["./write"], 0x7ffebd6145b0 /* 71 vars */) = 0
brk(NULL)                               = 0x55ff5489e000

<p>Disqus is one of the most popular commenting systems out there. However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">ZetaGlobal acquired Disqus in 2017</a> that changed the path of it. ZetaGlobal is a data-powered marketing technology company that “loves data”. So, they started using Disqus to collect data from millions of users around the world who visit websites that use Disqus as the commenting platform. Because of the “apparently free” pricing plan, Disqus had millions of websites using it, which made their data set the <a href="http://data.disqus.com/">largest on the web</a>. Disqus has lost a lot of users in recent times due to these privacy concerns, and there are plenty of reasons to remove Disqus. This blog post sums up 19 reasons why you should move away from Disqus.</p>
<h2>Reasons to Move Away From Disqus</h2>
<h3>1. Disqus places Ads on your Website</h3>
<p>If you are using the free plan of Disqus, they place ads on your website. This results in increased page load times, which will hurt your <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/on-page-seo-checklist/">on-page SEO</a>. It is also a bad experience for your users. Disqus seems to be crashing every party without any invitation. </p>
<h3>2. Disqus places Affiliate Links on your Website automatically</h3>
<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/disqus-potentially-adding-affiliate-links-users-content-opted/">Disqus was caught</a> placing affiliate links on the website without the consent of website owners. <a href="https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717122-how-to-disable-affiliate-linking">The official documentation says</a> that you cannot turn off affiliate links placed within the comments.</p>
<p>Let’s say one of your commenters mention “buy a camera on Amazon” (without links). Disqus will detect this and place a link from Amazon on this anchor text. When someone clicks this link and buys a product, Disqus will receive a commission. </p>
<blockquote><p>Disqus makes money <strong>from your content</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>3. Disqus is Owned by a Data/Marketing Company</h3>
<p>Most publishers think Disqus is a standalone company, which empowers social conversations on websites. Wrong! It is owned by a company called ZetaGlobal where your visitors become the product. &nbsp;Automattic founder&nbsp;<a href="https://replyable.com/2017/03/disqus-is-your-data-worth-trading-for-convenience/">Matt Mullenweg said in 2014</a>, “We’re tracking everyone who visits a website with Disqus enabled and building a profile on them based on the content of the sites they visit and any comments they leave. “Deeper” than Facebook.” This just says it all, doesn’t it?</p>
<h3>4. Disqus sells your Visitors’ Data without their Consent and has Violated GDPR</h3>
<p>Disqus collects user’s data from millions of their client websites. Worst, they sell them to big companies <strong>without the user’s consent</strong>. Their <a href="http://data.disqus.com/">data.disqus.com</a> website says their clients include companies like Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/martingund/status/1207327648093003777">This twitter thread</a> by Martin Gundersen reveals more information about their data selling. He calls Disqus a “Data Machine”.</p>
<h3>5. You are already Paying Disqus even when you Use the Free Plan (Spoiler: Your visitors are the products)</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the free plan isn’t free. You help the data company collect data. For example, assume that a.com and b.com have Disqus installed. You visit both websites on the same day. And, Disqus knows it! This is a crucial connection in the advertising field. When they sell it to another company, they will also know that you visited a.com and b.com. Advertising companies use this data to personalize the ads for you. So, there will be thousands of companies knowing what are your interests. </p>
<p>The same thing happens to your visitors. By using Disqus on your website, you are giving Disqus an opportunity to track them.</p>
<h3>6. You have to Pay to Remove Ads – But, there’s no Guarantee about User Tracking</h3>
<p>While you can subscribe to a paid plan of Disqus to remove advertisements on your website, there’s no mention if they stop tracking users. Disqus seems to track you and remember your computer, so to create another account and actually be able to comment, you have to find another computer. You’re being tracked in the name of advertising every step of the way on the Internet. In fact, Disqus is using the plugin to&nbsp;<strong>profile your visitors to later target them with ads</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Disqus makes your Website extremely Slow</h3>
<p>By injecting ads and third-party code to your website, Disqus will make your website extremely slow. Here’s a list of HTTP requests Disqus can add to your website:</p>
<figure><img src="https://fatfrogmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gtmetrix-redirects-problems-from-disqus-ads.jpg" alt="gtmetrix redirects problems from disqus ads" data-src="https://fatfrogmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gtmetrix-redirects-problems-from-disqus-ads.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Source: fatfrogmedia.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>The more HTTP requests you have the slower your website is. Disqus adds hundreds of spammy redirect links to your website. Additionally, it fetches a bunch of CSS and JS files to render the ads and affiliate links on your website. Even worst, these links come from third-party domains, which takes even more time to load due to <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/dns/">DNS resolving</a>. Additionally most people don’t have the time to create an account or switch between their Disqus profiles just to comment on a blog post. The year 2020 is all about hyper-distraction and inattentiveness. People ignore things that hinder progress. No one wants to spend five seconds logging into an account just to comment.</p>
<h3>8. Disqus discourages Commenters</h3>
<p>Disqus has millions of user accounts. However, it’s just a little fraction compared to 4 billion active internet users. Disqus doesn’t have a guest commenting option. While those who have Disqus accounts can comment easily from their account, what about others? Creating a new account just to post a comment isn’t reasonable. Guest commenting is a powerful option to have!</p>
<h3>9. Moderating in Disqus is complicated</h3>
<p>When you add a new website to Disqus, it creates a new subdomain for that website. You’ll need to switch between these subdomains every time if you moderate multiple websites. It makes moderation slower (And, it’s why <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/d51ppa/slack_redirects_subdomain_to_appslackcom/">Slack moved from subdomains to app.slack.com</a> in their web version). </p>
<p>And, their admin panel isn’t a single page application, which makes it even slower.</p>
<h3>10. Disqus is Old-fashioned</h3>
<p>At the time of 2010, Disqus’s design was innovative. However, this is 2020. There are new and better practices and tools to make web applications more user friendly. Despite its resources, the company failed to make the product user-friendly. The usability factor is a good enough reason to remove Disqus.</p>
<h3>11. Disqus isn’t Customizable</h3>
<p>Disqus has a similar appearance in all websites. It would be impossible to see the discussion box due to the color scheme; on certain website templates, the discussion box would be almost invisible. A visitor would not be able leave a comment because the discussion box may appear to be missing. The fact is that it is not possible to apply custom CSS to the new Disqus. The plugin will automatically apply a scheme based on the text color it inherits from a website. So depending on whether your template’s stylesheet has a light or dark color scheme, Disqus will make a selection. It cannot be as customized as you love. </p>
<h3>12. Disqus’s Pricing isn’t Flexible</h3>
<p>Disqus has free, plus ($9/month), pro ($89/month), and business (Custom pricing) plans. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-people-buy-factors-influence-purchase-descision#sm.0001o2k17imgbe7411rqj2vln3h2q">80% of consumers</a>&nbsp;consider pricing as a major deciding factor when shopping online: This is not only applicable to e-commerce sites but even to those in the plugin market. If you’re looking for more control over how you pay for a commenting platform, then look for that one option, which offers you a great deal of flexibility and added features.</p>
<h3>13. Disqus only has Single Sign-on in their Custom Pricing Plans</h3>
<p><a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/documentation/sso/introduction">Single sign-on (SSO)</a> is the most important feature for most companies. Disqus only provides it in their custom pricing plans, which is very expensive.</p>
<h3>14. Disqus Admins ban Websites without any Notifications</h3>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/disqus.com">some reviews</a> saying their websites are banned by Disqus for no reason.</p>
<h3>15. Users are banned for Political Opinions</h3>
<p>Freedom of speech is important. There are many converstaions going on regarding Disqus banning users (not moderators of websites but disqus admins) for just having political opinions.</p>
<h3>16. Disqus Exports your Data into a Messy XML Format</h3>
<p>If you ever need to import Disqus comments to your own database, you’ll need more developer resources as Disqus imports the data into a messy XML format. </p>
<h3>17. Disqus adds “Do Not Sell My Data” Badge to your Website</h3>
<p>Do you like to have such irritating badge on your website?</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png" alt="Do not sell my data badge by Disqus" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Do not sell my data – Disqus</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s one more thing to consider: Those who don’t know this badge is placed by Disqus may think <strong>you (the publisher) are selling data</strong>. Want to destroy the trust between you and your visitors? If no is the answer, you’ll definitely need to remove Disqus from your site and move to a new privacy-focused solution.</p>
<h3>18. Disqus has a Heavy Spam Detector</h3>
<p>Disqus’s spam detector is known to be harsh. It’s worst when non-spam comments are detected as spam. Again, destroying the trust between your users and you!</p>
<h3>19. Disqus Support is Poor</h3>
<p>Disqus <a href="https://disqus.com/home/channel/discussdisqus/discussion/channel-discussdisqus/poor_customer_support_from_disqus/best/">reportedly</a> has poor customer support. Moreover, it will be super hard to contact them if you have a problem to solve with your website. It will be impossible to do so if you are on their free plan.</p>

	<div><p><strong>Sally Rooney</strong></p><p>

It was four in the morning in Chennai when our bus driver fell asleep and drove us into a wall. No one was badly injured, and we could all get out of the bus okay. We found ourselves next to a themed restaurant with a plaster statue of King Kong outside.</p></div>
<p>I knew most of the other passengers, and we chatted together in English while we waited for the police, laughing in the slightly hysterical way that follows frightening events. It was late December, just a couple of days after Christmas, and we were in India for the World Universities Debating Championship. The bus service had been provided by the competition organizers, to take us directly from the airport to the hotel where we’d be staying free of charge for the duration of the tournament. The accident was an unexpected interruption of this schedule.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time I’d travelled overseas for a debating competition. I was familiar with how unlike ordinary travel it felt. A tight, transparent seal separated the competition from its setting: as long as you were in a place only in order to debate there, you could expect to encounter only the same privileged, English-speaking university students you had seen on the previous trip. You could also expect immaculate accommodation and relatively fast Wi-Fi. In Manila, two years before, a police escort had chaperoned our air-conditioned buses past roadside dwellings made partly of cardboard advertisements. No one failed to notice this fact, but what was there to say about it?</p>
<p>The bus driver in India was either unable to speak English or understandably reluctant to do so. Chennai is not a wealthy city, and he was not driving a bus full of gum-chewing college students to a luxury hotel at four in the morning for the good for his health. The passengers, a few of whom were American law students, complained freely despite his inattention. The legal responsibilities of the competition organizers were discussed. Formal avenues of redress were mentioned. Though I was slightly embarrassed at this posturing, I didn’t do anything about it. We all felt overwrought, not because the accident itself was so bad, but because something we had taken for stable was now not stable; the little seal of protection had ruptured. This didn’t feel like something we had agreed to.</p>
<p>Once the driver had spoken to the police, a new bus arrived. There was daylight by then, though it was a foggy urban light, as if filtered through milk. The driver helped us to move our luggage, but he did not accompany us on the new bus; we left him behind with a wrecked vehicle and two traffic police. I knew he had endangered our lives by falling asleep like that, but I still had the sense he was probably the most sympathetic figure on the scene.</p>
<div><p>When I was twenty-two, I was the number one competitive debater on the continent of Europe. After that I quit competing for good. In Chennai, I was just working as a volunteer in exchange for the cost of my flights and accommodation. I hadn’t really wanted to attend, but I found myself repeating phrases like ‘It’s a free trip to India’, until eventually I accepted the offer. When we got to the hotel that day I went straight up to my room and fell asleep. I woke up hours later, with all my clocks still on Irish time. It was after 10 p.m. locally. I padded downstairs to the lobby on my own, past the enormous Christmas tree and out the back entrance to the pool. Nobody else was outside, and the only light came up from underwater, the sting of blue chlorine. The pool was surrounded by trees. I sat on the tiled rim with my feet in the water for a while. In hotel rooms overhead, I could see people opening windows and switching lights on and off, but I couldn’t hear their voices. I heard nothing. And eventually I went back inside alone.</p><p>

College debaters are just students wearing ill-fitting formal clothes, and most of them aren’t even very good. But, crucially, some of them kind of are. When I first started attending college debates, I was a nearly friendless teenager living away from home for the first time; for me, the most talented speakers seemed to possess a subtle power and command that was almost glamorous. I started watching debates every week, just sitting in the audience, mostly on my own. I studied the speakers’ retorts and gestures, and tried to replicate them in everyday conversation. I even nursed intense romantic obsessions over droll counterfactuals.</p></div>
<p>College societies always need new members, so it wasn’t difficult to insinuate myself into this environment. Very soon I was making friends with committee members, staying out late after debates, and laughing sycophantically at everyone’s jokes. This kind of social landscape was different from anything I’d encountered before. For one thing, its structure was very clear. Popularity was not a mysterious arrangement of personal loyalties within a social code I didn’t understand: it was essentially just the same thing as success. Successful people were popular. You knew whose jokes to laugh at, because they were the people who gave the best speeches and said the cleverest things. I found this transparency encouraging somehow. The allocation of points in a debate was something clear and definable, and its effects on the distribution of social capital seemed clear and definable too. The more I observed the structure of public debates, the more I thought: I could do this. I could be successful and popular too.</p>
<p>Debating competitions take place at weekends throughout the academic year. To speak competitively, you need a partner: British Parliamentary style, the kind of debating common to the European and World Championships, requires teams of two. The bigger Irish tournaments host sixty or seventy such teams, as well as adjudicators, over the course of five group rounds, in which all teams participate, and then semi-finals and a final. An extensive specialized vocabulary exists to describe these relatively ordinary events. The rankings of teams and individual speakers, for example, are called ‘the tab’. When the tab is released at the end of a competition, either in stapled paper copies or online, everyone searches for their own name, and then their partner’s name, and then the names of people they especially like or hate. It doesn’t take long to pick that up.</p>
<p>At first I found the competitions almost unbearably exhilarating. I suffered from such intense nerves that I often couldn’t eat anything until the debating was finished. I also lost most of the debates I took part in. At the time, I was happy just sitting in the audience for the final and applauding at the right moments. I was self-deprecating about my own abilities, and sanguine in the face of defeat. Judges told me I had potential to improve, and obviously I felt this prospect was worth the continual low-level humiliation of failure. It’s hard to imagine my way back into that mindset now. I don’t think I will ever again want something so meaningless so much.</p>
<div><p>I was nineteen when I started debating competitively, and it’s probably fair to say that most things I did when I was nineteen were motivated by a desperation to be liked. I wasn’t only willing to lose debates: I was willing to tell all my secrets, to lend money when I couldn’t afford to, and to date anyone who showed an interest in me, no matter how dull or aggressive. I had low self-esteem and a predilection for hero-worship, and I was extremely determined. This was probably the perfect cocktail of tendencies for the novice debater. But by the time I could see that, I wasn’t a novice anymore.</p><p>

Competitive university debating requires of its participants a particular intersection of personal qualities. You have to enjoy talking out loud in front of people. You need to have a taste for ritualized, abstract interpersonal aggression. You have to be willing to tolerate physical and mental discomfort: weekends of sleeplessness, bad food or no food, and interminable group conversations about how tired and ill everybody feels. And you have to learn how to lose.</p></div>
<p>Thousands of students, probably tens of thousands worldwide, get involved in college debating every year; but few persevere, and so at the highest levels it is a relatively small community. At the big international tournaments, all the most accomplished speakers and judges know each other, and other people constellate around them in order of status. It is, at every level, a hierarchically organized activity. The more successful you are, the more people will stand around listening to you when you talk about how tired and ill you feel.</p>
<p>The economics of college debating are a little mysterious. Student societies collect membership fees, and raise money from sponsors and their universities in order to cover the costs of registering for competitions. The major competitions are also funded by corporate sponsors and by the host universities. Travel is often heavily or fully subsidized. Meals of varying quality appear on plates. Alcoholic beverages disappear from white tablecloths. Attendees need spend little or no money in the course of a competition.</p>
<p>Having established themselves on the competitive circuit, the most successful debaters are often offered funding to judge competitions in other countries. Sometimes you’ll get a spare room in a fellow debater’s loft apartment, sometimes a double room in a hotel. If you’re wise, you ask the organizers to book the flights for you in advance. You are almost always flying alone, and soon become skilled at asking strangers to place your luggage in the overhead compartment. Every person at the event will know your name; some of them will even want to talk to you. At a certain point, you are turning down more free trips than you take.</p>
<div><p>There’s no use joining a debating club with this jackpot in sight. Most debaters will never be invited on fully-paid weekend trips to Paris or Berlin. After logging a year or two of boring, thankless attendance …</p></div></div></div>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

Earlier for the sake of simplicity I told a little fib, and some of you have steam coming out of your ears by now because this fib is driving you crazy. I said that TCP guarantees that your message will arrive. It doesn’t, actually. If your pet snake has chewed through the network cable leading to your computer, and no IP packets can get through, then TCP can’t do anything about it and your message doesn’t arrive. If you were curt with the system administrators in your company and they punished you by plugging you into an overloaded hub, only some of your IP packets will get through, and TCP will work, but everything will be really slow.</p><p>This is what I call a leaky abstraction. TCP attempts to provide a complete abstraction of an underlying unreliable network, but sometimes, the network leaks through the abstraction and you feel the things that the abstraction can’t quite protect you from. This is but one example of what I’ve dubbed the Law of Leaky Abstractions:</p><p><strong>All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.</strong></p><p>Abstractions fail. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. There’s leakage. Things go wrong. It happens all over the place when you have abstractions.

Users almost always have multiple strategies available to pursue a goal — including deciding to work on something else entirely — and they will choose to use faster tools more and more frequently. Fast tools don’t just allow users to accomplish tasks faster; they allow users to accomplish entirely new types of tasks, in entirely new ways.

Lets start by digging into each of their namesake guarantees.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There’s a surprising symmetry between an HTTP request and a database’s transaction. Just like the transaction, an HTTP request is a transactional unit of work – it’s got a clear beginning, end, and result. The client generally expects a request to execute atomically and will behave as if it will (although that of course varies based on implementation). Here we’ll look at an example service to see how HTTP requests and transactions apply nicely to one another.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In APIs <em>idempotency</em> is a powerful concept. An idempotent endpoint is one that can be called any number of times while guaranteeing that the side effects will occur only once. In a messy world where clients and servers that may occasionally crash or have their connections drop partway through a request, it’s a huge help in making systems more robust to failure. Clients that are uncertain whether a request succeeded or failed can simply keep retrying it until they get a definitive response.</p></blockquote><hr><p><a href="https://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/" target="_blank">Notes on Distributed Systems for Young Bloods</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Distributed systems are different because they fail often • Implement backpressure throughout your system • Find ways to be partially available • Use percentiles, not averages • Learn to estimate your capacity • Feature flags are how infrastructure is rolled out • Choose id spaces wisely • Writing cached data back to persistent storage is bad • Extract services.</p></blockquote><hr><p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf" target="_blank">End-to-End Arguments in System Design</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This paper presents a design principle that helps guide placement of functions among the modules of a distributed computer system.

Examples discussed in the paper include bit error recovery, security using encryption, duplicate message suppression, recovery from system crashes, and delivery acknowledgement.

<p> 

In the last few years there has been quite a lot of activity in homebrew Retro-computing.  I really liked seeing things like the <a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/scene/craft/">Craft Demo</a>, the <a href="http://belogic.com/uzebox/index.asp">UzeBox</a>, The <a href="https://gigatron.io/">Gigatron</a> and <a href="https://eater.net/">Ben Eater's</a> amazing work in making all of this stuff accessible to mere mortals.  There are a lot of toy projects out there generating video signals, sometimes composite, sometimes VGA occasionally something more exotic.   This has inspired me to address something that has bugged me for a long long time in the hope that people might want do do some 4 bit digital output to generate a 16 colour palette that isn't completely hideous.</p>

<h3>Here's the problem </h3><p>

This is the original CGA palette.  Known as RGBI, four digital lines for Red, Green, Blue, and Intensity.  it looks like this 
</p><center><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> Black </td>
    <td> Red </td>
    <td> Green </td>
    <td> Dry Snot</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Blue </td>
    <td> Sad Magenta </td>
    <td> Sad Cyan </td>
    <td> Light Grey</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
    <td> Dark Grey </td>
    <td> Light Red </td>
    <td> Light Green </td>
    <td> Yellow</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Liht Blue </td>
    <td> Magenta</td>
    <td> Cyan </td>
    <td> White</td>
  </tr>  
  </tbody><caption>The Beauty that is RGBI.</caption>  
  </table>
  </center><p>
  
This arrangement of colours is somewhat unappealing.    To mitigate the worst of this a special case was introduced on the low intensity yellow colour where they halved the green brightness for that one colour.
This was a change to the monitors, not the video card, which strictly speaking had no concept of colour and merely output signals on 4 digital wires..
  

</p><center>
    <table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> Black </td>
    <td> Red </td>
    <td> Green </td>
    <td> Brown</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr><td> Blue </td>
    <td> Sad Magenta </td>
    <td> Sad Cyan </td>
    <td> Light Grey</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>

People managed to do quite a bit with that set but it wasn't an ideal arrangement.  When I look at homebrew video generators I can't help but think that there is a tendency to go with six or eight digital lines because four digital lines brings memory of this palette.    I wanted to know how much better you could make four digital lines without adding too much complexity.</p><h3>How did RGBI work anyway</h3><p>  
For starters lets look at an RGBI output mechanism.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rUu08JAtrqY/XxTv8IJswgI/AAAAAAAAAa0/QAuDa5Z6UoAYt9X05-qA4HCvd43R7jkXQCLcBGAsYHQ/s929/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi.png"><img data-original-height="522" data-original-width="929" height="351" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rUu08JAtrqY/XxTv8IJswgI/AAAAAAAAAa0/QAuDa5Z6UoAYt9X05-qA4HCvd43R7jkXQCLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h351/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi.png" width="625"></a></p><p>

This circuit is designed to convert four digital 5V lines coming in at the bottom to three analog signals for Red, Green and Blue.  This particular one places the Analog signals into the 0.0V - 0.7V range of a 75 Ohm VGA input.   The intensity line on the right contributes to each of the red green and blue lines evenly to make all levels brighter.  The diodes on the right prevent the original Red, Green, and Blue signals from  crossing over into the other channels.   Those diodes are not strictly necessary though, we are aiming for a visual representation, not mathematical accuracy. </p><h3>Let's do the dumbed down version</h3>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8nOaxU1nrSE/XxT0WWgkTsI/AAAAAAAAAcM/BYj31WTzBYkL0Z8SoLlnUXaWLkdyO9B-ACLcBGAsYHQ/s932/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi%2B-%2Bno%2Bdiodes.png"><img data-original-height="446" data-original-width="932" height="299" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8nOaxU1nrSE/XxT0WWgkTsI/AAAAAAAAAcM/BYj31WTzBYkL0Z8SoLlnUXaWLkdyO9B-ACLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h299/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi%2B-%2Bno%2Bdiodes.png" width="625"></a></p><p>

This arrangement eliminates the diodes. This means that when the Red line is on a small amount of current can travel back through the intensity resistors and onto the Blue and Green lines.  Running the numbers shows it's not really a problem though because the voltage is already dropped fairly low and has to go through another two resistors to get out one of the other lanes.  When the any one the RGB lines provides 0.3V a sneaky 0.01V slips through to the other two.  When two of the RGB lines are high the remaining one receives an extra 0.02V which isn't noticeable.</p><h3>Now mix things up</h3><p>  
To come up with a better arrangement, the plan was to introduce some asymmetry in the resistors to see what colours would come out.  I still wanted all lines High to provide white and all lines Low to be Black.  The rule of thumb is that if I drop the resistance on one of the colour lines I should correspondingly increase the resistance on the intensity line that contributes to that colour.  </p><p>

In this sense you would represent the traditional RGBI as
</p>
<center>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th> Output line </th> <th>Color Resistor</th> <th> Intensity Resistor</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Red </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Green </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Blue </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
These are not merely boolean options, a range of medium values are available.  You have a restriction that no output combination should produce a voltage higher than 0.7V on any line.  Additionally if you want to have a white, you need to have a set of resisters that provide 0.7V on all three RGB lines when all of the input lines are high.  Initially i tried an arrangement something like this.</p><center>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th> Output line </th> <th>Color Resistor</th> <th> Intensity Resistor</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Red </td> <td> Low </td> <td> High </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Green </td> <td> Medium </td> <td> Medium </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Blue </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>

<h3>A hint of lane crossing</h3><p>
I did some quick calculations on the colors and, while better,  I felt that the problem areas of the original RGBI system remained.  A good brown needs more Red than Green   So I tried shunting a little green over to red. After more tweaking and fiddling I decided to do the same with blue shunting to green and came up with 

</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AON7kUcR8tA/XxUAI7w6agI/AAAAAAAAAco/7AiKXLcmJs4ggCO2KNb05MmEVhbi1CMOgCLcBGAsYHQ/s960/Rgbi-alt.png"><img data-original-height="519" data-original-width="960" height="338" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AON7kUcR8tA/XxUAI7w6agI/AAAAAAAAAco/7AiKXLcmJs4ggCO2KNb05MmEVhbi1CMOgCLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h338/Rgbi-alt.png" width="625"></a></p><div>

  <h3>What should that look like?</h3><p> 
In theory the voltages produced by this arrangement of resistors should produce a palette something like this.</p><center><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> Black </td>
    <td> Red </td>
    <td> Green </td>
    <td> Brown</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Dark Blue </td>
    <td> Purple </td>
    <td> Sea Green</td>
    <td> Pale Brown</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
   <td>Steel Blue</td>
    <td> Blush</td>
    <td> Leaf Green </td>
    <td> Yellow</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Denim Blue </td>
    <td> Mauve</td>
    <td> Cyan </td>
    <td> White</td>
  </tr>  
  </tbody><caption>A theoretically better palette.</caption>
  
  </table>
  </center>
<p>
To me, that looks like a better set of colors.  We now have two tones of brown. The yellow is less intense, and stab-your-eyes magenta has been mellowed to a mauve. Sad magenta has been shifted over slightly to be a purple.  Sad cyan is now greener for a nice sea green. The pure greys are gone and replaced with pale colours. I'm rather happy with it.  
</p></div>

<h3>What does it actually look like?</h3>
<div><p>
Of course this doesn't mean anything unless i can actually get it working.   I wrote a small Arduino program to throw out some VGA 640x480 timings and a simple test pattern and put the resistor arrangement on a piece of breadboard.  I'm not well equipped when it comes to actually making things. So my creation was a bit of a Frankenstein's monster of what resisters I had lying about wired in combinations to make values close to what I needed.</p><p>
 In the end I got the Arduino outputting a signal that resembled VGA enough for a monitor to display it. <br></p></div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iNIIxmM1ASk/XxUvURltVPI/AAAAAAAAAdE/QN4ufc1rsGIMiCjWU65dJU8CAZTEipp2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/IMG_20200720_173606.jpg"><img data-original-height="745" data-original-width="800" height="583" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iNIIxmM1ASk/XxUvURltVPI/AAAAAAAAAdE/QN4ufc1rsGIMiCjWU65dJU8CAZTEipp2gCLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h583/IMG_20200720_173606.jpg" width="625"></a></p>
  <div><p>
  I was actually pretty chuffed to get colours that close to what I had calculated.       The stripes on the side a a series of 1,2,3 and 4 clock cycle bands.   Because the monitor is expecting 640x480 the digital nature of the LCD is quantizing to make the thinner bars uneven.  I'm a little torn between the simplicity of getting picture out of a plain Arduino or going for a 25.175MHz clocked chip and seeing what I can get it to do.</p></div>
  <p>
    Today's objective is however complete. Giving a better set of 4 bit colours hopefully will be of use to someone and inspire them to make some cool things with hardware that was never meant for that purpose.   At two pixels per byte there is less data to move around so potentially allowing for new things.  I already have a few ideas.  A 74LS157 would fairly easily handle turning a byte into two pixels. leaving more time for fetching the pixels in exotic manners.  An Arduino would probably use a 74LS158 and a 74LS04 because of the creatively inverted outputs on PORTD. <br></p>

<p>Recent advances in machine learning are consistently enabled by
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/">increasing amounts of
computation</a>. More
and more algorithms exploit parallelism and rely on distributed training
for processing an enormous amount of data. Both the need for more data
and more training impose great challenges on the software that manages
and utilizes the large scale computational resource.</p>
<p>Within Uber, we've developed algorithms like
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/poet-open-ended-deep-learning/">POET</a>,
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/go-explore/">Go-Explore</a>,
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/generative-teaching-networks/">GTN</a>,
etc., that leverage a large amount of computation. To enable future
generations of large-scale computation for algorithms like these, we
have developed a new system called <strong>Fiber</strong> that helps users scale what
might otherwise be only local computation to hundreds or even thousands
of machines with ease.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge-of-large-scale-distributed-computation">The challenge of large-scale distributed computation<a href="#the-challenge-of-large-scale-distributed-computation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In an ideal world, scaling an application that runs on one machine to an
application that runs on a cluster of machines should be as easy as
changing a command-line argument. However, that is not an easy task in
the real world.</p>
<p>While working with many people who run large scale distributed computing
jobs on a daily basis, we found that there are several reasons why it is
so hard to harness distributed computing nowadays:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>There is a huge gap between making code work locally on laptops or
    desktops and running code on a production cluster.</strong> You can make
    MPI work locally but it's a completely different process to run
    it on a computer cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No dynamic scaling is available.</strong> If you launch a job that
    requires a large amount of resources, then most likely you'll
    need to wait until everything is allocated before you can run your
    job. This waiting to scale up makes it less efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error handling is missing.</strong> While running, some jobs may fail.
    And you may be put into a very nasty situation where you have to
    recover part of the result or discard the whole run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High learning cost.</strong> Each system has different APIs and
    conventions for programming. To launch jobs with a new system, a
    user has to learn a set of completely new conventions before jobs
    can be launched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Fiber platform addresses each of these issues explicitly,
potentially opening up seamless large-scale distributed computing to a
much wider population of users.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-fiber">Introducing Fiber<a href="#introducing-fiber" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/uber/fiber">Fiber</a> is a Python-based
distributed computing library for modern computer clusters. Instead of
programming your desktop or laptop, now you can program the whole
computer cluster. Originally, it was developed to power large scale
parallel scientific computation projects like
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/poet-open-ended-deep-learning/">POET</a>
and it has been used to power similar projects within Uber. The key
features of Fiber include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy to use.</strong> Fiber allows you to write programs that run on a
    computer cluster without the need to dive into the details of the
    computer cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy to learn.</strong> Fiber provides the same API as Python's standard
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</a>
    library that people are familiar with. If you know how to use
    multiprocessing, you can program a computer cluster with Fiber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast performance.</strong> Fiber's communication backbone is built on
    top of <a href="https://nanomsg.org/">Nanomsg</a>, which is a
    high-performance asynchronous messaging library to allow fast and
    reliable communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No need for deployment.</strong> You run Fiber application the same way
    as running a normal application on a computer cluster and Fiber
    handles the rest for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reliable computation.</strong> Fiber has built-in error handling when you
    are running a pool of workers. Users can focus on writing the
    actual application code instead of dealing with crashed workers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Fiber can be used together with other specialized
frameworks in areas where performance is critical. Examples include
distributed SGD where many existing frameworks like
<a href="https://github.com/horovod/horovod">Horovod</a> or
<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html">torch.distributed</a>
have already provided very good solutions. Fiber can be used together
with such platforms by using Fiber's <a href="https://uber.github.io/fiber/experimental/ring/">Ring
feature</a>
to help to set up a distributed training job on computer clusters.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_overview" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_overview.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Fiber overview.</strong> The diagram shows how Fiber works on a
computer cluster. It starts many different job-backed-processes and runs
different Fiber components and user processes inside them. Fiber Master
is the main process that manages all the other processes. Some processes
like Ring Node maintain communications between each member.</p>
<p>Fiber can (1) help users who are working on large-scale distributed
computing to reduce the time to go from ideas to actually running
distributed jobs on computation clusters, (2) shield users from details
of configuration and resource allocation tasks, (3) enable faster debug
cycles, and (4) simplify the transition from local to cluster
development.</p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture<a href="#architecture" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fiber bridges the classical multiprocessing API with a flexible
selection of backends that can run on different cluster management
systems. To achieve this integration, Fiber is split into three
different layers: the <strong>API layer</strong>, <strong>backend layer</strong> and <strong>cluster
layer</strong>. The <strong>API layer</strong> provides basic building blocks for Fiber like
processes, queues, pools and managers. They have the same semantics as
in multiprocessing, but are extended to work in distributed
environments. The <strong>backend layer</strong> handles tasks like creating or
terminating jobs on different cluster managers. When a new backend is
added, all the other Fiber components (queues, pools, etc.) do not need
to be changed. Finally, the <strong>cluster layer</strong> consists of different
cluster managers. Although they are not a part of Fiber itself, they
help Fiber to manage resources and keep track of different jobs, thereby
reducing the number of items that Fiber needs to track. This overall
architecture is summarized in figure 2.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_architecture" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_architecture.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2: Fiber architecture.</strong></p>
<h3 id="job-backed-process">Job-Backed Process<a href="#job-backed-process" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fiber introduces a new concept called <em>job-backed processes</em> (also
called a <em>Fiber process</em>). It is similar to the <em>process</em> in Python's
multiprocessing library, but more flexible: while a process in
multiprocessing only runs on a local machine, a Fiber process can run
remotely on a different machine or locally on the same machine. When
starting a new Fiber process, Fiber creates a new job with the proper
Fiber backend on the current computer cluster.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_process" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_process.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3: Job-backed processes.</strong> Each job-backed process is a
containerized job running on the computer cluster. Each job-backed
process will also have its own allocation of CPU, GPU and other types of
resources. The code that runs inside the container is self-contained.</p>
<p>Fiber uses containers to encapsulate the running environment of current
processes, including all the required files, input data, other dependent
program packages, etc., to ensure everything is self-contained. All the
child processes are started with the same container image as the parent
process to guarantee a consistent running environment. Because each
process is a cluster job, its life cycle is the same as any job on the
cluster. To make it easy for users, Fiber is designed to directly
interact with computer cluster managers. Because of this, Fiber doesn't
need to be set up on multiple machines or bootstrapped by any other
mechanisms, unlike Spark or IPyParallel. It only needs to be installed
on a single machine as a normal Python pip package.</p>
<h3 id="components">Components<a href="#components" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fiber implements most multiprocessing APIs on top of Fiber processes
including pipes, queues, pools, and managers.</p>
<p><em>Queues and pipes</em> in Fiber behave the same as in multiprocessing. The
difference is that queues and pipes are now shared by multiple processes
running on different machines. Two processes can read from and write to
the same pipe. Furthermore, queues can be shared among many processes on
different machines and each process can send to or receive from the same
queue at the same time. Fiber's queue is implemented with Nanomsg, a
high-performance asynchronous message queue system.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_queue" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_queue.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4: Fiber Queue.</strong> This diagram shows a Fiber queue shared
across three different Fiber processes. One Fiber process is located on
the same machine as the queue and the other two processes are located on
another machine. One process is writing to the queue and the other two
are reading from the queue.</p>
<p><em>Pools</em> are also supported by Fiber. They allow the user to manage a
pool of worker processes. Fiber extends pools with <em>job-backed
processes</em> so that it can manage thousands of (remote) workers per pool.
Users can also create multiple pools at the same time.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_pool" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_pool.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5: Fiber Pool.</strong> A pool with 3 workers is shown. Two of them
are located on one machine and the other is located on a different
machine. They collectively work on tasks that are submitted to the task
queue in the master process and send results to the result queue.</p>
<p><em>Managers and proxy objects</em> enable Fiber to support shared storage,
which is critical to distributed systems. Usually, this function is
handled by external storage like Cassandra, Redis, etc. on a computer
cluster. Fiber instead provides built-in in-memory storage for
applications to use. The interface is the same as multiprocessing's
Manager type.</p>
<p><em>Rings</em> are an extension to the multiprocessing API that can be helpful
in distributed computing settings. A ring in Fiber stands for a group of
processes who work collectively together as relative equals. Unlike
<code>Pool</code>, <code>Ring</code> does not have the concept of a master process and
worker processes. All the members inside the <code>Ring</code> share about the
same responsibility. Fiber's Ring models a topology that is very common
in machine learning when doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">distributed
SGD</a>.

    At this point, we are not as fond of Facebook as we used to be. We mostly
    are just not that active anymore, abandoned entirely, or even considering
    deleting our accounts. Something is holding us still, though; we have part
    of our history there. On each "status update", we registered a moment, those
    posts add up to document years of our lives.
</p>

<p>
    Even if you want to keep your Facebook account to save these memories,
    they are hidden from you by Facebook's newsfeed algorithm. Facebook
    decides which of your memories to surface, not you, and it is very
    cumbersome to search for them. If you want to move out of Facebook, but
    keep your Facebook history and gain the ability to search your old posts
    quickly, Quid Sentio can solve your problem.
</p>

<h3>Understanding Quid Sentio</h3>
<p>
	If you are not familiar with Quid Sentio yet, it is a digital personal
	journal that you can share with your real friends. Using text, audio, and
	custom tags, you create private entries, with an easy way to filter and
	search, and the ability to share and comment with trusted friends (real
	friends, not the ones that are your "facebook friends").
</p>
<p>
	Quid Sentio has an import tool for Facebook status updates posts. First, you
	have to export and download your data from your Facebook account, then
	upload that file to Quid Sentio, and all your status updates become
	searchable journal entries.
</p>

<h2>How to export your Facebook posts</h2>

<p>
	The first thing to do is to download a file from Facebook with all your posts. Here
	is a step-by-step tutorial on how to do it.
</p>

<p><em>Note: the screenshots presented here are from the new Facebook interface.
If your Facebook still has the old design, it might look different, but
the options are largely the same (or very similar). You should be able to follow
these steps without any issue.</em></p>

<h4>1. Go to your Facebook settings</h4>

<p>At the top right, click on the down arrow to open the menu. Select
<em>"Settings &amp; Privacy"</em> and then again <em>"Settings"</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-menu.png" alt="Facebook menu, Settings &amp; Privacy option">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-menu-2.png" alt="Facebook menu, Settings option"></p><h4>2. Select "Your Facebook Information" and "Download Your Information"</h4>

<p><em>Note: Quid Sentio is prepared to identify the Facebook information structure
when it's written in English. If you use Facebook in another language, I suggest
you change it to English before exporting your posts (it is ok for the posts
themselves to be in another language).</em></p>

<p>
	In the Settings page, select the option
	<em>"Your Facebook Information"</em> on the left side menu.
</p>

<p>
	Then, among the presented options, click on
	<em>"Download Your Information"</em>.
</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-settings.png" alt="Facebook Settings page"></p><h4>3. Choose the format "JSON" and select "Posts" data to download</h4>

<p>You will see a box with download options. You must choose the format
<em>"JSON"</em>, so Quid Sentio can import your posts.</p>

<p>You can also decide which information you want to download. Quid Sentio will only
use <em>"Posts"</em>, but the information will be downloaded in separate files,
so you can choose as many as you want.</p>

<p>After selecting the <em>format: "JSON"</em> and <em>"Posts"</em>, click on the
button <em>"Create File"</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-download-select.png" alt="Facebook Information Download options"></p><h4>4. Wait until your file is available and download it</h4>

<p>You can't download your information immediately; Facebook has to process your
request. You will receive an email informing you that they are processing the
request and another email as soon as the request is processed and ready for
download.
</p>

<p>
    If you selected only the <em>"Posts"</em> type of information, it would
    usually take no more than 5 minutes. It might take longer if you selected more
    types of information.
</p>



<p>Once your file is ready, go back to the same page (<em>Settings &gt; Your
Facebook Information &gt; Download Your Information</em>). There, click on the tab
<em>"Available Copies"</em> and click on the <em>"Download"</em> button of the file
listed there.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-file-ready.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download"></p><p>You will download a compressed ZIP file (ending in <code>.zip</code>) with
separate folders for each type of information that you selected to download. The
file with your posts is usually called <code>your_posts_1.json</code>. Extract this
file from the ZIP file.</p>

<p>Now you have your file with all your Facebook posts downloaded at your
computer. You are ready to import them to your Quid Sentio journal.</p>

<h4>5. Create your Quid Sentio account and upload your posts file</h4>

<p>Now the easy part. Go to <a href="https://www.quidsentio.com/" target="_blank">www.quidsentio.com</a> and Sign Up.</p>

<p>Then click on <em>"Account"</em> at the top right, and you will see the button
to <em>"Upload your posts .json file"</em>. Click on it and select the file you
just downloaded from Facebook with your posts (the one probably called
<code>your_posts_1.json</code>).</p>

<p>You will see how many status updates posts you have and show the button to
<em>"Start import process"</em>. Click on it and see the count of imported posts
going up. Please do not close the site or refresh the page until it finishes its
process.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-account.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download">

<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-import.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download"></p><p>That's it! You have now transformed all your Facebook status updates into
Quid Sentio journal entries. Experiment a little bit searching through your
older updates and explore your past in a way that Facebook never allowed!</p>

<h2><strong>Why</strong> transfer your posts from Facebook to Quid
Sentio?</h2>

<p>You know how to do it, but you might be wondering why do it. Here is a list
of a few advantages of having your Facebook update posts on Quid Sentio:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        You can search and filter your posts.<br>
        Quid Sentio clearly shows all your old posts, with easy ways to filter
        by keywords, also allowing you to add custom tags for future reference.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        You will not be tracked or manipulated to addiction at Quid Sentio.<br>
        Quid Sentio is not supported by ads, so there is no need to track your
        every move nor use every trick in the book to keep you mindlessly
        scrolling. Quid Sentio does not use any third-party client-side tracking.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        You will have better control over your privacy.<br>
        Every entry (including the imported ones) is visible only to you by
        default. You can add real friends to your Quid Sentio network and
        individually decide for each entry who can read it. There
        is no way to search for people at Quid Sentio. You will have only
        the people you manually added as your friends.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>A few disclaimers</h3>

<p>In case you are new to Quid Sentio, there are a few things that are important
for you to know before deciding to import your Facebook posts.</p>

<p>You will only import your Facebook Status updates posts. The downloaded "Posts"
file includes lots of other types of posts that are not status updates. Things
like posts on your friends' timelines, posts on groups, on events. Those things
do not match the format of journal entries, so all of those are ignored. Just
your status updates are imported as Quid Sentio entries.</p>

<p>You will not import your Facebook pictures. While Quid Sentio entries allow for
images, it is a very different experience from Facebook with its
albums. You are better off downloading Facebook pictures and keeping at your
computer or another photo service of your choice.</p>

<p>You will not import your Facebook "friends". Quid Sentio meaning of "friends"
is very different from Facebook's. I believe you should add friends to your Quid
Sentio network very consciously, adding only those you really trust. I designed
Quid Sentio to avoid "contact spam" of any form. So I will not ask or even allow
you to upload your list of friends to Quid Sentio. You have to add them one by
one.</p>

<p>Quid Sentio is a paid service, not supported by ads, but by customers that
pay for it if they find it valuable. While you can create an account for free and
import all your Facebook status posts also for free, after that, you will have
become a Supporter ($19/year) to be able to create more entries.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, you can import your posts and leave them at Quid Sentio for
free. Only if you want to continue to create new entries that you need to become
a paying supporter.</p>

<p>Quid Sentio still does not have an export tool of its own. I do believe
everyone should have control of all the data they update to an online service.
The only reason Quid Sentio does not have this feature is that I am the sole
developer of Quid Sentio, so things are a bit slow to build. The export tool is
on the roadmap, so rest assured that by the time you sign up to Quid Sentio,
create a few entries, and decide to move out to another service and export your
data, it will  be ready.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/turing-basins">last post</a>, I shared my journey through understanding the link between entropy, thermodynamics, evolution, computation, and mathematics. At the end, I shared some preliminary research on using entropy/complexity to classify the behavior of Cellular Automata (CA) and perhaps pave a road to finding more universal CA (those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My8AsV7bA94" target="blank">capable of computation</a>). At that time, I only had a handful of samples which, albeit showing promise, fell short of demonstrating concrete results.</p>

<p>I am incredibly excited to share that I have now run my simulations on <em>every possible</em> Life-Like Cellular Automaton rule (a total of 262,144 rules), and it shows some great potential in classifying every rule based on its emergent behavior. Not only that, but this method establishes what appears to be a strong metric for finding “islands” of rules that have similar behavior.</p>

<p>This is exciting news, because past classifications of even elementary CA such as the semi-totalistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood" target="blank">Moore neighborhood</a> variety (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton" target="blank">Life-Like</a> CA) have either required generalizations that are computationally intractable to ascertain, or required a great deal of manual filtering and edge-case handling in order to separate sets of rules into classes.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/expository/rule_30.png" alt="Rule 30"></p>

<p>Stephen Wolfram (one of the biggest researchers in CA) <a href="https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/02-2-2.pdf" target="blank">proposed</a> a four-level classification scheme for one dimensional cellular automata. He later extended these definitions to include two-dimensional cellular automata like the Life-Like CA we are looking at here. The classifications are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to a homogeneous state.</em></li>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to a set of separated simple stable or periodic structures.</em></li>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to a chaotic pattern.</em></li>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to complex localized structures, sometimes long-lived.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>But, as mentioned in <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/ca/wolfram.html" target="blank">this post</a> regarding some caveats about these classifications, gliders have been found in all four of these classes. This is problematic because gliders are one of the most essential parts of data transmission in machines built inside of CA, so the four classes may not be enough to identify the presence or absence of a universal CA. Also, <a href="https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/02-2-2.pdf" target="blank">it has been shown</a> that, given a rule, finding which class a CA belongs to is an undecidable problem (for one-dimensional CA at least, but I would imagine the argument abstracts well to any Cartesian dimension).</p>

<p>My goal here was to focus on dynamic classification of the emergent properties of any given CA given its rules. By not subscribing to manually generated labels on classification, we can instead focus on developing a metric of similarity. In this sense, each rule becomes its own “class” and you can find rules that are sufficiently close in behavior to be considered the same class. Geometrically, this would be an analysis of CA by way of clustering.</p>

<p>The difficult part, of course, is developing a representation of a given rule that would allow for clustering. I settled on producing a curve of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" target="blank">Kolmogorov complexity</a> across the generations of the automaton’s universe. My inspiration for this approach came from a few core concepts. First, that entropy and complexity looked like valid metrics to measure the emergent behavior of a system and its potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organized_criticality" target="blank">self-organized criticality</a>. My reasoning behind this intuition is that structure typically implies order, and order implies either repeating patterns or extension of structure that can be derived from existing structure. Kolmogorov complexity would capture the amount of bits required to express this structure. I later learned that this view is not a new one, as Wolfram took a similar approach in examining the procession of spacial and temporal entropy in <a href="https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/pdfs/universality-complexity-cellular-automata.pdf" target="blank">his research on one-dimensional CA</a>.</p>

<p>In a addition to the convenient dualistic simplicity of studying life-or-death CA, the grid of an automaton can be interpreted as a bitmap image. Image compression is (unsurprisingly) adept at finding something close to the smallest possible representation of an image, and PNG compression does it without loss of information. Image compression asymptotically <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/papers/cluster.pdf" target="blank">approximates Kolmogorov Complexity</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266795088_A_Safe_Approximation_for_Kolmogorov_Complexity">up to a constant</a> dependent on the compression algorithm. Therefore, as the compression algorithm is the same for each measurement, we have a viable pipeline for estimating the Kolmogorov complexity of each state of the CA universes we encounter. If we wish to relate all of this back to entropy, we can do so. <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/papers/info.pdf" target="blank">Entropy is the expected value of Kolmogorov Complexity</a> in this context, so this data will be useful for that as well.</p>

<p>In order to get an amortized generalization of each rule, I started from random initial states of the universe with each cell having an equal probability of starting in any of the possible states. I then ran simulations for hundreds of generations with multiple random initial conditions and found the average complexity at each step. Other researchers looking into the general behavior of CA have taken this approach of random initial state and it seems to be a valid way to capture their behavior.</p>

<p>Lastly, I chose to study only Life-Like CA. These are the semi-totalistic CA rules that only depend on the Moore neighborhood of each cell. This made the search space something that I could simulate in reasonable time, given that it only had around a quarter million possible rules (even though it still took two weeks to generate all of the data).</p>

<p>The result of these simulations were 262,144 records of the average complexity in bytes of the board of all possible Life-Like CA. Each record had 256 samples, each record was averaged from 10 runs, and each rule was run with a board size of 100x100 cells.</p>

<h2 id="using-umap-a-digital-telescope">Using UMAP, a Digital Telescope</h2>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/expository/webb.jpg" alt="James Webb Space Telescope"></p>

<p>Obviously, no one has the time to go through the graphs of over a quarter million samples, so I needed to find a way to classify the results. Recently I have been infatuated with the <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="blank">UMAP</a> algorithm. It has the ability to compress data with thousands of dimensions into a lower dimensional space (in this case 2D or 3D) while still preserving structures/features in the data. It is a remarkable feat of algebraic topology that deserves more awareness of in the scientific community.</p>

<p>When first learning about dimensionality reduction algorithms such as UMAP or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding" target="blank">tSNE</a>, I was extremely skeptical of their efficacy. It seemed impossible to retain structure when losing that many dimensions. What made their usage click for me was the knowledge that, even if your data lives in a space that has thousands of dimensions (called the ambient space), there is a very good chance that the <em>local dimension</em> of real-world data is of much lower dimension than this. The goal, then, of UMAP is to preserve the structure found in the data by finding a good manifold to embed it into. For further understanding on this topic, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU" target="blank">presentation</a> that Leland McInnes (the creator of UMAP) gave on his algorithm.</p>

<p>In a sense, UMAP is a digital telescope that lets us look at constellations of high-dimensional data that we have never had the ability to visualize before. Algorithms like tSNE have worked in similar ways in the past, but UMAP is the first algorithm to be efficient enough to run on data with thousands of dimensions using something as prosaic as a laptop and a dream. This is to say that UMAP scales incredibly well, especially when compared to what is already out there.</p>

<p>Armed with UMAP, I fed the algorithm all 262,144 vectors (each with 256 dimensions, one for each complexity snapshot) and patiently waited for the embedding to complete. After fifteen minutes of my laptop revving up my fans, I had my first snapshot of the overarching structure of the Life-Like CA (points are colored by the average forward difference between each complexity snapshot):</p>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/plots/selected_run/UMAP_CA_Full.png" alt="UMAP Embedding"></p>

<p><a href="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/plots/selected_run/UMAP_CA_Full_High_Res.png" download="">(High-Res Version)</a></p>

<p>There it was, the massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram" target="blank">Hertzspring-Russel</a>esque serpent hiding in the structure of emergent complexity in automata. It is important to note that compressing dimensions can make parts of the data look separate in the embedding, even though they are connected in the ambient space they came from. It would be reasonable to assume that the serpent is one continuous entity, and the “jump” in the center was a result of the embedding.</p>

<p>While beautiful, this representation would not mean much if it did not accomplish the goal we set out to achieve: a metric for classification of rules that behave in similar ways to a given starting rule. Starting from the Game of Life, I began examining nearby rules and found that the metric did indeed yield other rules that produced uncanny behavior.</p>

<p>What is fascinating about this embedding is that it extends the idea of Stephen Wolfram’s four-level classification of CA to a continuum that can be embedded in as many dimensions as you see fit. CA classically known for supporting persistent structures and gliders such as Game of Life, Day and Night, and High Life exist in the middle of the serpent where the average difference is on the edge of chaos. CA that burn through complexity at a higher rate such as Morley, Anneal, and Diamoeba are far out on the tail of the serpent, along with many rules that result in universes that either die out quickly or fill the whole board with live cells (two low-complexity attractors). Meanwhile, rules like Replicator (which duplicates existing structure) exist in the head of the serpent where complexity stays roughly the same throughout the generations. Rules at the head seem to tend very quickly towards chaos, an apt opposite to the rules found in the tail.</p>

<p>
I needed an idea for the covers of the series of books that I'm writing,
<a href="https://aiprobook.com/"><i>Interactive Programming for Artificial Intelligence</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
My budget was (close to) zero, and I can't call myself an artist. Many ideas came
and went; none of them were distinctive enough. They weren't communicating the
message of the book series.
</p>

<p>
The main message of the book series? These aren't just
tutorials teaching some contemporary programming skills. I hope they are
much more than that!
</p>

<p>
This book series has an <i>interactive</i> approach. Every concept I'm writing
about is immediately illustrated with executable code. You can try it right away
in Clojure's amazing super-console: <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">the REPL</a>, which provides a genuine connection between
the programmer and the running program.
</p>

<p>
These are <i>programming</i> books. They go beyond theory, and they do not stop
at cute demos. The code you'll write is fast, flexible and extendable.
The real thing. Comprehensive, but approachable.
</p>

<p>
Not all of the books are strictly about <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>,
they are also about the programming foundations that are important
in building AI software.
</p>

<p>
These are several challenging areas on their own. Math: it's tough. AI: it's abstract.
Functional programming: it's funky. High performance computing on the GPU: get out of here!
Together? It's a tough sell!
</p>

<p>
Finally though, the answer fell into my lap. Meet Dog and Bird, they are two friends
that bravely immerse themselves into challenging activities and make them effortless and fun!
</p>

<p>
These books are great for beginners. It's not easy, but everything is simply explained.
You don't have to be an expert to start, but you will become one as you progress.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.12.3"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo">Last week, in-home fitness startup Mirror was acquired by Lululemon for $500M. Just under a month ago, Hydrow—a connected indoor rowing machine—announced $25M in new funding. A few weeks before that, reports surfaced that Tonal, a wall-mounted connected-exercise station, was in talks to raise additional funding at a $250M valuation. Over the last quarter, Peloton sales jumped 66%. To date in 2020, the entire in-home fitness market has been scorching hot. Much of the growth is due to COVID, however, this market was set to expand regardless of our current circumstances. What should have taken 5-10 years to unfold happened in 10 weeks. Now that we’re here, there’s no going back—the genie is out of the bottle. In-home fitness is having its moment, and I don’t expect it to end anytime soon. </p><p id="viewer-2hjad">Despite the gradual re-opening of gyms across the globe, I don’t see the traditional usage of gyms or fitness studios ever fully returning. Don’t get me wrong, I’m beyond excited to get back into the gym once restrictions in NYC are lifted. Having been stuck at home doing bodyweight workouts for several months, I can’t wait to be back in the gym lifting weights again. But I’ll never go back to the same routine I had before COVID. As someone who has gone to the gym 5-6 days a week for the past decade, that realization had a profound impact on my future outlook for the fitness industry. It crystalized my view that in-home fitness isn’t just a trend—it’s the future. </p><p id="viewer-8paom">If someone like me—an incredibly sticky user for the traditional gym model—is willing to change habits, what does that mean for the millions of casual gym-goers? Those who have made the transition to working out at home are likely to continue doing so in the future, at least some of the time. It's incredibly convenient. Over the past two years, we've seen a Cambrian explosion of in-home fitness equipment and on-demand workouts. There have never been more options for working out without needing to go to a gym or studio. Classes at yoga and fitness studios typically range between $25-40 per class.</p><p id="viewer-d7das">Why pay that amount for a single class when you can pay $12.99 a month for unlimited access to on-demand and live classes on the Peloton app? If Peloton isn't your jam, there are a plethora of other options out there for any type of workout you can imagine. Sure, there is something different about attending a class in person. It's invigorating and you and feed off the energy of those around you. But what do you price that experience at? </p><p id="viewer-coaat">In-person classes also have a community component, sometimes even a cult-like following. Studios like Soul Cycle and Barry's Bootcamp have an army of die-hard followers. But the community aspect has translated well over to the digital world. Peloton has built a thriving community with over 2.6 million members. Soul Cycle is going digital as well with the launch of their in-home. Soul Cycle's in-home classes will live on the Variis app, which also includes on-demand classes from Equinox, Pure Yoga, and Precision Run. What this signals to me, is that in-person will become the luxury, and in-home/on-demand the norm. </p><p id="viewer-c4da5">On the tech front, in-home and on-demand fitness products are rapidly innovating. The future of fitness technology will be like nothing we've ever experienced. We’re starting to see what’s possible with the use of AI and motion tracking in products like <a href="https://zenia.app/?ref=producthunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenia</a> and <a href="https://tempo.fit/product?irclickid=0nL2IAQ1xxyOTWrxU-SAVSQkUkiUckzpuywv3Y0&amp;irgwc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tempo</a>. Zenia is a personal yoga assistant that leverages computer vision and motion tracking to analyze your movements. It's able to give you real-time feedback on your poses and recommend adjustments on the fly. Tempo is an AI-powered home gym that tracks your motion and improves your form. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154185/tempo-smart-home-gym-kinect-computer-vision-ai-form-correction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This article</a> in <em>The Verge </em>gives a great explanation of how it works. We’re also seeing the potential for VR in the space with products like <a href="https://fitxr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FitXR. </a>They developed an immersive VR boxing game and plan to launch several new fitness games. These examples are just the tip of the iceberg of FitTech that we'll see in the future.</p><p id="viewer-cipfk">Along with rapid advancements in tech, consumer sentiment is shifting towards working out at home. COVID has been a huge accelerator of this trend. With gyms closed, most people have had no choice but to workout at home. This led to mass demand for in-home fitness equipment as well as supply shortages. It also forced gyms and studios to create digital offerings. The number of Instagram and YouTube workouts have also skyrocketed. As a result, the transition to working out at home has been much easier than many folks anticipated. Somebody with no fitness knowledge at all can get started with just a few taps on their iPhone. Add in the convenience of working out at home, and it becomes clear this trend is likely to stick. </p><p id="viewer-3vmpn">Combining these trends with advancements in FitTech, I see the market for in-home and on-demand fitness overtaking brick and mortar gyms within the next decade. For context, the global health &amp; fitness club industry is currently valued at nearly $100B. The International Health, Racquet &amp; Sportsclub Association estimates that 20% of Americans have a membership to some type of fitness club. At the end of 2017, the ‘digital fitness’ market, which includes in-home equipment, was projected to grow to $27.4B by 2020. I’ve yet to see any concrete numbers following the onset of COVID, but I’d struggle to believe that valuation hasn’t been left in the dust. Peleton alone currently sits at a ~$18B market cap. </p><p id="viewer-3jia3">In thinking about the potential market size for in-home fitness, I keep returning to comments I recently came across from Charlie Songhurst—a prolific investor and former Head of Strategy at Microsoft. In discussing East vs West Coast Investors, Charlie states that “<em>West Coast investors do very well when you have a product leap that does not get evidenced in the numbers immediately but is such a tactile and visceral experience when you use it, that you have to make an imaginative leap to turn that into numbers.”</em> He goes on to note the early iPhone as an example, <em>“One of the things you realize is that there was a cohort of investors that thought Apple was overvalued at a $100-200B market cap because they took the TAM of Nokia and said even if they take all of their share, this business can’t be that big, because they couldn’t intuit the increase in pricing power you were going to get for turning the phone into a computer.” </em></p><p id="viewer-740u6">While it's silly to equate the in-home and on-demand fitness market to Apple and the launch of the iPhone, I do think you can draw parallels. Many smart and well-qualified investors made the easy mistake of using Nokia's TAM to gauge Apple’s prospects with the iPhone. I think folks using the TAM of the health &amp; fitness club industry to define the market for in-home and on-demand fitness market will be making a similar mistake. </p><p id="viewer-a3hh3">The first half of 2020 opened my eyes to the possibilities of in-home and on-demand fitness. It's now clear to me that this market has the potential to be much larger than many people realize. I’ll be keeping close track of this market and am excited about the growth and innovation to come. </p><p id="viewer-fb6fh"><em>If you’re working on something in this space I’d love to connect and discuss.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Being great at building software doesn’t make you great at building a software company.  It sounds silly now, but when I started Haught Codeworks, I thought if I could put together a great engineering team then building the business would take care of itself.</p>
            
            <p>Apparently, I’m not the only one with this impression.  You commonly hear that business owners need to work <strong>on</strong> the business, not <strong>in</strong> the business.  I loved building software so much that I just wanted to stick with that.</p>
            
            <p>The problem is that your business won’t reach its potential if you only work in the business.</p>
            
            <p>My biggest regret with running Haught Codeworks is how I’ve failed to bring awareness to who we are and what we do as a company.  I could go into the many reasons why I never put much energy into that, but that would be enough content that it would deserve its own post.</p>
            
            <p>Since the beginning, clients found Haught Codeworks purely through word-of-mouth. I never did any marketing or promotion.  I had a wide network in the software industry so we got enough business through referrals to make promotion unnecessary.  But there was a downside to this approach that I wasn’t aware of.  People knew about me but didn’t know about Haught Codeworks.</p>
            
            <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
            
            <p>This came to light a couple years ago when one of my apprentices, Louisa Barrett, was at a software conference and someone asked her where she worked.  She answered that she was an apprentice at Haught Codeworks.  No one recognized the name.  She clarified, “I work for Marty” and they replied, “Ah, great you work for Marty!”</p>
            
            <p>This wasn’t an isolated incident. Many of our team members have had similar experiences.  When Louisa told me about her experience, it took me off guard. How much potential business have I missed over those years?</p>
            
            <p>It wasn’t simply about name recognition for the company, but a deeper awareness of what we do and how we do it.  I’m known by many for the events I organize.  I have been a relentless community builder for the past 11 years.  I’ve also been building a small, niche software consultancy with expertise in lean software development.</p>
            
            <p>How many out there know that I’ve honed a very efficient and effective way to build rapid prototypes that evolve into production-grade applications?  How many know that my team has successfully worked remote 100% of the time for over 10 years?  How many know that I’ve run a software apprenticeship program for the past 4 years?  How many businesses could we have helped had I spread awareness of Haught Codeworks?</p>
            
            <h2>Giving Back</h2>
            
            <p>I’ve been building software for 20 years and I’ve seen a lot of different ways to build better teams and products.  Though I’ve blogged about these topics sporadically over the past decade, I haven’t turned a lot of my attention to sharing what I know.  Our <a href="https://haughtcodeworks.com/newsletter">newsletter</a> represents my commitment to change that, to give back to the greater software community.</p>
            
            <p>Not only do I hope you will join me on this adventure, but I hope you keep me honest about sticking with it.  It’s so easy to let the pressure of product deadlines and new potential projects overtake our daily lives.</p>
            
            <p>I’ve had so many great conversations in person at software conferences over the last 12 years.  I ask that you continue to give me feedback and help me improve how we build great software products and teams.</p>
            
            <p>I also ask that you help share this <a href="https://haughtcodeworks.com/newsletter">newsletter</a> with anyone you think might find it beneficial. Thanks, and I look forward to popping up in your inbox more often!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>There are a lot of books in the world. How do you choose which ones to read?</p><p>There are at least two questions here:</p><ul><li>What topics should I read about?</li><li>What books do I read within a topic?</li></ul><p>For some people, the answer to the topic question is easy. They're obsessed with a given topic. They move onto the second problem.</p><p>For others, like myself, the first can be daunting. It's not that there aren't enough topics, it's that there are too many. If I look at my Goodreads want to read list right now, I see books on the following:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1138264.Mathematical_Models_of_Social_Evolution">Mathematical models of social evolution</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256965.Six_Myths_about_the_Good_Life">Philosophical views on the good life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49930783-why-we-re-polarized">Political polarisation in the US</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178447.Leaders">Nixon's take on different state leaders</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23582015-principles-of-neural-design">Neuroscience and neural design</a></li></ul><p>Each of these topics seem great and the books seemed good enough to justify saving. I have 176 more on my list. A friend just emailed me about<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Liberalism-Failed-Politics-Culture/dp/0300223447"> Why Liberalism Failed</a> and it turns out that book looks interesting as well. How to choose?</p><p>This post is about modeling my reading engine. It's about reading for insight, reading to uncover valuable and relevant information and skills. There are other reasons to read, like to relax or for social reasons. They can be related, but I'm largely going to ignore those reasons here. This may come across as utilitarian and boring, but that's the cost of being serious.</p><p>Let's step back and consider what kind of decision is at stake here. Decisions can vary on the following dimensions:</p><ul><li>reversibility</li><li>stakes</li><li>prior uncertainty</li><li>post certainty</li></ul><p>When decisions are irreversible, you'll want to ensure that you take the correct one. So you'll spend more time on the decision. If they are reversible and you learn you made the wrong decision, no problem, you can change. Choosing between job offers is the sort of thing you'll likely want to spend a decent amount of time on. The switching costs are usually high. If you want a better example, consider the decision of whether to have a kid or not.</p><p>If decisions are high stakes, deciding correctly matters more. Not so much if they're smaller potatoes. Spend more time on choosing a job, less time on what to watch this evening.</p><p>If decisions are made in a shroud of uncertainty, then the value of additional information will be higher. Prior uncertainty refers to the amount of uncertainty before a given decision. Often, "When it comes to perceiving reality, our minds are in a fog."</p><p>Post certainty refers to the amount and rate of relevant information flow after making a decision. That's a bit abstract, but we all know that after some decisions, you'll know right away whether you made the right one. Ordering at some restaurants is like this. After other decisions, such as longer term investments, you may never know. To be more precise, a decision will be higher in post certainty to the degree that, after you make the decision, you get relevant information and you get that information quickly.</p><p>With these in mind we can see that the decision to read on a particular topic is:</p><ul><li>reversible</li><li>medium stakes</li><li>variable prior uncertainty</li><li>reasonable post certainty</li></ul><p>The decision is reversible because you can stop reading at any point. Reading is somewhat important (it depends), but not as high stakes as many decisions we make. There can initially be a lot of prior uncertainty, ideally this goes down over a life. Occasionally, the result of a decision won't be evaluable for years, for example, when it's tied up with a risky research project. An example of this is deciding to become an expert in nanotech in the early 2000s. Yet if you know that you want to take a bet on high risk, world shaping technological developments then, by asking the right questions, you'll be able to reduce uncertainty. Given that you're studying nanotech, you can evaluate whether you're studying the right issues within that domain. You can do all of this even if the decision to study nanotech won't be evaluable for years.</p><p>So choosing what domains to hop into is reversible, medium stakes, has variable uncertainty, and has a reasonable amount of post certainty.</p><p>There are two key upshots here:</p><ul><li>First, what you read is determined by your projects. If you're uncertain about your projects, that uncertainty will trickle down. When I was studying philosophy, learning software engineering, or heads down in<a href="http://stoameditation.com/"> Stoa</a> I had less uncertainty about what to read. If I'm exploring different projects, there's more uncertainty.</li><li>The second, is that deciding what to read is a game you'll play over and over again. It's a reversible decision that you can get better at.</li></ul><p>What you want to think of doing then, is designing a reading engine. You're not making one-off judgements about what to read for all time. Instead, you're setting up a system for selecting, consuming, and then utilizing information. Books play a small role in that ecosystem - they're not even the primary unit.</p><h3 id="building-a-reading-engine">Building A Reading Engine</h3><p>This engine can be modeled as a pipeline:<br></p><figure><img src="https://www.calebontiveros.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-7.47.11-AM.png"><figcaption>Created with <em><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>'s </em>nascent <em>diagram tool.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Reading is the core activity. But it's interwoven with a number of other activities.</p><p>What I read is influenced by what I've collected into my reserves, projects, the questions I'm asking, and curiosity.</p><p><strong>Reserves</strong><br>The reserves is a list of books that I found intriguing at one point or another. It isn't a list of books to read. That seems too prescriptive - I won't read every book in my reserve. Instead, it's a list of books that I may read, if I get excited about the relevant topic. The books are on deck, as it were.</p><p>Some of my favorite ways to populate my reserves is through interviews, blog posts, conversations, and Twitter. I usually find the best pieces at the end of bibliographies or during a simple search.</p><p><strong>Projects</strong><br>The most influential driver of this pipeline is projects. I like to think of my life as organized around a few projects or goals. Some of these are mundane, others grand. Whatever they are, they should guide what you read. If you're looking for insight, that's in the purpose of something or other. Examples of projects are:</p><ul><li>Building better habits</li><li>Learning about formal methods in cultural evolution</li><li>Aiming to be more Stoic</li><li>Cooking more varied dishes</li><li>Running a reading group on power and influence in organizations</li></ul><p>As noted above, uncertainty about your projects trickles down. If it seems like there are too many things to read, that may be a sign that you have too many projects.</p><p>If this is you, you can let your work inform whether they should get dropped or not. If you want to cull projects more aggressively, <a href="https://www.calebontiveros.com/on-disproving-your-own-ideas/">derisk</a> and<a href="https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2020/6/26/five-ways-to-prioritize-better"> prioritize</a>. Focus on questions like:</p><ul><li>What can I learn that would make this project not matter to me?</li><li>What cheap tests would show that this project won't work?</li><li>Can I build an MVP of this project?</li><li>What specific questions about this topic do I want answered? What would answers unlock?</li></ul><p><strong>Questions</strong><br>Projects are vague and not sufficient for narrowing down the solution set on their own. Instead, list questions that you want answers to. If reading is inquiry guided, you're more likely to find what you want and spend less time trawling through books that feel relevant, but aren't.</p><p>Questions can help you choose the right things to read. What you decide to spend your attention on is a reversible decision. You can stop reading at any moment. So, if, like me, you feel like there are too many topics, narrow it by answering questions like:</p><ul><li>What's the chance that this topic is related to my project?</li><li>If I understand this completely, how will that be helpful in advancing my project?</li><li>How long will it take you to understand this topic? Is it worth the cost?</li></ul><p>Think of reading as inquiry guided. Your questions are the fundamental units. Read in order to answer specific queries you have. Once you've answered a question, that should generate more questions and output. If you can't find the answer, put the book down.</p><p>As an example, I want to read the book on neural design, because I'm interested in the nature of emotion. Often I feel like I read neuroscientific explanations of behavior and they don't feel like explanations at all. On the surface, they appear to be very black box (x module is linked with this behavior). Plausibly, explaining how the brain works from an engineering perspective is more illuminating. So, if I read that book then I should come into with the questions:</p><ul><li>Does this book give a new kind of explanation?</li><li>Is this explanation useful to understanding the nature of emotion?</li></ul><p>I can likely figure this out pretty quickly. If the answer is no, I can stop reading. Returning to the framework above, reading has reasonably high post certainty. As you read, you can get a sense of whether you're reading the right thing by updating on the book’s quality and whether it has what you want in it.</p><div><p>As an aside answers to these questions are things that should end up in notes. And if the answers help me push the peanut forward, they'll influence other questions, an essay, or project.</p><p><strong>Output</strong><br>Your project likely has some private or public output.</p></div><p>For me the private output is in the form of anki cards and notes.<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"> Anki</a> is a fun and useful way to remember things.

<p>How many times have you heard someone say they are data-driven or data centric or that “data is the heart of everything they do”? I’ve heard this so many times that the urge to wince is becoming irresistible. This sentiment is emblematic of a vanity that exists in the big data era – we are scientific, evidence based and use data to make our decisions.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This slogan is heard at every company I’ve worked at and from a range of people whether they be CEOs or “thought leaders”. In this post, I want to explain why we’re not as data-driven as we’d like to think. There are mistakes I’ve noticed some otherwise very smart people make when it comes to looking at and making decisions based on data and I want to discuss some of them with the hopes of injecting some humility and skepticism into the discourse.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Before I begin, let me give the benefit of the doubt to those people who express this sentiment earnestly. I’m aware that people are well intentioned when they say this – they want to express the fact that they’re not exclusively guided by their experience, hearsay or whim when making decisions. They want to consider facts from the outside world and let this guide their thought process about a particular issue. As far as this goes – fine, but I contend that this sentiment is so general and fair-seeming that it goes without saying. Not many people would openly admit that they don’t like to consider the facts before making a decision.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I would go further and say those people who frequently want you to know how data savvy or data focused they are, do so as a way of sounding clever and giving legitimacy to whatever it is that they’re about to say next. Whenever someone tells me that they’re data-driven I inevitably lean in to hear what silly comment couched in technical sounding language is going to follow – it has the inverse effect that the author intended.<br></p>



<p>Let’s explore some of the common blunders made by data-driven decision makers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>No one has ever let data speak for itself – ever</h2>



<p>If a data tree falls in a (random?) forest, does it make a sound? Easy – no. This is an error I see made by non technical people or those who come from non scientific fields and love the idea of objective and bias free analysis. Too bad no one has ever done that in data science. Data cannot speak without an interpreter and that interpreter is always mischievous, seeking to mix in its own words.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>All data have assumptions and biases. Where we get our data from, the quality of our data and how we use the data for analysis all imbue data with a structure of which we have to be mindful. Even activities as simple as looking at a line graph carry assumptions that can trip us up if unchecked. There could be missing data, the time scale could not be homogeneous (have we skipped days?) or the data recorded could change scale halfway through. Even choosing which range of values on the x and y axis to show will have an impact on the user. These assumptions must be considered and made explicit if it is feared that they could mislead the end user. If not feared – do it all the same.</p>



<h2>Where your data comes from is as important as how much data you have</h2>



<p>The sad truth is that in practice, most of the data we have as data scientists is junk. Choosing what to ignore is important for meaningful analysis. More data does not equate to better analysis – especially if it comes from a source which is biased and unreliable, Garbage In Garbage Out.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I was once asked to model how some process evolves over time. The problem was that each data point was not measuring the same unit; our observation of some phenomena at time epoch 2 was not the observation of the same phenomena at time epoch 1. Therefore you were not measuring evolution of anything over time but rather making statements about independent data on different days. To illustrate this, consider the problem of measuring daily occupancy in a hotel – we count the number of guests in rooms every day and plot. However if we had daily occupancy data but each day reports a different hotel, then we cannot reasonably plot this on a (time indexed line) graph since we would not be looking at the occupancy rate of the same hotel over time.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This distinction is important and fundamentally shifts the robustness of our whole analysis. We have to interrogate carefully where our data comes from, what biases it might have and whether it is in the format we need to test our hypotheses.</p>



<h2>Just being skeptical doesn’t make you smart</h2>



<p>It is true that confirmation bias is real and there are many trigger-happy stakeholders who will make decisions based on one significant test in a sea of other non significant results (my views on significance testing in business might be in a different post). It pays dividends to be careful, demand more data and adopt a wait-and-see approach. A lot of times we build models and make predictions and the best thing to do is to wait for more data once we feel like we have effectively modelled a problem.<br></p>



<p>However there are people who sit on the other extreme and no amount of analysis is sufficient for them to act. They try to show how level-headed they are by making comments like “we need other data sources to better understand the problem”, “we need to synthesise our data to separate signal from noise” or “the data is out of date”. All these remarks are reasonable but in many cases they’re used as a justification for inaction.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The purpose of data work and experimentation should be to inform action. If you are hiding behind these excuses to not make changes which seem otherwise reasonable then you’re not being cautious, you’re being cowardly. If you don’t have a measurable limit of how much data will be enough for you to act (how this is determined is a different problem) or how you intend to separate signal from noise then you’re making this mistake.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s a tricky blunder to spot because it disguises itself as wisdom. If data analysis is used to repeatedly say no because stakeholders see no evidence that an action will be successful, they should go the whole way and not take any action – there is never going to be evidence of efficacy until after the fact. One telltale sign of this behaviour is how people conveniently depend on less data when there is a decision they want to make already. The criterion of evidence for ideas they dislike is far higher compared to the ideas they are favourable towards.</p>



<h2>Automation is not a substitute for thinking</h2>



<p>When you write code it helps to automate as much as possible. Putting models in production or scheduling scripts are very powerful tools which ultimately save time and effort. However there is a danger when we try to automate those decisions which require a domain specific understanding of a problem.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Natural Language Processing is full of problems which require a human to determine if the results make sense – from interpreting word2vec similarity outputs to validating the sensibility of text cleaning, there are some problems which require humans in the loop (for the time being). We can make the space for those humans small but we can’t fully automate it away at the risk of making our analysis meaningless. Clustering is another example where we can automate to a great extent but if the output does not make sense for the problem in question, it might be necessary to compromise on some performance metrics in order to gain interpretability.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>If it helps, I’ve formulated Junaid’s 1st law “Automate as far as possible, but not further”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sometimes it’s okay to ignore the data</h2>



<p>Sometimes it helps to take a risk and ignore what the data might be presently suggesting and go with your instinct. Frequent A/B testing can sometimes lead to users chasing local optima and not focusing on the big picture. If you gambled on a new product feature and early results have shown that users respond adversely, it might not necessarily be the case that it is good to discontinue it. Think about other benefits it might have for your business and users later down the line. It might be that after users have gotten used to the new feature, they begin to respond positively.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Ultimately there is nothing wrong with using intuition sometimes. The problem arises when we confuse our intuition as inference from data and behave with a false confidence. I have seen people deliberately masquerade their opinions as if they were inferences from data analysis and refuse to acknowledge that their views originate from their minds vs the external world. We should admit when we’re using our intuition and be open to being challenged if others have differing ideas.<br></p>



<p>There are more data sins but these are the main ones that come to mind. Hopefully I’ve illustrated the value of thinking through what we’re doing, checking our assumptions and realising that this enterprise is far more complicated than the buzzwords and slogans would have us believe.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2> Simplified view on How Certificate Signing works </h2>
    <strong>Tags: </strong>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Reference: <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/">https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/</a></p>
<h4 id="steps-for-signing-certificate-by-ca">Steps for signing certificate by CA</h4>
<ol>
<li>The Subscriber (the person asking a CA to issue them a certificate) sends a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the CA which contains all of their details like name, domain name etc.</li>
<li>The CA will then take a blank certificate and begins to fill in the details of the Subscriber, validating ownership of the domain along the way, until they have completed all of the fields in the certificate.</li>
<li>At this stage we have what we call the Pre-Certificate, it’s basically a finished certificate ready to issue but the only thing that’s missing is the CAs signature on the bottom of the certificate to make it official</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="signing-of-certificate">Signing of certificate</h4>
<ol start="4">
<li>CA takes Pre-Certificate and running it through a hash function, currently SHA256, to obtain the digest.</li>
<li>The second step is the CA then taking that digest and encrypting it with their private key.</li>
<li>This encrypted digest is the signature and once appended to the end of the file we now have a signed certificate that can be issued to the Subscriber.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rules public key encryption</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For every private key, there is only one corresponding public key.</li>
<li>Also Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with it’s corresponding private key, and data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with it’s corresponding public key.</li>
<li>More rules and info at: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/">https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Q: How does adding the <strong>encrypted digest</strong> i.e. signature makes it signed certificate ?</p>
<p>A: It can better be explained by putting browser in picture and looking at what it does while requesting https website.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="what-browser-does">What browser does</h4>
<ol>
<li>During tls handshake with https endpoint, it fetches associate intermediate certificate and root certificate.
<ul>
<li>We need to upload intermediate certificate(public key of CA) and root certificate while uploading ssl certificate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser now decrypts the digest using intermediate certificates, if it is able to decrypt using intermediate key, it means that above certificate is signed by private-key of CA(data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with it’s corresponding public key)</li>
<li>Browser itself also calculate hash of pre-certificate to compare with hash it got in step 2 after decrypting digest.</li>
<li>If both are correct means,
<ul>
<li>The signature definitely came from the CA. (Authenticity) - Step 2</li>
<li>The certificate has not been tampered with. (Integrity)  - Step 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Above is over-simplified explanation of what happens, above all is taken from 1st half of post at : <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/">https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>Writing your resume for the first time or editing it for the 100th can both be incredibly daunting experiences. </span></p>
<p><span>With todayâ€™s fast-paced, ever-evolving corporate environment, hiring managers are consistently searching for unique candidates in an oversaturated market. </span></p>
<p><span>This makes resume writing so much more integral to landing a job that you want. </span><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most hiring managers utilize applications called â€œApplicant Tracking Systems (ATS),â€� which help electronically filter through candidate resumes searching for keywords, required skills, and overall competency. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a job required Slack as a hard skill, and you fail to mention your proficiency within your resume, your resume will automatically be sorted out of potential applicants immediately. </span></p>
<p><span>That being said, making a point to highlight your skills effectively is essential to passing through the ATS successfully. </span><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep in mind that hiring managers are sent hundreds to thousands of resumes per job advertisement. After making it through the ATS, your resume will have approximately 6-8 seconds to prove your worth. </span></p>
<p><span>This means that you should ensure it looks professional and highlights the key information in bite-size pieces for quick reading and digestion. Your goal is to provide information and make the hiring process as painless as possible for the employer. </span></p>
<p><span>The following part of this article will walk you through several suggestions to better your skills section so that it will pass inspection and highlights you as a strong and capable candidate for the jobs you are applying. </span></p>
<p><span>These suggestions are: (1) Do not list given skills, (2) Spotlight key skills, and (3) Highlight your knowledge by separating hard and soft skills. </span></p>
<p><span>By incorporating these 3 modifications to your resume, youâ€™ve already created a great start to passing through the ATS and getting the hiring managersâ€™ attention. </span></p>
<h2><span>Tip #1: Do not list given skills</span></h2>
<p><span>Itâ€™s in our nature to want to name each and every skill we have in order to show that we are qualified, if not overqualified, candidates. Though this approach worked in the past, now itâ€™s more necessary to omit skills that would be assumed. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, previously it was necessary to indicate proficiency with technical skills including Microsoft Office and Google, however, now it seems redundant. In todayâ€™s technical climate, it is assumed that all applicants applying for positions have these commonplace skills. </span></p>
<p><span>Keep in mind that your goal of listing skills is to showcase your attributes, not bog down the hiring manager with information they already assume to know. </span></p>
<h2><span>Tip #2: Spotlight â€œkeyâ€� skills</span></h2>
<p><span>The next suggestion is to spotlight â€œkeyâ€� skills on each resume. This means that when applying to multiple jobs, ensure that you are adjusting your skills section based on the needs of the individual job. </span></p>
<p><span>Itâ€™s a great idea to use keywords and specific skills from the job description itself. If a requirement or specific responsibility is listed or has an apparent theme throughout the job description, use your skill section to highlight your ability to accomplish those tasks. </span></p>
<p><span>An effective way of doing this would be to rephrase their needs into your own voice and then adding that to your resume. For example, if the job description stated, â€œa strong background in CRM systems,â€� you could add, â€œProficient with CRM system,â€� within your skills section. </span></p>
<p><span>However, avoid copying and pasting only the skills outlined in the job description, as this could be seen as unimaginative and hurt your chances of candidacy. </span></p>
<h2><span>Tip #3: Emphasize the difference between soft skills and hard skills.</span></h2>
<p><span>Previously, it was simple to add a single skills section and be content with your resume. Now, it is necessary to emphasize both hard and soft skills. </span></p>
<p><span>Hard and soft skills are equally important to create a compelling resume. An ideal way to include both skills is to create two separate lists. This allows for a hiring manager to easily read through both skillsets. </span></p>
<p><span>Remember, you have 6-8 seconds to convince the hiring manager that youâ€™re a worthy candidate for the job. </span></p>
<p><span>In order to ensure balance across your resume, try to keep the number of skills on each list the same. For example, if you have 5 hard skills, ensure that you have 5 soft skills too. </span></p>
<h2><span>In Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>This article highlights 3 suggestions that you can incorporate into your skill section to make your resume stand out from others.</p>
<p>This includes: (1) do not list given or assumed skills, (2) take time to spotlight â€œkeyâ€� skills, especially those that are discussed within the job description, and (3) emphasize the difference between your hard and soft skills by giving each their own section.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>There’s a famous thinking framework by ‘futurist’, ‘forecaster’, and scenario consultant Paul Saffo called ‘strong opinions, weakly held’. The phrase itself became popular in tech circles in the 2010s — I remember reading about it on Hacker News or a16z.com or one of those thinky tech blogs around the period. It’s still rather popular today.</p><p>Saffo’s framework — laid out in his original <a href="https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">2008 blog post</a> — goes like this:</p><blockquote>I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often through a sequence of lousy forecasts. Instead of withholding judgment until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will force myself to make a tentative forecast based on the information available, and then systematically tear it apart, using the insights gained to guide my search for further indicators and information. Iterate the process a few times, and it is surprising how quickly one can get to a useful forecast.<p>Since the mid-1980s, my mantra for this process is “strong opinions, weakly held.” Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the “strong opinion” part. Then – and this is the “weakly held” part – prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result.</p><p>This process is equally useful for evaluating an already-final forecast in the face of new information. It sensitizes one to the weak signals of changes coming over the horizon and keeps the hapless forecaster from becoming so attached to their model that reality intrudes too late to make a difference.</p><p>More generally, “strong opinions weakly held” is often a useful default perspective to adopt in the face of any issue fraught with high levels of uncertainty, whether one is venturing a forecast or not. Try it at a cocktail party the next time a controversial topic comes up; it is an elegant way to discover new insights — and duck that tedious bore who loudly knows nothing but won’t change their mind!</p></blockquote><p>On the face of it, it all sounds very reasonable and smart. And ‘strong opinions weakly held’ is such a catchy phrase — which probably explains its popularity.</p><p>The only problem with it is that it doesn’t seem to work that well.</p><h2 id="swimming-upstream-against-the-architecture-of-the-mind">Swimming Upstream Against the Architecture Of The Mind</h2><p>How do I know that it doesn’t work that well? I know this because I’ve tried. I tried to use Saffo’s framework in the years between 2013 and 2016, and when I was running my previous company I attempted it with my boss, whenever we convened to <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/what-uncertainty-feels-like/">discuss company strategy</a>.</p><p>Eventually I read Phillip Tetlock’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-forecasting-series/"><em>Superforecasting</em></a>, and then I gave up on ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’.</p><p>Why does the framework not work very well? From experience, Saffo’s approach fails in two ways.</p><p>The first way is if the person <em>hasn’t</em> read Saffo’s original post. This is, to be fair, most of us — Saffo’s original idea is so quotable it has turned into a memetic phenomenon, and I’ve seen it cited in fields far outside tech. In such cases, the failure mode is that ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ turns into ‘Strong Opinions, Justified Loudly, Until Evidence Indicates Otherwise, At Which Point You Invoke It To Protect Your Ass.’</p><p>In simpler terms, ‘strong opinions, weakly held’ sometimes becomes a license to hold on to a bad opinion strongly, with downside protection, against the spirit and intent of Saffo’s original framework.</p><p>Now, you might say that this is through no fault of Saffo’s, and is instead the problem of popularity. But my response is that if an idea has certain affordances, and people seem to always grab onto those affordances and abuse the idea in the exact same ways, then <em>perhaps you shouldn’t use the idea in the first place.</em> This is especially true — as we’re about to see — if there are better ideas out there.</p><p>The second form of failure is if the person has taken the time to look up the original intention of the phrase. In this situation, the failure mode is when you attempt to integrate new information into your judgment. Saffo’s framework offers no way for us to do this.</p><p>Here’s an example. Let’s say that you’ve decided, along with your boss, to build a particular type of product for a particular subsection of the self-service checkout market. You both come to the opinion that this subsection is the best entry-point to the industry: it is relatively lucrative, and you think that it is the easiest customer segment to service.</p><p>What happens to your opinion when you <em>slowly</em> discover that the subsegment is overcrowded? Of course, you don’t find out immediately — what happens instead is that you spot little hints, spread over the course of a couple of months, that many competitors are entering the market at the same time. These are tiny things like competitor brochures lying in the corner table of a client’s office, or pronouncements by industry groups that “they are looking to engage vendors for large deployments”, and then much later, clearer evidence in the form of increased competition in deals.</p><p>“Well,” I can hear you say, “‘Strong opinions weakly held’ means that you should change your opinion when you encounter these tiny hints!”</p><p>But at which point do you change your mind? At which point do you switch away from your strong opinion? At which point do you think that it’s time to reconsider your approach?</p><p>The problem, of course, is that <em>this is not how the human brain works.</em></p><p>Both forms of failure stem from the same tension. It’s easy to have strong opinions and hold on to them strongly. It’s easy to have weak opinions and hold on to them weakly. But it is quite difficult for the human mind to vacillate between one strong opinion to another.</p><p>I don’t mean to say that people <em>can’t</em> do this — only that it is very difficult to do so. For instance, Steve Jobs was famous for arguing against one position or another, only to decide that you were right, and then come back a month later holding exactly your opinion, as if it were his all along.</p><p>But most people aren’t like Jobs. Psychologist Amos Tversky used to joke that by default, human brains fall back to “yes I believe that, no I don’t believe that, and maybe” — a three-dial setting when it comes to uncertainty. People then hold on to their opinion for as long as their internal narratives allow them to. Saffo’s thinking framework implies that you sit in ‘yes I believe that’ territory, and then rapidly switch away to ‘maybe’ or to ‘no’, depending on the information you receive.</p><p>Perhaps you may — like Jobs! — be able to do this. But if you are like most people, the attempt will feel a lot like whiplash.</p><p>So, you might ask, what to do instead?</p><h2 id="use-probability-as-an-expression-of-confidence">Use Probability as an Expression of Confidence</h2><p>The gentler answer lies in <em>Superforecasting.</em> In the book, Tetlock presents an analytical framework that is easier to use than Saffo’s, while achieving many of the same goals.</p><ol><li>When forming an opinion, phrase it in a way that is very clear, and may be verified by a particular date.</li><li>Then state the probability you are confident that it is correct.</li></ol><p>For instance, you may say “I believe that Tesla will go bankrupt by 31 December 2021, and I am about 76% confident that this is the case.” Or you can be slightly sloppier with the technique — with my boss, I would say: “I think this subsegment is a good market to enter, and I think we would know if this is true within four months. I believe this on the order of 70% ish. Let’s check back in September.”</p><p>(My boss was an ex-investment banker, so he took to this like a duck to water.)</p><p>Tetlock’s stated technique was developed in the context of a geopolitical forecasting tournament called the Good Judgment Project. In 2016, when I read <em>Superforecasting</em> for the first time, I remember thinking that geopolitical forecasting wasn’t particularly relevant to my job running an engineering office in Vietnam. But I also glommed onto the book’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-the-superforecasters-do-it/">ideas around analysis</a>, because it was too attractive to ignore.</p><p>The truth is that Tetlock’s ideas are not unique to his research group. Annie Duke’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets">Thinking in Bets</a></em> proposes the same approach, but drawn from poker, and the ‘rationalist’ community <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> has long-held norms around stating the confidence of their opinions.</p><p>More importantly, Duke and LessWrong have both discovered that the <em>fastest</em> way to provoke such nuanced thinking is to ask: “Are you willing to bet on that? What odds would you take, and how much?”</p><p>You’d be surprised by how effective this question is.</p><p>Why is it so effective? Why does it succeed where ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ does not?</p><p>The answer lies in the ‘strong opinion’ portion of the phrase. First: by forcing you to state your opinion as a probability judgment — that is, a percentage — you are forced to calibrate the strength of your belief. This makes it easier to move away from it. In other words, you are forced to let go of the ‘yes, no, maybe’ dial in your head.</p><p>Second: by framing it as a bet, you suddenly have skin in the game, and are motivated to get things right.</p><p>Of course, you don’t actually <em>have</em> to bet — you can merely propose the bet as a thinking frame. Later, as new information trickles in, you are allowed to update the % confidence you have in your belief. This allows you to see the world in shades of grey; it also allows you to communicate that confidence to those around you.</p><h2 id="revisiting-the-hierarchy-of-practical-evidence">Revisiting The Hierarchy of Practical Evidence</h2><p>I have one final point to make about this approach.</p><p>Long term readers of this blog would know that my shtick is “apply a technique to my career or to my life, over the period of a couple of months, and report on its efficacy.” Over time, I’ve noticed that techniques are more likely to be effective when they come from believable practitioners. This is what led to my <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-hierarchy-of-practical-evidence/">Hierarchy of Practical Evidence</a>.</p><p>Saffo’s and Tetlock’s …</p></section></div>
